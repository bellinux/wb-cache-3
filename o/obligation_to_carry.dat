5000|$|Options are {{contracts}} {{that give the}} owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in {{the case of a}} call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) an asset. The price at which the sale takes place is known as the strike price, and is specified at the time the parties enter into the option. The option contract also specifies a maturity date. In the case of a European option, the owner has the right to require the sale to take place on (but not before) the maturity date; {{in the case of an}} American option, the owner can require the sale to take place at any time up to the maturity date. If the owner of the contract exercises this right, the counter-party has the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out the transaction. Options are of two types: call option and put option. The buyer of a call option has a right to buy a certain quantity of the underlying asset, at a specified price on or before a given date in the future, but he has no <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out this right.

50|$|In the rent-out option, {{fishermen}} acquire temporary contractual <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out conservation efforts. They {{are paid}} if {{they agree to}} terminate their fishing inside the vaquita refuge area. There is a penalty if fishermen breach the contract which includes getting their vessels taken by the government. The switch-out option provides fishermen with compensation for switching to vaquita-safe harvesting technology. Finally, the buy-back program compensates fisherman for permanently turning in their fishing permits, {{as well as their}} respective gear. In 2008, because of how few fisherman were enrolling in the switch-out option, PACE Vaquita added a yearly, short-term option for fishermen, letting them simply rent the vaquita-safe fishing equipment yearly for compensation. Then, in 2010, this option was broken down even further, giving fishermen the option of buying the vaquita-safe net, or paying the yearly rent, but for less compensation. Despite these efforts, the probability that these attempts at conservation will work is slim. Only about a third of fishermen in the area have accepted these terms so far. Some fishermen continue to fish in the protected areas despite the economic alternatives. Even measuring the population size of the vaquita will be difficult as the rarity of the vaquita bycatch will make it difficult to demonstrate the difference these programs are making.|$|R

40|$|People {{living with}} disabilities in our society today {{are more likely to}} be without a job {{compared}} to the rest of the population. The fact that a high number of people are not given the opportunity to work, and thereby being self-sufficient, is a failure for both the individual and the society. My purpose with the study is to increase knowledge and understanding regarding disabilities in the working life, with focus on the disability dyslexia. In the study, I am investigating the employer’s obligations and rights when employing a person with disabilities. To achieve my purpose and answer the research questions in the most adequate way, I am making use of a traditional legal dogmatic method, but also a sociological method focusing on law. Throughout the study, the employer’s equitable <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> into affect for supporting and customizing already during the recruitment process for a person with disabilities are introduced. This is done in order for the individual to be in a comparable situation as remaining jobseekers. Persons with disabilities are entitled to the same rights as others. Previous studies show employers lack knowledge regarding disabilities and what it means to have a disabled employee, and therefore neither wishes nor dares to hire someone with special needs. In lots of other European countries the existence of quota legislation is creating opportunities for people with disabilities to enter the ordinary labour market. Sweden has made the choice to use special arrangements that are for the employer to use if they having a disabled employee. Why Sweden chooses to use this system rather than the quota system is due to the effects from a quota system cannot be distinguished and because the government prefers to have optional arrangements, instead of legislating on quotas...|$|R
50|$|The {{prerogative}} held {{by police}} to enforce underage drinking laws is also debatable under certain circumstances. For example, since no state requires its citizens to carry identification except {{when they are}} driving, it is presumed that underage persons are under no <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> identification while drinking, and, if those persons were approached by law enforcement under such circumstances, could presumably simply state they were in fact of the legal drinking age. Since a hunch is not considered probable cause to detain someone in the United States, it is debatable what recourse law enforcement might have to determine if such a person was telling the truth.|$|E

50|$|Consultations {{have been}} found {{extremely}} problematic {{due to the fact}} that they often reach just village chiefs but neglect common villagers and disenfranchised groups. World Bank researchers noted that “a key finding from case studies is that communities were rarely aware of their rights and, even in cases where they were, lacked the ability to interact with investors or to explore ways to use their land more productively.” When consultations were even conducted, they often did not produce written agreements and were found to be superficial, glossing over environmental and social issues. In Ghana and elsewhere, chiefs often negotiated directly with investors without the input from other villagers, taking it upon themselves to sell common land or village land on their own. Moreover, investors often had obtained approval for their projects before beginning consultations, and lacked any contractual <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out promises made to villagers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, {{the philosopher}} Karl Popper gave a talk on [...] "The Moral Responsibility of the Scientist" [...] at the International Congress on Philosophy in Vienna, {{in which he}} {{suggested}} [...] "an undertaking analogous to the Hippocratic oath".

He also noted that it was an apprentice's oath, as distinct from a graduation oath. Based on this, he proposed a three-section oath for students, rearranged from the Hippocratic oath to give professional responsibility to further the growth of knowledge; the student, who owes respect to others engaged in science and loyalty to teachers; and the overriding loyalty owed to humanity as a whole.|$|E

Neither a teacher nor a citizen has {{a constitutional right to}} single out a public employee to serve as the audience for his or her privately expressed views, at least in the absence of evidence that the public employee was given that task by law, custom, or school Board decision. There is no evidence here that Givhan sought to disseminate her views publicly, to anyone willing to listen. Rather, she brought her complaints to Leach alone. Neither is there evidence that the Board or Mississippi law delegated to Leach the task of entertaining complaints from all comers and that he discriminated in choosing to reject her complaints and not to rehire her because she impressed him into such service.|$|E
