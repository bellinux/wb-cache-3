40|$|Several Literatures in {{construction}} management support {{the view that}} procurements have impacts <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. Aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of procurement related factors of procurement selection criteria, tendering methods and variation orders <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. Purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of procurement related factors <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. Snowballing sampling technique was used in selecting forty (40) construction organizations in Lagos metropolitan city that participated in the study and thirty-one (31) responses were secured from Architects, Builders, Engineers and Quantity Surveyors. Results of the study indicate that procurement selection criteria of cost, time, quality, project characteristics and external environmental factors have effects <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. Competitive, open and selective tendering methods have high impacts <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. No significant difference was found between the impacts of tendering methods <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. Variation orders impact project performance with time, cost overruns and disputes and it have effects <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. Conclusions are that procurement selection criteria, tendering methods and variation orders have impacts <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. Cost, time, quality related factors, tendering methods and variation orders strongly affect project performance. Recommendations to clients, stakeholders, practitioners and consultants are on the onset to consider tendering methods, use selective, open and competitive tendering approaches and discourage excessive variation orders during construction. Policy makers in government, clients, and private developers into housing projects should give adequate attention for selecting appropriate procurement and tendering methods for better management of future projects in Nigeria and other developing countries...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{comprehend}} the impact of risk management <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. Further it aims to investigate the degree of diffusion of risk management practice in Brazilian companies. The methodological approach involves a survey of 415 projects at different levels of complexity in different industrial sectors in several states of Brazil. The results demonstrate that adopting risk management practices has a significant positive impact <b>on</b> <b>project</b> success. They also show a positive impact from the presence of a risk manager <b>on</b> <b>project</b> success. The study’s principal limitations are the methodological choice of non probability sampling and a questionnaire based on respondent perception. From the practical point of view, paying attention to uncertainties during the project, making use of the risk management techniques and deeply understand the business environment are critical success factors, demanding attention of project managers and risk managers. The results demonstrate the impact of risk management practices <b>on</b> <b>project</b> success. They also show a positive impact from the presence of a risk manager <b>on</b> <b>project</b> success. Furthermore, it demonstrated the importance of soft skill in risk management...|$|R
