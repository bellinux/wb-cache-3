Researchers had <b>one</b> <b>participant</b> stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from field}} show and parade, {{competitions}} among secondary school {{can also have}} the march off (also concentration block or drill down). This event involves all participants on the field following the commands of a drill sergeant. If a participant makes a mistake, either by execution or wrong timing, then the participant falls out of the field. A winner is crowned when there is only <b>one</b> <b>participant</b> left on the field.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{features}} of focus group discussions include, member’s involvement, a number of consecutive meetings, the common characteristics of members with respect to interests, the evolvement of qualitative data, and discussion within the group that is focused on a topic, that is determined by the purposes of the research(Freitas, 1998). In other words, a focus group is an informal discussion among a group of selected individuals about a particular topic (Wilkinson 2004). A focus group, as a research method, involves more than <b>one</b> <b>participant</b> per data collection session.|$|E

25|$|Often, teenage couples {{engage in}} sexual conduct {{as part of an}} {{intimate}} relationship. This may occur before either participant has reached the age of consent, or after one has but the other has not. In the latter case, in most jurisdictions, the person who has reached the age of consent is guilty of statutory rape. In some jurisdictions (such as California), if two minors have sex with each other, they are both guilty of engaging in unlawful sex with the other person. The act itself is prima facie evidence of guilt when <b>one</b> <b>participant</b> is incapable of legally consenting.|$|E
25|$|Eighty-four F-86 Sabres of the 4th and 51st Fighter-Interceptor Groups {{were the}} first to arrive in the Sui-ho target area, tasked to provide cover against MiG attack and, {{according}} to <b>one</b> <b>participant,</b> to prevent MiGs from taking off by overflying their bases at low altitude, even though officially UN aircraft were not allowed to cross the Yalu except in hot pursuit. According to US sources, 160 MiGs took off before the arrival of the covering force but flew deeper into China, possibly fearing that their airfields were the targets, and none attempted to intercept the strike force.|$|E
25|$|From {{the summer}} of 1944 until February 1945, high school girls worked in or near Kokura {{constructing}} balloons to carry bombs across the Pacific where they would detonate in the U.S. The girls worked in two 12-hour shifts and, contrary to their expectations, there was little food available. Some eventually suffered from malnutrition. Within a short time after graduation {{in the spring of}} 1945, <b>one</b> <b>participant</b> estimates that one-tenth of her classmates died, while others suffered from tuberculosis, neuralgia, rickets, and symptoms of over-exhaustion as a result of exposure to chemicals used in making the balloons.|$|E

25|$|One {{experimental}} game used {{to measure}} levels of cooperation is the dictator game. In the standard form of the dictator game, there are two anonymous unrelated participants. <b>One</b> <b>participant</b> is assigned {{the role of the}} allocator and the other the role of the recipient. The allocator is assigned some amount of money, which they can divide in any way they choose. If a participant is trying to maximize their payoff, the rational solution (nash equilibrium) for the allocator to assign nothing to the recipient. In a 2011 meta study of 616 dictator game studies, Engel found an average allocation of 28.3%, with 36% of participants giving nothing, 17% choosing the equal split, and 5.44% give the recipient everything.|$|E
25|$|During the fighting, the Soviet {{forces had}} dug {{defensive}} trenches in Rainis Park (Raiņa parks) {{in the center}} of Liepāja. On July 3 and 4, 1941, in their first documented massacre in Liepāja, Reichert's EK 1a men, all Germans of the SD, rounded up Jews and marched them to these trenches in the park. Once at the trench, they were shot and the bodies pushed in. How many were killed during these shootings is not known. Estimates range from several dozen to 300. After the war, the Soviet Union investigatory commission concluded that 1,430 people were killed in the park shootings, which Professor Ezergailis characterizes as an exaggeration. <b>One</b> <b>participant,</b> Harry Fredrichson, later testified that in one massacre he participated in, 150 people were killed.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Moray had plunged the {{province}} of Moray into rebellion. King Edward's principal follower in the area was Sir Reginald Cheyne, the Scots sheriff of Elgin. The active support of some Scottish lords allowed King Edward to rule Scotland without deploying a large occupying force, but their ultimate loyalty was frequently questioned by English officials and chroniclers. Cheyne was alarmed by the growth of Moray's rebellion. He wrote to the king requesting assistance, who responded by instructing him to vigorously suppress the rebels. Sir Reginald ordered his principal lieutenants to a meeting at Inverness Castle on 25 May 1297 to discuss {{how to deal with}} Andrew Moray. <b>One</b> <b>participant</b> was Sir William fitz Warin, constable of Urquhart Castle standing on the western shore of Loch Ness.|$|E

25|$|In the prisoner's dilemma with {{third party}} punishment, {{two of the}} {{participants}} play a prisoner's dilemma, in which each must choose to either cooperate or defect. The game is set up such that {{regardless of what the}} other player does, it is rational for an income maxizer to always choose to defect, even though both players cooperating yields a higher payoff than both players defecting. A third player observes this exchange, then can pay to punish either player. An income maximizing third parties' rational response would be to not punish, and income maximizing players would choose to defect. A 2004 study demonstrates that a near majority of participants (46%) are willing to pay to punish if <b>one</b> <b>participant</b> defects. If both parties defect, 21% are still willing to punish.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{negative}} reactions, concerns and criticisms {{as a result}} of the December 2008 public meetings and online hearing where the preliminary findings of the MAPS (Mobility, Access and Pricing Study) were discussed. <b>One</b> <b>participant</b> questioned the rationale for having to pay to drive on a public street. Others considered that congestion pricing is a regressive tax imposing a greater burden on those without a good option to ride public transit and on low-income commuters. Other considered too expensive to pay USD 6.00 for a short duration trips. Zone residents with children and inflexible schedules complained they would be unfairly affected. Another major concern is the lack of reliability and capacity of San Francisco's existing network of transit services, limiting commuters to switch to public transport once the congestion pricing is implemented.|$|E
25|$|Headgear is not {{permitted}} in professional bouts, and boxers are generally {{allowed to take}} much more damage before a fight is halted. At any time, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that <b>one</b> <b>participant</b> cannot defend himself due to injury. In that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. For this reason, fighters often employ cutmen, {{whose job is to}} treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. If a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare-chested.|$|E

25|$|The University of Essex {{conducted}} a study to evaluate the efficacy of including the Wii in an established falls prevention training program to improve balance, mobility, and educate recovery from the instance of a fall. After a 7-week falls prevention training, {{the results indicated that}} Wii can positively support a standard rehabilitation, although the use of the game alone would not be encouraged. On the other hand, participants found the experience of Wii game as enjoyable, which can support patients engagement to training. A follow up longitudinal study would be needed to conclude if the incidence of falls can be reduced along time. Extending this study, another research conducted by the same University of Essex found that training with Wii can imply on mood and self-esteem. This behavior was observed in women who participated in this last mentioned research for fall prevention. As said by investigators, it would not be appropriate to generalize, however <b>one</b> <b>participant</b> who had the biggest improvement on the functional measures had the largest positive changes in well-being, which may indicate that the use of the Wii as an adjunct to standard falls prevention training can improve not only functional but also psychological outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{situation}} has been noticed, {{in order for}} a bystander to intervene they must interpret the incident as an emergency. According to the principle of social influence, bystanders monitor the reactions of other people in an emergency situation to see if others think {{that it is necessary to}} intervene. If it is determined that others are not reacting to the situation, bystanders will interpret the situation as not an emergency and will not intervene. This is an example of pluralistic ignorance or social proof. Referring to the smoke experiment, even though students in the groups had clearly noticed the smoke which had become so thick that it was obscuring their vision, irritating their eyes or causing them to cough, they were still unlikely to report it. Only <b>one</b> <b>participant</b> in the group condition reported the smoke within the first four minutes, and by the end of the experiment, no-one from five of eight groups had reported the smoke at all. In the groups that did not report the smoke, the interpretations of its cause, and the likelihood that it was genuinely threatening was also less serious, with no-one suggesting fire as a possible cause, but some preferring less serious explanations, such as the air-conditioner was leaking.|$|E
25|$|Worried {{about his}} supply line to Portugal, Wellesley ordered Craufurd to march west {{with his own}} brigade and General Rufane Donkin's brigade to cover the Almaraz crossing. On 6 August, {{the last day of}} the march, the troops marched 15 hours on a meal of boiled wheat and dried peas without salt or meat. <b>One</b> <b>participant</b> later {{recalled}} that the straggling was the worst he ever saw in the entire war. Craufurd reached Almaraz with 4,000 British troops and joined 1,500 Spaniards under Del Reino. Ney's French troops arrived on the north bank the next day. After retreating from the Puerto de Baños, Del Reino crossed to the south bank of the Tagus at Almaraz and dismantled the pontoon bridge on the 2nd. After a difficult march over bad roads, two divisions of Wellesley's army reached Deleitosa on 7 August, within supporting distance of Almaraz. Another British division was holding Mesas de Ibor. That day, the head of Cuesta's column was approaching Mesas de Ibor where there was an immensely strong defensive position. The rest of the Spanish army struggled slowly over the hills. To cover the movement, the Spanish divisions of Bassecourt and Lieutenant General Alburquerque formed a rear guard at the Arzobispo bridge. Meanwhile, Victor's I Corps occupied Talavera on the 6th, but it remained to the east of the theater of action.|$|E
