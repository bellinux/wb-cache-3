40|$|We {{examined}} <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> socioeconomic {{position to}} the health and mental health status of children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities in a sample of 10, 438 British children.

Between-group differences in socioeconomic position and household composition, however, accounted for 24 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> risk <b>of</b> poor health, 23 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> risk for conduct disorder, and 37 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> risk for emotional disorder.

5|$|During the Great Irish Famine (1845–1852) the Catholic {{population}} of Liverpool increased dramatically.

5|$|Over the {{eighteen}} years that Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half; three-quarters of this growth came in the 1960s and early 1970s. During {{the second half of}} Brezhnev's reign, average income per head grew by one-quarter. In {{the first half of the}} Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5% per annum; slightly less growth than what it had been the previous years. This can be explained by Brezhnev's reversal of most of Khrushchev's policies. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, but with three-quarters of this growth happening before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his rule. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform.|$|E

5|$|Test cricket {{is played}} between {{international}} cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, having no limit in their number of overs. Test cricket is first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from {{three days to}} timeless matches. The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> {{in the number of}} Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.|$|E

5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases {{with the size of}} the atom as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the most}} recent (July 2015) {{revision}} of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the world population is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 to 1973, the GDP {{per head}} in US dollars increased. Over the {{eighteen}} years Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union, average {{income per head}} increased by half in equivalent US dollars. In {{the first half of}} the Brezhnev period, income per head increased by 3.5 percent per annum, though this represented slightly less growth than in the last years of Khrushchev. This can be explained by the reversion of most of Khrushchev's policies when Brezhnev came to power. Over time, however, citizens did find themselves better off than under Khrushchev. Consumption per head rose by an estimated 70% under Brezhnev, though three-quarters of this growth happened before 1973 and only one-quarter in the second half of his time in office. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in consumer production in the early Brezhnev era can be attributed to the Kosygin reform, according to an analysis on the performance of the reform carried out by the Moscow State University.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{retired in}} 1859 and was succeeded {{by his son}} William White Harding, who had become a partner three years earlier. William Harding changed {{the name of the}} {{newspaper}} to its current name, The Philadelphia Inquirer. Harding, in an attempt to increase circulation, cut the price of the paper, began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street. In 1859, circulation had been around 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> was due to the interest in news during the American Civil War. Twenty-five to thirty thousand copies of The Inquirer were often distributed to Union soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked The Philadelphia Inquirer to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers. The Philadelphia Inquirer supported the Union, but Harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral. Confederate generals often sought copies of the paper, believing that the newspaper's war coverage was accurate.|$|E

5|$|In {{military}} affairs, {{the use of}} infantry with specialised roles increased. Along {{with the}} still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries. The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led {{to the use of}} closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour. Gunpowder was known in Europe by the mid-13th century with a recorded use in European warfare by the English against the Scots in 1304, although it was merely used as an explosive and not as a weapon. Cannon were being used for sieges in the 1320s, and hand-held guns were in use by the 1360s.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the decline of Bristol's Iceland trade for 'stockfish' (freeze dried cod) was a hard blow to the local economy, encouraging Bristol merchants to turn west, launching unsuccessful voyages of exploration in the Atlantic by 1480 in search of the phantom island of Hy-Brazil. More recent research, however, has shown that the Iceland trade was never more than a minor part of Bristol's overseas trade and that the English fisheries off Iceland actually increased during the late 15th and 16th centuries. In 1487, when king Henry VII visited the city, the inhabitants complained about their economic decline. Such complaints, however, were not uncommon among corporations that wished to avoid paying taxes, or which hoped to secure concessions from the Crown. In reality, Bristol's customs accounts show that the port's trade was growing strongly during the last two decades of the fifteenth century. In great part this was due <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of trade with Spain.|$|E

From 1951, the municipality started working on plans for the Oslo Metro {{in the eastern part}} of the city. The large difference in traffic between the eastern and western lines caused the plans to be changed during the 1960s, and the eastern network was equipped with third rail power supply. The eastern lines at first terminated at Jernbanetorget, and the plans were to continue the lines onwards towards Bislett. But by the 1970s, these plans changed, largely because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of traffic in the west and decrease in the east. On 7 March 1987, the services from the west, including the Røa Line, were extended from Nationaltheatret to Stortinget, a station that allowed transfer to the metro.|$|E
