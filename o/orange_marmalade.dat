25|$|After ending {{domestic}} promotions for {{its fifth}} mini-album Can't Stop (2014), CNBLUE pursued individual activities. Frontman Jung Yong-hwa released his debut solo studio album One Fine Day (2015) in January and {{embarked on an}} Asian tour. Guitarist Lee Jong-hyun {{played the role of}} a lead character in KBS2's <b>Orange</b> <b>Marmalade</b> and participated on MBC's reality variety program We Got Married. Drummer Kang Min-hyuk took part in MBC's I Live Alone and KBS2's sports variety show Our Neighborhood Arts and Physical Education.

2500|$|CNBLUE began {{developing}} {{songs for}} 2gether in midst of writing songs for Can't Stop. While {{staying at a}} hotel in Japan during the band's Arena Tour 2013: One More Time, bassist Lee sought out to write a song. Jung assigned him and Kang to do it together; after listening to the melody of [...] "Control", the two conceived the idea of writing a love song, which Jung rejected. After discussing it between themselves, Kang and Lee agreed to write a song with the notion that [...] "no one can control me". Initially written in Korean, the two faced difficulties in translating the song into English. With the assistance of Jung, the translations and lyrics were completed; Kang and Lee were left uncredited. The song was originally intended to be included on Can't Stop, but was ultimately excluded. Jung cited the limited space on the release, as well as the [...] "different atmosphere" [...] the song had in comparison to the other songs for its omission. He decided to add it to the band's Japanese single [...] "Go Your Way". The lyrics were rewritten in Korean by the bassist for its inclusion on 2gether, marking the first song to be credited under his name since the debut of the band. [...] "Radio" [...] was previously recorded in Japanese for CNBLUE's album Wave, which was re-recorded in Korean for inclusion on 2gether. [...] "Footsteps", originally titled [...] "Heart Song" [...] and included in its Japanese single [...] "Truth", was also rewritten in Korean. In midst of filming KBS2's <b>Orange</b> <b>Marmalade,</b> guitarist Lee took the opportunity to write [...] "Hero".|$|E

60|$|Phyllis Browne's Life of Mrs. Somerville forms {{part of a}} very {{interesting}} little series, called 'The World's Workers'--a collection of short biographies catholic enough to include personalities so widely different as Turner and Richard Cobden, Handel and Sir Titus Salt, Robert Stephenson and Florence Nightingale, and yet possessing a certain definite aim. As a mathematician and a scientist, the translator and populariser of La Mecanique Celeste, {{and the author of}} an important book on physical geography, Mrs. Somerville is, of course, well known. The scientific bodies of Europe covered her with honours; her bust stands in the hall of the Royal Society, and one of the Women's Colleges at Oxford bears her name. Yet, considered simply in the light of a wife and a mother, she is no less admirable; and those who consider that stupidity is the proper basis for the domestic virtues, and that intellectual women must of necessity be helpless with their hands, cannot do better than read Phyllis Browne's pleasant little book, in which they will find that the greatest woman-mathematician of any age was a clever needlewoman, a good housekeeper, and a most skilful cook. Indeed, Mrs. Somerville seems to have been quite renowned for her cookery. The discoverers of the North-West Passage christened an island 'Somerville,' not as a tribute to the distinguished mathematician, but as a recognition of the excellence of some <b>orange</b> <b>marmalade</b> which the distinguished mathematician had prepared with her own hands and presented to the ships before they left England; and to {{the fact that she was}} able to make currant jelly at a very critical moment she owed the affection of some of her husband's relatives, who up to that time had been rather prejudiced against her on the ground that she was merely an unpractical Blue-stocking.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{antioxidant}} activity of methanol extracts obtained from Mediterranean fruit products (prickly pear fruit jam and cream, myrtle berries jam, <b>orange</b> and mandarin-orange <b>marmalades)</b> was evaluated and compared in several in vitro models of oxidative stress.

All extracts showed protective effect against thermal-cholesterol degradation, strictly correlated to total phenols. Extracts from prickly pear cream and myrtle berries jam preserved liposomes from Cu 2 +-induced oxidation, inhibiting the reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids and the increase of malondialdehyde.

5000|$|In Glynn v Margetson {{a vessel}} was {{to carry a}} {{perishable}} consignment of Seville <b>marmalade</b> <b>oranges</b> from Malaga to Liverpool.

[...] On leaving Malaga, the vessel did not head straight for Liverpool, but {{made her way to}} Burriana, 350 miles up the coast. As a result of the delay, the cargo had deteriorated by the time it reached England. The House of Lords (establishing the so-called [...] "main purpose rule"), held that the clause, if given full effect, would defeat the main purpose of the contract and would be, in effect, an exemption clause which should be ignored. They gave the clause a limited construction, namely that the vessel could have liberty to proceed and stay at any ports on the voyage from Malaga to Liverpool, such as Cadiz or Lisbon.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1991, {{partners}} Jonathan King and Jim Stott combined {{their interests}} in horticulture and cooking to create recipes for oils, jams, chutneys and more. At {{the urging of}} a friend, they began their business by selling their homemade products at the local farmers’ market. Working from a small folding table and calling themselves Stonewall Kitchen, after the historic New England stone walls visible outside their kitchen window, the two ended up selling every product they brought with them. Able to repeat their success at farmers’ markets and other local venues, Jonathan and Jim expanded their product line to include new kinds of vinegars, oils, pesto, jams and baked goods. At one event, a local business owner asked if they sold wholesale. Not knowing exactly what she meant, Jonathan and Jim ended up selling every jar before the market even opened. And with that, a new revenue stream emerged. In 1993, demand for Stonewall Kitchen products was growing. National retailer Crate & Barrel approached Jonathan and Jim with an order for 2500 jars of their <b>Orange</b> Cranberry <b>Marmalade.</b> The order was filled {{but it took a}} month {{for the two of them}} to do it. Realizing they needed to increase production capacity, they purchased and renovated an eighteenth-century era barn in Kittery, Maine. Though adequate, when another larger property became available in nearby York, Maine, the two purchased it and opened a new center of operations. As production became more structured and streamlined, Jonathan and Jim attended the Fancy Food Show in New York City - the largest specialty food and beverage marketplace that attracts 1,100 exhibitors and 36,000 buyers. The result was unprecedented for first time attendees—the Outstanding Preserve award for their Roasted Garlic Onion Jam. They also earned a second highest honor award, for Outstanding Product Line. By the time the show was over, Jonathan and Jim had 500 orders from retailers across the country.|$|R

The Cottage was of brick with a steep shingled roof; two or three gentlemen...were lodged under the efficient charge of a Scottish working-housekeeper". She continues on to describe living on the verandah of the House,Indoor occupation was varied and constant. One says indoor - yet it was carried out for the most part on the wide verandah, shaded from the sun by blinds. These came from Java or Japan; they were made of long strips of cane painted green and rolled up in the evening by cords on small pulleys. On the verandah peaches were stoned for jam, <b>oranges</b> peeled for <b>marmalade</b> and quinces carefully paired and cored for jelly. There was a wide table where the many kerosene lamps were washed and trimmed every morning and set ready to be carried to their respective rooms at night. There was the indispensable treadle sewing machine, and in a cool corner, in a draught, stood a filter with a tap and a tin pannikin, near it a large porous water-jar swathed in damp flannel for evaporation.|$|R
