5|$|Specifically, {{the video}} {{opens with a}} boy with a {{basketball}} in his bag walking out of a car park. The basketball then begins to bounce <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> jumps out of the city streets and gets into a Lada taxi. After that, it continues to bounce and causes troubles in an office. Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.|$|E
25|$|They all got {{together}} {{up there and}} there was a bloody massacre because I think they shot about three hundred natives all in one hit {{and there was a}} hell of a row over it.

25|$|At the time, the Schuylkill Valley was a {{hotly contested}} territory, with {{constant}} conflicts over titles, some dating to before the American Revolution and British colonial rule, and rights. Had {{any of their}} competitors became aware of what Tower and Munson were up to, they may well have bought up the land the pair were after, and charged exorbitant prices for it, or worse, refused to sell it at all. The partners operated secretly to protect their interests. Tower would make the purchases, and convey the titles to legal dummies to hide the ownership of the land. By 1858 Tower and Munson had acquired eleven thousand acres (45km2). By now, Munson and Tower's plan was well <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> and anyone who had even a partial claim {{to any of the}} lands began to litigate. Only Tower's considerable skill as a lawyer kept the whole enterprise from falling apart.|$|E

25|$|The Humanitarian Daily Ration (HDR) is a {{self-contained}} Halal meal {{designed to be}} given to refugees and other displaced people. It is designed to feed a single person for a full day, and the menus were intended to be palatable to many religious and cultural tastes around the globe. To meet this goal, no animal products or by-products, no alcohol or alcohol-based products, and minimal dairy products are used in their production. It is otherwise created and packaged much like MREs; feedback from the Afghanistan campaign led to the interior packing being reinforced to withstand being air-dropped, as the packets sometimes ruptured on impact. The outer bag is tinted a high-visibility red or yellow and has an American Flag and a picture of a person eating <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> with a spoon. There are usually instructions printed on it in English and one or more local languages as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{refugees}} {{were transferred to}} the cruise ship Neuralia, which had been taken into war service. The Czechs looked to smuggle Ant between the two ships by hiding him in a kit bag. This failed as the dog pushed his head <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> {{just as they were}} boarding – fortunately for Ant the new crew seemed happy to have a dog on-board and welcomed him. The facilities on Neuralia were much better than Northmoor, as the cabins remained fitted out as a cruise ship and Ant could stay in the cabin with the men. The remainder of the voyage went smoothly, until Bozděch was informed about the quarantine rules for dogs upon entering the United Kingdom. Having no money with which to pay for the quarantine fees, the Czechs sought once again to smuggle him – this time into the UK. They elected to hide Ant once again in a bag, this time mixed up in those being transferred as cargo by crane. They arrived at the docks in Liverpool on 12 July, where they successfully took Ant ashore. They were nearly found out by a pair of military police as they were at the train station nearby as {{they were on their way}} to Cholmondeley, Cheshire.|$|E
500|$|Before meeting Beyoncé, Rich Harrison had {{conceptualized}} {{the beat}} of the song. He had sampled the hook's instrumentation from the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)," [...] which had originally been written and composed by Eugene Record, frontman of the Chicago-based vocal group The Chi-Lites. When Harrison first played the beat to his friends, they could not [...] "dig it," [...] and this made him realize that he had conceived something special, which people would appreciate better after hearing the whole record. Thus Harrison decided not to market the selection, and instead, he waited for the right artist to record it: [...] "I had it in the chamber, I had not really shopped it much, because sometimes {{you do not want to}} come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> before it's right. People do not really get it and you will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the crews}} passed the HMS Stork {{training}} ship, Cambridge began {{to draw away}} and were two lengths ahead by Chiswick Steps. [...] With a strong tailwind along Corney Reach, the Light Blues continued to pull ahead and passed below Barnes Bridge four lengths ahead, and six seconds ahead of the course record. [...] Cambridge passed the finishing post five lengths ahead {{in a time of}} 17 minutes 50 seconds. [...] The victory, Cambridge's second in a row, and third in the last four races, took the overall record in the race to 5043 in their favour. [...] The special correspondent writing in The Observer called it [...] "the maddest Boat Race for years". [...] The Times rowing correspondent suggested it was [...] "a great triumph for the Cambridge coaches, who so often seem able to produce something <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> which has not been apparent in practice." [...] Writing in The Manchester Guardian, the rowing correspondent noted that it was [...] "strange that Cambridge had never shown anything like this form in practice".|$|E

2500|$|As a true {{freshman}} in 1982, Harbaugh, at age 18, and junior Dave Hall were backups to quarterback Steve Smith, who had broken Michigan's single season record with 2,335 yards of total offense in 1981. In the 1982 season, Smith started all 12 games, and Hall handled the limited backup role. Even as Smith struggled, coach Schembechler expressed {{a reluctance to}} play Harbaugh, saying, [...] "To suddenly pull some freshman <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> I don't {{think you can do}} that in today's football." [...] Harbaugh did not see any game action in 1982, registered no statistics, and retained four years of eligibility under the NCAA's redshirt rule.|$|E

2500|$|Perone's {{assessment}} of the album's composition indicates a remove from [...] "just about anything else {{that was going on}} in 1966 pop music". Composer Philip Glass observed: [...] "Listening to it today, it is, perhaps, easier to see why {{it was one of the}} defining moments of its time... its willingness to abandon formula in favor of structural innovation, the introduction of classical elements in the arrangements, production concepts in terms of overall sound which were novel at the time-all these elements give Pet Sounds a freshness that, 30 years later, is immediately there for the listener." [...] Strauss writes that with Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys became the first major rock group [...] "to look music trends firmly in the eye and declare that rock really didn't matter. Rock is supposed to be about, you know, fucking, and Brian Wilson was recording a song ('I Know There's an Answer') that was originally entitled 'Get Rid of Your Libido'." [...] Sommer said that the Beach Boys became the first group to make an entire album that departed from the usual small-ensemble electric rock band format: [...] "Of course, others had done it for a song or two, but no one had said, 'This will be a complete album that can not be performed by four or five guys plugged into amps.... Once the Beach Boys let that cat <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> the whole ship of rock sailed to new ports.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of release, {{professional}} reviews were overall mixed. Record Mirror stated: [...] "Assuming that the title {{should be taken to}} mean that the group are trying to visit the territorial war grounds of their golden years in the singles charts I reckon they are in for a shock. I expect a little more than references to Big Brother, Stereo, Radio etc, in the otherwise catchy [...] "Sign of the Times" [...] and the reflection of [...] "Born to Run" [...] in [...] "Wheels Ain't Coming Down". On [...] "Nuts Bolts & Screws" [...] and [...] "My Baby's Got It" [...] Slade start to rock, but there's nothing here to distinguish them from any other rocking combo. I wasn't expecting another [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] or [...] "My Friend Stan" [...] but just something a little more inspired. From a new band this would be a fairly good debut, from Slade I want more." [...] Sounds were similar in their reception, writing: [...] "Slade have managed to pull a fair to impressive performance <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> with this one. Sure to new wave lugs it sounds dated, but Return to Base still rocks like a good un', utilising standard rock 'n' roll/hard rock foundations for commendable displays of tightness and old time rock bite. Noddy's got one of the all time classic rock voices as he belts through ten steamy originals and one Chuck Berry cover. Slade may have stood still, but their own brand of rock shout clout still sounds good to these biased ears." ...|$|E

50|$|By the mid 18th century, {{over a dozen}} patents for submarines/submersible boats {{had been}} granted in England. In 1747, Nathaniel Symons {{patented}} and built the first known working example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a ballast tank for submersion. His design used leather bags that could fill with water to submerge the craft. A mechanism was used to twist <b>the</b> water <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> and cause <b>the</b> boat to resurface. In 1749, the Gentlemen's Magazine reported that a similar design had been proposed by Giovanni Borelli in 1680.
