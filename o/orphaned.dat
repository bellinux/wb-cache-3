Methods A comprehensive <b>orphan</b> drug database was compiled from FDA data and corporate annual reports of major pharmaceutical companies. Analysis allowed the generation of a descriptive <b>orphan</b> drug portrait as well as documentation of <b>orphan</b> drugs along their lifecycle. Results Currently, 2002 products have obtained <b>orphan</b> drug designation with 352 drugs obtaining FDA approval. Approximately 33 % of <b>orphan</b> drugs are oncology products. On average, products obtain 1. 7 <b>orphan</b> designations with approximately 70 % obtaining a single designation. At least 9 % of <b>orphan</b> drugs have reached blockbuster status with two-thirds having two or more designations. An additional 25 <b>orphan</b> drugs had sales exceeding US$ 100 million in 2008 alone. Since 1983, at least 14 previously discontinued products have been recycled as <b>orphan</b> drugs. Conclusions The United States <b>Orphan</b> Drug Act has created issues which, in some cases, have led to commercial and ethical abuses. <b>Orphan</b> Drug Act reform is necessary but current incentives, including 7 year market exclusivity, should be maintained in order to favour patients {{as well as economic}} prosperity.

ABSTRACT: The present study aims to assess the child abuse and emotion regulation among <b>orphan</b> and non-orphan school adolescents residing in Jammu city. A purposive sample of 200 school going adolescents (100 from <b>orphan</b> schools and 100 from non-orphan schools) from Jammu, with an age range of 13 - 16 years was collected. Consent from guardians and assent from adolescents were taken. In conclusion, study demonstrated that the emotion regulation of <b>orphan</b> and non – <b>orphan</b> adolescents fall in the poor spectrum as observed from the manual comparatively. The mean value of emotion regulation of non-orphan adolescent boys & girls is slightly better than emotion regulation of <b>orphan</b> boys and girls. Child abuse of <b>orphan</b> adolescents and non- <b>orphan</b> adolescents differ significantly from each other. <b>Orphan</b> boys are more abused than non-orphan boys and abuse of non- <b>orphan</b> girls is more abused than <b>orphan</b> girls. <b>Orphan</b> boys are more abused than <b>orphan</b> girls but the non-orphan girls are more abused than non- <b>orphan</b> boys...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Orphan</b> {{drugs are}} a growing issue of {{importance}} to European healthcare policy makers. The success of <b>orphan</b> drug legislation in Europe has resulted in {{an increasing number of}} licensed medicines for rare diseases, and many more yet unlicensed products have received <b>orphan</b> drug designation. Increasingly the concerns amongst policy makers relate to issues of patient access and affordability, yet few studies have sought to estimate the future budget impact of <b>orphan</b> drugs. The aim {{of this study was to}} predict the total cost of <b>orphan</b> medicines in Europe between 2010 and 2020 as a percentage of total European pharmaceutical expenditure. Methods: A disease-based epidemiological model was created based upon trends in the designation and approval of new <b>orphan</b> medicines, prevalence estimates for <b>orphan</b> diseases, and historical price and sales data for <b>orphan</b> drugs in Europe (defined as Eurozone + UK). The analysis incorporated two stages: 1) Predicting the number of diseases for which new <b>orphan</b> drugs will be approved over the next decade, based on an analysis of trends from the EU registry of <b>orphan</b> medicines; 2) Estimating the average ex-factory drug cost across an <b>orphan</b> disease life cycle, from the year in which the first <b>orphan</b> medicine is launched to the point where the first medicine loses marketing exclusivity. The two sets of information were combined to quantify the annual cost of <b>orphan</b> drugs from 2010 through 2020...|$|R

50|$|Drug {{companies}} nearly universally {{believe the}} ODA to be a success. Before Congress enacted the ODA in 1983 only 38 drugs were approved in the USA specifically to treat <b>orphan</b> diseases. In the USA, from January 1983 to June 2004, {{a total of}} 1,129 different <b>orphan</b> drug designations have been granted by the Office of <b>Orphan</b> Products Development (OOPD) and 249 <b>orphan</b> drugs have received marketing authorization. In contrast, the decade prior to 1983 saw fewer than ten such products come to market. From {{the passage of the}} ODA in 1983 until May 2010, the FDA approved 353 <b>orphan</b> drugs and granted <b>orphan</b> designations to 2,116 compounds. As of 2010, 200 of the roughly 7,000 officially designated <b>orphan</b> diseases have become treatable.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>Orphan</b> Drug Act (1983) {{established}} several {{incentives to}} encourage the development of <b>orphan</b> drugs (ODs) to treat rare diseases and conditions. This study analyzed the characteristics of OD designations, approvals, sponsors, and evaluated the effective patent and market exclusivity life of <b>orphan</b> new molecular entities (NMEs) approved in the US between 1983 and 2007. Methods Primary data sources were the FDA Orange Book, the FDA Office of <b>Orphan</b> Drugs Development, and the US Patent and Trademark Office. Data included all <b>orphan</b> designations and approvals listed by the FDA and all NMEs approved by the FDA during the study period. Results The FDA listed 1, 793 <b>orphan</b> designations and 322 approvals between 1983 and 2007. Cancer was the main group of diseases targeted for <b>orphan</b> approvals. Eighty-three companies concentrated 67. 7 % of the total <b>orphan</b> NMEs approvals. The average time from <b>orphan</b> designation to FDA approval was 4. 0 ± 3. 3 years (mean ± standard deviation). The average maximum effective patent and market exclusivity life was 11. 7 ± 5. 0 years for <b>orphan</b> NME. OD market exclusivity increased the average maximum effective patent and market exclusivity life of ODs by 0. 8 years. Conclusion Public programs, federal regulations, and policies support <b>orphan</b> drugs R&D. Grants, research design support, FDA fee waivers, tax incentives, and <b>orphan</b> drug market exclusivity are the main incentives for <b>orphan</b> drug R&D. Although the 7 -year <b>orphan</b> drug market exclusivity provision had a positive yet relatively modest overall effect on effective patent and market exclusivity life, economic incentives and public support mechanisms provide a platform for continued <b>orphan</b> drug development for a highly specialized market. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Orphan</b> {{designated}} {{medicinal products}} benefit from regulatory and economic incentives for <b>orphan</b> drug development. Approximately 40 % of <b>orphan</b> designations target rare neoplastic disorders, referring to rare cancers. In {{order to provide}} more insights in drugs for rare neoplastic disorders that are under development and {{to better understand the}} role of <b>orphan</b> designation in the development of oncology drugs, this study investigates the characteristics of the product, the indication and the applicants as well as the stage of development of products with an <b>orphan</b> designation for rare neoplastic disorders and compares them with products with an <b>orphan</b> designation for other rare indications. Therefore, <b>orphan</b> designation application files and annual reports submitted by the applicant were reviewed at the premises of the European Medicines Agency. Results: At the time of application, 41. 6 % of products with <b>orphan</b> designation for rare neoplastic disorders were in pre-clinical phase; this was 65. 1 % for other rare conditions (p < 0. 05). Thirty percent of <b>orphan</b> designations for rare neoplastic disorders had reached phase 1; compared to 19. 3 % of <b>orphan</b> designations targeting other rare conditions (p < 0. 05). The same trend was observed for the stage of development {{at the time of the}} latest annual report. Significant benefit was more often considered for <b>orphan</b> designations for rare neoplastic disorders compared to <b>orphan</b> designations for other rare conditions. Conclusion: <b>Orphan</b> designations for rare neoplastic disorders involve products that are in a more advanced stages of development compared to <b>orphan</b> designations for other (non-oncology) rare conditions...|$|R
40|$|An <b>orphan</b> {{disease is}} a disease with a very low prevalence. Although there are 5000 - 7000 <b>orphan</b> diseases, only 50 <b>orphan</b> drugs (i. e. drugs {{developed}} to treat <b>orphan</b> diseases) were marketed in the EU {{by the end of}} 2008. In 2000, the EU implemented policies specifically designed to stimulate the development of <b>orphan</b> drugs. While decisions on <b>orphan</b> designation and the marketing authorization of <b>orphan</b> drugs are made at the EU level, decisions on drug reimbursement are made at the member state level. The specific features of <b>orphan</b> diseases and <b>orphan</b> drugs make them a high-priority issue for policy makers. The aim {{of this article is to}} identify and discuss several issues surrounding <b>orphan</b> disease and drug policies in Europe. The present system of <b>orphan</b> designation allows for drugs for non-orphan diseases to be designated as <b>orphan</b> drugs. The economic factors underlying <b>orphan</b> designation can be questioned in some cases, as a low prevalence of a certain indication does not equal a low return on investment for the drug across its indications. High-quality evidence about the clinical added value of <b>orphan</b> drugs is rarely available at the time of marketing authorization, due to the low number of patients. A balance must be struck between ethical and economic concerns. To this effect, there is a need to initiate a societal dialogue on this issue, to clarify what society wants and accepts in terms of ethical and economic consequences. The growing budgetary impact of <b>orphan</b> drugs puts pressure on drug expenditure. Indications can be extended for an <b>orphan</b> drug and the total prevalence across indications is not considered. Finally, cooperation needs to be fostered in the EU, particularly through a standardized approach to the creation and use of registries. These issues require further attention from researchers, policy makers, health professionals, patients, pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders with a view to optimizing <b>orphan</b> disease and drug policies in Europe.

40|$|<b>Orphans</b> are genes {{restricted}} {{to a single}} phylogenetic lineage and emerge at high rates.

Furthermore, highly expressed <b>orphans</b> with a strong male-bias are more likely to be retained. Since both lost and retained <b>orphans</b> show similar evolutionary signatures of functional conservation, we propose that <b>orphan</b> loss is not driven by high rates of sequence evolution, but reflects lineage specific functional requirements.
