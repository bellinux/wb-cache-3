25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, one of {{the most}} notable synesthetes is Solomon Shereshevsky, a newspaper reporter turned celebrated mnemonist, who was discovered by Russian neuropsychologist, Alexander Luria, to have a rare fivefold form of synesthesia. Words and text were not only associated with highly vivid visuo-spatial imagery but also sound, taste, color, and sensation. Shereshevsky could recount endless details <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> without form, from lists of names to decades-old conversations, but he had great difficulty grasping abstract concepts. The automatic, and nearly permanent, retention of every little detail due to synesthesia greatly inhibited Shereshevsky from understanding much of what he read or heard.|$|E
25|$|The missing {{double eagle}} was {{acquired}} by King Farouk of Egypt, who was a voracious collector <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>things,</b> including imperial Fabergé eggs, antique aspirin bottles, paperweights, postage stamps—and coins, {{of which he had}} a collection of over 8,500. In 1944 Farouk purchased a 1933 double eagle, and in strict adherence with the law, his ministers applied to the United States Treasury Department for an export license for the coin. Mistakenly, just days before the mint theft was discovered, the license was granted. The Treasury Department attempted to work through diplomatic channels to request the return of the coin from Egypt, but World War II delayed their efforts for several years. In 1952, King Farouk was deposed in a coup d'etat, and many of his possessions were made available for public auction (run by Sotheby's) – including the double eagle coin. The United States government requested the return of the coin, and the Egyptian government stated that it would comply with the request. However, the coin disappeared and was not seen again in Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Many {{men went}} bareheaded and, {{apart from the}} Emperor, they were {{normally}} so in votive depictions, which may distort the record we have. In the late Byzantine period a number of extravagantly large hats were worn as uniform by officials. In the 12th century, Emperor Andronikos Komnenos wore a hat shaped like a pyramid, but eccentric dress is one <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> he was criticised for. This was perhaps related to the very elegant hat with a very high-domed peak, and a sharply turned-up brim coming far forward in an acute triangle to a sharp point (left), that was drawn by Italian artists when the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos went to Florence and the Council of Ferrara in 1438 {{in the last days}} of the Empire. Versions of this and other clothes, including many spectacular hats, worn by the visitors were carefully drawn by Pisanello and other artists. They passed through copies across Europe for use in Eastern subjects, especially for depictions of the three kings or Magi in Nativity scenes. In 1159 the visiting Crusader Prince Raynald of Châtillon wore a tiara shaped felt cap, embellished in gold. An Iberian wide brimmed felt hat came into vogue during the 12th century. Especially in the Balkans, small caps with or without fur brims were worn, of the sort later adopted by the Russian Tsars.|$|E

After failing to sign the player, Real Madrid's manager at the time, Bernd Schuster, accused Villa of having [...] "no ambition", whereupon Villa responded by saying, [...] "Footballing ambition is not about your mouth, it is about your feet. You can accuse me of lots of things – of having a bad day, of missing chances, <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> – but I have always had ambition and always will have. I think I have proved that on the pitch with Zaragoza, Sporting, UD Langreo, and the national team." [...] In October 2008, Kaká praised Villa: speaking to Canal+, he claimed that Villa is [...] "the best Spanish footballer" [...] adding that, [...] "The player with whom I would most like to play is David Villa of Valencia." [...] On 2 December 2008, Villa came seventh in the Ballon d'Or 2008 rankings and on 12 January 2009, he was announced as the joint ninth-best player of 2008 alongside international teammate Andrés Iniesta of Barcelona, according to the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year awards.|$|E

2500|$|Yet Berg also noted, [...] "As late as April 1939after Germany overtook CzechoslovakiaLindbergh {{was willing}} to make excuses for Hitler.

[...] Berg also explained that leading up to the war, in Lindbergh's mind, the great battle would be between the Soviet Union and Germany, not fascism and democracy.|$|E

[...] The sidewalks will be worse obstructed in every street than Wall-street is where the brokers are in full blast. Old beds and ricketty bedstands, handsome pianos and kitchen furniture, will be chaotically huddled together. [...] Everything will be in a muddle. Everybody in a hurry, smashing mirrors in his haste, and carefully guarding boot boxes from harm. Sofas that go out sound will go in maimed, tables that enjoyed castors will scratch along and [...] "tip" [...] on one less than its complement. [...] Bed-screws will be lost in the confusion, and many a good piece of furniture badly bruised in consequence. [...] Family pictures will be sadly marred, and the china will be a broken set before night, in many a house. All houses will be dirty – never so dirty – into which people move, and the dirt of the old will seem enviable beside the cleanliness of the new. [...] The old people will in their hearts murmur at these moving dispensations. The younger people, though aching in every bone, and [...] "tired to death," [...] will relish the change, and think the new closets more roomy and more nice, and delight themselves fancying how this piece of furniture will look here and that piece in the other corner.
