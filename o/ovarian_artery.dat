It should be killed immediately before use, as otherwise the gastric juice attacks {{the wall of the}} stomach, and the dissection is, in consequence, rendered extremely disagreeable. A very young rabbit is unsatisfactory as regards the genitalia, but otherwise there is no objection to a little one, and it has this advantage-- that it may be immersed more conveniently under water, in a large pie dish, for purposes of fine dissection. The external features of the animal should be examined: eyelids, whiskers and teeth, toes, anus, perineal space {{on either side of the}} same, urogenital opening, and position of the ribs, vertebral column, and limb girdles beneath the skin should be made out. Then the animal should be pinned out through the legs, the ventral surface uppermost, the skin opened up along the middle line from pelvic girdle to symphyses of jaw; separated from the body wall below by means of the handle of a scalpel, and turned back; and then the abdominal wall should be cut into and two flaps pinned back to expose its contents. Note the xiphisternum. The caecum and colon will be recognised (Section 16); the stomach, the right and left central, and left lateral lobes of the liver will probably be apparent; and the urinary bladder (especially if distended) in the middle line behind. Without any further dissection, but simply by turning the parts over, all the structures of the abdomen in Figure 1, Sheet 1, will be identified. Seek especially for and note particularly, the gall bladder, bile duct, and portal vein, pancreatic duct, sacculus rotundus, vermiform appendix, ureters (by pulling urinary bladder forward), genital ducts (looping over ureters), spleen, kidneys, and adrenals. The vena cava inferior is seen dorsally. The genital duct guides the student to the genital gland; if the subject is a male, the testes may be exposed by dissection, or by pulling the vas deferens gently the scrotal sac will be turned inside out, and the testes brought into view. The ovary lies exposed without dissection posterior to the kidney. Examine all this carefully, and make small sketches of points of interest-- the duodenal loop and the pyloric end of the stomach, for instance; the meeting of colon, caecum, and sacculus rotundus again; or the urinary bladder and adjacent parts. Note the dorsal aorta and vena cava and their connexions behind. (Compare figure of circulation.) Cut through pelvic girdle, and remove one hind leg, to see bladder and genital ducts better (compare Sheet 10). Wash away any blood that may flow. Turn all the intestines over to the animal's right, and see the dorsal aorta and vena cava inferior of the abdomen, the inferior mesenteric artery, and the spermatic (or <b>ovarian)</b> <b>artery</b> (compare, of course, with figure in book). In front, immediately dorsal to the spleen, is a variable quantity of lymphoidal tissue, which must be very carefully cleared to see the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries. Separate Spigelian lobe from stomach, and look for vagus nerve descending by oesophagus, solar plexus around the superior mesenteric artery, and thrown up very distinctly by the purple vena cava inferior beneath, and the splanchnic nerve. To see the abdominal sympathetic behind, gently remove the peritoneum that lies on either side of the aorta; blood-vessels will be seen running in between the vertebral bodies, and the sympathetic chain, with its ganglia, made out very distinctly, as it runs across them longitudinally. Now cut oesophagus just in front of stomach, and cut the rectum, cut through the mesentery supporting the intestine, and remove and unravel alimentary canal; cut open, wash out, and examine caecum and stomach. Bleeding to a considerable extent is inevitable, chiefly from the portal vein. The liver had better remain if the same rabbit is to serve for the second dissection.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Altered utero-ovarian {{blood flow}} has been {{claimed to be}} a subtle cause of unexplained infertility. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare between the flow {{velocity}} indices in the uterine and <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries</b> during the luteal phase in fertile and unexplained infertility women. Study design: Observational, cross section, controlled study done at the departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Benha Faculty of Medicine, Egypt, during the period from October 2010 to October 2011. Patients and methods: Two groups each of 30 cases and aged 20 - 25  years were studied. A control group of fertile women who got pregnant within one year of marriage, and a study group of women with unexplained infertility were included. Trans-vaginal pulsed color Doppler ultrasound was done at days 21 – 23 of the cycle to measure uterine and <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries</b> resistance and pulsation indices. Outcome measures: Mean uterine and <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries</b> resistance and pulsation indices in both groups and their values in the diagnosis of altered blood flow in unexplained infertility were measured. Results: Women with unexplained infertility had significantly higher uterine and <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries</b> pulsation index (P <  0. 001 – 0. 003), and no significant difference was found as regards the resistance index. Uterine artery pulsation index of ⩾ 1. 21 was a good test for the diagnosis of decreased uterine artery blood flow in unexplained infertility with sensitivity and a specificity of 83. 3 % and an accuracy of 89 %. Conclusions: Unexplained infertility is associated with decreased uterine and <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries</b> blood flow during the luteal phase. More studies are needed to support this conclusion and to evaluate the possible role of perfusion enhancer drugs in increasing utero-ovarian blood flow and enhancing pregnancy...|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to show whether color Doppler {{ultrasonography}} of the <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries</b> is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and appendicitis. The study included 50 female patients with clinical symptoms of acute pelvic inflammation and 50 healthy women of the same age as a control group. All were examined with color Doppler ultrasonography to visualize the internal genitalia and estimate the blood flow through the <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries.</b> Peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity, pulsatility index (DPI), and resistance index were measured. In the healthy women, ovaries were normal in size, and the parameters of ovarian arterial flow were PSV 0.30 – 0.50, systolic/diastolic ratio < 0.7, DPI 1.23 – 1.50. In 45 of the patients, there was infection and enlargement of the ovaries and/or salpinx, and flow parameters were PSV 0.40 – 0.70, systolic/diastolic ratio 0.5 – 0.8, and DPI 1.40 – 1.96. In five cases the ultrasound image was obscure, and flow parameters were similar to those of healthy women. These patients underwent surgery for a diagnosis of appendicitis. Our study showed that in cases of diagnostic differentiation between PID and appendicitis, examination with color Doppler ultrasound is very easy and useful. The relatively increased flow parameters in <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries</b> direct the diagnosis to PID.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{review and}} {{sum up the}} {{published}} literature on gynecological Doppler ultrasound examination. Methods: Publications on gynecological Doppler ultrasound examination already known by the author, publications found in the bibliographic database Medline, and publications found in the reference lists of available studies were read, and relevant information was extracted and summarized. Results: Reference data representative of normal findings at transvaginal color and spectral Doppler ultrasound examination of the uterine and <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries</b> have been established in healthy pre- and post-menopausal women and in normal early pregnancies. Blood flow velocities in the uterine and <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries</b> change during the normal menstrual cycle and are very different in pre- and post-menopausal women. Lower blood flow velocities and higher pulsatility index (PI) values have been recorded in the <b>ovarian</b> <b>arteries</b> after the menopause. Uterine artery blood flow velocities increase and uterine artery PI values and resistance index (RI) values decrease with gestational age in the first trimester. There is not yet an established role of the gynecological Doppler ultrasound examination in clinical practice. It remains unclear whether the gynecological Doppler ultrasound examination contributes substantially to the clinical management of early pregnancy complications or infertility problems, to the differential diagnosis of pelvic masses or uterine pathology. Conclusions: Large prospective studies-preferably randomized controled trials-are needed to determine the clinical value of the gynecological Doppler ultrasound examination...|$|R

In the pubertal monkey, the hilar and medullary arteries exhibited some intimai thickenings in which smooth muscle cells of a synthetic phenotype were longitudinally arranged. These arteries in adult monkeys had considerable intimai thickening. In a 30 -year-old woman, arteries with intimai thickenings were detected in the hilus and medulla. Around 40 years of age. the intima of the arteries were considerably thickened with a diameter usually equal to half of the wall.
