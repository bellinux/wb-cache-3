These waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea. The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.|$|E
5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>knew</b> that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E
5|$|The {{manpower}} problem {{was compounded by}} the supply crisis which was affecting the entire nation, with the fleet going unpaid and largely unfed for months at times. In August 1793, these problems {{came to a head}} in the fleet off Brest, when a lack of provisions resulted in a mutiny among the regular sailors. The crews overruled their officers and brought their ships into harbour in search of food, leaving the French coast undefended. The National Convention responded instantly by executing a swathe of senior officers and ship's non-commissioned officers. Hundreds more officers and sailors were imprisoned, banished or dismissed from naval service. The effect of this purge was devastating, seriously degrading the fighting ability of the fleet by removing at a stroke many of its most capable personnel. In their places were promoted junior officers, merchant captains and even civilians who expressed sufficient revolutionary zeal, although few <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>knew</b> how to fight or control a battle fleet at sea.|$|E

25|$|Seven people {{survived the}} impact, {{although}} they were all injured and in shock. One of the survivors assisted two others away from the wreck, which was burning, and they all rallied a distance away from the wreck. They stated to the press afterwards {{that they were all}} apathetic and in shock, and that none of them thought about the possibilities to search for help. Also, none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>knew</b> where they were. They heard the search being carried out by helicopter and were therefore aware that they were being searched for. Two of the initial survivors later died, bringing the death toll to forty.|$|E

500|$|The metaphysical {{conflicts}} {{born from}} man's isolation {{are also important}} themes throughout the story, as the characters cannot rely on a higher cause or being for protection. The correspondent laments the lack of religious support, {{as well as his}} inability to blame God for his misfortunes, musing: [...] "When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeply that there are no bricks and no temples." [...] Man's perception of himself and the world around him are also constantly questioned; the correspondent regularly refers to the way things [...] "seemed" [...] or [...] "appeared", leaving how a thing actually [...] "was" [...] entirely ambiguous. Wolford similarly pointed to the importance of the story's strong yet problematic opening line—"None <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>knew</b> the color of the sky"—as one that sets the scene for the story's sense of unease and uncertainty.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{deploying}} to France in 1917 many of {{the soldiers}} in the 30th Engineer Regiment (Gas and Flame) spent their time stateside in training that did not emphasize any chemical warfare skills; instead the training focused on drill, marching, guard duty, and inspections. Despite the conventional training, the public perceived the 30th as dealing mainly with [...] "poisonous gas and hell fire". By the time those in the 30th Engineers arrived in France most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>knew</b> nothing of chemical warfare and had no specialized equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Fritz Efaw, a Chapter Representative of VVAW, stated: [...] "The {{claims that}} the WSI {{hearings}} contained falsified testimony from men who were not veterans is an old one, and it's definitely false. [...] The testimony was startling even {{at the time it}} took place: startling to the general public, startling to the military and the Nixon administration, and startling to those who participated because each <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>knew</b> a piece of the story, but the hearings brought a great many of them {{together for the first time}} and provided a venue in which they could be heard for the first time. It's hardly surprising that those on the other side would set out almost immediately to discredit them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{doctrines of}} {{marginalism}} and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as somehow {{a response to}} Marxist economics. However {{the first volume of}} Das Kapital was not published until July 1867, after the works of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were written or well under way (In 1874 Walras published Éléments d'économie politique pure and Carl Menger published Principles of Economics in 1871) and Marx was still a relatively minor figure when these works were completed. It is unlikely that any <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>knew</b> anything of him. (On the other hand, Hayek or Bartley has suggested that Marx, voraciously reading at the British Museum, may have come across the works of {{one or more of these}} figures, and that his inability to formulate a viable critique may account for his failure to complete any further volumes of Kapital before his death.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{chorus of}} the song {{includes}} the line [...] "The boys of the NYPD choir still singing 'Galway Bay'". In reality the NYPD (New York City Police Department) {{does not have a}} choir, the closest thing being the Pipes and Drums of the NYPD's Emerald Society that is featured in the video for the song. The NYPD Pipes and Drums did not know [...] "Galway Bay" [...] and so sang a song that all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>knew</b> the words to – the [...] "Mickey Mouse March", the theme tune for The Mickey Mouse Club television series. The footage was then slowed down and shown in brief sections to disguise the fact the Pipes and Drums were singing a different song. Murray recalled that the Pipes and Drums had been drinking on the coach that brought them to the video shoot, {{and by the time they}} arrived they were more drunk than the band, refusing to work unless they were supplied with more alcohol.|$|E
