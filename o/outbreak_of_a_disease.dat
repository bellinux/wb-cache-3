5|$|Since Du Tertre {{wrote that}} the macaws were prone to sickness, an <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease,</b> along with hunting, {{may have contributed to}} its demise. In 1760, the French {{zoologist}} Mathurin Jacques Brisson quoted a letter by French writer M. de la Borde, which stated that macaws had become very rare in the Antillean islands because they were hunted for food. By then they could only be found in areas not frequented by humans, and were probably extinct soon afterwards. Parrots are often among the first species to be exterminated from a given locality, especially islands.|$|E
5|$|Asad {{then left}} Mazara under Abu Zaki al-Kinani, {{and turned to}} Syracuse: the Muslim army {{advanced}} along the southern shore towards the island's capital, but at Qalat al-Qurrat (possibly ancient Acrae), it was met by an embassy from the city which offered tribute if the Muslims halted their advance. The proposal was probably designed to buy time {{for the city to}} better prepare itself for a siege, but Asad, either persuaded by the emissaries' assurances or needing to rest his army, halted his advance for a few days. At the same time, Euphemius began to regret his alliance with the Aghlabids, and opened secret contacts with the imperials, urging them to resist the Arabs. The Muslims recommenced their advance soon after, and laid siege to the city. Byzantium, which at the same time was forced to face a threat much closer to home at Crete, was unable to send much aid to the beleaguered island, while the Muslims received reinforcements from Africa. Giustiniano Participazio, the dux of the imperial protectorate of Venice, came to the city's aid, but was not able to raise the siege. The besiegers however suffered from lack of supplies as well as the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> in spring 828, which cost Asad his life. He was replaced by Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Jawari. When a Byzantine fleet arrived, the Arabs raised the siege and tried to sail back to Africa, but were hindered by the Byzantine ships. Thwarted, the Muslim army burned its ships and retreated over land to the castle of Mineo, which surrendered to them after three days.|$|E
25|$|In 537/538 or 539, he {{clashed with}} Mundhir of the Lakhmids over grazing rights on the lands south of Palmyra, near the old Strata Diocletiana. According to later {{accounts}} by Tabari, the Ghassanid ruler invaded Mundhir's territory and carried off rich booty. The Persian ruler, Khosrau I (r. 531–579), used this dispute {{as a pretext}} for restarting hostilities with the Byzantines, and renewed war broke out in 540. In the campaign of 541, Harith and his men, accompanied by 1200 Byzantines under generals John the Glutton and Trajan, were sent by Belisarius into a raid into Assyria. The expedition was successful, penetrated far into enemy territory and gathered much plunder. At some point, however, the Byzantine contingent was sent back, and subsequently Harith failed to either meet up with or inform Belisarius of his whereabouts. According to Procopius's account, this, {{in addition to the}} <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> among the army, forced Belisarius to withdraw. Procopius further alleges that this was done deliberately so that the Arabs would not have to share their plunder. In his Secret History, however, Procopius gives a different account of Belisarius's inaction, completely unrelated to the Ghassanid ruler. In c. 544/545, Harith was involved in armed conflict with another Arab phylarch, al-Aswad, known in Greek as Asouades.|$|E
40|$|Numerous <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> {{whose most}} {{prominent}} effects were gangrene {{and loss of}} limbs occurred in Europe in the Middle Ages. Sufferers sought relief at the shrine of St Anthony at Vienne in France. Quite early, it was recognized that the <b>disease</b> was <b>a</b> poisoning due to the consumption of bread prepared from rye contaminated with the fungus ergot. Many interesting substances have been isolated from ergot, {{some of which are}} used in medicine in migraine and in childbirth, but the most dramatic substance derived from ergot is LSD. The circumstance of some of these discoveries is recounted. ...|$|R

25|$|Soon {{after his}} accession, in summer 1304, John and Philip of Savoy were ordered by King Charles II of Naples to attack Epirus, where the Byzantine princess Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, mother and regent of the under-age Despot Thomas I Komnenos Doukas, {{had refused to}} re-affirm Epirote vassalage to Naples and made common cause with the Byzantine Empire. John campaigned in Epirus {{alongside}} a large Achaean contingent, but their siege of the Epirote capital, Arta, failed and the allies withdrew. While Charles II remained determined to repeat the offensive next year, Anna managed to bribe Philip into staying in the Morea. Philip refused to campaign on the pretext of holding a grand parliament at Corinth, where all the barons and vassals of the Principality, including John, were assembled. As a result, Charles II deposed Philip of Savoy and transferred the Principality directly to his own son, Philip of Taranto. The new Prince launched another invasion of Epirus in 1307, which failed due to the <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> among the Latin troops, but managed to wring some territorial concessions from Anna. According to the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of the Morea, John not only participated in this second expedition but actively instigated it, perhaps in hopes of replacing Thomas as ruler of Epirus.|$|E
500|$|The species' {{low rate}} of {{reproduction}} and long period of immaturity render it vulnerable to rapid change in the environment as response and recovery are slow. Their habit of forming flocks predisposes them to outbreaks of disease and localised adverse weather events. A probable <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> led {{to the deaths of}} up to 23 breeding female cockatoos at Koobabbie in September–October 2009, a hailstorm killed 68 individuals around Perth on 22 March 2010, and 145 perished in a heatwave around Hopetoun when temperatures reached [...] on 6 January 2010. Temperature and weather extremes in southwest Australia are predicted to worsen with climate change. Carnaby's black cockatoos have been brought to veterinary hospitals with traumatic injuries. Motor vehicles are a hazard, as much vegetation useful to Carnaby's black cockatoos lies on road verges. The cockatoos fly into open space when leaving the vegetation, which is often over a road and in the path of oncoming traffic.|$|E

The o'nyong'nyong virus and the malarial parasite share a common vector, two species of anopheline mosquitoes.

50|$|While {{video games}} are unquestionably built with the {{intention}} of being enjoyable and fun, functions or programs built into the game sometimes have interesting, though unanticipated, outcomes.

While the properties of this disease were not designed into the game on purpose, due to its nature and the actions of the players (descriptive meaning) it allowed scientists to study the behavior and extract the evaluative meaning behind the players’ actions as they played.|$|E

40|$|The new SEVERITY {{procedure}} fits probability distributions for {{the severity}} (magnitude) of random events. Important examples include events with negative impact (such as {{the distribution of}} losses claimed under insurance policies, the magnitude of damages caused by natural disasters, and the severity <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease)</b> and events with positive impact (such as order sizes for products characterized by intermittent demand). The SEVERITY procedure can use any of eight different parametric families of probability distributions. If these eight built-in distributions are not sufficient for your problem, then you can extend the SEVERITY procedure to support any parametric family by specifying its CDF and PDF functions with SAS ® programming statements and the FCMP procedure. The SEVERITY procedure can model the effects of exogenous variables on the severity <b>of</b> <b>an</b> event. It can also model censored or truncated data, which is an important feature, especially for insurance problems. Data on payments under insurance policies are subject to deductibles (which cause left truncation of the data) and are also subject to coverage limits (which produce right censoring) ...|$|R
