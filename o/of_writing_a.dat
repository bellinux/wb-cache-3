5|$|On {{their first}} stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin {{found that a}} white band high in the {{volcanic}} rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy {{had given him the}} first volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods, and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> book on geology.|$|E
5|$|Brian Mansfield {{speculated that}} Carey was {{addressing}} Eminem in the lyrics, {{with whom she}} has had a longstanding feud. Carey has reportedly been romantically linked with several male celebrities {{during the course of}} her career, some of which she has openly spoken about and acknowledged, while others she has denied dating. Eminem has claimed on multiple occasions that he dated Carey, but Carey has always firmly denied that she knew him on a romantic level. In 2001, Carey contacted Eminem to discuss the possibility <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> song together for inclusion on Carey's ninth studio album Charmbracelet (2002), and they reportedly started dating soon after.|$|E
5|$|By 1889 Verdi {{had been}} an opera {{composer}} for more than fifty years. He had written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, Un giorno di regno, staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but thought him incapable <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> comedy. Verdi disagreed {{and said that he}} longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody would give him the chance. He had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} decade, Galileo stayed {{well away from}} the controversy. He revived his project <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> book on the subject, {{encouraged}} by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.|$|E
5|$|In January 1859, Prescott {{decided to}} resume his work on Philip II, with the goal <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> final fourth volume. On January 29, he {{suffered}} a second stroke, which resulted in his immediate death. He was buried with his parents in St. Paul's Church, and his funeral was attended by representatives, among others, of Harvard University, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Essex Institute.|$|E
5|$|Love {{continued}} to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as Man on the Moon (1999) and Trapped (2002), before releasing her first solo album, America's Sweetheart, in 2004. The next few years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug addiction, {{which resulted in a}} mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 while she was in the process <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> second planned solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, which was released in 2010 as a Hole album but without any other members of the former lineups. Between 2014 and 2015, she released two solo singles and returned to acting in the network series Sons of Anarchy and Empire.|$|E

5|$|Reared in Utah in a respected, if impoverished, Mormon family, Brodie {{drifted away}} from {{religion}} during her graduate studies in literature at the University of Chicago. Having found temporary employment at the Harper Library, Brodie began researching {{the origins of}} Mormonism. Progress toward her eventual goal <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> full biography of Joseph Smith was slowed by {{the birth of her}} first child and by three rapid moves to follow her husband's career, but in 1943, Brodie entered a three-hundred page draft of her book in a contest for the Alfred A. Knopf literary fellowship, and in May her application was judged the best of the forty-four entries.|$|E
5|$|Yuki started Fairy Cube {{with the}} goal <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> short series. Because of the story's nature as a serial, she faced page limitations. When {{deciding}} on the ending, she considered having Ian and Rin as the sacrifice to close the demon door, but rejected it, feeling {{that it would be}} too unpleasant for the readers, although she expressed her fondness for sad endings. She was also unable to include Ian and Tokage's newfound friendship, because Rin and Ian's romantic relationship served as the focus of the story.|$|E
5|$|Batman: The Ultimate Evil {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Andrew Vachss and {{published}} in 1995 by the Warner Aspect imprint of Warner Books. Vachss was an attorney specializing in child abuse cases, {{as well as a}} crime novelist best known for his series of books featuring the character Burke, a private investigator who also takes on child abuse cases. A representative from DC Comics approached Vachss about the possibility <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> novel featuring Batman. Viewing {{this as an opportunity to}} reach a completely different audience, Vachss agreed and wrote a draft. He continued with his themes concerning child sexual abuse and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making a clear distinction between fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex.|$|E
60|$|I {{have just}} been looking over some <b>of</b> this <b>writing.</b> <b>A</b> great many <b>of</b> the {{specimens}} are <b>written</b> in <b>a</b> beautiful manner. All are good. The writing in nearly all cases slants backward instead of forward. One piece <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> from <b>a</b> soldier who had lost both arms, was made by holding the pen in his mouth.|$|R

60|$|CZARE. (coming {{back from}} the window). I don't think Prince Paul's nature is such a mystery. He would stab his best friend for the sake <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>an</b> epigram on his tombstone, or {{experiencing}} a new sensation.|$|R
5|$|Clark {{began writing}} the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he {{scribbled}} down some rough ideas for later development, following {{a discussion with}} guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that {{it was he who}} conceived the initial idea <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark, author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same were Clark still alive.|$|E
5|$|Kim's {{associates}} {{characterize the}} director as an eccentric individual. Tokyo International Film Festival programming director Kenji Ishizaka recalls that Kim's way <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> screenplay was {{to walk away}} from home for three months. He would shut himself up in a cheap hotel, listen to neighborhood gossip, and write all night in the dark. South Korean film critic Lee Young-il remembers that Kim's shoes were never shined, and that one of his few material pleasures was high-quality coffee. Kim Ki-young's unconventional and nonconformist nature also prevented him from participating in South Korea's mainstream film industry. The only official title he held within the film community was member of The National Academy of Arts, which he joined in 1997, and he did not cultivate friendships with journalists who could further his career.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1561, cannons {{were fired}} in Leith to {{announce}} Queen Mary's arrival in Scotland. When she attended Mass being {{celebrated in the}} royal chapel at Holyrood Palace five days later, this prompted a protest in which one of her servants was jostled. The next day she issued a proclamation {{that there would be}} no alteration in the current state of religion and that her servants should not be molested or troubled. Many nobles accepted this, but not Knox. The following Sunday, he protested from the pulpit of St Giles'. As a result, just two weeks after her return, Mary summoned Knox. She accused him of inciting a rebellion against her mother and <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> book against her own authority. Knox answered that as long as her subjects found her rule convenient, he was willing to accept her governance, noting that Paul the Apostle had been willing to live under Nero's rule. Mary noted, however, that he had written against the principle of female rule itself. He responded that she should not to be troubled by what had never harmed her. When Mary asked him whether subjects had a right to resist their ruler, he replied that if monarchs exceeded their lawful limits, they might be resisted, even by force.|$|E

5|$|The Congress soon {{joined the}} new Indian ministry. The League was slower to do so, not {{entering}} until October 1946. In agreeing {{to have the}} League join the government, Jinnah abandoned his demands for parity with the Congress and a veto on matters concerning Muslims. The new ministry met amid a backdrop of rioting, especially in Calcutta. The Congress wanted the Viceroy to immediately summon the constituent assembly and begin the work <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> constitution and felt that the League ministers should either join in the request or resign from the government. Wavell attempted to save the situation by flying leaders such as Jinnah, Liaquat, and Jawaharlal Nehru to London in December 1946. At {{the end of the}} talks, participants issued a statement that the constitution would not be forced on any unwilling parts of India. On the way back from London, Jinnah and Liaquat stopped in Cairo for several days of pan-Islamic meetings.|$|E
