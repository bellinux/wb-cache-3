In Two for the Money, Pacino portrays a sports gambling agent and mentor for Matthew McConaughey, alongside Rene Russo. The film {{was released on}} October 8, 2005, to mixed reviews. Desson Thomson wrote in The Washington Post, [...] "Al Pacino has played the mentor so many times, he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a kingmaker's award... the fight {{between good and evil}} feels fixed in favor of Hollywood redemption." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, with critics highlighting Ellen Pompeo's performance, Washington's {{direction and}} McKee's writing. TV Line gave Pompeo's performance the most praise, called it [...] "visceral" [...] and wrote, [...] " [...] If a picture really says a thousand words, this review is superfluous: Any image 'we publish of Pompeo’s stricken face from this week’s Grey’s {{will tell you}} {{all you need to}} know about her [...] " [...] Praising McKee the site called [...] the episode a [...] "stunner". The site added, [...] "We long ago gave up predicting what the Emmy Awards will do. But we will still say that, if there’s any justice, Pompeo’s transcendent work <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the leading lady at very least the nomination for which she is so long overdue." ...|$|E
500|$|In a July 1951 {{profile in}} Book of the Month Club News, Salinger's friend and New Yorker editor William Maxwell asked Salinger about his {{literary}} influences. Salinger responded: [...] "A writer, when he's asked {{to discuss his}} craft, <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up and call out {{in a loud voice}} just the names of the writers he loves. I love Kafka, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Proust, O'Casey, Rilke, Lorca, Keats, Rimbaud, Burns, E. Brontë, Jane Austen, Henry James, Blake, Coleridge. I won't name any living writers. I don't think it's right" [...] (although O'Casey was in fact living at the time). In letters written in the 1940s, Salinger had expressed his admiration of three living, or recently deceased, writers: Sherwood Anderson, Ring Lardner, and F. Scott Fitzgerald; Ian Hamilton wrote that Salinger even saw himself for some time as [...] "Fitzgerald's successor". Salinger's [...] "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" [...] has an ending similar to that of Fitzgerald's earlier published short story [...] "May Day".|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{was deeply}} {{depressed}} {{in the months}} following King's assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist Jules Feiffer and his wife Judy in late 1968. [...] The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou's stories impressed Judy Feiffer. The next day she called Robert Loomis at Random House, who became Angelou's editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011, and [...] "told him that he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this woman to write a book". At first, Angelou refused, since she thought of herself as a poet and playwright. According to Angelou, Baldwin had a [...] "covert hand" [...] in getting her to write the book, and advised Loomis to use [...] "a little reverse psychology", and reported that Loomis tricked her into it by daring her: [...] "It's just as well", he said, [...] "because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible". [...] Angelou was unable to resist a challenge, and she began writing Caged Bird. After [...] "closeting herself" [...] in London, it took her two years to write it. [...] She shared the manuscript with her friend, writer Jessica Mitford, before submitting it for publication.|$|E

[...] While in Saudi Arabia, Hanjour applied for a job with Saudi Arabian Airlines, but was turned down due to poor grades.

2500|$|Gingrich {{has said}} that {{children}} {{should be able to}} work at an earlier age. He said: [...] "You say to somebody, you shouldn't go to work before you're what, 14, 16 years of age, fine," [...] Mr. Gingrich said. [...] "You're totally poor. You're in a school that is failing with a teacher that is failing. I've tried for years to have a very simple model. Most of these schools <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the unionized janitors, have one master janitor and pay local students {{to take care of the}} school. The kids would actually do work, they would have cash, they would have pride in the schools, they'd begin the process of rising." [...] He later clarified his position, saying he was not proposing major changes in the law or encouraging children to seek jobs instead of attending school, but rather was [...] "talking about working 20 hours a week and being empowered to succeed".|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} case based {{exceptions}} to the Salomon principle, though their restrictive scope is not wholly stable. The present rule under English law is that only where a company {{was set up to}} commission fraud, or to avoid a pre-existing obligation can its separate identity be ignored. This follows from a Court of Appeal case, Adams v Cape Industries plc. A group of employees suffered asbestos diseases after working for the American wholly owned subsidiary of Cape Industries plc. They were suing in New York to make Cape Industries plc pay for the debts of the subsidiary. Under conflict of laws principles, this could only be done if Cape Industries plc was treated as [...] "present" [...] in America through its US subsidiary (i.e. ignoring the separate legal personality of the two companies). Rejecting the claim, and following the reasoning in Jones v Lipman, the Court of Appeal emphasised that the US subsidiary had been set up for a lawful purpose of creating a group structure overseas, and had not aimed to circumvent liability in the event of asbestos litigation. The potentially unjust result for tort victims, who are unable to contract around limited liability and may be left only with a worthless claim against a bankrupt entity, has been changed in Chandler v Cape plc so that a duty of care may be owed by a parent to workers of a subsidiary regardless of separated legal personality. However even though tort victims are protected, the restrictive position remains subject to criticism where a company group is involved, since {{it is not clear that}} companies and actual people <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the protection of limited liability in identical ways. An influential decision, although subsequently doubted strongly by the House of Lords, was passed by Lord Denning MR in DHN Ltd v Tower Hamlets BC. Here Lord Denning MR held that a group of companies, two subsidiaries wholly owned by a parent, constituted a single economic unit. Because the companies' shareholders and controlling minds were identical, their rights were to be treated as the same. This allowed the parent company to claim compensation from the council for compulsory purchase of its business, which it could not have done without showing an address on the premises that its subsidiary possessed. Similar approaches to treating corporate [...] "groups" [...] or a [...] "concern" [...] as single economic entities exist in many continental European jurisdictions. This is done for tax and accounting purposes in English law, however for general civil liability the rule still followed is that in Adams v Cape Industries plc. It is very rare for English courts to lift the veil. The liability of the company is generally attributed to the company alone.|$|E
