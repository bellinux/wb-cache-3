Firstly, it commences by exploring the differences between terrorism, international terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism. Secondly, it details the United States' list of state sponsors <b>of</b> international <b>terrorism</b> and the sanctions that accompany that list. Thirdly, international terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism in Africa, {{during and after the}} Cold War, are briefly discussed. Fourthly, two case studies regarding the state sponsorship <b>of</b> international <b>terrorism</b> in Africa are presented. The case studies include Libya, a previous state sponsor <b>of</b> international <b>terrorism,</b> and Sudan, currently on the United States' list of state sponsors <b>of</b> international <b>terrorism.</b> The case studies consider the history of these two countries as sponsors of international terrorism; the international community's attempts to prevent their involvement in international terrorism; how Libya succeeded in being taken off the United States' list; and Sudan's efforts to join Libya as a country that is no longer seen as a sponsor <b>of</b> international <b>terrorism...</b>|$|R
5|$|After the {{terrorist}} attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention <b>of</b> <b>Terrorism</b> Act. The aim of the act was to improve the government's {{ability to deal with}} terrorism. It initially failed to pass in the Rajya Sabha; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a joint session of the Parliament, where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass. The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused <b>of</b> <b>terrorism.</b> However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it had been used to target Muslims. It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.|$|E

40|$|This Note {{will attempt}} to address the {{question}} of whether or not incidents of swatting aimed at contrary political ideals meet the characterization <b>of</b> domestic <b>terrorism</b> in the post– 9 / 11 era. In particular, there will be consideration of the extent to which treatment of political swatting as domestic terrorism is consistent with the maintenance of the delicate balance between public safety concerns and protection of the constitutional values of free speech and free expression. This Note will proceed in four parts. Part I will examine the growth of telecommunication manipulation practices from products of curiosity to an alarming means of intimidation in modern day swatting and the dangers swatting presents to American communities. Part II will offer a history of the development <b>of</b> domestic <b>terrorism</b> in American jurisprudence and discuss the current state <b>of</b> domestic <b>terrorism</b> in the post– 9 / 11 era. Part III provides context for the application <b>of</b> the domestic <b>terrorism</b> classification by offering examples <b>of</b> domestic <b>terrorism</b> in U. S. history, particularly the rise <b>of</b> “special-interest” domestic <b>terrorism.</b> Finally, Part IV analyzes political swatting in light <b>of</b> domestic <b>terrorism</b> requirements grown out of the PATRIOT Act and in comparison with prior examples of crimes classed as domestic terrorism. Part IV concludes with the argument that, in light of the definitional requirements <b>of</b> domestic <b>terrorism</b> in the United States and strong public policy interests, swatting should in fact be classified as an act <b>of</b> domestic <b>terrorism</b> when used to intimidate political adversaries or coerce advocates of a particular viewpoint to withdraw from participation in political discourse...|$|R
