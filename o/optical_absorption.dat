These oligomers comprise two terminal electron-rich cyclopentadithiophene units connected to six different electron deficient aromatic rings that allow tuning the optical band gap from 1. 4 to 2. 0 eV. <b>Optical</b> <b>absorptions</b> of the ground state, triplet excited state, and radical cation have been investigated. The optical band gaps correlate with the electrochemical oxidation and reduction potentials and are further supported by quantum-chemical calculations at the density functional theory (DFT) level.

5|$|Isolated vacancy is {{the most}} studied defect in diamond, both {{experimentally}} and theoretically. Its most important practical property is <b>optical</b> <b>absorption,</b> like in the color centers, which gives diamond green, or sometimes even green–blue color (in pure diamond).

5|$|Silicon is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in diamond films grown by chemical vapor deposition and it originates either from silicon substrate or from silica windows or walls of the CVD reactor. It was also observed in natural diamonds in dispersed form. Isolated silicon defects have been detected in diamond lattice through the sharp <b>optical</b> <b>absorption</b> peak at 738nm and electron paramagnetic resonance. Similar to other large impurities, the major form of silicon in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site). This center is a deep donor having an ionization energy of 2 eV, and thus again is unsuitable for electronic applications.|$|E
5|$|When {{diamonds}} {{are grown}} by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt {{or some other}} metals are usually added into the growth medium to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms incorporate into diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron paramagnetic resonance, <b>optical</b> <b>absorption</b> and photoluminescence spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%.

It has an amber color and orthorhombic symmetry, with the lattice constants of a = 1411 pm, b = 1755 pm and c = 963 pm and the calculated density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound within a period of weeks. One C5H5 ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2. The <b>optical</b> <b>absorption</b> spectra of this compound {{are very similar to}} those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E
5|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>absorption</b> {{in carbon}} {{nanotubes}} differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D nanotubes) {{instead of an}} absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify nanotube types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra. This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E
5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation {{states have been}} observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic <b>optical</b> <b>absorption</b> spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E

The absorption is decreasing the soliton intensity with the propagation distance (which set a limit in the soliton channel length), is increasing the breathing period, and is changing the soliton width (in inverse relations, at low and high intensities).

40|$|We {{investigate}} the optical transmittances of ion-irradiated sapphire crystals as potential vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) to near-infrared (NIR) window materials of fusion reactors. Under potential conditions in fusion reactors, sapphire crystals are irradiated with hydrogen (H), deuterium (D), and helium (He) ions with 1 -keV energy and ∼ 1020 -m- 2 s- 1 flux. Ion irradiation decreases the transmittances from 140 to 260 nm but hardly affects the transmittances from 300 to 1500 nm. H-ion and D-ion irradiation causes <b>optical</b> <b>absorptions</b> near 210 and 260 nm {{associated with an}} F-center and an F+-center, respectively. These F-type centers are classified as Schottky defects that can be removed through annealing above 1000 K. In contrast, He-ion irradiation does not cause <b>optical</b> <b>absorptions</b> above 200 nm because He-ions cannot be incorporated in the crystal lattice due to the large ionic radius of He-ions. Moreover, the significant decrease in transmittance of the ion-irradiated sapphire crystals from 140 to 180 nm {{is related to the}} light scattering on the crystal surface. Similar to diamond polishing, ion irradiation modifies the crystal surface thereby affecting the optical properties especially at shorter wavelengths. Although the transmittances in the VUV wavelengths decrease after ion irradiation, the transmittances can be improved through annealing above 1000 K. With an optical transmittance in the VUV region that can recover through simple annealing and with a high transparency from the ultraviolet (UV) to the NIR region, sapphire crystals can therefore be used as good optical windows inside modern fusion power reactors in terms of light particle loadings of hydrogen isotopes and helium...|$|R
