40|$|Title: Computational {{problems}} of elementary number theory Author: Mgr. Jiří Widž Department: Department of Mathematics Education Supervisor: Prof. RNDr. Štefan Porubský, DrSc. Institute of Computer Science of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Abstract: The central notion of this presented thesis {{is the concept}} <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> fractions. The origin of this concept {{as one of the}} oldest mathematical methods is shown here in its historical connections. The technique <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> fractions belongs to classical parts of mathematics. Although the general theory <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> fractions is manifold and layered considerably, in textbooks it is usually treated according to the intended purpose of its use. In the present text we have summarized the foundations of the general theory <b>of</b> convergence <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> fractions with an emphasis on the theory <b>of</b> simple <b>continued</b> fractions and their most common applications. We show several possibilities how the concept <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> fractions can be generalized to other structures such as the Gaussian integers or polynomial continued fractions. In the chapter devoted to matrix continued fractions we shall demonstrate the possibility how to extend it to non-commutative algebraic structures. We also show how the apparatus <b>of</b> <b>continued</b> fractions can be used to solve [...] ...|$|R

Diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from Connie.
