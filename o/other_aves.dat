As is seen in <b>other</b> <b>aves,</b> the flamingo's circulatory system is closed maintaining a separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. This maximizes their efficiency to meet their high metabolic needs during flight. Due to this need for increased cardiac output, the avian heart tends to be larger in relation to body mass than what is seen in most mammals.|$|E

While the known parent-of-origin quantitative trait loci in chicken do not overlap with differentiated methylated regions, further analysis with a larger sample size is required. No transcript in the chicken transcriptome at incubation day 4. 5 shows parent-of-origin expression, providing strong evidence for a lack of imprinting at this stage of development.

40|$|Aim: The present {{work was}} {{targeted}} {{to form the}} baseline data of normal morphological and histological picture of parathyroid gland in female Kuttanad ducks. Materials and Methods: A Histomorphological study of the parathyroid gland {{was carried out in}} twelve adult female Kuttanad ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) of 20 weeks of age. Birds reared semintensively were procured from Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University Poultry and Duck Farm and sacrificed humanely. Glands were collected and gross parameters were recorded. The glands were fixed in 10 percent neutral buffered formalin. The small sized glands were processed as such by routine histological methods, paraffin blocks were prepared and sectioned to a thickness of 5 µ. The tissues were stained by Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) for routine histological studies and Gomori's rapid one step trichrome method for connective tissue fibres. Micrometric parameters were recorded using ocular micrometer. Results: Parathyroid glands in Kuttanad ducks lay just caudal to the division of the innominate artery into the subclavian and common carotid arteries. Parathyroids were oval to spherical in shape, yellow in colour and smaller than thyroid gland of the representative sides. The arterial blood supply was from common carotid artery and blood from gland was drained directly into jugular vein. Although it lied close to the thyroid, thymus and ultimobranchial gland, parathyroid tissue did not merge to any of the above mentioned three glands. Parenchyma was composed irregular anatomizing cords of cells supplied by connective tissue stroma penetrated by blood capillaries. Parenchyma was predominantly made of lightly stained cell, the chief cell. The nuclei were round and contain one or two nucleoli. Oxyphil cells present in parathyroid glands of other mammals were not seen in the present study. Conclusion: Histomorphological features or characteristics of Parathyroid gland in Kuttanad duck were studied. Cranial parathyroids were larger in size as compared to the caudal parathyroids. Parathyroid glands were enclosed by a well-developed connective tissue capsule made predominantly of collagen fibers. Parenchyma was composed of irregular anatomizing cords of cells supplied by connective tissue stroma and penetrated by blood capillaries. Oxyphil cells were absent similar to <b>other</b> <b>aves.</b> Parathyroid gland is very vital in maintaining the homeostasis of the plasma calciumReference?. Findings of this study will contribute to the anatomy literature as a valuable resource for future researchers focused on this subject and will also help other allied subjects on comparative basis...|$|E

5000|$|Alta Velocidad Española (AVE) is {{a service}} of {{high-speed}} rail in Spain operated by Renfe, the Spanish national railway company, at speeds {{of up to}} 310 km/h (193 mph).1 The name is literally translated from Spanish [...] "Alta Velocidad Españolas" [...] (Spanish High Speed), but its initials are also a play on the word ave, meaning [...] "bird". As of December 2011, the Spanish AVE system is the longest HSR network in Europe with 2,665 km (1,656 mi) and the second in the world, after China.AVE trains run on a network of dedicated high-speed rail track owned and managed by Adif. The first line was opened in 1992, connecting the cities of Madrid, Córdoba and Sevilla. Unlike {{the rest of the}} Spanish broad gauge network, the AVE uses standard gauge, permitting direct connections outside Spain. Although AVE trains are operated by Renfe, the Spanish state railway company, private companies may be allowed to operate trains in the future using other brands, in accordance with European Union legislation. Some TGV-derived trains do run on the broad-gauge network at slower speeds, and these are branded separately as Euromed. On the line from Madrid to Seville, the service guarantees arrival within five minutes of the advertised time, and offers a full refund if the train is delayed further, although only 0.16% of trains have been so. In this regard, the punctuality of the AVE is exceptional compared to other non-long-distance RENFE services. On <b>other</b> <b>AVE</b> lines, this punctuality promise is more lax (15 minutes on the Barcelona line). A possible {{reason for this is that}} AVE services slow down to 200 km/h for the Sierra Morena section of the journey, because of the tight curves, and 250 km/h for the Córdoba-Seville section, possibly on account of medium-speed services running on the line, meaning that they have an easy means of recovering lost time if held up earlier in the journey.|$|R

40|$|The ovary of {{the yellow}} spotted ray, Urolophus jamaicensis, is {{embedded}} in the epigonal gland, a lymphomyeloid organ. The covering of the ovary is composed of a germinal epithelium that is cuboidal and dome-shaped with microvilli. Adjacent cells have elaborate intercellular folds that create dilated intercellular spaces. In previtellogenic follicles, the follicle cells are simple cuboidal and contain modest amounts of synthetic or transport organelles. As vitellogenesis proceeds, the epithelium becomes multilaminar. Follicle cells are columnar as yolk precursors are transported from the maternal circulation, through the follicle cell cytoplasm, to the oocyte. Large, round cells occur in the follicle wall that contain lipid-like substances. These cells decrease in size and number as folliculogenesis proceeds and eventually disappear prior to ovulation. Columnar follicular cells and the oocyte have cellular extensions that impinge upon the zona pellucida. Transosomes are follicle cell extensions that indent the oocyte membrane. Tips of transosomes become enclosed by a layer of oocyte plasmalemma. The tips of transosomes pinch off and become resident in the ooplasm. Dense staining material occurs on the inner surface of the transosome membrane derived from the follicle cell. In other animals, this material has been described as ribosome-like. This study is the first to document the presence of transosomes in a group <b>other</b> than <b>Aves</b> or reptiles. Follicle cells are supported by an extremely thick basal lamina. Subjacent to the lamina is the vascularized theca with fibroblasts embedded in a collage-nous network. There is no differentiation into definitive theca interna and externa. In vitellogenic eggs, extensive inward foldings of the follicular epithelium occur thereby generating more surface area for the transport of yolk precursors to the oocyte.

Three differentiated histological regions constitute the oviduct: the infundibulum, as its main characteristic, has many tubuloalveolar glands; the uterine region is remarkable for many mucous glands, just below the epithelium; the vagina, near to the cloacal opening, is characterized by an epithelium with infolding borders and several crypts for sperm storage. The infundibulum and uterine regions were marked {{by the presence of}} acid glycosaminoglycans and neutral polysaccharides, which reacted strongly in the epithelium, and was absent in the functional gland units. In the sperm storage region, polysaccharides were not observed, occurring only in the epithelium of unicellular glands.

5000|$|Only {{scattered}} {{remnants of}} Ashwell's music survives. As was common for pre-Reformation music in England in Latin, {{the large majority}} of manuscripts were destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII (and a large proportion of English-language sacred music was destroyed during the subsequent reign of Mary, during her attempt to re-impose Roman Catholicism on the island). Two masses, both for six voices, survive complete in the Forrest-Heyther Partbooks, the first layer of which were copied for Taverner's use at Cardinal College in 1526-1530. With the fall of Cardinal Wolsey in 1529 the college founded by him was not able to devote resources to such music and so the manuscript was discontinued, and this situation was probably the reason for Taverner's departure that year. This first layer contains the Missa Jesu Christe (for 6 voices) and ten other works by various composers, including Taverner. The <b>other</b> Mass-setting (Missa <b>Ave</b> Maria, also for 6 voices, which is the finer of the two and an outstanding work with similarities to Taverner's Missa Gloria tibi Trinitas) was copied into the partbooks mid-century along with five other settings by other composers, though the dates of composition of both Ashwell Masses were considerably earlier: their style indicates dates of composition possibly even before his appointment at Durham. A few other works survive in other sources, mostly very fragmentary, including a fragment of a Mass for St. Cuthbert, which must date from his time at Durham.

Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as [...] "SA" [...] and operates on AAR58. There are two crossings near each <b>other,</b> Williams <b>Ave</b> and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui. From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track). There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1. Few more miles southward, the next major location appears. At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal. From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago. The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track. From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track. From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike. The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of [...] "0BA" [...] but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal. At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard. Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals. This location is known as North Radnor. The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta. The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures. The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main. Both lines remain double track for a while. The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0. Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south. From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge. At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40. From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10. After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown. On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present. This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it. The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye. The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic. The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal. The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0. The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 [...] "11th Avenue" [...] where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track. The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at [...] "Shops". Now speed has been increased. The line is still double track until [...] "Sellars", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher. For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements. The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3. The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines. The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed. The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel. Crew change usually occurs at the [...] "walkway" [...] which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower. This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins. Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated. At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now. There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3. About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double. About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names). When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as [...] "Long Lead". And now, the Terminal splits into two parts. The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood. The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while. This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line. The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2. Speed is now increased to 40. Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance. Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line. At 00J3.6 known as A-1. Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9). Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line. At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, [...] "SC". At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill. There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track. And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad. Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard. Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10. Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192. The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use. The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs. At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1. Speed is now at 40. 2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present. This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main. There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track. Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains. This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent. From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip. The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood. Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher. The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important.|$|R
