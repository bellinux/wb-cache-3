5|$|The British and Americans {{exchanged}} nuclear information, but did {{not initially}} combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 offer by Bush and Conant to create a combined British and American project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, {{the head of the}} London liaison office of OSRD, raised the issue <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Switzerland {{approved}} 1 billion francs of supportive {{investment in}} the poorer Southern and Central European countries in support <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> positive ties to the EU as a whole. A further referendum {{will be needed to}} approve 300 million francs to support Romania and Bulgaria and their recent admission. The Swiss have also been under EU and sometimes international pressure to reduce banking secrecy and to raise tax rates to parity with the EU. Preparatory discussions are being opened in four new areas: opening up the electricity market, participation in the European GNSS project Galileo, cooperating with the European centre for disease prevention and recognising certificates of origin for food products.|$|E
5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{had offered}} to give the United States access to its {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft, {{as part of the}} Tizard Mission, briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The British and American projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 American offer to create a combined project. In November 1941, Frederick L.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} design {{as part of}} {{creative}} economy and design {{in the context of}} corporate innovations. The aim is to analyze the conditions <b>and</b> qualities <b>of</b> <b>cooperations</b> between companies <b>and</b> designers in the Czech Republic, to identify barriers to effective collaboration and to propose steps leading to development <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> between businesses <b>and</b> designers. Tool for the analysis is research in the form of a questionnaire survey among Design Competitiveness programme participants, which the agency CzechTrade implemented in 2013 and 2014 to support projects <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> between companies <b>and</b> designers. Conditions <b>and</b> qualities <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> is explored in the following aspects: establishment <b>of</b> <b>cooperation,</b> objectives <b>and</b> results <b>of</b> the collaboration, progress <b>of</b> the <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> obstacles to effective cooperation. The research is complemented by a case study of a specific project <b>of</b> such <b>cooperation,</b> the development <b>of</b> a new product line by the Mikov company...|$|R

5|$|The HVO {{advanced}} north along {{two main}} axes of attack. The western axis advanced from Šuica {{along the main}} road towards Kupres, capturing the village of Donji Malovan on 1 November. The eastern axis of the HVO offensive moved from Ravno towards Rilić. Just as the HVO began to move north, the ARBiH suspended its westward advance. Various explanations for the pause were put forward, including fog, rain, need to secure territorial gains, wear of equipment and fatigue of personnel. Regardless, that day the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović telephoned Alagić requesting an adequate level <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> avoidance of any conflicts with the HVO. Finally, Alagić made a public call to the HVO {{to participate in the}} offensive against the VRS in Kupres. The same day, the VRS targeted Bugojno using two 9K52 Luna-M missiles.|$|E
5|$|The chaos {{continued}} as other royal guards were found and beaten; {{at least one}} more was killed and his head too appeared atop a pike. Finally, the fury of the attack subsided enough to permit some communication between the former French Guards, who formed the professional core of Lafayette's National Guard militia, and the royal gardes du corps. The units had a history <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> a military sense of mutual respect, and Lafayette, who had been snatching a few hours of sleep in his exhaustion, awoke {{to make the most of}} it. To the relief of the royals, the two sets of soldiers were reconciled by his charismatic mediation and a tenuous peace was established within the palace.|$|E
5|$|William III's {{victory at}} the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690 (O.S.) forced JamesII to abandon his army and flee back to France. In August Marlborough himself left for Ireland engaged upon his first {{independent}} command – a land/sea operation upon the southern ports of Cork and Kinsale. It was a bold, imaginative project aimed at disrupting Jacobite supply routes, and one which the Earl conceived and executed with outstanding success. Cork fell on 27 September (O.S.), and Kinsale followed in mid-October. Although the campaign did not end the war in Ireland as Marlborough hoped, it taught him {{the significance of the}} minutiae of logistics, and the importance <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> tact when working alongside other senior Allied commanders. It would, however, be more than ten years before he once again took charge in the field.|$|E

The report mentioned initiation rituals and codes of conduct, as well as criminal activities that included counterfeiting, kidnappings for ransom, murder, robbery, and witness intimidation.

In an attempt to annihilate the Mafia, Italian troops arrested 64 people of Palermo in February 1898.|$|E
