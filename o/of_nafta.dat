5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA,</b> a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E

25|$|Later, amid a {{push for}} greater {{integration}} {{and concerns about}} the impact of heightened security on trade relations following the September 11 attacks in 2001, an effort was organized in 2003 by the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, U.S. Council on Foreign Relations, and the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations called the Independent Task Force on North America. Several weeks before a meeting of North American leaders on March 23, 2005 the Task Force issued a press release and a statement from the Task Force's chairmen calling for deeper integration <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA</b> to form a North American Economic and Security Community by 2010.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} being a staple in the Mexican diet, Mexico's {{comparative}} advantage in agriculture is not in corn, but in horticulture, tropical fruits, and vegetables. Negotiators <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA</b> expected that through liberalization and mechanization of agriculture two-thirds of Mexican corn producers would naturally shift from corn production to horticultural and other labor-intensive crops such as fruits, nuts, vegetables, coffee and sugar cane. While horticultural trade has drastically increased due to NAFTA, it has not absorbed displaced workers from corn production (estimated at around 600,000). Corn production has remained stable (at 20 million metric tons), arguably, {{as a result of}} income support to farmers, or a reluctance to abandon a millenarian tradition in Mexico: not only have peasants grown corn for millennia, corn originated in Mexico. Mexico is the seventh largest corn producer in the world.|$|E

50|$|Like Mexico and the U.S., Canada {{received}} a modest positive economic benefit {{as measured by}} GDP. Many feared declines failed to materialize, and some industries, like the furniture industry, which were expected to suffer, grew instead. Canadian manufacturing employment held steady despite an international downward trend in developed countries. One <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA's</b> biggest economic effects on U.S.-Canada trade has been to boost bilateral agricultural flows. In the year 2008 alone, Canada exports to the United States and Mexico were at $381.3 billion, and imports from NAFTA were at $245.1 billion.|$|R
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{came under}} heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA {{resulted in a}} loss of American jobs. NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding {{a situation in which the}} president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change. While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA</b> a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993. NAFTA remains controversial for its impact on wages, jobs, and overall economic growth.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{benefits}} <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA</b> {{have been}} quantified by several economists, whose {{findings have been}} reported in several publications like the World Bank's Lessons from NAFTA for LA and the Caribbean, NAFTA's Impact on North America, and NAFTA revisited by the Institute for International Economics. They assess that NAFTA has been positive for Mexico, whose poverty rates have fallen, and real income salaries have risen even after accounting for the 1994–1995 Economic Crisis. Nonetheless, they also state that it has not been enough, or fast enough, to produce an economic convergence nor to reduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth. Beside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile industry in Mexico gained open access to the American market, promoting exports to the United States. The value of Mexican cotton and apparel exports to the U.S. grew from $3billion in 1995 to $8.4billion in 2002, a record high of $9.4billion in 2000. At the same time, the share of Mexico’s cotton textile market the U.S. has increased from 8 percent in 1995 to 13 percent in 2002. Some have suggested that in order to fully benefit from the agreement Mexico should invest in education and promote innovation as well as in infrastructure and agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Their initial {{goal was}} to {{instigate}} a revolution against the rise of neoliberalism throughout Mexico, but as this did not happen, they used their uprising as a platform to call the world's attention to their movement to protest the signing <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA,</b> which the EZLN believed would increase the {{gap between rich and}} poor people in Chiapas—a prediction affirmed by subsequent developments. Gaining attention on a global level through their convention called the Intercontinental Encounter for Humanity and Against Neoliberalism that was attended by 3,000 activists worldwide, the Zapatistas were able to help initiate a united platform for other anti-neoliberal groups. This did not detract from the Zapatistas' national activism efforts, but rather expanded their already existent ideologies. The EZLN also called for greater democratization of the Mexican government, which had been controlled by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (Institutional Revolutionary Party, also known as PRI) for 65 years, and for land reform mandated by the 1917 Constitution of Mexico but largely ignored by the PRI. The EZLN did not demand independence from Mexico, but rather autonomy in the forms of land access and use of natural resources normally extracted from Chiapas, as well as protection from despotic violence and political inclusion of Chiapas' indigenous communities.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million termination fee to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA.</b> Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something {{that he was going to}} do just for the sake of Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a letter saying the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, not a legal one, on the U.S government.|$|E

In {{this paper}} we inquire why {{after more than}} 25 years of {{domestic}} agricultural reforms in Mexico and 15 years of trade liberalization <b>of</b> maize under <b>NAFTA</b> –a non-competitive crop and the major staple in Mexico–domestic production of this field crop has increased. We present new empirical evidence showing that, as expected, maize prices in Mexico dropped until 2006 and have experienced a process of convergence with USA prices, and maize imports from the USA increased. However, despite lower prices, maize production in Mexico rose and has experienced a positive structural change since 1992, {{two years before the}} beginning <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA’s</b> implementation. Based on the heterogeneity of maize production in Mexico, three possible explanations are proposed to explain this unexpected outcome: government supports to big commercial farmers in the agriculturally rich North of Mexico; the persistence of maize production by subsistence farmers; and to a lesser degree, increasing yields on some irrigated maize farms. We finish the paper by drawing lessons from the experience of Mexico for other Less Developed Countries...|$|R

The econometric approach is based on time series analysis using VARs, Granger causality, impulse response functions and variance decomposition.

The inclusion <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA’s</b> potential impact confirms the positive effect of exports and reveals that GDP and exports Granger cause FDI.

Before and after the election Fox made appearances on several U.S. news programs advocating greater integration including a plan to open up the U.S.-Mexico border within ten years.

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the {{maquiladora}} program {{was in place}} far before NAFTA, in some sense dating {{all the way back}} to 1965.

[...] Prior to NAFTA maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given preferential tariff rates by the Mexican government so long as the finished good was for export. [...] The US, prior to NAFTA, allowed Maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the US with the tariff rate only being applied to the value of non US raw materials used to produce the good, thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries.

2500|$|The Zapatistas' {{response}} to the introduction <b>of</b> <b>NAFTA</b> in 1994, it is argued, reflects the shift in perception taking place in societies that have experienced colonialism. The theory of [...] "postcolonial gaze" [...] studies what is described as the cultural and political impacts of colonization on formerly colonized societies and how these societies overcome centuries of discrimination and marginalization by colonialists and their descendents. In Mexico, {{the theory of the}} postcolonial gaze is being fostered predominantly in areas of large indigenous populations and marginalization, like Chiapas. Over the last 20 years, Chiapas is said to have emerged as a formidable force against the Mexican government, fighting against structural violence and social and economic marginalization brought on by globalization. The Zapatista rebellion not only raised many questions about the consequences of globalization and free trade; it also questioned the long-standing ideas created by the Spanish colonial system. Postcolonialism is the antithesis of imperialism because it attempts to explain how the prejudices and restrictions created by colonialism are being overcome. This is especially obvious in countries that have large social and economic inequalities, where colonial ideas are deeply entrenched {{in the minds of the}} colonials' descendents.|$|E
