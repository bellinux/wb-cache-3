50|$|The {{slowness}} of the electrification {{process was}} the source of conflict within the HRO, and during {{the latter half of the}} 1890s Julius Tallberg acquired the right to construct an orbital tram system around the city, that would have linked together the existing HRO lines and parts of the city not covered by the HRO lines.

5000|$|The Liverpool to Warrington {{section of}} this line was {{initially}} scheduled {{to be on the}} Merseyrail electric urban network. The Strategic Plan for the North West, the SPNW, in 1973 envisaged that the Outer Loop which was to be an <b>orbital</b> <b>line</b> circling the city of Liverpool, the Edge Hill Spur which is a tunnel connecting the east of Liverpool to the central underground sections, and the lines to St. Helens, Wigan and Warrington would be electrified and all integrated into Merseyrail by 1991. [...] This meant that trains from Warrington would access Liverpool city centre's underground stations via the Northern Line and Liverpool Central underground station, giving access to Liverpool's shopping and business quarters. This never transpired, however is a long term aspiration of Merseytravel.|$|E
5000|$|It had {{not been}} {{clarified}} if the newly electrified line would be incorporated within Merseyrail, as was the 1973 plan. The Liverpool-Wigan line was initially scheduled {{to be on the}} Merseyrail electric urban network. The Strategic Plan for the North West, the SPNW, in 1973 envisaged that the Outer Loop which was to be an <b>orbital</b> <b>line</b> circling the city of Liverpool, the Edge Hill Spur which is a tunnel connecting the east of Liverpool to the city centre underground sections, and the lines to St. Helens, Wigan and Warrington would be electrified and all integrated into Merseyrail by 1991. [...] This meant that trains from Wigan theoretically could directly access West Kirby on the Wirral via Liverpool city centre's underground stations creating an east-west crossrail using the 1890 [...] to Liverpool James Street tunnel, which is currently used as a shunting tunnel. This never transpired, even though tunnelling work had commenced on the Edge Hill Spur section. Wigan was not incorporated into the Merseyrail electric network, with the Wigan line remaining a diesel service and operated as part of the Merseytravel diesel-operated City Line, although branded as Merseyrail. However, the current Network Rail electrification project would give fast electric train access from Wigan to Liverpool's high-level Lime Street railway station. If the mothballed Edge Hill Spur project were to be completed, it was thought trains from Wigan could access the stations in Liverpool city centre's underground section. However a major concern was whether or not the Class 319 EMUs offered, because of their build and four carriage configuration, would be able to negotiate the Merseyrail tunnel system safely.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{describe}} a procedure for diagnosis {{and planning for}} orthognatic surgery based on international standards. A special 2 D planning based on lateral cephalograms (Axis <b>Orbital</b> Marker <b>Lines</b> System) realize a transmission to the SAM 2 P articulator (3 D) {{by means of the}} Axis Orbital Plane. Methods Former intraoperative measurement of the average height of the LeFort I osteotomy plane relative to the molar occlusal plane allow to construct a virtual osteotomy plane in the lateral cephalogram. This is the basis {{for the development of the}} Axis <b>Orbital</b> Marker <b>Lines</b> System (AO-MLS). Results The AO-MLS is presented graphically, and in detail, with construction guidelines. The system could be integrated into various lateral cephalometric analysis- and surgical prediction schemes. It forms the basis for a standardized transfer of the 2 D planning to the 3 D planning in the articulator, and vice versa. This procedure makes it possible to generate surgical planning protocols based on the model surgery, which represent the dislocations in the proximity of the real osteotomy planes. Conclusions The Axis <b>Orbital</b> Marker <b>Lines</b> System (software component) in conjunction with the University Münster Model Surgery System (hardware system) increases the predictability of model operations in orthognathic surgery. </p...|$|R
