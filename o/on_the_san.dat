5|$|A {{colder climate}} {{introduced}} cold-limited animal species which appeared at lower altitudes, and glaciers formed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> Bernardino Mountains.

5|$|By the 1960s, the Santa Fe {{encountered}} capacity problems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> Francisco Chief, {{which ran}} between Chicago and San Francisco. Unlike the El Capitan, the Chief carried {{a mix of}} sleeping cars and coaches. To augment capacity, the Santa Fe ordered an additional 24 coaches in 19631964; 12 step-down and 12 standard. This was the final major order for new long-distance passenger equipment before the coming of Amtrak. Each San Francisco Chief carried four Hi-Level coaches, displacing six single-level coaches.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, SDSU {{was deemed}} {{the number one}} small {{research}} university in the nation. The ranking was determined based on faculty productivity, honorary awards, publications in journals, and number of research grants received. At any point, the campus usually has around 800 studies in progress in various fields. A 2007 study revealed that the campus has an economic impact of $2.4 billion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> Diego region. Due to projections of current and future growth, the study indicated that the school's economic impact {{is expected to increase}} to $4.5 billion by 2025.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these environmental problems, Congress passed in 1992 the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), Title 34 of Public Law 102-575, to change water management practices in the CVP in order to lessen the ecological impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers. Actions mandated included the release of more water to supply rivers and wetlands, funding for habitat restoration work (especially for anadromous fish spawning gravels), water temperature control, water conservation, fish passage, increasing the service area of the CVP's canals, and other items.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 1978, 10 {{months after}} being sworn in, White {{resigned}} his position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> Francisco Board of Supervisors, {{saying that his}} annual salary of $9,600 {{was not enough to}} support his family. Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and he be reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed. However, further consideration—and intervention by other supervisors—convinced Moscone to appoint someone more in line with the growing ethnic diversity of White's district and the liberal leanings of the Board of Supervisors.|$|E

Stela68 was found at the base of Mound61A near to a broken altar. Structure61 and its associated mounds may have been used to control access to the city during the height of its power, Mound61A was reused during the Postclassic occupation of the site. Early Classic finds from Mound61A include four ceramic vessels and four obsidian prismatic blades.|$|E
5|$|The CVP {{also has}} several dams <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> Joaquin River—which has far less average flow than the Sacramento—in order to divert its water to {{southern}} Central Valley aqueducts. The Friant Dam, completed in 1942, {{is the largest}} component of the Friant Division of the CVP. The dam crosses the San Joaquin River where it spills out of the Sierra Nevada, forming Millerton Lake, which provides water storage for San Joaquin Valley irrigators {{as well as providing}} a diversion point for a pair of canals, the Friant-Kern Canal and the Madera Canal. The Friant-Kern Canal sends water southwards through the Tulare Lake area to its terminus at Bakersfield on the Kern River, supplying irrigation water to Tulare, Fresno, and Kern counties. The Madera Canal takes water northwards to Madera County, emptying into the Chowchilla River.|$|E
5|$|The Hi-Level {{is a type}} of bilevel {{intercity}} railroad {{passenger car}} built by the Budd Company for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ("Santa Fe") in the 1950s and 1960s. The first two coaches entered service on the El Capitan in 1954 and found immediate success. Budd built sufficient coaches, dining cars, and lounge cars to fully reequip the El Capitan, with additional coaches seeing use <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> Francisco Chief. Amtrak inherited the entire fleet in 1971 and continued to use the equipment on its western routes. In 1979, the first Superliners, based on the Hi-Level concept, although built by Pullman-Standard, began entering service. As of 2013 Amtrak continues to operate five Hi-Level lounges on the Coast Starlight as Pacific Parlour Cars.|$|E

Shasta also spent several months every two years at various shipyards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south <b>San</b> Francisco waterfront. This {{situation}} of going to sea from one port and returning to another led to many logistical difficulties for the ship's crew.|$|R

5|$|The Presidio La Bahía {{was moved}} from the Guadalupe River to Goliad <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> Antonio River in 1749. Within five years, a new mission for the Karankawa tribes, Nuestra Señora del Rosario de los Cuhanes, was built {{upstream}} of the presidio. This mission survived for many years. Despite the new missions and presidios, Texas {{was one of the}} least populated provinces on the northern frontier of New Spain. By 1760, almost 1,200Hispanic people lived in Texas, with half in San Antonio, 350 at Los Adaes, and 260 at La Bahía. Other Spaniards lived in what is now the El Paso area, but that was considered part of New Mexico and not part of Texas.|$|E
5|$|In France, the {{government}} press misrepresented the battle. Le Moniteur Universel published a report purportedly written by Captain Raymond Cocault of the corvette Diligente. The report began by inaccurately {{claiming that the}} British squadron consisted of nine ships of the line. The report concluded with the information that two British ships had been destroyed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>San</b> Domingo coast alongside three French and that two others had been dismasted and were badly damaged. The official French report, written by Leissègues but not published in France, contradicted this version of events. Leissègues stated that Cocault, with the other smaller warships, had made all sail to the westwards {{at the start of}} the engagement and that by the time the flagship drove ashore, Diligente was already out of sight. Leissègues remained on Santo Domingo for some time, but had returned to Europe by the time the colony fell to a joint English and Spanish force in July 1809. He later received a regional command in the Ionian Sea and took part in the Adriatic campaign.|$|E
