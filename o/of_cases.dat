5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply.

These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} several years, state mental health {{authorities}} throughout the United States have assigned a high priority to the funding, development, and operation <b>of</b> <b>case</b> management programs. Although the concept <b>of</b> <b>case</b> management has been in existence for over a decade, there is still confusion regarding the definition <b>of</b> <b>case</b> management and the identification <b>of</b> alternative <b>case</b> management approaches. Recognizing this confusion, the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation undertook a comprehensive study to determine the state <b>of</b> <b>case</b> management practice today. This article reports {{on the results of}} a national survey <b>of</b> <b>case</b> management programs and describes the characteristics of the programs themselves, the case managers, the clients they serve, and the systems within which they operate.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} a partial, {{critical look at}} {{the construction}} and use <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies in ethics education.

Issues {{of the nature of}} the genre, the fictional, story-constructing aspect <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies, the nature of authorship, and the purposes and uses <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies as "texts" are outlined and discussed. The paper concludes with some critical questions that can be applied to the construction and use <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies in the light of the foregoing analysis...|$|R

5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.|$|E

40|$|Defining {{the roles}} and {{functions}} <b>of</b> <b>case</b> managers is crucial in today 2 ̆ 7 s healthcare environment and necessary for the case management field. One way {{to address this issue}} is through the examination <b>of</b> <b>case</b> managers 2 ̆ 7 job descriptions used in various healthcare organizations. The study reported herein used qualitative analysis procedures and the latent class cluster analysis method to examine a national sample of 1028 job descriptions <b>of</b> <b>case</b> managers. The study identified the activities, role relationships, knowledge, skills, and abilities <b>of</b> <b>case</b> managers working in varied settings. It also described the changes that occurred in the practice <b>of</b> <b>case</b> management, based on these job descriptions, over 5 years: from the mid- 1990 s until the early 2000 s. One benefit of this study was a change in one eligibility criterion of the CCM credential. Another was the development of a taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>case</b> managers 2 ̆ 7 roles and functions that {{can be used as a}} step toward standardization <b>of</b> <b>case</b> managers 2 ̆ 7 job descriptions...|$|R
30|$|For the {{resistive}} model <b>of</b> <b>case</b> # 8 (Figure  18), {{the calculated}} overvoltages do not present significant oscillations, given the dissipative {{character of the}} loads. The model <b>of</b> <b>case</b> # 7 (Figure  17) and the lumped inductance of 5 μH <b>of</b> <b>case</b> # 10 (Figure  20) leads to smaller peak values, and, on the contrary, for the model <b>of</b> <b>case</b> # 9 (Figure  19) the overvoltages present high values and oscillations of elevated frequency, with a significantly different behavior {{from that of the}} other models.|$|R
30|$|What {{is missing}} is a {{comparison}} <b>of</b> <b>case</b> study research designs {{with regard to}} differences in the contribution to theory.

5|$|If the {{dissection}} of {{the artery}} {{extends to the}} part of the artery that lies inside the skull, subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur (1% <b>of</b> <b>cases).</b> This arises due to rupture of the artery and accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space.

5|$|In ESRD, some {{eventually}} need hemodialysis {{or equivalent}} renal replacement therapy (RRT).

5|$|In England and Wales an {{estimated}} 41,200 cases of paracetamol poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990, with a mortality of 0.40%. It {{is estimated that}} 150 to 200 deaths and 15 to 20 liver transplants occur {{as a result of}} poisoning each year in England and Wales. Paracetamol overdose results in more calls to poison control centers in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance, accounting for more than 100,000 calls, as well as 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year. A study <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of acute liver failure between November 2000 and October 2004 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA found that paracetamol was the cause of 41% of all cases in adults, and 25% <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> in children.|$|E
30|$|In summary, through formalized {{materials}} by plaintiffs {{and documentation}} by courts, disputes are further packaged as cases. Every dispute has a case file that includes digital-management information, {{such as a}} case file number, a case file date, and a trial date, {{as well as a}} lawsuit appeal text, an approval table, a notification, and a subpoena. The establishment <b>of</b> the above <b>case</b> files maintains the imprint of handling a dispute, which renders this dispute handling process to meet the requirements of the legal process. It makes the case appear to be standardized, formalized, and legalized. The establishment <b>of</b> <b>case</b> files is also a documentation process completed in preparation for possible procedural checks that may need to occur in the future. “The legal requirement <b>of</b> <b>case</b> procedures and evidence is finally reflected as the legal production <b>of</b> <b>case</b> files, because all the evidence must be found within a case-file (Zhao 1997).” This practice skill of making the forms <b>of</b> <b>case</b> files (Zheng 1997) is usually found following the trial, such as refining the contents <b>of</b> <b>case</b> files, adding more materials, re-ordering all lawsuit documents, and creating a booklet from them (Ding 2014). This study analyzes the production <b>of</b> <b>case</b> files from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>case</b> filing and emphasizes the importance <b>of</b> <b>case</b> forms and the production of documentation.|$|R
