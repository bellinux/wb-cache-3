40|$|Abstract — Most {{wireless}} communication networks are two-way, where nodes act as both sources and destinations of messages. This allows for adaptation at or {{interaction between the}} nodes—a node’s channel inputs may be functions of its message(s) and previously received signals allowing for potentially larger rates than those achievable in feedback-free <b>one-way</b> <b>channels</b> where inputs are functions of messages only. However, examples exist of channels where adaptation is not beneficial from a capac-ity perspective. We ask whether analogous results hold for several multiuser two-way networks. We first consider deterministic two-way channel models: the binary modulo- 2 addition channel and a generalization of this, and the linear deterministic channel, which models Gaussian channels at high SNR. For these deterministic models, we obtain the capacity region for the two-way multiple access/broadcast channel (MAC/BC), the two-way Z channel...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Common Randomness Generation (CRG) and Secret Key Establishment (SKE) are {{fundamental}} primitives {{that are used}} in information-theoretic coding and cryptography. We study these two problems over the two-way channel model of communication, introduced by Shannon. In this model, the common randomness (CK) capacity is defined as the maximum number of random bits per channel use that the two parties can generate. The secret key (SK) capacity is defined similarly when the random bits are also required to be secure against a passive adversary. We provide lower bounds on the two capacities. These lower bounds are tighter than those one might derive based on the previously known results. We prove our lower bounds by proposing a two-round, two-level coding construction over the two-way channel. We show that the lower bound on the common randomness capacity can also be achieved using a simple interactive channel coding (ICC) method. We furthermore provide upper bounds on these capacities and show that the lower and the upper bounds coincide when the two-way channel consists of two independent (physically degraded) <b>one-way</b> <b>channels.</b> We apply the results to the case where the channels are binary symmetric...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Key {{establishment}} protocols {{are among}} the most important security mechanisms via which two or more parties can encrypt their communications over an insecure network. This paper is concerned with the vulnerability of onepass two-party key establishment protocols to key-compromise impersonation (K-CI) attacks. The latter may occur once an adversary has obtained the longterm private key of an honest party, and represent a serious — but often underestimated — threat, because a successful impersonation attack may result in far greater harm than the reading of past and future conversations. Our aim is to describe two main classes of K-CI attacks that can be mounted against all of the best-known one-pass protocols, including MQV and HMQV. We show that one of the attacks described can be somewhat avoided (though not completely eliminated) through the combined use of digital signatures and time-stamps; however, there still remains a class of K-CI threats {{for which there is no}} obvious solution.

It achieves {{the same rate as}} the original compress-forward scheme with binning and successive decoding. Therefore, binning helps reduce decoding complexity by allowing successive decoding, but has no impact on achievable rate for the <b>one-way</b> relay <b>channel.</b> On the other hand, no binning simplifies relay operation. By extending compress-forward without binning to the two-way relay channel, we can achieve a larger rate region than the original compress-forward scheme when the channel is asymmetric for the two users. Binning and successive decoding limits the compression rate to match the weaker of the channels from relay to two users, whereas without binning, this restriction no longer applies. Compared with noisy network coding, compress-forward without binning achieves the same rate region in certain Gaussian channel configurations, and it has much less delay.

Here, Alice and Bob are connected by a noisy classical <b>one-way</b> <b>channel,</b> and are given correlated inputs from a random source. Their goal is for Bob to learn Alice’s input while using the channel as little as possible. In the zero-error regime, the optimal rates of source codes and channel codes are given by graph parameters known as the Witsenhausen rate and Shannon capacity, respectively. The Lovász theta number, a graph parameter defined by a semidefinite program, gives the best efficiently computable upper bound on the Shannon capacity and it also upper bounds its entanglement-assisted counterpart. At the same time, it was recently shown that the Shannon capacity can be increased if Alice and Bob may use entanglement. Here, we partially extend these results to the source-coding problem and to the more general source-channel coding problem. We prove a lower bound on the rate of entanglement-assisted source-codes in terms of Szegedy’s number (a strengthening of the theta number). This result implies that the theta number lower bounds the entangled variant of the Witsenhausen rate. We also show that entanglement can allow for an unbounded improvement of the asymptotic rate of both classical source codes and classical source-channel codes.

However, examples exist of channels where adaptation is not beneficial from a capacity perspective; it is known that for the point-to-point two-way modulo 2 adder and Gaussian channels, adaptation does not increase capacity. Recently, it was shown that the two-way modulo- 2 additive versions of the multiple-access / broadcast (MAC/BC respectively, in the two directions), the Z channel and the interference channel also have capacity regions equal to two parallel one-way versions of the channels.
