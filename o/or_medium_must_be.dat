A strategy to avoid this is the vitrification procedure when the embryo and the surrounding medium undergo the transition to glassy state rather than a crystalline one during cooling. Similarly, recrystallization in the embryo <b>or</b> the <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> avoided during the warming process. The necessary conditions for this are rapid cooling and warming rates. We assess the cooling and warming rates in the Rapid-i™ device for vitrification and cryostorage of human embryos from Vitrolife Sweden AB with help of numerical simulations.

In order to achieve self-focusing in a hyperbolic wire medium, a nonlinear self-defocusing Kerr <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> used as a dielectric host.

The role {{of time in the}} corresponding effective 3 D Minkowski spacetime is played by the spatial coordinate aligned with the optical axis of the metamaterial. Nonlinear optical Kerr effect bends this spacetime resulting in effective gravitational force between extraordinary photons.
