5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E
5|$|Major {{developments}} in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest's {{translation of the}} Mabinogion, {{one of the most}} important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology, into English. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century experienced an important shift away from the stilted and long-winded Victorian Welsh prose, with Thomas Gwynn Jones leading the way with his 1902 work Ymadawiad Arthur. The slaughter in the trenches of the First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style of prose championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.|$|E

25|$|Later in the Victorian period, the Regency {{seemed to}} retreat to an unthreateningly remote {{historical}} distance, and Kate Greenaway and the Artistic Dress movement selectively revived elements of early 19th century fashions.

25|$|Kothi Khas Bagh is {{a palace}} located at Rampur, about 30km east of Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. It was the {{erstwhile}} {{residence of the}} Nawabs of Rampur. Set in a 300-acre compound, this huge 200-room European style palace is a unique blend of Islamic architecture and British architecture.

25|$|Constructed {{over one}} hundred years ago, the clock {{on top of the}} main head house is the largest {{operating}} hand-wound clock mechanism in New England. The clock is styled after London's Big Ben, and has a 12-foot wide face. The mechanism weighs over 400 pounds. In 2008, the clock underwent a six-week restoration and repair. The clock mechanism was completely disassembled and transported to a nearby workshop, where replacement pieces had to be fabricated by hand. The clock, once one of many in the city, is a hallmark <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> era—something that commuters rely on to make their trains, and which visitors admire for its historical presence. The stone eagle that sits atop the clock is eight feet wide and weighs over eight tons. The eagle imitates the figurines commonly placed atop classically styled buildings.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} Magyarization {{did not succeed}} in {{imposing}} the Hungarian language as the most used language in all territories in the Kingdom of Hungary. In fact the profoundly multinational character of historic Transylvania was reflected in the fact that during the fifty years of the dual monarchy, the spread of Hungarian as the second language remained limited. In 1880, 5.7% of the non-Hungarian population, or 109,190 people, claimed to have a knowledge of the Hungarian language; the proportion rose to 11% (183,508) in 1900, and to 15.2% (266,863) in 1910. These figures reveal the reality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> era, one in which millions of people could conduct their lives without speaking the state's official language. The policies of Magyarization aimed to have a Hungarian language surname as a requirement for access to basic government services such as local administration, education, and justice.|$|E

Music critic Jim Fusilli writes that Simone's music is still relevant today: [...] "it didn't adhere to ephemeral trends, it isn't a relic <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> era; her vocal delivery and technical skills as a pianist still dazzle; and her emotional performances have a visceral impact.|$|E

500|$|Friedrich's work {{brought him}} renown {{early in his}} career, and contemporaries such as the French {{sculptor}} David d'Angers (1788–1856) spoke {{of him as a}} man who had discovered [...] "the tragedy of landscape". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity, and {{in the words of the}} art historian Philip B. Miller, [...] "half mad". As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bygone</b> age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his paintings and sculptures in Berlin. By the 1920s his paintings had been discovered by the Expressionists, and in the 1930s and early 1940s Surrealists and Existentialists frequently drew ideas from his work. The rise of Nazism in the early 1930s again saw a resurgence in Friedrich's popularity, but this was followed by a sharp decline as his paintings were, by association with the Nazi movement, interpreted as having a nationalistic aspect. It was not until the late 1970s that Friedrich regained his reputation as an icon of the German Romantic movement and a painter of international importance.|$|E

Four of the songs performed by Aguilera are cover versions, two of Etta James' works: [...] "Something's Got a Hold on Me" [...] and [...] "Tough Lover", a cover version of Marlene Dietrich's [...] "Guy What Takes His Time", and a dance version of [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] by Marilyn Manson, including the [...] "unmistakable" [...] drum beats and guitar riff in the original version.
