5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> philosophy.

Some believe the Big Bang implies a creator, and some see its mention in their holy books, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2001 {{report from}} The World Factbook by CIA, about 47% of Nigeria's {{population}} is Muslim, 43% are Christians and 10% adhere to local religions. But in some recent report, the Christian population is now sightly {{larger than the}} Muslim population. An 18 December 2012 report <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> public life by the Pew Research Center stated that in 2010, 49.3percent of Nigeria's population was Christian, 48.8percent was Muslim, and 1.9percent were followers of indigenous and other religions, or unaffiliated. Additionally, the 2010s census of Association of Religion Data Archives has reported that 46.5percent {{of the total population}} is Christian, slightly bigger than the Muslim population of 45.5percent, and that 7.7percent are members of other religious groups.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, a New Year's Eve benefit {{event was}} held for the Council <b>on</b> <b>Religion</b> <b>and</b> the Homosexual. Police stood outside with large floodlights, and {{in an effort to}} intimidate took {{photographs}} of anyone entering the building. Later, several officers demanded that they be allowed inside. Three lawyers explained to them that under California law, the event was a private party and they could not enter unless they bought tickets. The lawyers were then arrested. Several ministers who were in attendance held a press conference the next morning, likening the SFPD to the Gestapo. Even the Catholic archbishop strongly condemned the actions of the police. In an attempt to reduce such harassment two officers were tasked with improving the police department's relationship with the gay community.|$|E
5|$|Like much of Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli remains {{prone to}} {{communal}} tensions based <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> ethnicity. There have been occasional outbreaks {{of violence against}} Sri Lankans. In 2009, the offices of a Sri Lankan airline were attacked in the city. In September 2012, two groups of Sri Lankan pilgrims who had visited the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Velankanni and the Poondi Madha Basilica had their buses attacked in Tiruchirappalli {{by a group of}} Tamil activists. Owing to a series of terrorist attacks in Indian cities since 2000, security has been increased at sites such as Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple.|$|E
5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there were 1,800 Jews in Albania {{at the end of}} the Second World War, eleven times the number of Jews that were living in the country in 1939. The Jewish community in Kosovo never fully recovered from the war. Few Jews remained in Kosovo and many emigrated to Israel during the communist period. Similarly, most Jews in Albania decided to emigrate following the communist takeover. About 300 remained in the country until the early 1990s. The official Albanian census of April 1989 recorded 73 Jews living in the country. With the fall of Communism, Albania eased restrictions <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> foreign travel, which resulted in virtually the entire Jewish community of the country emigrating to Israel. From December 1990 to June 1991, 350 Albanian Jews were airlifted from Albania to Israel in what was codenamed Operation Flying Carpet. Most of Albania's 60 remaining Jews left in 1997, after the country became engulfed in a brief civil war.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Thi led {{a revolt}} against Diệm after {{lobbying}} by his Airborne Division deputy commander, Lieutenant Colonel Vương Văn Đông. Đông had become discontented with Diệm's arbitrary rule and constant meddling in military affairs. Diệm, who promoted officers <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> loyalty, rather than skill, gave orders directly to individual commanders, and played senior officers {{against one another}} in order to weaken the military leadership and prevent them from becoming effective, lest they try to challenge his rule. Đông later stated his sole objective was to force Diệm to improve the governance of the country. Đông was clandestinely supported by his brother-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Triệu Hồng, and Hong's uncle, Hoang Co Thuy, members of the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (VNQDĐ, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party), which was an anti-communist political organization whose members had been marginalized by Diệm. The coup was organized {{with the help of}} some VNQDĐ and Đại Việt Quốc Dân Đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam, known as Đại Việt) members, civilians and officers alike. Đông enlisted the cooperation of an armored regiment, a marine unit and three paratrooper battalions. The operation was launched on November 11 at 05:00. The coup was executed ineffectually; although the rebels captured the headquarters of the Joint General Staff at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, they failed to block the roads leading into Saigon and cut off loyalist reinforcements. Thi’s men also failed to disconnect phone lines into the palace, which allowed Diệm to appeal for aid from loyal units. After taking the key military points, the paratroopers headed towards Independence Palace. At first, they did not attack, believing that Diệm would capitulate. Most of Thi's soldiers had been tricked into thinking that they were attacking in order to save Diệm from a Presidential Guard mutiny. When the attack finally started, Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes when gunfire hit his bed, but he had arisen just a few minutes earlier. Despite their numerical advantage, the paratroopers' first assault was repelled by the loyalists. Thi and Dong held fire; they brought in reinforcements and attacked again, but the loyalists held firm. In the meantime, Thi's rebels had captured the national police offices, the studios of Radio Saigon and the Presidential Guard barracks. They had also put most of the Saigon-based generals under house arrest.|$|E
