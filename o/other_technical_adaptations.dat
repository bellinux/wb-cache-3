40|$|In this {{proof-of-concept}} {{study we}} focus on linking large scale climate and permafrost simulations to small scale engineering projects by bridging the gap between climate and permafrost sciences {{on the one hand}} and on the <b>other</b> <b>technical</b> recommendation for <b>adaptation</b> of planned infrastructures to climate change in a region generally underlain by permafrost. We present the current and future state of permafrost in Greenland as modelled numerically with the GIPL model driven by HIRHAM climate projections up to 2080. We develop a concept called Permafrost Thaw Potential (PTP), defined as the potential active layer increase due to climate warming and surface alterations. PTP is then used in a simple risk assessment procedure useful for engineering applications. The modelling shows that climate warming will result in continuing wide-spread permafrost warming and degradation in Greenland, in agreement with present observations. We provide examples of application of the risk zone assessment approach for the two towns of Sisimiut and Ilulissat, both classified with high PTP...|$|R

50|$|CFL was {{expected}} to provide from December 2014 an hourly connection between Trier and Luxembourg (RE 11) with Stadler KISS multiple units, connecting in Trier with the services to/from Koblenz.

50|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>adaptations</b> {{enabled the}} {{production}} of this engine in many displacements in single and dual carburettor forms, later with fuel injection, with or without turbo. The Cléon-Fonte was coupled initially to four-speed manual transmissions, and then later five speed and automatic gearboxes according to its applications and the natural progress of the automotive industry.|$|R
30|$|An {{important}} consideration is that various authors have forcefully argued that retrenchment measures {{are more likely}} to occur through less visible administrative or <b>technical</b> <b>adaptations,</b> or even through non-intervention, in order to raise less resistance (Pierson 1996). In the context of MIP, this may occur through non-interventions such as skipping indexation, or small, technical changes such as tinkering with eligibility parameters.|$|R

50|$|In her {{review of}} this seminal show, Dorothy Adlow, {{wrote in the}} Christian Science Monitor: “Kahlil Gibran, who like Mr.David Aronson is 24 years old, paints a Pietà in oil with {{remarkable}} <b>technical</b> <b>adaptation</b> of pigment". And later, when the Pietà was exhibited in a March, 1948 Artists’ Equity show, this critic heralded it as “one of the more distinguished pictures painted in Boston in recent years".|$|R
