40|$|Artemisinin is an {{antimalarial}} sesquiterpene lactone {{that contains}} a 1, 2, 4 -trioxane heterocycle. Dihydroartemisinin and artesunate demonstrated activity against Echinococcus multilocularis metacestodes in vitro but were not effective in a mouse model. In this study, the in vitro effects of a small library of synthetic <b>ozonides</b> (1, 2, 4 -trioxolanes) were investigated. Initial compound screening against E. multilocularis metacestodes was performed at 20 μM, and selected <b>ozonides</b> were further assessed in dose-response studies in metacestode cultures and mammalian cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to characterise compound-induced structural alterations. At 20 μM, the most potent <b>ozonides</b> (OZ 401, OZ 455, OZ 491 and OZ 494) led to death of ca. 60 - 100 % of the parasites. Subsequent dose-response experiments demonstrated that OZ 401, OZ 455 and OZ 491, which contain an aminopropylether substructure, were the most potent, with 50 % inhibitory concentrations ranging from 11 μM to 14 μM. Cytotoxicity for these three <b>ozonides,</b> assessed in human foreskin fibroblasts, rat hepatoma cells and green monkey epithelial kidney (Vero) cells, was evident only at high concentrations. TEM demonstrated that OZ 401 and OZ 491 treatment induced considerable metabolic impairment in metacestodes at 1 day post exposure. At Day 3 post exposure, the germinal layer was severely distorted, although some intact cells were still visible, demonstrating that not all cell types in the parasite tissue were equally affected.
