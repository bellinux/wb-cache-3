5|$|Cadw {{carried out}} a major {{restoration}} project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attic,</b> which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, to prevent it appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{the south}} range {{includes}} three 16th- or early-17th-century stone fireplaces that {{have probably been}} reused from the earlier house. The north room <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attic</b> floor and principal room {{on the first floor}} include 16th- or early-17th-century timber panelling. The room over the entrance hall features late-17th-century panelling. Two period staircases feature; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries. The windows in the entrance hall and north room of the east range include armorial stained glass windows dated 1567, 1567 and 1575. The stairwell includes windows with 17th-century German stained glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other, undated stained glass.|$|E

They are divided into two lines of ten ranks – the same number as that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attic</b> tribes. All figures are beardless youths {{with the exception of}} two, W8 and W15, who along with S2–7 wear Thracian dress of fur cap, a patterned cloak, and high boots; these have been identified by Martin Robertson as hipparchs. Next are the four-horse chariots, each with charioteer and armed passenger, there are ten on the south frieze and eleven on the north. Since these passengers are sometimes depicted as dismounting they may be taken to represent the apobatai, participants in the ceremonial race found in Attica and Boeotia.|$|E

40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory studied 8 {{homes in}} the mixed-humid climate, 4 with vented attics and 4 with sealed attics. ORNL wanted to {{understand}} <b>the</b> moisture performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sealed <b>attic</b> and how it affected the interior environment. We found that <b>the</b> <b>attic</b> and interior <b>of</b> sealed attic homes were more humid than <b>the</b> <b>attic</b> and interior observed in vented attic homes. This is due to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> ventilation in <b>the</b> sealed <b>attic.</b> Historically attics have been vented to dehumidify <b>the</b> <b>attic</b> and interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home. A sealed attic design greatly reduces the venting potential and thus this drying pathway and can cause elevated interior moisture over a vented <b>attic</b> home. Despite <b>the</b> elevated <b>attic</b> and interior moisture in <b>the</b> sealed <b>attic</b> homes, so far no mold or material degradation has been found. The roof sheathing moisture content has stayed below 20 %, indicating low potential for material degradation. Also the relative humidity at the roof sheathing has stayed within the ASHRAE 160 design criteria except {{for a short time}} during the 2011 / 2012 winter. This was due to a combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sealed <b>attic</b> design (minimal venting to the outside) and the duct work not being operated in <b>the</b> <b>attic</b> which usually provides a dehumidification pathway. It was also found that when the humidity was controlled using the HVAC system, it resulted in 7 % more cooling energy consumption. In the mixed-humid climate this reduces <b>the</b> cost effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sealed <b>attic</b> design as a solution for bringing ducts into a semi-conditioned space. Because of this we are recommending the other alternatives be used to bringing ducts into the conditioned space in both new construction and retrofit work in the mixed-humid climate...|$|R

In particular, the market analysis (size, cost, time of sale, etc.) shows the comparison among different geographical areas (regions, provinces, city centres, etc.); 2. Search for innovative design solutions and analysis of best practices; 3. Investment convenience in lofts and attics refurbishment compared to other types of investment in urban regeneration projects. For this purpose, about 200 designers working on the entire national territory and some major players in the Italian Real Estate market were interviewed. The research tries to raise operator's awareness in order to limit the land consumption, to improve existing buildings, to revitalize cities and the historical centres...|$|R

40|$|A two-dimensional, {{steady-state}} finite-element {{model was}} developed to simulate <b>the</b> thermal effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> an <b>attic</b> radiant barrier system (ARBS) inside a ventilated residential <b>attic.</b> <b>The</b> <b>attic</b> is ventilated using the exhaust air from an evaporative cooler.

She became so conceited of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of Athena herself. Athena gave Arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning Arachne not to offend the deities. Arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest, so she could prove her skill.|$|E
