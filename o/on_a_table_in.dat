5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus {{seems to be}} on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event. Fans {{interact}} with the film {{in a similar fashion}} to The Rocky Horror Picture Show; audience members dress up as their favorite characters, throw plastic spoons in reference to an unexplained framed photo of a spoon <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> Johnny's living room, toss footballs to each other from short distances, and yell insulting comments {{about the quality of the}} film as well as lines from the film itself. Wiseau has claimed that it was his intent for audiences to find humor in the film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have viewed it as a poorly-made drama.|$|E
5|$|Two other swords are used. The two-handed Sword of State, made in 1678, symbolises the monarch's royal authority. It is {{also carried}} before the monarch at State Openings of Parliament. Its wooden sheath is bound in crimson velvet {{decorated}} with silver-gilt emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, fleurs-de-lis and portcullises. In the centre is the royal badge of joint-sovereigns WilliamIII and MaryII, for whose coronation the sheath {{was made in}} 1689. The lion of England and unicorn of Scotland form the cross-piece to the sword's handle. At coronations, a peer gives the Sword of State to the Lord Great Chamberlain who places it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> StEdward's Chapel.|$|E

The initial line of Imus's speech was considered a direct reference to Hillary Clinton, {{who was at the}} time involved in a specific aspect of the Whitewater scandal concerning billing records that were discovered just a few weeks before <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the resident section of The White House.|$|E
25|$|The ICC T20 Championship is an {{international}} Twenty20 cricket competition run by the International Cricket Council. The competition is notional {{in that it is}} simply a ranking scheme overlaid on the regular T20I match schedule. After every T20I match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team's points total is divided {{by the total number of}} matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> order of rating.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} doors {{open to reveal}} the private apartments of Harrison Hightower, the idol sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the center. Hightower, under a ghostly form, glowing blue, appears beside it and reaches out to touch it. The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, blasting him backwards past open {{elevator doors}} {{at the opposite end}} of the apartments, where Hightower falls down the shaft, which then fades away, replaced by a star field. The idol turns toward the guests' elevator and laughs before the doors close.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} Test and ODI Rankings, the ICC T20I Team Rankings are an {{international}} Twenty20 ranking system {{run by the}} ICC. It is simply a ranking scheme overlaid on the regular T20I match schedule. After every T20I match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team's points total is divided {{by the total number}} of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> order of rating. This ranking does not replace the ICC World Twenty20 competition.|$|E
25|$|Four months later, in November 2014, August was tagged as {{the main}} suspect after the BMW 325i of {{producer}} Chris Clark went missing while on a studio session with Santo. Clark had left the car keys <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the studio, but {{when he went to}} leave, the keys – and August – were gone. August’s refusal to cooperate ended with Clark going to the authorities. A month later, in December 2014, it was announced by August, via his Twitter account, that he’d been removed from Mindless Behavior.|$|E
25|$|The ICC ODI Team Rankings were created, and are run, by the ICC {{for reasons}} {{similar to the}} Test Rankings. The rankings are simply an {{international}} ranking scheme overlaid on the regular ODI (One Day International) match schedule. After every ODI match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team's points total is divided {{by the total number}} of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> order of rating. The ranking does not replace the World Cup; the latter still carries much more significance to most cricket fans.|$|E
50|$|Jack Arnold {{was born}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> kitchen <b>table</b> <b>in</b> New Haven, Connecticut, to Russian {{immigrant}} parents. As a child he {{read a lot}} of science fiction, which laid the foundations for his genre films of the 1950s.|$|R

60|$|There was a {{knock at}} the door. Burton, with a word of excuse, crossed the room to open it. The postman stood there with a packet. It was his novel {{returned}} once more. He threw it <b>on</b> to <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the corner and returned to his place.|$|R
25|$|The Bible remains {{central to}} most Liberal Friends' worship, {{and almost all}} {{meetings}} make it available in the meeting house, (often <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> {{the centre of the}} room), which attendees may read privately or publicly during worship. However, Liberal Friends, decided that the Scriptures should give way to God's leading, if God leads {{them in a way that}} is contrary to the Bible. Many Friends are also influenced by liberal Christian theologians, and modern Biblical criticism. They often adopt non-propositional Biblical hermeneutics, such as believing that the Bible is an anthology of human authors' beliefs and feelings about God, rather than Holy Writ, and that multiple interpretations of the Scriptures are acceptable.|$|E
25|$|Under the 1830 Act any householder {{who paid}} rates could apply, with a one-off payment of two guineas (roughly equal in value to £ today), to sell beer or cider {{in his home}} (usually the front parlour) and even to brew his own on his premises. The {{permission}} did not extend to the sale of spirits and fortified wines, and any beer house discovered selling those items was closed down and the owner heavily fined. Beer houses were not permitted to open on Sundays. The beer was usually served in jugs or dispensed directly from tapped wooden barrels <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> {{the corner of the}} room. Often profits were so high the owners were able to buy the house next door to live in, turning every room in their former home into bars and lounges for customers.|$|E
25|$|Later {{attempts}} at discovering whether Lucas had actually killed anyone apart from Powell and Rich were complicated by Lucas's {{ability to make}} an accurate deduction that seemed to substantiate a confession. In one instance, he explained how he had correctly identified a victim in a group photograph through her wearing spectacles; a pair of glasses were <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> a crime scene photo shown to him earlier. There were also suggestions that the interview tapes showed that, despite Lucas's supposedly low IQ, he had adroitly read the reactions of those interviewing him and altered what he was saying, thereby making his confessions more consistent with facts known to law enforcement. The most serious allegation against investigators, that they had let Lucas read case files on unsolved crimes and thus enabled him {{to come up with}} convincingly detailed confessions, made it virtually impossible to determine if, as some continue to suspect, he had been telling the truth to the Lucas Task Force about a relatively large number of the murders.|$|E
60|$|While these uncomfortable {{thoughts}} were presenting themselves to Ralph, Bob Hubbard was standing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rudely-constructed <b>table,</b> <b>in</b> order {{that he might}} keep a watch upon Newcombe and his men, {{and from time to}} time he whispered to his companions of that which he saw.|$|R

50|$|Dr. Rosa Campesino: The Assistant Dade County coroner. Intelligent and determined, but {{burdened}} with a kinky streak that has worried {{some of her}} former lovers (one of whom broke up with her after she convinced him {{to have sex with}} her <b>on</b> <b>an</b> autopsy <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the morgue).|$|R
500|$|On the set, Belushi's {{drug use}} worsened. Fisher, who herself later {{struggled}} with cocaine addiction, says Landis {{told her to}} keep Belushi away from the drug. Wendell was hired to clear any from the places Belushi visited off-camera. Nevertheless, at one point, Landis found Belushi with {{what he described as}} a [...] "mountain" [...] of cocaine <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> his trailer, which led to a tearful confrontation in which Belushi admitted his addiction and feared it could eventually kill him.|$|E
500|$|On August 28, 1826, torrential rains in the White Mountains {{caused a}} {{mudslide}} on Mount Willey. [...] The Willey couple, with their five children, {{lived in a}} small house in the notch between Mounts Willey and Webster. [...] They evacuated their home with the help of two hired men to escape the landslide, but all seven Willeys and the two hired men died in the avalanche. [...] The Willey home was left standing. [...] Rescuers later found an open Bible <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the home, indicating that the family retreated in haste.|$|E
500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, I just thought {{it would be nice to}} have an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown at the end of the episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E
50|$|Dan {{received}} his master's degree from MIT, {{where he was}} a member of the Tangible Media Group at the MIT Media Lab under the direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii from 2001-2003.

50|$|He {{resigned}} {{from his job}} at the aerospace laboratory to concentrate on refining the device. Spira thence went on to conduct experiments <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ping-pong <b>table</b> <b>in</b> his Riverside Drive apartment in New York City, which led to a device capable of dimming the lighting in a home or office setting.|$|R

500|$|Philip C. H. Primrose died on March 17, 1937, in Edmonton, {{while still}} occupying {{the office of}} Lieutenant Governor, a post he had held for only 167 days. He was the first Lieutenant Governor of Alberta to die in office. He had {{suffered}} a heart attack, with pre-existing complications from a long, undisclosed illness. On March 19, 1937, he lay in state for two hours in the main chamber of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in what was described {{as one of the}} [...] "most impressive ceremonies ever beheld in Edmonton." [...] His coffin, draped with the Union Flag lay <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the chamber in front of the speaker's rostrum, guarded by four Royal Canadian Mounted Police constables; members' desks were draped in purple velvet. At his request, Primrose was dressed in the uniform of a NWMP Inspector.|$|E
500|$|Travelling with Irwin was Ensign Robert Dale, who {{had somehow}} {{acquired}} Yagan's head. According to the historian Paul Turnbull, Dale {{appears to have}} persuaded Irwin to let him have the head as an [...] "anthropological curiosity". After arriving in London, Dale tried to sell the head to scientists, approaching a number of anatomists and phrenologists. His price of ₤20 failed to find a buyer, so he made an agreement with Thomas Pettigrew for the exclusive use of the head for 18 months. Pettigrew, a surgeon and antiquarian, was {{well known in the}} London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and autopsied Egyptian mummies. He displayed the head <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> front of a panoramic view of King George Sound reproduced from Dale's sketches. For effect, the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the red-tailed black cockatoo.|$|E
500|$|The Nintendo DSi XL {{features}} larger screens, and {{a greater}} overall size, than the original DSi. It is the fourth DS model, {{the first to be}} available as a pure size variation. Iwata said that cost restraints had, until then, limited the screen size and multiplayer aspects of portable game consoles, and that the DSi XL offers [...] "an improved view angle on the screens", which makes it the first [...] "portable system that can be enjoyed with people surrounding the gamer." [...] He argued that this introduces a new method of playing portable video games, wherein those [...] "surrounding the game player can also join in {{one way or the other}} to the gameplay." [...] While the original DSi was specifically designed for individual use, Iwata suggested that DSi XL buyers give the console a [...] "steady place <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the living room," [...] so that it might be shared by multiple household members.|$|E
50|$|Congrega {{public square}} {{is named after}} the Congrega little church. The public {{documents}} which form part of the civil marriage ceremony are completed <b>in</b> public <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stone <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the square. It is not known when this tradition began. The table is made from a 20 cm-thick slab supported by two stone pillars.|$|R
