40|$|Publisher's version {{accessible}} on [URL] the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EHM) {{has been}} widely accepted as robust by many researchers {{in the field of}} capital markets, the hypothesisâ€™ robustness has been under increased scrutiny and question of late. In the light of the concerns over the robustness of the EMH, the weak form efficiency of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) is tested. Stock returns used in the analysis were controlled for thin trading and it was discovered that once returns are controlled for thin trading, they are independent of each other across time. Theory proposes that if markets are efficient then professional investment management is of little value if any; hence the position of professional investment managers in efficient markets is investigated. Although the ZSE is found to be efficient, at least in the weak form, it is argued that achieving efficiency does not necessarily make the investment managerâ€™s role <b>obsolete.</b> <b>Investment</b> managers are needed even when the market can be proved to be efficient...|$|E
40|$|For years, {{the world}} has enjoyed the luxury of {{inexpensive}} transport fuels, resulting in the continuous expansion of transport demand and vast improvements in mobility levels. The threat of peak oil and other environmental concerns, however, are forcing a paradigm shift in terms of transport planning. In recent times, many developed nations have been investigating alternative ways and means of weaning themselves off oil as the main transport energy source and managing transport energy demand. South Africa is a developing nation that, in terms of transportation technology and policy, lags behind developed countries. This presents South Africa {{with the opportunity to}} learn from other countries' triumphs and mistakes and to skip over <b>obsolete</b> <b>investment</b> patterns and ineffective policy. It needs to be determined what South Africa can do to bend the stream of continuously growing transport (energy) demand, without hampering growth in mobility. Solutions can potentially be found by looking at the European Union's past and present situation and responses. This paper summarises various European energy management transport policies. These policies are translated into a South African context [...] pros, cons and implementation viability are identified. Transport energy efficiency measures South Africa Transport policy...|$|E
40|$|While the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EHM) {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} as robust by many researchers {{in the field of}} capital markets, the hypothesis’ robustness has been under increased scrutiny and question lately. In the light of the concerns over the robustness of the EMH, the weak form efficiency of the JSE is tested. Stock returns used in the analysis were controlled for thin trading and it was discovered that once returns are controlled for thin trading, they are independent of each other across time. Some of the previous studies found the JSE to be inefficient in the weak form but this research found that the JSE is efficient in the weak form. A comparison is also made between the JSE and four other African stock markets and the JSE is found to be more efficient than the other markets. The developments on the JSE, which have improved information dissemination as well as the efficiency of trading, contributed to the improvement of the JSE’s efficiency. The improvement in operational efficiency and turnover from the late 1990 s has also made a major contribution to the improvement in the weak form efficiency of the JSE. Theory proposes that if markets are efficient then professional investment management is of little value if any; hence the position of professional investment managers in efficient markets is investigated. Although the JSE is found to be efficient, at least in the weak form, it is argued that achieving efficiency does not necessarily make the investment manager’s role <b>obsolete.</b> <b>Investment</b> managers are needed even when the market can be proved to be efficient...|$|E
40|$|As firms grow older, their {{profitability}} {{seems to}} decline. We first document this phenomenon {{and show that}} it is very robust. Then we offer two non-exclusive explanations of why firms may age. First, corporate aging could reflect a cementation of organizational rigidities over time. Consistent with that, costs rise, growth slows, assets become <b>obsolete,</b> and <b>investment</b> and R&D activities decline. Second, older age could advance the diffusion of rent-seeking behavior inside the firm. This hypothesis is supported by the poorer governance, larger boards, and higher CEO pay we observe in older firms. Overall, firms seem to face a real senescence problem...|$|R
2500|$|According to the report, GM {{viewed the}} PrEView {{program as a}} failure, {{evidence}} that the electric car was not yet viable, and that the CARB regulations should be withdrawn. Dennis Minano, GM's Vice President for Energy and Environment, questioned whether consumers desired electric vehicles. Robert James Eaton, chairman of Chrysler, also questioned whether the market was ready for electric cars, and said, [...] "... if the law is there, we'll meet it... at this point of time, nobody can forecast {{that we can make}} [...]" [...] The negative positions taken by the automakers was criticized by Thomas C. Jorling, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation for New York State, which had adopted the California emission program. According to Jorling, consumers had demonstrated tremendous interest in electric cars, but automakers did not want to render <b>obsolete</b> their multibillion-dollar <b>investments</b> in internal combustion engine technology.|$|R
40|$|The {{spare part}} {{management}} function is critical from an operational perspective especially in asset intensive {{industries such as}} refineries, chemical plants, paper mills, automotive manufacturing, and oil mills. Given the determinants like demand, unpredictability, part substitution, and tight control on spare parts inventory coupled with high service level expectations; the exigency of spare parts management in manufacturing operations cannot be underrated. In most organizations, a constant scrimmage persists over the stocking, ordering, and maintaining of products required by maintenance and operations. The Materials Management and Purchasing functions are often vied against Maintenance, Facilities, Engineering, and Operations with respect to; the number and types of stock keeping units, capital and critical spares, <b>obsolete</b> inventory, inventory <b>investment,</b> and turnover and program operation. This paper evaluates best practices in the Maintenance Repairs & Overhauls, discusses the ABC classification scheme, and elaborates {{on the role of}} maintenance storeroom as service provider...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} economic {{models of}} child development that {{capture the essence of}} recent findings from the empirical literature on skill formation. The goal of this essay is to provide a theoretical framework for interpreting the evidence from a vast empirical literature, for guiding the next generation of empirical studies, and for formulating policy. Central to our analysis is the concept that childhood has more than one stage. We formalize the concepts of self-productivity and complementarity of human capital investments and use them to explain the evidence on skill formation. Together, they explain why skill begets skill through a multiplier process. Skill formation is a life cycle process. It starts in the womb and goes on throughout life. Families play a role in this process that is far more important than the role of schools. There are multiple skills and multiple abilities that are important for adult success. Abilities are both inherited and created, and the traditional debate about nature versus nurture is scientifically <b>obsolete.</b> Human capital <b>investment</b> exhibits both self-productivity and complementarity. Skill attainment at one stage of the life cycle raises skill attainment at later stages of the life cycle (self-productivity). Early investment facilitates the productivity of later investment (complementarity). Early investments are not productive if they are not followed up by later investments (another aspect of complementarity). This complementarity explains why there is no equity-efficiency trade-off for early investment. The returns to investing early in the life cycle are high. Remediation of inadequate early investments is difficult and very costly as a consequence of both self-productivity and complementarity. skill formation, education, government policy, educational finance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{possibilities of}} developing new tools for architectural design. It argues that architects should {{meet the challenge}} of information technology and computer-based design techniques. One such attempt has been {{the first phase of the}} development of an architectural design information system (ADIS), also an architectural design decision support system. The system should benefit from the developments of the artificial intelligence to enable the architect to have access to information required to carry out design work. In other words: the system functions as a huge on-line electronic library of architecture, containing up-to-date architectural design information, literature, documents, etc. At the same time, the system offers necessary design aids such as computer programs for design process, drawing programs, evaluation programs, cost calculation programs, etc. The system also provides data communication between the architect and members of the design coalition team. This is found to be of vital importance in the architectural design process, because it can enable the architect to fit in changes, brought about in the project by different parties. Furthermore, they will be able, to oversee promptly the consequences of changes or decisions in a comprehensive manner. The system will offer advantages over the more commonly applied microcomputer based CAAD and IGDM (integrated graphics database management) systems, or even larger systems available to an architect. Computer programs as well as hardware change rapidly and become <b>obsolete.</b> Therefore, unrelenting <b>investment</b> pressure to up-date both software and hardware exists. The financial burden of this is heavy, in particular for smaller architectural practices (for instance an architect working for himself or herself and usually with few or no permanent staff). ADIS, as an on-line architectural design aid, is constantly up-dated by its own organisation. This task will be co-ordinated by the ADIS data- base administrator (DBA). The processing possibilities of the system are faster, therefore more complex processing tasks can be handled. Complicated large graphic data files, can be easily retrieved and manipulated by ADIS, a large system. In addition, the cost of an on-line system will be much less than any other system. The system is based on one model of the architectural design process, but will eventually contain a variety of design models, as it develops. The development of the system will be an evolutionary process, making use of its users'feed-back system. ADIS is seen as a step towards full automation of architectural design practices. Apart from being an architectural design support system, ADIS will assist the architect in his/her administrative and organisational activities...|$|R
