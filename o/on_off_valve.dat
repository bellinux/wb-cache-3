40|$|An adjust ejector was {{designed}} based on classical gas dynamical function method in single phase dual temperature ejector refrigeration system. Further more ejector optimal dimension influenced by mass flow distribution ratio, {{high and low}} evaporating temperature was also analyzed in this paper. The velocity field and pressure field of the adjustable ejector was simulated by CFD software. Moreover, the simulated ejector ratio agreed with experimental ejector ratio well. The effect of primary flow pressure, suction flow pressure and out flow pressure on ejector ratio was investigated through using CFD software. Finally the experimental comparison result indicated that the single phase dual temperature ejector system expressed superior performance than <b>on</b> <b>off</b> <b>valve</b> dual temperature system. The maximal cooling capacity and EER elevation was close to 12. 9 % and 9. 5 % respectively as high and low temperature evaporating temperature difference reached 16 ℃, {{this means that the}} single phase dual temperature ejector system was suitable for larger temperature difference situation such as freezing and cooling storage area...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, the Design of Decision {{support system}} for the Automation of Drip {{irrigation}} is presented. Generally the Drip irrigation was named in Israel in 1959. In the conventional drip irrigation system, the farmer has to keep watch on irrigation timetable, which is different for different crops. In Automatic microcontroller based drip irrigation system irrigation will take place only when there will be intense requirement of water. Irrigation system uses valves to turn irrigation <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF.</b> These <b>valves</b> may be easily automated by using controllers and solenoids. The developed irrigation method removes the need for workmanship for flooding irrigation as well as drip irrigation. In this presented Decision Support system I have used linear programming concept. Linear Programming helps us to distribute available water {{to the number of}} crops in order to get maximum profit with minimum cost. Also linear Programming helps us to do proper management of available water. Finally it helps to increase productivity and ultimately profi...|$|R

40|$|This project {{developed}} the inlet metering system. An inlet metering system represents a new option in hydraulic pump design. Traditional pressure controlled hydraulic pumps rely on either swashplate displacement (for variable displacement pumps) or bleed <b>off</b> <b>valves</b> (for fixed displacement pumps). Variable displacement pumps require mechanically complex parts which are expensive to machine {{and prone to}} break down. Bleed <b>off</b> <b>valves</b> represent a significant loss in system efficiency. In contrast, the inlet metering system is able {{to make use of}} a fixed displacement pump (which is relatively inexpensive and mechanically robust) and a two-way spool valve. This dissertation goes through the process of designing the valve and pump dimensions, presents a theoretical dynamic analysis, studies the control law associated with this pump, and examines the energy requirements associated with inlet metering system operation. A prototype of the design was constructed and experimental data was used to validate the efficiency analysis. The major finding associated with this work was that the inlet metering system can be designed to display a first order pressure response. This means that when the inlet metering system is operated, the actual pressure in the system will never exceed the desired pressure. In contrast, traditional hydraulic systems will display up to 60 % pressure overshoot, meaning the systems must be designed to handle pressures significantly greater than operating pressures. Additionally {{it was found that the}} inlet metering system is more efficient than using a bleed <b>off</b> <b>valve,</b> but less efficient than using a variable displacement pump...|$|R

25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow <b>off</b> <b>valve).</b> Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|R
