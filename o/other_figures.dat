5|$|As a formulaic kart racer, Chocobo Racing {{is often}} {{compared}} to Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing. The game's star and namesake is the Chocobo, the mascot of the Final Fantasy series. <b>Other</b> <b>figures</b> {{from the game}} series, such as Mog the Moogle, the Black Mage, and Cid, fill out the all-Final Fantasy cast. Most of the game's soundtrack is composed using tunes from previous Final Fantasy titles.|$|E

After they met, Poland, Polish topics, Polish names, and Polish (Slavic) mysticism {{began to appear}} much more frequently in his works, as exemplified by such characters as Hoene Wroński, Grabianka and General Chodkiewicz.|$|E
5|$|Isa was demoted in 1987, because Abu Nidal {{believed}} he had become too close to <b>other</b> <b>figures</b> within the ANO. Always keen to punish members by humiliating them, Abu Nidal insisted he remain in the Intelligence Directorate, forcing him to work for his previous subordinates, who according to Seale were told to treat him with contempt.|$|E

5|$|The {{walls of}} one of the private {{chambers}} on the upper floor were covered with 16th century limewash which was removed in 1995, to expose a 13th-century wall painting with a depiction of Jesus on the cross and two <b>other</b> <b>figures.</b> The crucifixion scene with rosettes and vine leaf decoration was uncovered in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Their {{painting}} demonstrates, {{more than}} any <b>other</b> <b>figures</b> on the ceiling, Michelangelo's mastery of anatomy and foreshortening and his enormous powers of invention. In their reflection of classical antiquity they resonate with Pope Julius' aspirations to lead Italy towards a new 'age of gold'; at the same time, they staked Michelangelo's claim to greatness. However, a number of critics were angered by their presence and nudity, including Pope Adrian VI who wanted the ceiling stripped.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{puts the}} Alamanni force at around 35,000. This is {{consistent}} with two <b>other</b> <b>figures</b> he gives for Alamannic armies elsewhere in his history: an army of 40,000 in 378; and in 366 an army divided in three, with one division 10,000 strong. Nevertheless, several historians regard Ammianus' figure as unrealistically high. It has been recently suggested that in reality the Alamanni at Strasbourg may have been only about 15,000, {{much the same as}} the Romans. This calculation {{is based on the assumption}} that the average reported size of Alamanni raiding-bands (800 men) represented the maximum manpower of a pagus. For various reasons, the midpoint figure between these two extremes (about 25,000 men) appears the most likely scenario.|$|E
5|$|As {{he tries}} to {{investigate}} further, Quatermass finds that <b>other</b> <b>figures</b> in high levels of government have gained 'the mark' after coming across meteorites. Quatermass leaves the inquiry, then returns with Fowler to find that Broadhead has been 'marked' and now claims {{there is no problem}} with the project. Fowler takes Quatermass to meet with civil servant Rupert Ward, who has the authority to inspect the plant. Back at the Rocket Group, Leo and Paula deduce and discover with a radio telescope that an asteroid is orbiting the Earth invisibly and discharging the meteorites when it reaches the near point, 400 000 miles over Southern England every 14 hours.|$|E

5|$|By 1921, Tzara {{had become}} {{involved}} in conflicts with <b>other</b> <b>figures</b> in the movement, whom he claimed had parted {{with the spirit of}} Dada. He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with Raoul Hausmann over leadership status. According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself. The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{replaced}} the prefect of Rome with his consular colleague Bassus. Most officials {{who had served}} under Carinus, however, retained their offices under Diocletian. In an act of clementia denoted by the epitomator Aurelius Victor as unusual, Diocletian did not kill or depose Carinus' traitorous praetorian prefect and consul Ti. Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus, but confirmed him in both roles. He later gave him the proconsulate of Africa and the post of urban prefect for 295. The <b>other</b> <b>figures</b> who retained their offices might have also betrayed Carinus.|$|E
5|$|He used {{friends as}} models, {{most notably the}} painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who {{modelled}} for {{the figure in the}} foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of the}} mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two <b>other</b> <b>figures.</b>|$|E

5|$|Notable {{figures in}} the center of the painting, to the left of Małachowski, include other {{supporters}} of the Constitution. Priest Hugo Kołłątaj (11) is the most prominent, gesturing in disdain at Suchorzewski. Several <b>other</b> <b>figures</b> in the vicinity are described in sources, but their precise location is unclear, or the sources contradict one another. The priest holding the Bible (12) is probably Feliks Turski, although some identify him as Tymoteusz Gorzeński. The figures to the right of Kołłątaj represents the Grand Lithuanian Marshal, Ignacy Potocki (13), and perhaps Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski (14) (although some sources identify Czartoryski elsewhere in the painting, in the vicinity of Kościuszko). Surrounding Kołłątaj are likely the priest Scipione Piattoli (15) and Tadeusz Matuszewicz or Matusiewicz (16).|$|E

Rowling later explained her position in more detail, saying that although she opposed most of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions she did not think the cultural boycott would bring about the removal of Israel's leader or help improve the situation in Israel and Palestine.|$|E
