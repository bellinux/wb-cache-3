40|$|Plasmons in {{metallic}} nanomaterials exhibit {{very strong}} {{size and shape}} effects, and thus have recently gained considerable attention in nanotechnology, information technology, and life science. In this review, we overview the fundamental properties of plasmons in materials with various dimensionalities and discuss the optical functional properties of localized plasmon polaritons in nanometer-scale to atomic-scale objects. First, the pioneering works on plasmons by electron energy loss spectroscopy are briefly surveyed. Then, we discuss the effects of atomistic charge dynamics on the dispersion relation of propagating plasmon modes, such as those for planar crystal surface, atomic sheets and straight atomic wires. Finally, standing-wave plasmons, <b>or</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>resonances</b> of plasmon polariton, of some widely used nanometer-scale structures and atomic-scale wires (the smallest possible plasmonic building blocks) are exemplified along with their applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{feasibility}} of using near-hermetic organic materials for microwave and millimeter-wave packaging is investigated. The effects of moisture on both passive and active components on/inside the nonhermetic materials are tested. Microstrip patch antennas on three low moisture absorption substrates (0. 1 % or less) {{are subjected to}} immersion tests until saturated and the corresponding measured frequency shifts {{are found to be}} less than 0. 25 % for two of the three materials tested. The recovery time from saturation to normal operation is found to occur from natural evaporation at room temperature in 10 min or less. One of the three materials, a promising organic laminate material called liquid crystal polymer (LCP), showed no measurable change in weight <b>or</b> in <b>antenna</b> <b>resonance</b> frequency between the ambient (air) state and that after extended submersion in water. In addition, a novel laminated LCP package for a 13 – 25 GHz monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) formed from seven thin layers of laser-machined LCP is subjected to immersion testing. The seal for the embedded chip cavity (formed by the LCP conforming around the feeding transmission lines) is found to be robust for protecting the embedded chip. Standard hermetic materials are suggested to be a potentially unnecessary requirement for reliable, long-lifetime, high-performance RF systems.

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{decay of}} an excited state of an emitter {{placed in the}} vicinity of a metallic single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) was examined theoretically. The emitter-SWNT coupling strongly depends on the position of the emitter relative to the SWNT, the length of the SWNT, the dipole transition frequency and the orientation of the emitter. In the high-frequency regime, dips in the spectrum of the spontaneous decay rate exist at the resonance frequencies in the spectrum of the SWNT conductivity. In the intermediate-frequency regime, the SWNT conductivity is very low, and the spontaneous decay rate is practically unaffected by the SWNT. In the low-frequency regime, the spectrum of the spontaneous decay rate contains <b>resonances</b> at the <b>antennas</b> <b>resonance</b> frequencies for surface-wave propagation in the SWNT. Enhancement of both the total and radiative spontaneous decay rates by several orders in magnitude is predicted at these resonance frequencies. The strong emitter-field coupling is achieved, in spite of the low Q factor of the <b>antenna</b> <b>resonances,</b> due to the very high magnitude of the electromagnetic field in the near-field zone. The vacuum Rabi oscillations {{of the population of the}} excited emitter state are exhibited when the emitter is coupled to an <b>antenna</b> <b>resonance</b> of the SWNT.

40|$|International audienceResonant optical dipole nano-antennas allow giant field {{enhancement}} within nano-gaps. To {{show how}} the energy of external illumination waves is delivered and concentrated in nano-gaps, we build up a model by considering the dynamical launching and multiple scattering processes of surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs) on both antenna arms. The model captures the main feature of the <b>antenna</b> <b>resonance</b> as evidenced by comparison of the model prediction with fully vectorial numerical results and provides an intuitive picture that the energy of external wave is initially transferred into SPP and is then coupled into the nano-gap. The enhanced field in the nano-gap oscillates quasi-periodically {{with the increase of}} the antenna-arm length, and the resonance peaks can be predicted with a phase-matching condition derived from the model, showing that <b>antenna</b> <b>resonance</b> is due to a constructive interference of the multiple-scattered SPPs. Analytical equation for determining the complex resonance wavelength and the quality factor of the resonant modes is obtained. The model however exhibits observable deviation from fully vectorial numerical results for the lowest <b>resonance</b> order (for <b>antenna</b> with the shortest arms), evidencing that, for this case, surface waves other than SPPs contribute to the <b>antenna</b> <b>resonance.</b> The present results are helpful for clarifying the underlying physics for the energy concentration with resonant dipole antennas and may provide recipes for intuitive design of antenna devices, such as those used for optical nonlinearity enhancement and biochemical sensing...|$|R

It is shown that the antenna is equivalent to its radio frequency analogue, the monopole antenna. For the right antenna length and local excitation conditions, <b>antenna</b> <b>resonances</b> occur that lead to an enhanced localized field near the antenna apex. Direct mapping of this field with single fluorescent molecules reveals a spatial localization of 25 nm, demonstrating the importance of such antennas for nanometer resolution optical microscopy. Antennas play an essential role as transmitters and receivers in our modern wireless society. The charge movements they support efficiently link propagating electromagnetic fields to localized fields. Radiation from a distant source can be concentrated in a local volume, vice versa a localized excitation can be efficiently coupled into directed radiation. The efficiency of an antenna depends critically on its resonances, as dictated by the operation frequency and b...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} general theory {{from the first}} {{principles}} to describe the thermal emission from optical antennas in both far- and near-fields. Thermal emission from optical antennas is quasi-monochromatic because of the modulation by <b>antenna</b> <b>resonance</b> modes, and the thermal emission rate has a theoretical limit, which can be achieved when the resonance mode losses are equally distributed to the emitter and the absorber. We then revisit the thermal emission from metal nanorods and propose a new methodology to realize reasonant near-field metamaterials with monochromatic and super-Planckian thermal emission. 2 As a fundamental building block in nanophotonics, optical antenna usually works as a passive device driven by the illumination from lasers, quantum dots, fluorescence molecules, etc [1 – 3]. In the infrared and terahertz regime, thermal agitation in materials provides a possibility to realize thermal-optical antennas that can actively emit infrared photons. In contrast with bulk materials, thermal emission from optical antennas can be monochromatic and coherent, and exceed the radiation limit by the well-known Stefan-Boltzmann law [4 – 6]. This is because <b>antenna</b> <b>resonance</b> modes are thermally excited, and in turn enhance the intrinsic thermal emission of materials at the resonanc...|$|R
