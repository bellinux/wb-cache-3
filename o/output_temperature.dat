25|$|An {{open circuit}} gas turbine cycle has a compressor, a {{combustor}} and a turbine. For gas turbines {{the amount of}} metal that must withstand the high temperatures and pressures is small, and lower quantities of expensive materials can be used. In this type of cycle, the input temperature to the turbine (the firing temperature), is relatively high (900 to 1,400°C). The <b>output</b> <b>temperature</b> of the flue gas is also high (450 to 650°C). This is therefore high enough to provide heat for a second cycle which uses steam as the working fluid (a Rankine cycle).|$|E

50|$|On {{the base}} of this experience, a family of {{derivatives}} engines were proposed. The RD-805 and RD-809 are mostly modifications of the RD-8, but the RD-801 and the RD-810 {{members of the family}} can be considered true descendants of the RD-120.

50|$|While the COP {{is partly}} {{a measure of the}} {{efficiency}} of a heat pump, it is also a measure of the conditions under which it is operating: the COP of a given heat pump will rise as the input temperature increases or the <b>output</b> <b>temperature</b> decreases because it is linked to a warm temperature distribution system like underfloor heating.|$|E
40|$|The element {{efficiency}} of a phased array is {{the ratio of}} the radiated-to-available power of a single element, when only that element is excited.

So, a combined cycle plant has a thermodynamic cycle that operates between the gas-turbine's high firing temperature and the waste heat temperature from the condensers of the steam cycle.

5000|$|A common {{implementation}} in buildings with an HVAC central control computer {{is to allow}} the thermostats to provide a graded level of control. Temperatures in such a system are governed by the central controller's settings, which are typically set by the building maintenance staff or HVAC engineers. The individual thermostats in various offices provide the controller with a temperature reading of the zone (provided the thermocouples are not installed as inline duct sensors), but also serve as modifiers for the central controller's set point. While the thermostat may include settings from, for example, 60 to 90 F, the actual effect of the thermostat is to apply [...] "pressure" [...] to the central controller's set point. Thus, if the controller's setting is 72 F, setting the thermostat to its maximum warm or cool settings will deflect the <b>output</b> <b>temperature,</b> generally by only a few degrees Fahrenheit (about two degrees Celsius) at most. So, although the thermostat can be set to its lowest marking of 60 F, in reality, it may only change the HVAC system's <b>output</b> <b>temperature</b> to 70 F. In this case, the thermostat has a [...] "swing" [...] of 4 °F (2 °C) — it can alter the produced temperature from the main controller's set point by a maximum of 2 °F (1 °C) in either direction. Consequently, while not purely a placebo, the thermostat in this setup does not provide the level of control that is expected, but {{the combination of the}} lower setting number and the feeling of a slight change in temperature can induce the office occupants to believe that the temperature was significantly decreased.|$|E

5000|$|The {{dependence}} of {{net thermal efficiency}} on the electricity infrastructure tends to be an unnecessary complication for consumers and is not applicable to hydroelectric power, so performance of heat pumps is usually expressed as the ratio of heating output or heat removal to electricity input. Cooling performance is typically expressed in units of BTU/hr/watt as the energy efficiency ratio (EER), while heating performance is typically reduced to dimensionless units as the coefficient of performance (COP). The conversion factor is 3.41 BTU/hr/watt. Performance is influenced by all components of the installed system, including the soil conditions, the ground-coupled heat exchanger, the heat pump appliance, and the building distribution, but is largely determined by the [...] "lift" [...] between the input temperature and the <b>output</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tankless {{water heaters}} {{can be further}} divided into two {{categories}} according to their heating capability: [...] "full on/full off" [...] versus [...] "modulated". Full on/full off units {{do not have a}} variable power output level; the unit is either fully on or completely off. This can cause an annoying and possibly hazardous variation of hot water temperature as the flow of water through the heater varies. Modulated tankless water heaters change their heat output in response to the flow rate of water running through the unit. This is usually done by using a flow sensor, a modulating gas valve, an inlet water temperature sensor, and an outlet water temperature sensor-choke valve. A properly configured modulating heater can supply the same <b>output</b> <b>temperature</b> of water at differing water flow rates within their rated capacity, usually maintaining a close range of ±2 °C.|$|E
50|$|While boiling, it {{is useful}} to recover some of the energy used to boil the wort. On its way out of the brewery, the steam created during the boil is passed over a coil through which {{unheated}} water flows. By adjusting the rate of flow, the <b>output</b> <b>temperature</b> of the water can be controlled. This is also often done using a plate heat exchanger. The water is then stored for later use in the next mash, in equipment cleaning, or wherever necessary. Another common method of energy recovery takes place during the wort cooling. When cold water is used to cool the wort in a heat exchanger, the water is significantly warmed. In an efficient brewery, cold water is passed through the heat exchanger at a rate set to maximize the water's temperature upon exiting. This now-hot water is then stored in a hot water tank.|$|E

5000|$|Increase the {{temperature}} {{difference in the}} heat engine. The simplest {{way to do this}} is to increase the hot side temperature, which is the approach used in modern combined-cycle gas turbines. Unfortunately, physical limits (such as the melting point of the materials used to build the engine) and environmental concerns regarding NOx production restrict the maximum temperature on workable heat engines. Modern gas turbines run at temperatures as high as possible within the range of temperatures necessary to maintain acceptable NOx output [...] Another way of increasing efficiency is to lower the <b>output</b> <b>temperature.</b> One new method of doing so is to use mixed chemical working fluids, and then exploit the changing behavior of the mixtures. One of the most famous is the so-called Kalina cycle, which uses a 70/30 mix of ammonia and water as its working fluid. This mixture allows the cycle to generate useful power at considerably lower temperatures than most other processes.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the formula}} shows, the COP of a {{heat pump system}} can be {{improved}} by reducing the temperature gap [...] minus [...] at which the system works. For a heating system this would mean two things: 1) reducing the <b>output</b> <b>temperature</b> to around 30 C which requires piped floor, wall or ceiling heating, or oversized water to air heaters and 2) increasing the input temperature (e.g. by using an oversized ground source or by access to a solar-assisted thermal bank [...] ). Accurately determining thermal conductivity will allow for much more precise ground loop [...] or borehole sizing, resulting in higher return temperatures and a more efficient system. For an air cooler, COP could be improved by using ground water as an input instead of air, and by reducing temperature drop on output side through increasing air flow. For both systems, also increasing the size of pipes and air canals would help to reduce noise and the energy consumption of pumps (and ventilators) by decreasing the speed of fluid which in turn lower the Re number and hence the turbulence (and noise) and the head loss (see hydraulic head). The heat pump itself can be improved by increasing {{the size of the}} internal heat exchangers which in turn increase the efficiency (and the price) relative {{to the power of the}} compressor, and also by reducing the system's internal temperature gap over the compressor. Obviously, this latter measure makes such heat pumps unsuitable to produce high temperatures which means that a separate machine is needed for producing hot tap water.|$|E
