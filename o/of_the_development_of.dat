5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences the risk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by {{a family history of}} alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|Although most of Wodehouse's {{fiction is}} set in England, {{he spent much of}} his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as {{settings}} for some of his novels and short stories. During and after the First World War, together with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, he wrote a series of Broadway musical comedies that were an important part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the American musical. He began the 1930s writing for MGM in Hollywood. In a 1931 interview, his naïve revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak.|$|E
5|$|Among Imperial {{historian}}s {{who wrote in}} Greek are Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the Jewish historian Josephus, and the senator Cassius Dio.

5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also {{undertaken}} considerable development {{work on a}} supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four swivelling nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of plenum chamber burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation's Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|From the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 CE) {{until the}} modern period (1840–1919), {{scholars}} and rulers developed a male-dominated patriarchal society in China. Confucianism {{was at the}} root <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the patriarchal society in China, and emphasized the distinctions between the sexes and the roles they have within the family. These ideologies continued through the Tang dynasty (618-907), and girls were taught from {{a very young age}} to be submissive to their fathers, then to their husbands, and later to their sons. During the Song Dynasty (960-1297), Confucian scholars further developed the patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a very young age.|$|E

One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, such questions as the density of the Earth and the composition of water.|$|E
5|$|In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli {{are used}} for titles and {{illuminated}} capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In the early stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals {{can be used to}} identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.|$|E

5|$|In many {{accounts}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> evolutionary theory, Wallace {{is mentioned}} only in passing as simply being the stimulus to {{the publication of}} Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's Descent of Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.|$|E
