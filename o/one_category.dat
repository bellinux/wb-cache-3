5|$|Traditional {{classification}} of endometrial carcinomas is based either on clinical and endocrine features (Type I and Type II), or histopathological characteristics (endometroid, serous, and clear-cell).

5|$|Beginning {{with this}} ceremony, the AMPAS music branch divided the {{category}} of Best Original Score into two categories: Best Dramatic Score and Best Musical or Comedy Score.

25|$|Points for the {{mountains}} classification were earned by reaching the mountain tops first.

The biofilm was nominated for seven Emmy Awards, winning in <b>one</b> <b>category.</b> Riefenstahl, who for some time had been working on her memoirs, decided to cooperate in the production of this documentary to tell her life story about the struggles she had gone through in her personal life, her film-making career and what people thought of her.

5|$|Of the 118 Category 4 hurricanes {{that have}} {{formed in the}} eastern and central Pacific basins, 25 have made {{landfall}}. Of them, four made landfall at Category 4 intensity, three at Category 3, eleven at Categories 2 and 1, six as tropical storms, and five as tropical depressions. Several of these storms weakened slightly after attaining Category 4 status as they approached land; this is usually a result of dry air, shallower water due to shelving, cooler waters, or interaction with land. Only in five years – 1976, 1983, 1992, 1997, and 2014 – more than <b>one</b> <b>Category</b> 4 hurricane made landfall, and only during one year – 1992 – did three Category 4 hurricanes made landfall.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in <b>one</b> <b>category</b> considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was an active}} Atlantic {{hurricane season}}, {{although most of the}} storms were weak and short-lived. Despite the high activity of weak storms during 2007, it was the first season to feature more than <b>one</b> <b>Category</b> 5 landfalling hurricane, a feat that would not be matched until 2017. It produced 17tropical cyclones, 15tropical storms, sixhurricanes, and twomajor hurricanes. It officially started on June1 and ended on November30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first tropical cyclone, Subtropical Storm Andrea, developed on May9, while the last storm, Tropical Storm Olga, dissipated on December13. The most intense hurricane, Dean, is tied for the eighth most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded as well as the third most intense Atlantic hurricane at landfall. The season was one of only six on record for the Atlantic with more than one Category5 hurricane. It was the second on record in which an Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day. September had a record-tying eight storms, although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low. Aside from hurricanes Dean and Felix, none of the storms in the season exceeded Category1 intensity.|$|E

30|$|Classical {{clustering}} algorithms {{work under}} the assumption that values of all of the variables are certain and known. However, in many cases (including our study), the data is collected using “linguistic variables”. Linguistic variables aim to reflect individuals’ perception on the variable. Since perception is a subjective concept, quantitative values of the variables often do not reflect the exact value of participants’ perception (Hawkins and Mothersbaugh 2010). Moreover, classical clustering techniques assign each object to a single category.
