5|$|News reports linked Caspersen with {{financial}} problems and accusations of alleged large-scale tax evasion that {{were discovered in}} the course of federal investigations into offshore tax shelters managed by financial firms UBS and LGT Bank, and used by wealthy American clients. Near the end of his life, Caspersen was subjected to an IRS audit with a possible focus on alleged offshore accounts. An attorney for Caspersen’s estate claimed that in 2013 the IRS effectively exonerated Caspersen posthumously—with no penalties or fines for offshore accounts <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

50|$|In short, naturalism {{undercuts}} itself. If naturalism is true, then {{we cannot}} sensibly believe it <b>or</b> virtually <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{indirect}} free kick is also {{awarded to}} the opposing team if a player plays in a dangerous manner, deliberately obstructs an opponent, prevents the goalkeeper from throwing the ball with hands <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> for which play is stopped to caution or dismiss a player. The indirect free kick is taken from {{the place where the}} infringement occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} postulates that if, as naturalism entails, all of {{our thoughts}} are {{the effect of a}} physical cause, then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. However, knowledge is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if naturalism were true, there would be no way of knowing it (<b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else),</b> except by a fluke.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} other {{interpretation}}s of quantum mechanics, the many-worlds interpretation is motivated by behavior that can be illustrated by the double-slit experiment. When particles of light (<b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else)</b> are passed through the double slit, a calculation assuming wave-like behavior of light {{can be used to}} identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} snake are {{ovoviviparous}} and retain the eggs within their bodies {{until they are}} almost ready to hatch. Recently, it has been confirmed that several species of snake are fully viviparous, such as the boa constrictor and green anaconda, nourishing their young through a placenta {{as well as a}} yolk sac, which is highly unusual among reptiles, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> outside of requiem sharks or placental mammals. Retention of eggs and live birth are most often associated with colder environments.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} endings {{are the same}} as in Esperanto except for -i, -ir, -ar, -or and -ez. Esperanto marks noun plurals by an agglutinative ending -j (so plural nouns end in -oj), uses -i for verb infinitives (Esperanto infinitives are tenseless), and uses -u for the imperative. Verbs in both Esperanto and Ido do not {{conjugate}} depending on person, number or gender; the -as, -is, and -os endings suffice whether the subject is I, you, he, she, they, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

25|$|Colin McGinn {{argues that}} the Chinese room {{provides}} strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (<b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> for that matter) can {{be shown to be}} conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.|$|E
25|$|Written {{mathematics}} {{began with}} numbers expressed as tally marks, with each tally representing a single unit. The numerical symbols consisted probably of strokes or notches cut in wood or stone, and intelligible alike to all nations. For example, one notch in a bone represented one animal, or person, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> The peoples {{with whom the}} Greeks of Asia Minor (amongst whom notation in western history begins) were likely to have come into frequent contact were those inhabiting the eastern littoral of the Mediterranean: and Greek tradition uniformly assigned the special development of geometry to the Egyptians, {{and that of the}} science of numbers either to the Egyptians or to the Phoenicians.|$|E
25|$|The {{machine was}} similar in {{power to the}} Apple II and {{included}} a small 9-inch black-and-white character display built into a small case with a floppy disk. It was text only, as Raskin disliked the computer mouse <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that could take his hands from the keyboard. A number of basic applications were built into the machine, selectable by pressing function keys. The machine also included logic that would understand user intentions and switch programs dynamically. For instance, if the user simply started typing text it would switch into editor mode, and if they typed numbers it would switch to calculator mode. In many cases these switches would be largely invisible to the user.|$|E

5000|$|Intuitively, B's height {{will have}} {{remained}} the same whereas A's height and all ways of measuring height will have changed. Really, it is A's height and all ways of measuring height that will have changed. The problem {{with the notion of}} [...] "Cambridge change" [...] is its failure to acknowledge that B's <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else's</b> height is relational (relative to ways of measuring height). [...] "Height" [...] is thus not unary and thus is extrinsic, not intrinsic.|$|R
25|$|As an {{unmarried}} and childless empress, it was imperative for Elizabeth {{to find a}} legitimate heir to secure the Romanov dynasty. She chose her nephew, Peter of Holstein-Gottorp. Elizabeth was only too aware that the deposed Ivan VI, whom she had imprisoned in the Schlusselburg Fortress and placed in solitary confinement, {{was a threat to}} her throne. Elizabeth feared a coup in his favour and set about destroying all papers, coins <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> depicting or mentioning Ivan. Elizabeth had issued an order that, should any attempt be made for him to escape, he was to be eliminated. Catherine II upheld the order and when an attempt was made he was killed and secretly buried within the fortress.|$|E
25|$|Guy {{discovers that}} Gilda is {{living with the}} Spanish-born nursing student/model Mia and has a lover, whom she quickly {{discards}} when Guy moves in. The trio are enjoying their unusual living arrangement, but world events are beginning to affect their existence. It is {{the height of the}} Spanish Civil War, and idealistic Guy, a long-time supporter of the army of the Second Spanish Republic, is determined to do what he can to help them as Francisco Franco's fascists gain strength. Mia, too, is anxious to {{come to the aid of}} her native land. Gilda, however, has no interest in politics <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that might disrupt her life of luxury, and pleads with the two to ignore the conflict, but they feel compelled to act and depart for Spain.|$|E
25|$|When the Edinburgh and Northern Railway {{obtained}} {{authorisation for}} its line, the exact {{alignment of the}} Dunfermline branch left ambiguous {{the question of the}} intersection with the Halbeath Railway. When the time came to make the crossing, the E understood that a flat crossing was to be made, but the rival Edinburgh and Perth Direct Railway provisional committee still owned the Halbeath line, although it was moribund by this time. The E committee still harboured thoughts of promoting their northward line, notwithstanding the earlier setback. Accordingly the Halbeath directors, prompted by the E, refused to agree to a flat crossing of their line, and the completion of the Dunfermline branch was frustrated: it terminated for the time being at Crossgates in 1848. Negotiations with the Halbeath people failed to reach any sensible compromise, whether underbridge, overbridge, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> It was only when the E scheme was obviously doomed that the matter was resolved, and the Dunfermline branch was completed, making a flat crossing with the Halbeath line after all, and opening in 1849.|$|E

500|$|Kirsten Gillibrand {{received}} the appointment, and attention {{then turned to}} who would run against her in the 2010 Senate special election. [...] By November 2009, Giuliani was seriously considering a run for his old would-have-been Senate seat, but the following month he announced he was not running for it <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in 2010, signalling an end to his political career.|$|E
500|$|Terron R. Moore of Ology {{gave the}} episode a {{slightly}} more positive review, writing, [...] ""The Story Of Brenda Q", judging by only the title, {{could have been a}} Lifetime movie in the Seth MacFarlane fashion <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> than a typical episode of the show, but it was pretty much a typical episode of the show." [...] He continued, [...] "it's pretty much an episode where someone on the Family Guy writing staff needed a new way to get out a bunch of pent-up misogyny and anger." [...] He gave the episode a grade of seven out of ten.|$|E
500|$|The {{gender of}} [...] "Kat" [...] was unclear from the start. [...] Herriman experimented with a {{decision}} about the character's gender, but it remained ambiguous and he would refer to [...] "Kat" [...] as [...] "he" [...] or [...] "she" [...] as he saw fit. Herriman incorporated unusual details into the mini-strip's backgrounds—cacti, pagodas, fanciful vegetation, <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that struck his fancy; this became a signature of the later Krazy Kat strip. [...] The cast grew and soon included the mainstay character Bull Pupp and characters from the Gooseberry Sprigg strip. [...] The strip's characters, relations and situations grew organically during its lifetime, encouraged by Herriman's colleagues.|$|E
60|$|These liberal {{directions}} Mr. Grewgious issued {{with his}} usual air of reading an inventory, or repeating a lesson, <b>or</b> doing <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> by rote. Bazzard, after drawing out the round table, withdrew to execute them.|$|R
50|$|Beerware is a {{somewhat}} tongue-in-cheek term for software released under a very relaxed license (beerware licensed software). It provides the end user {{with the right}} to use a particular program (<b>or</b> do <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> with the source code).|$|R
5000|$|Economist Richard W. Rahn in The Washington Times welcomed it as [...] "a {{wonderful}} new book".
