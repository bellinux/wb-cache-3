5|$|Because Bonnie hit Florida {{immediately}} before Charley, damage {{between the two}} storms was <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to differentiate. President George W. Bush responded to the storm by declaring much of Florida a Federal Disaster Area on August 13, 2004.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to find P. fimbriata in the wild, as {{its shape}} and {{movements}} are well disguised. The Queensland variety is quite easy to raise, while the Northern Territory variety is quite troublesome to maintain.|$|E
5|$|During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a {{frequent}} witness on charters. While it is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement {{near the top of}} the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E

5|$|In the C++ {{programming}} language, decltype is {{a keyword}} used to query {{the type of}} an expression. Introduced in C++11, its primary intended use is in generic programming, where it is <b>often</b> <b>difficult,</b> or even impossible, to express types that depend on template parameters.|$|E
5|$|Misdiagnosis is {{frequent}} (occurring {{in about}} 5 to 30% of cases). Different {{studies showed that}} in many cases seizure-like attacks in apparent treatment-resistant epilepsy have a cardiovascular cause. Approximately 20% of the people seen at epilepsy clinics have PNES and of those who have PNES about 10% also have epilepsy; separating the two based on the seizure episode alone without further testing is <b>often</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E
5|$|The exact {{degree of}} Caroline's wealth was always {{problematic}} to trace, as {{the king had}} placed {{so much of it}} in different sources <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to locate and measure both during his lifetime and after his death. One 1912 source for instance reported that out of the king's estimated estate of $65,000,000, Caroline received $7,000,000, while others stressed still higher numbers, and that the majority of it came from Congo shares.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of templates into the C++ programming language, {{and the advent of}} generic programming techniques pioneered by the Standard Template Library, the need for a mechanism for obtaining the type of an expression, commonly referred to as typeof, was recognized. In generic programming, it is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> or impossible to express types that depend on template parameters, in particular the return type of function template instantiations.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is <b>often</b> <b>difficult.</b> It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from football, Gatski was a scout for the Boston Patriots {{for two years}} before becoming head football coach and athletic director at the West Virginia Industrial School for Boys, a correctional facility for young offenders in Pruntytown, West Virginia. He worked there until the school shut down in 1982. He hunted and fished in retirement, and was <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to reach. He lived on a mountain in West Virginia and did not have a telephone for many years.|$|E

25|$|Food {{intolerance}} is more chronic, less acute, {{less obvious}} in its presentation, and <b>often</b> more <b>difficult</b> to diagnose than a food allergy.|$|R
5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is <b>often</b> <b>difficult.</b> A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Attribution is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> with Farsari's {{photographs}} because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' {{images and}} sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings {{in countries that}} had <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> relations with the United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style. His strong views on Iraq's reconstruction efforts after the war in 2003 were in part responsible for a wholesale change in the Bush administration's strategy to stabilize the war-torn nation. He also advocated engagement with Sudan {{at a time when}} White House officials and the C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in Khartoum.|$|E

5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.|$|E
5|$|For {{the human}} ear, it is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to tell {{precisely}} where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, {{the sound is}} continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{scientists}} in Australia successfully implanted a Poitou donkey embryo created by artificial insemination {{in the womb}} of a Standardbred mare. Worries that joint problems might prevent a healthy pregnancy in the foal's biological mother led to the initiative. The resultant foal became one of three Poitou donkeys in Australia. The procedure was unusual because it is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> for members of one Equus species to accept implanted embryos from another species in the same genus.|$|E
50|$|Ideally, {{system designs}} will {{accommodate}} all team members, but orienting older workers to new CSCW tools can <b>often</b> be <b>difficult.</b> This can cause problems in virtual teams {{due to the}} necessity of incorporating the wealth of knowledge and expertise that older workers {{bring to the table}} with the technological challenges of new virtual environments. Orienting and retraining older workers to effectively utilize new technology can <b>often</b> be <b>difficult,</b> as they generally have less experience than younger workers with learning such new technologies.|$|R

5|$|In her book, Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology, Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia {{connected}} the Slender Man to ancient folklore about fairies. Like fairies, Slender Man is otherworldly, with motives that are <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to grasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what the viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, the Slender Man calls {{the woods and}} wild places his home and kidnaps children.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to superficially {{distinguish}} {{between male and}} female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|Survivals {{from late}} Medieval church {{fittings}} and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even {{compared to those}} from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the Scottish Reformation. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as Limoges enamels. It is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> to decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.|$|E
