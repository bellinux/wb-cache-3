5|$|It {{would be}} more than 40years before the first {{crossing}} <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> was achieved, by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1955–58. This expedition set out from Vahsel Bay, following a route which avoided the Beardmore Glacier altogether, and bypassed much of the Ross Ice Shelf, reaching McMurdo Sound via a descent of the Skelton Glacier. The entire journey took 98days.|$|E
5|$|The {{geological}} study <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> {{has been}} greatly hindered by {{nearly all of the}} continent being permanently covered with a thick layer of ice. However, new techniques such as remote sensing, ground-penetrating radar and satellite imagery have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.|$|E
5|$|As this {{scenario}} continues, by 100 million {{years from the}} present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around {{the southern tip of}} Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> will reverse direction and return to the South Pole, building up a new ice cap.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, a {{satellite}} detects a mysterious heat bloom beneath Bouvetøya, an island about one thousand {{miles off the}} coast <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica.</b> Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried 2000 feet beneath the ice. He attempts to claim it for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries, a subsidiary of the Weyland Corporation, and assembles a team of experts to investigate. The team includes archaeologists, linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a guide named Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan).|$|E

5|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> {{has been}} warming up; {{particularly}} strong warming {{has been noted}} on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted {{for the first time}} that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> is slightly positive at >0.05°C (0.09°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1°C (0.2°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic sheet is {{the largest}} known single mass of ice. It covers almost 14 million km2 and some 30 million km3 of ice. Around 90% of the fresh water on the planet's surface is held {{in this area and}} if melted would raise sea levels by 58 metres. The continent-wide average surface {{temperature}} trend <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> is positive and significant at >0.05°C/decade since 1957.|$|E
5|$|The main mineral {{resource}} known {{on the continent}} is coal. It was first recorded near the Beardmore Glacier by Frank Wild on the Nimrod Expedition, and now low-grade coal is known across {{many parts of the}} Transantarctic Mountains. The Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> lie offshore, namely the oil and natural gas fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973.

5|$|The {{range of}} the Ferugliotheriidae is overall more limited, both in extent and time, than that of Sudamericidae; sudamericids have been {{recorded}} from the Late Cretaceous to Miocene of Argentina, the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar and India, the Middle Eocene <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica,</b> and perhaps the Cretaceous of Tanzania (TNM 02067, tentatively referred to Sudamericidae).

5|$|This crater {{was named}} after Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Anglo-Irish {{explorer}} <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> from 1901 {{until his death in}} 1922. The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1994. Nearby craters of note include Shoemaker, Haworth, de Gerlache, Sverdrup, Slater, and Faustini. Somewhat farther away, on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side, are the larger craters Amundsen and Scott, named after two other early explorers of the Antarctic continent.|$|E
5|$|A 1993 review {{estimated}} that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, {{with a minimum of}} 11,841,600 pairs worldwide. Macaroni penguins range from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula; at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites have been recorded. In South America, macaroni penguins are found in southern Chile, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and South Orkney Islands. They also occupy much <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> and the Antarctic Peninsula, including the northern South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Prince Edward and Marion islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Heard and McDonald Islands. While foraging for food, groups will range north to the islands off Australia, New Zealand, southern Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|After {{the race}} to the South Pole ended in December 1911 with Roald Amundsen's conquest, Shackleton turned his {{attention}} to the crossing <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> from sea to sea, via the pole. To this end he made preparations for what became the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914–17. Disaster struck this expedition when its ship, Endurance, became trapped in pack ice and was slowly crushed before the shore parties could be landed. The crew escaped by camping on the sea ice until it disintegrated, then by launching the lifeboats to reach Elephant Island and ultimately the inhabited island of South Georgia, a stormy ocean voyage of 720 nautical miles and Shackleton's most famous exploit. In 1921, he returned to the Antarctic with the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, but died of a heart attack while his ship was moored in South Georgia. At his wife's request he was buried there.|$|E
50|$|The West Antarctic Rift is a major, active {{rift valley}} lying between East and West Antarctica.

5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{an island}} {{was found in}} {{the central part of the}} lake. Then, in January 2006, the {{discovery}} of two nearby smaller lakes under the ice cap was published; they are named 90 Degrees East and Sovetskaya. It is suspected that these Antarctic subglacial lakes may be connected by a network of subglacial rivers. Centre for Polar Observation & Modelling glaciologists propose that many of the subglacial lakes <b>of</b> <b>Antarctica</b> are at least temporarily interconnected. Because of varying water pressure in individual lakes, large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large amounts of water through the solid ice.|$|E
5|$|In November 1903 Scotia {{retreated to}} Buenos Aires for repair and reprovisioning. While in Argentina, Bruce {{negotiated}} {{an agreement with}} the government whereby Omond House became a permanent weather station, under Argentinian control.

On 6 March, new land was sighted, part of the sea's eastern boundary; Bruce named this Coats Land after the expedition's chief backers. On 14 March, at 74°01′S and in danger of becoming icebound, Scotia turned north. The long voyage back to Scotland, via Cape Town, was completed on 21 July 1904.|$|E
