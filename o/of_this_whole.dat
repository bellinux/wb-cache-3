25|$|Losses at Truk were severe. Some 17,000 tons of stored fuel were {{destroyed}} by the strikes. Shipping losses totaled almost 200,000 tons including precious resources in fleet oilers. This represents almost one tenth of total Japanese shipping losses between 1 November 1943 and 30 June 1944. Moreover, the isolation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> area of operations by submarine and air attack meant the effective severance of Japanese shipping lanes between empire waters and critical fuel supplies in e.g. Borneo. The ultimate effect of such a disconnect was later seen during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, when IJN forces had to sortie separately from Japan and Lingga Roads due to fuel constraints.|$|E

And they equaled many nations of this world that are renowned and considered civilized, and they surpassed many others, and to none were they inferior.

In an interview with FHM in December 2001, vocalist Corey Taylor revealed that he put himself in specific situations to achieve his performance on the album. While recording vocals for the final song [...] "Iowa" [...] he was completely naked, vomiting all over himself and cutting himself with broken glass. Explaining this, he said, [...] "that's where the best stuff comes from. You've got to break yourself down before you can build something great."

Series creator Ryan Murphy told Morris that as Glee is a primetime series, {{he did not want to}} show them making out. Interviewed by Brett Berk of Vanity Fair in May 2010, Morris stated that Brittany and Santana were simply best friends, and the show would not be taking them in a [...] "friends with benefits" [...] direction. However, at the Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour in August 2010, Murphy stated that the characters would in fact kiss on screen in an upcoming episode. Falchuk later explained that the Brittany/Santana storyline had begun [...] "almost as a goof at first", however [...] "then we realised this show is so inclusive, and then there were people we weren't representative <b>of.</b> <b>This</b> <b>whole</b> lesbian-bisexual female community. We're fortunate the network wasn't resistant of it and let us try it out, then it became something much deeper." [...] In [...] "Duets", Brittany also had a brief relationship with Artie.

2500|$|The LMG {{design is}} a {{traditionally}} laid-out machine-gun. It has several features conducive to its {{use as a}} light machine gun, such as a quick-change barrel, a vented fore-grip, a belt feeding mechanism, provisions {{for the use of}} an ammunition pouch, and a rate of fire of approximately 600 RPM. [...] Other features include its light weight, an ammunition counter, and a highly stiff and heat resistant barrel achieved with the use of fluting and specialized alloys. [...] When firing, the weapon's chamber swings around a longitudinal pivot; it swings from horizontally parallel with the pivot (the firing position) to vertically parallel (the feed position), and back again. [...] A long-stroke gas-piston is used to operate this action. [...] A round is fed into the chamber at the feed position using a rammer, and the new round also serves to push a spent or dud round out of {{the far end of the}} chamber. [...] Such rounds are pushed forward, parallel to the barrel, and they slide into a separate mechanism that ejects them out of one side of the gun. [...] The advantages <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> action include its simplicity, its isolation of the chamber from barrel heat, and its positive control of round movement from extraction to ejection. [...] In the caseless firing version of the weapon, another mechanism is introduced to seal the chamber during firing, accounting for the slightly increased weight of the caseless version.|$|E
