40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{to assess}} the risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in elderly, by {{comparing}} the sociodemographic and cognitive factors, history <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and self-reported comorbidities. Method: cross-sectional and quantitative study with 240 elderly. Data were collected based on the social profile, through the instrument <b>of</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and assessment <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> by univariate analysis, bivariate and multiple logistic regression. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19 was used for statistical analysis. Results: {{there was a significant}} association of the risk <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> as measured by the Fall Risk Score, with sex (< 0. 001), age (0. 054), cognitive status (< 0. 001) and history <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> (< 0. 001). All variables were statistically significant and contributed to the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> In logistic regression, the variables that showed association with risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> were: fall, with whom they live, hypertension and visual impairment. Conclusion: female gender, older elderly (over 80 years old), with low cognitive status and occurrence <b>of</b> previous <b>falls</b> {{in the last six months}} are factors that increase the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> In logistic regression, the variables that were associated with risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> were: fall, with whom they live, visual impairment and rheumatologic diseases...|$|R

40|$|Falls are {{the most}} {{worrying}} incidence of patients {{in the hospital and}} that has an impact on injury and even death. The incidence was second ranks of adverse event after medication errors. Hospitals are already making efforts to reduce the fall incident but in reality, the incidence <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> still occurs. Data obtained from March to September 2016 have 6 cases <b>of</b> incident patients <b>falling</b> from a total of 43 patient safety incidents. The results of the observations show that most <b>of</b> the <b>fall</b> prevention programs that have not been done are falling risk assessments. Fall risk assessment is the first step to prevent the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in the patient, if not done then the incident will occur. This study aims to explore the implementation <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> risk assessment conducted by nurses in the hospital wards. The research method using qualitative research with phenomenology approach. The population used is inpatient ward nurses as many as 304 nurses. The sample used by purposive sampling technique with 10 informants. Data collection using primary and secondary data. Primary data obtained by in-depth interview with semi-structured interview to all informants. Secondary data was used document review of SOP prevention <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> risk, assessment protocol, and patient's medical record status. Data analysis used Miles and Huberman analysis model by reducing data, making display data, and drawing conclusions. The results of the research are two themes that are the existence of internal training and socialization affects the nurse's understanding of the implementation <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> risk assessment both initial <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> risk assessment and re-assessment <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> risk and implementation <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> risk assessment influenced by the inhibiting and supporting factors, both of these factors affect compliance <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> risk assessment conducted by the nurse. This study suggests that the understanding <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> risk assessment does not guarantee the nurse to always adhere to the implementation <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> risk assessment. It is expected that there will be cooperation between hospital management, working group prevention <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> risk, and head of ward to always supervise and monitor evaluation related to implementation <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> risk assessment along with giving reward and punishment. </em...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{identification}} of the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> {{is an important step}} for screening and for rehabilitation processes for the elderly. The methods of monitoring these events are susceptible to recording biases, and the choice of the most accurate method remains challenging. Objectives: (i) To investigate the agreement between retrospective self-reporting and prospective monitoring of methods <b>of</b> recording <b>falls,</b> and (ii) to compare the retrospective self-reporting <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and the prospective monitoring <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and recurrent falls over a 12 -month period among older women at high risk <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> and fractures. Method: A total of 118 community-dwelling older women with low bone density were recruited. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> was monitored prospectively in 116 older women (2 losses) via monthly phone calls {{over the course of a}} year. At the end of this monitoring period, the older women were asked about their recall <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in the same 12 -month period. The agreement between the two methods was analyzed, and the sensitivity and specificity <b>of</b> self-reported previous <b>falls</b> in relation to the prospective monitoring were calculated. Results: There was moderate agreement between the prospective monitoring and the retrospective self-reporting <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in classifying fallers (Kappa= 0. 595) and recurrent fallers (Kappa= 0. 589). The limits of agreement were 0. 35 &# 177; 1. 66 <b>falls.</b> The self-reporting <b>of</b> prior <b>falls</b> had a 67. 2 % sensitivity and a 94. 2 % specificity in classifying fallers among older women and a 50 % sensitivity and a 98. 9 % specificity in classifying recurrent fallers.

40|$|Introduction Older adults' {{perception}} of their own risk <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> has never been included into screening tools. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the predictive validity of questions on subjects' self-{{perception of}} their own risk <b>of</b> <b>fall.</b> Methods This prospective study was conducted on a probabilistic sample of 772 Spanish community-dwelling older adults, who were followed-up for a one year period. At a baseline visit, subjects were asked about their recent history <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> (question 1 : 'Have you fallen in the last 6 months?'), as well as on their {{perception of their}} own risk <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> by using two questions (question 2 : 'Do you think you may fall in the next few months?' possible answers: yes/no; question 3 : 'What is the probability that you fall in the next few months?' possible answers: low/intermediate/high). The follow-up consisted of quarterly telephone calls, where the number <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> occurred in that period was recorded. Results A short questionnaire built with questions 1 and 3 showed 70 % sensitivity (95 % CI: 56 %- 84 %), 72 % specificity (95 % CI: 68 %- 76 %) and 0. 74 area under the ROC curve (95 % CI: 0. 66 - 0. 82) for prediction <b>of</b> repeated <b>falls</b> in the subsequent year.

40|$|The problem <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in {{the elderly}} has become a topic of growing {{scientific}} interest. Numerous studies on risk factors for falls and preventive strategies {{have been published in}} the past decades. The development <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> prevention interventions has usually been based on these known risk factors. Another approach would be to develop an intervention program that is mainly based on the reported circumstances <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> Such interventions would typically include elements like obstacle course walking, because a large number <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> {{in the elderly}} are a consequence of tripping and stumbling over obstacles while walking. The first aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effectiveness <b>of</b> a new <b>falls</b> prevention exercise program for the elderly, which was called the Nijmegen falls prevention program. This exercise program was developed from the perspective of training in an exercise environment that simulated the most frequently reported circumstances <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> such as obstacles that are encountered while walking. In order to enhance the probability of success of such intervention programs, it may help to get a better understanding <b>of</b> why elderly <b>fall</b> over obstacles. The second aim of this thesis was to provide more knowledge about the characteristics of obstacle avoidance under time pressure and about the influence of divided attention and aging on this task. Finally, the ultimate goal of the prevention <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> is the prevention <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> injuries. The third aim of this thesis was to explore whether the practice <b>of</b> martial arts <b>fall</b> techniques could potentially contribute to the prevention <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> injuries in the elderl...|$|R
