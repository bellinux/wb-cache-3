50|$|Worldwide, the fishkeeping hobby is {{a multibillion-dollar}} industry. The United States {{is the largest}} market, {{followed}} by Europe and Japan. In 1993 the United States Census Bureau found that 10.6% of U.S. households owned <b>ornamental</b> freshwater or <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish,</b> {{with an average of}} 8.8 fish per household. In 1993, the retail value of the fish hobby in the United States was US$910 million. In 2002, census data indicated that aquarium products and fishing accounted for US$684 million.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: While {{there are}} {{numerous}} studies on economic benefits of <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing,</b> there is little literature on other benefits such as social benefits. It is widely accepted that leisure, and angling are associated with social benefits, family cohesion and friendship development, yet few empirical studies exist to support these claims. Additional research that examines the relationship between recreation and leisure activities (e. g. <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing)</b> and social benefits {{is needed to determine}} if such a relationship exists. The purpose of this project is to present the findings of a study done to determine the social benefits of <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing.</b> Data was collected by interviewing fishermen along North Carolina beaches participating in surf fishing, charter boat fishing, and pier fishing. Discussion focuses on the extent that social benefits received through <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> compare to other recreational activities, to what extent is involvement in saltwater angling related to social benefits received, and the relationship between participation frequency in <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> and social benefits received...|$|R

40|$|Georgians {{represent}} 96 {{percent of}} the recreational <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> in the state. Using IMPLAN, this® studyevaluates the economic importance associated with the activity in both the coastal region and {{the state as a}} whole. Six scenarios are examined {{to determine the extent of}} economic activity. These scenarios include a base case for the coastal region, elimination of recreational <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> from the coastal region and state’s economy, and a 25 percent increase in coastal and state recreational <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> by the year 2005. The analysis indicates the significance of recreational <b>saltwater</b> <b>fishing</b> in Georgia’s coastal and statewide economies. The 100 miles between Savannah and St. Marys do not fullydescribe the richness of Georgia’s coastline. The coastal ecosystem includes coastal marine, barrier islands, estuaries and sounds, mainland upland, rivers, and swamps that enhance the biodiversity of the region (Lenz 1999). Fourteen major barrier islands contribute to make Georgia’s coast valuable to residents and visitors. Only four islands are developed; th...|$|R

50|$|Like the {{closely related}} green puffer fish, the figure 8 {{exhibits}} euryhalinity, and undergoes epithelial remodeling {{and changes in}} the kidneys and gills when exposed to changes in salinity. Accordingly, the figure 8 puffer is often mistakenly regarded as an entirely freshwater fish, and has considerable resistance to freshwater exposure. In a marine environment, it exhibits typical <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish</b> morphological features in its gills, allowing it to secrete sodium chloride across the gill epithelium like a typical <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish.</b> However, acclimated to freshwater, the figure 8 puffer will exhibit specialized cells that do not match any gill ion-regulating cell of a freshwater fish. The other fish known to have these types of cells is the Mozambique tilapia (O. mossambicus), but this is a <b>saltwater</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|R
