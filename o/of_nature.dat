They describe virtuous conduct and man's obligation to God, nature and society, and ask as if there is a place for simple appreciation <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> without having to actively dedicate one's life to altruism.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine Grade 9 students’ understanding <b>of</b> the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science (NoS). There were 37 female and 34 male students participating in {{this research}}, all of which were from an education-extended school in the Chaiyaphum Primary Educational Service Area Office 3, Thailand. The students’ conception <b>of</b> the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science was examined using an open-ended questionnaire about the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science adapted from the one used in Lederman et al. (2002) VNOS-C, and an interview record form. Twenty percent of the students were randomly selected for an interview to probe deeper into their understanding. The data from the questionnaires and interviews were analyzed base on an interpretive paradigm. Research findings indicated {{that the majority of the}} students had little awareness, and held naïve views, of all aspects <b>of</b> the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science. These findings indicated that the students’ understanding <b>of</b> the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science was inadequate and fragmented. An improvement of the students’ understanding <b>of</b> the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> science is thus necessary...|$|R

5|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, can any {{analogous}} principle {{apply in}} nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> and so be enabled to increase in numbers.|$|E
