50|$|Drilling {{began in}} October 1882 {{as a public}} works project by the Village of Bay View, but progressed slowly due to the dense glacial drift below.

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that desiccation cracks can potentially be extended by vegetation in dry weather promoting the deeper penetration <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> potential slip plane and increased water pressure into the soil during the wet periods. Nevertheless, these cracks will be filled by roots growing deeper into the soil as they follow the path of least resistance.|$|R
50|$|When one mole <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{is added}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large volume <b>of</b> <b>water</b> at 25 °C, the volume {{increases}} by 18 cm3. The molar volume <b>of</b> pure <b>water</b> would thus be reported as 18 cm3 mol−1. However, addition of one mole <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large volume <b>of</b> pure ethanol {{results in an}} increase in volume of only 14 cm3. The reason that the increase is different is that the volume occupied by a given number <b>of</b> <b>water</b> molecules depends upon the identity of the surrounding molecules. The value 14 cm3 {{is said to be the}} partial molar volume <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in ethanol.|$|R
50|$|The {{greater the}} ratio of xanthan gum added <b>to</b> <b>a</b> liquid, the thicker the liquid will become. An {{emulsion}} can be formed with as little as 0.1% (by weight). Increasing the amount of gum gives a thicker, more stable emulsion up to 1% xanthan gum.

These heightened characteristics increase both the potential of stream erosion and heavier stream load (Knighton, 1998). Flooded streams are often responsible for heavy sediment transportation and deposition downstream. Stream capacity is greatly increased during a flood (Knighton, 1998). During a flood, increased suspended load may be visible, giving the stream a muddy color.|$|R
