5|$|As a result, Bach Xuan Nguyen, {{who led the}} investigation, {{ordered the}} posthumous humiliation of Duyệt. This {{resulted}} in the desecration of his tomb, the execution of sixteen relatives, and the arrests <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues.</b> Minh Mạng's attitude led Duyet's adopted son Khoi {{to break out of}} prison and start a revolt against the emperor on 10 May 1833.|$|E
5|$|During oral {{argument}} before the Court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments {{than any other}} justice—and a 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often than any <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> did. His goal during {{oral argument}}s was to get across his position to the other justices.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{retained}} close {{connections with}} York throughout his life. After Jonathan Martin's arson attack on York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, Etty was {{prominent in the}} effort to restore the building to its original state. One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> in that campaign was Welsh politician Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn, the long-serving Conservative Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Princeton Theological Seminary was reorganized to {{make the}} school's {{leadership}} and faculty more representative of the wider church rather than just Old School Presbyterianism. Two of the seminary's new board members were signatories to the Auburn Affirmation. In order to preserve Princeton's Old School legacy, Machen and several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> founded Westminster Theological Seminary.|$|E
5|$|In AD31 Sejanus {{was summoned}} to {{a meeting of the}} Senate, where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and {{ordering}} his immediate execution.

5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. He argued that the Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not {{within the scope of}} the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1945–1946, Slotin shocked some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> with a bold action. He {{repaired}} an instrument six feet under water inside the Clinton Pile while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose {{was estimated to be}} at least 100 roentgen. A dose of 1 Gy (~100 roentgen) can cause nausea and vomiting in 10% of cases, but is generally survivable.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Ephraim Fabricant {{was named}} for real-life murderer Valery Fabrikant, a mechanical engineering professor who shot dead four <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> in {{what became known as}} the Concordia University massacre. In addition, the character's back-story and demise were both intended to echo the case of Jack the Ripper—both were believed to be medically trained, while the use of Fabricant's kidney to send a message is based on the From Hell letter, sent to the police by the Ripper along with one of his victims' kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators. During one meeting, a cross-country representative {{asked for the}} selection of six athletes, prompting the selection committee chairman to interject. The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, {{and went on to}} explain that a dog was required to find the athletes after they got lost in the snow. The majority <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> burst into laughter.|$|E

5|$|A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with an {{unconventional}} lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with the Free and Independent Faction. His literary debut came late in life, closely following {{the start of}} his close friendship with Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu and their common affiliation with the influential conservative literary society Junimea. Although viewed with reserve by many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> there, and primarily appreciated for his records of oral tradition, Creangă helped propagate the group's cultural guidelines in an accessible form. Later criticism has often described him, alongside Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale and Ioan Slavici, {{as one of the most}} accomplished representatives of Junimist literature.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting his}} degree, O'Donnell moved to Chicago, where he {{expected}} {{that he would}} teach at the American Conservatory of Music. The job fell through, and instead {{he worked as a}} grip in the film and television business. O'Donnell began his musical career in the field after one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> who knew of his music background approached him to write for his film. O'Donnell talked to his friend Michael Salvatori, who had his own recording studio, and offered to split the profits from the job with him; the two became constant partners.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{returned}} to Harvard after the war, and initiated {{the construction of}} a 96-inch synchro-cyclotron, which has since been dismantled. From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, he drew the ire of Senator Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive defense <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> in academia. As chairman, he was responsible for the renovation of the old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted a good deal of his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues,</b> including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed {{to persuade him to}} make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the war he}} was {{included}} in an Australian Imperial Forces cricket team, touring England in 1919. Charles Kelleway, an officer, was {{the captain of the}} team for the first six matches. Despite Collins's rank Field Marshal Birdwood, the former commander of the Australian Corps, asked him to take over the captaincy {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> were officers such as Jack Gregory and Nip Pellew. Collins proved a capable and popular skipper with the team losing only four of twenty eight matches during the tour. He scored 1,615 runs including five centuries at an average of 38.45 and took 106 wickets at 16.55 apiece.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, {{at the head of}} a highly successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The electoral reform he ushered in was credited with undermining national political processes and causing severe harm to the system of parliamentary government. For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition from the majority <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues,</b> leading to a virtual split in the Conservative Party over his policies. On 3 September 1856, while still in office and at the height of his political career, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E

5|$|Mallory {{resigned}} {{after the}} Confederate government had fled from Richmond {{at the end}} of the war, and he and several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> in the cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason. After more than a year in prison, the public mood had softened, and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole, he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate, although he was not incapacitated until the very end. He died on November 9, 1873.|$|E
5|$|Meyer is a driven, arrogant surgeon, {{with high}} {{expectations}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues.</b> His major storylines see him operate {{on his own}} sister, fear {{that he may have}} Motor Neurone Disease, lose his spleen after being shot in a road rage incident, and ultimately depart from Holby for Michigan when the hospital Board make impositions on his autonomy. Irving made the decision to leave the series as he struggled to set the character aside outside of work, which had a negative impact on his personal life. He ruled out the possibility of returning to Holby City in future, preferring his memory of Meyer to remain untarnished.|$|E
5|$|Others like Stroud, Krause and Phillips opine {{that even}} Rommel's {{recklessness}} and disobedience during {{the invasion of}} France benefitted the German cause, while rescuing Hitler's mercurial objectives and inventing the actual application of blitzkrieg ("lightning war"), and it was Hitler who downgraded strategic victory to operational victory. According to Alan J. Levine, contrary to the allegation {{that he was only}} a genius tactician without a good grasp of logistics, Rommel was a clearer thinker than most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> (shown by his judgements on developing situations), and although he was the most defeatist German general, there was a serious qualification to his pessimism and he was capable of displaying a surprising amount of energy in building the Normandy defense at the same time.|$|E
