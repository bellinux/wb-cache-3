40|$|The {{preparation}} of large particle size 3 to 30 micrometer monodisperse latexes in space confirmed that original rationale unequivocally. The flight polymerizations formed negligible amounts of coagulum {{as compared to}} increasing amounts for the ground-based polymerizations. The number of <b>offsize</b> large particles in the flight latexes was smaller than in the ground-based latexes. The particle size distribution broadened and more larger <b>offsize</b> particles were formed when the polymerizations of the partially converted STS- 4 latexes were completed on Earth. Polymerization in space also showed other unanticipated advantages. The flight latexes had narrower particle size distributions than the ground-based latexes. The particles of the flight latexes were more perfect spheres {{than those of the}} ground-based latexes. The superior uniformity of the flight latexes was confirmed by the National Bureau of Standards acceptance of the 10 micrometer STS- 6 latex and the 30 micrometer STS- 11 latexes as Standard Reference Materials, the first products made in space for sale on Earth. The polymerization rates in space were the same as those on Earth within experimental error. Further development of the ground-based polymerization recipes gave monodisperse particles as large as 100 micrometer with tolerable levels of coagulum, but their uniformity was significantly poorer than the flight latexes. Careful control of the polymerization parameters gave uniform nonspherical particles: symmetrical and asymmetrical doublets, ellipsoids, egg-shaped, ice cream cone-shaped, and popcorn-shaped particles...|$|E
40|$|Campoletis sonorensis virus (CsV) (Polydnaviridae) {{previously}} {{was detected}} {{only in the}} calyx epithelial cells and lumen of the oviducts from female C. sonorensis (Ichneumonidae) endoparasitic wasps (Norton et al., Cell Tissue Res. 162 : 195 - 208, 1975). Using dot-blot hybridizations, we detected low amounts of CsV DNA in male and female wasp head and thorax tissues and in male abdominal tissues. Low amounts of extrachromosomal viral DNA were detected in Southern blots of undigested male wasp DNA and in male DNA purified by isopycnic centrifugation. High-molecular-weight male wasp DNA digested with any of several restriction endonucleases and hybridized with cloned viral DNAs from CsV superhelices B and Q under stringent conditions contained CsV-specific DNA fragments that differed significantly in size and number from the hybridizing fragments detected in comparably digested viral DNA. Identical <b>offsize</b> restriction fragments were detected in digested female head and thorax DNA. These data suggest that at least CsV DNAs B and Q are integrated in C. sonorensis cellular DNA and that the virus may be transmitted through the germline...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{reported}} of latex sphere polymerization experiments performed on two flights of the Columbia and three flights of the Challenger. The trials {{were carried out}} because polymerization of the spheres in space avoids coagulation, nucleation of {{a new crop of}} particles, and excessive stirring requirements, and allows growth of spheres larger than 4 microns diam. The Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR) held four stirred 100 cc sealed stainless steel cylindrical containers. The mixtures were monitored for the conversion times, volume decreases as spheres formed and the mixture temperature. The spheres were grown from 0. 19 micron seeds. Details of the flight preparation efforts are outlined. In flights which did not experience mechanical malfunctions spheres 3 - 30 microns diam were grown that had noticeably lower size variations than did the ground-based control particles. The 10 micron diam spheres grown on STS- 6 were accepted as standard reference material by the NBS and became the first products made in space to be commercially sold on earth; the 30 micron spheres also became NBS standards. The experiments confirmed all projected benefits of producing the spheres in space, as well as provided the opportunity to grow more larger <b>offsize</b> spheres by finishing the growths on earth...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} {{patterns of}} persisting adenovirus type 12 (Ad 12) DNA were analyzed in two Ad 12 -induced tumors of Balb/c and CBA/J mice {{and in one}} tumor cell line derived from an Ad 12 -induced retinoblastoma of C 3 H origin. In all three tumors the Ad 12 genome was integrated colinearly and various copy numbers of viral DNA were found. Analysis of the Ad 12 integration patterns revealed relatively simple <b>offsize</b> band patterns regardless of Ad 12 copy numbers. The degree of methylation at the 5 '-CCGG- 3 ' sites in the inserted Ad 12 genome was determined using the isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease pair HpaII and MspI. Methylation was rather incomplete in the primary tumor tissues but almost complete in the retinoblastoma line carried in culture for many passages. The levels of expression of the viral genome in the Balb/c tumor and in the retinoblastoma line were determined by in vitro translation of RNA isolated from these cells and selected with appropriate restriction endonuclease fragments of Ad 12 DNA. In both instances the 59 K, 19 K, and 17 K proteins of the E 1 b region were expressed. Proteins of the E 1 a region appeared very faint in the size class between 22 K and 42 K. The permissivity of Ad 12 and the replication of Ad 12 DNA in mouse cells were investigated by blotting restricted DNA from cells soon after, and a long time after, infection and by hybridization with 32 P-labeled Ad 12 DNA. Neither primary mouse kidney cells nor the established L 929 mouse cell line supported viral DNA replication. These results raise the question to what extent host cell factors determine Ad 12 DNA replication in mammalian cells...|$|E
