5|$|Although N. rajah has a {{restricted}} distribution {{and is often}} quoted as a plant in peril, it is not rare in the areas where it does grow and most populations are now <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> visitors and lie in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park. Furthermore, N. rajah has a distinctive leaf shape {{making it difficult to}} illegally ship abroad even if the pitchers are removed, as an informed customs official should be able to identify it.|$|E
5|$|Social {{media was}} blamed for {{bringing}} unwanted {{visitors to the}} site and not {{pointing out that the}} area is <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> the public. Following these acts of vandalism, the state of Hawaii asked for the removal of directions to Kaniakapūpū on many social media websites and tourism blogs, and encouraged those who knew the direction to the ruins to come with respect.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until early}} 2010, the keeper's cottage had been <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> visitors. Two of the ground-floor rooms {{have now been}} opened: the living-room is {{furnished}} in a 1930s/40s style, while the old kitchen area currently holds a couple of display cases, {{with a view to}} showing hitherto unseen artefacts from the museum's collection of smaller items. The upper floors remain closed to visitors.|$|E

He also cancelled the Spring Bear Hunt, a decision which was opposed by many Ontario hunters but supported by animal rights groups.|$|R
5|$|Fossil Creek's steady flow, warmth, deep pools, {{and small}} waterfalls attract {{visitors}} who wade, swim, float, kayak, and snorkel in its waters. Four named hiking paths intersect the Fossil Creek corridor: the Flume–Irving, Fossil Springs, Mail, and Deadman Mesa trails. The U.S. Forest Service allows dispersed camping {{in some parts}} of the area but has made other parts, such as riparian zones, <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> overnight stays. Other activities in the area include wildlife viewing, photography, fishing, and visits to the remains of the Childs-Irving infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory is characterised {{by a few}} {{highly visible}} remains. The priory church survives in a fragmentary state, {{dominated}} by the east wall of the presbytery that stands to its full height. Several of the priory church's column bases can also be seen, as can a number of excavated graves within the presbytery. Elsewhere on the site, {{the outline of the}} cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while the ruins of the west (or cellarer's) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground. A ruined gatehouse and a still-intact dovecote (the latter <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> visitors) stand on the western edges of the site.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, Osip Berkman {{was granted}} the right, as a {{successful}} businessman, {{to move from the}} Pale of Settlement to which Jews were generally restricted in the Russian Empire. The family moved to Saint Petersburg, a city previously <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> Jews. There, Ovsei adopted the more Russian name Alexander; he was known among family and friends as Sasha, a diminutive for Alexander. The Berkmans lived comfortably, with servants and a summer house. Berkman attended the gymnasium, where he received a classical education with the youth of Saint Petersburg's elite.|$|E

5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to {{the very nature of}} Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried men and women to intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, <b>off-limit</b> <b>to</b> visitors and suitors. It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, School Rumbles Japanese license holder, Media Factory, {{declared}} its titles <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> fan-made subtitled translations—a practice known as fansubbing.2}} The directory website AnimeSuki later removed all links to fansubs of Media Factory's work {{in response to}} a cease-and-desist notice issued by the license holder, although fansub group 'Wannabe Fansubs' continued their fansubbing regardless. Media Factory-owned anime {{has been the subject of}} debate over the validity of fansubbing practice. Proponents believe School Rumble would have more quickly received an English license had fansubs been allowed to circulate more freely, generating viewer interest.|$|E
5|$|Kaniakapūpū {{is located}} {{at the end of an}} unmarked trail off the Pali Highway. The {{property}} is near the Luakaha Falls, and the surrounding area and trail leading up to the site are covered by a forest of invasive bamboo. Periodic clearing is necessary in order to halt the deteriorating effects of invasive root growth. The trail and ruins, which are located in a protected watershed, are officially <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> the public, although state DLNR officials do not regularly monitor the site. Trespassers are subjected to citations if caught.|$|E
5|$|While {{much of the}} {{construction}} in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what {{seems to have been}} a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> construction.|$|E
50|$|Human Rights Watch later accused Syria's {{government}} of hiding hundreds of prisoners held in its crackdown from Arab observers visiting the country, saying Syrian authorities have transferred perhaps hundreds of detainees <b>to</b> <b>off-limits</b> military sites <b>to</b> hide them from Arab League monitors in the country.|$|R

It knew that Hezbollah was not interested in hitting Israeli civilian targets. It adopted a policy of [...] "zero targets" [...] implying that IDF presence was reduced to a minimum whenever the risk of Hezbollah abduction attempts was deemed to be high. Ironically, during alerts, the [...] "red zones" [...] along the border became <b>off-limit</b> <b>to</b> military personal but were open to civilian traffic.

5|$|As {{late as the}} mid-1970s, Doi Mae Salong was {{strictly}} <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> outsiders. Since 1994, Santikhiri has capitalised on its unique history and has developed into a tourist attraction, with its narrow winding streets lined with inns, noodle shops and teashops. As a result, Santikhiri {{has become one of}} Thailand's top ten destinations among backpackers today. The former soldiers had settled down, some of them having married ethnic Chinese brides who crossed the border after the fighting stopped, and others having married local Thais. The old soldiers carry on their normal lives peacefully now, but still retain their Chinese identity; the main language spoken remains Yunnanese. Among their local-born descendants, some have adopted a Thai identity and no longer identify with their Chinese ancestry. As of 2007, General Lue Ye-tien, aged 90 and Tuan's former right-hand man, {{is the leader of the}} group, after taking over the leadership on Tuan's death in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the Pod itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E
5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, to relay reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 to relay its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of {{estimated time of arrival}} for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> civilian aircraft.|$|E
50|$|CRE is {{also home}} to part of the world-famous Calvert Cliffs. The cliffs are made of sand and clay with clearly visible layers.

50|$|The {{inner sanctum}} {{can be reached}} from the middle sanctum after {{climbing}} steps and passing another candi bentar gateway. The inner sanctum is the most sacred area of the temple where the main shrine is located. The main shrine took form of a pelinggih gedong, a pavilion-like shrine building dedicated {{to the spirit of}} Pedanda Manuaba, the founder of the temple. This shrine is dominated with a huge and intertwining banyan tree on its background. To the side of the main shrine is the padmasana, a shrine which took form of a miniature shrine dedicated for the supreme god. There are a couple of pavilions on the inner sanctum used for storage. The pesantian pavilion is used for religious chanting. The Pewedaan Pemangku is a pavilion set aside for priests. The inner sanctum is normally <b>off-limit</b> <b>to</b> visitors, but it is possible to ask permission to the temple priest.|$|R
5|$|Kaniakapūpū ("the {{singing of}} the land shells"), known {{formerly}} as Luakaha ("place of relaxation"), is {{the ruins of the}} former summer palace of King Kamehameha III and Queen Kalama on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Built in the 1840s, and situated in the cool uplands of the Nuʻuanu Valley, it served as the king and queen's summer retreat after the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii moved from Lahaina to Honolulu in 1845. It was famous for being the site of a grand luau attended by an estimated ten thousand guests during the 1847 Hawaiian Sovereignty Restoration Day celebration. The palace had fallen into ruins by 1874; no records exist about its condition in the intervening years. Rediscovered in the 1950s, the site was cleared and efforts were made to stabilize the ruins from further damage by the elements and invasive plant growth. The site remains officially <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> the public and trespassers are subjected to citations, although the site is not regularly monitored.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, the U.S. {{launched}} its most intense and sustained attempt to force North Vietnam into peace negotiations. Almost {{all of the}} targets on the Joint Chiefs' list had been authorized for attack, including airfields that had been previously off limits. Only central Hanoi, Haiphong, and the PRC border area remained prohibited from attack. A major {{effort was made to}} isolate the urban areas by downing bridges and attacking LOCs. Also struck were the Thai Nguyen steel complex (origin of the Pardo's Push), thermal and electrical power plants, ship and rail repair facilities, and warehouses. North Vietnamese MiGs entered the battle en masse, as their capital was threatened and kill ratios fell to one U.S. aircraft lost for every two MiGs. During 1968, MiGs accounted for 22 percent of the 184 American aircraft (75 Air Force, 59 Navy, and five Marine Corps) lost over the north. As a result, operations against the last of North Vietnam's airfields, previously <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> attack, were authorized.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Internet and {{international}} telephone service in Ürümqi remained limited {{for nearly a}} year after the riots. As late as November, most of the Internet was still inaccessible to residents and international phone calls were impossible; as late as December, most web content hosted outside the autonomous region remained <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> all but a few journalists, and residents had to travel to Dunhuang 14 hours away to access the Internet normally. Within the city, only about 100 local sites, such as banks and regional government websites, could be accessed. Both incoming and outgoing international phone calls were disallowed, so Ürümqi residents could only communicate by calling intermediaries in other cities in China who would then place the international calls. The communications blackout generated controversy even within China: Yu Xiaofeng of Zhejiang University criticised the move, and many Ürümqi locals said it hurt businesses and delayed recovery, whereas David Gosset of the Euro-China forum argued that the government had the right to shut down communications for the sake of social stability; some locals believed that getting away from the Internet even improved their quality of life.|$|E

5|$|Out of {{fourteen}} potential water sources {{considered by the}} city – which included Lake Tahoe, the Eel River, and tributaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers– Hetch Hetchy was considered superior for its excellent dam site, abundant sediment-free water, lower cost and hydroelectric potential. At the time, Hetch Hetchy was an isolated, seldom visited subalpine valley, visited intermittently by gold seekers and sheepherders. However, since 1890, Hetch Hetchy Valley and the surrounding lands {{had been part of}} Yosemite National Park and thus <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> utility development, let alone at the grand scale proposed by the city. Even though the valley was not well known to the general public, organizations such as the Sierra Club treasured it for its spectacular beauty, often compared to that of Yosemite Valley itself. Led by naturalist and mountaineer John Muir, the Sierra Club adamantly opposed the city of San Francisco as it sought permission from the federal government to build a dam in the valley.|$|E
5|$|Shelters {{closed by}} September1 and {{residents}} {{returned to their}} homes, although Hatteras Island remained <b>off-limits</b> <b>to</b> everyone but emergency workers for several days. Unemployment across Hatteras rose {{in the wake of}} the damage to local businesses, and many restaurants lost product when their refrigerators failed during the power outages. Residents piled debris from their damaged homes on roads, primarily Highway 12, and workers responded by clearing the debris. The highway was speedily reopened and repaired at a cost of around $1million. Within two weeks of the storm, businesses resumed as cleaning work was under way, and the island was reopened to tourists. Clean-up operations in the region lasted weeks to months. In the three months after the storm, saltwater intrusion into the Cape Hatteras water supply boosted chlorine levels from 40milligrams (0.0014ounces) to 280milligrams (0.01ounces) per liter; it took another three months for the chlorine to decrease to normal concentrations. Around 50homeowners affected by Emily raised their houses to prevent a recurrence, partially funded by flood insurance payments.|$|E
