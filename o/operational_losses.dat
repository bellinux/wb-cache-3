His Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers flying from China were dropping their bombs near their targets only 5% of the time. <b>Operational</b> <b>losses</b> of aircraft and crews were unacceptably high owing to Japanese daylight air defenses and continuing mechanical problems with the B-29.

25|$|Other {{studies of}} the {{fighting}} at Kursk suggest that very few of German armour losses were caused by the IL-2 or any other Soviet aircraft. In fact, total German tank losses in Operation Citadel amounted to 323 totally destroyed, the vast majority to anti-tank guns and armored fighting vehicles. In addition {{it is difficult to}} find any first-hand accounts by German panzer crews on the Eastern Front describing anything more than the occasional loss to direct air attack. The vast majority, around 95%–98%, of tank losses are due to enemy anti-tank guns, tanks, mines, artillery, and infantry assault, or simply abandoned as <b>operational</b> <b>losses</b> like mostly happened during the last eleven months of the war.|$|E

40|$|With few {{previous}} {{data and}} literature {{based on the}} South African banking sector, the key {{aim of this study}} was to contribute further results concerning the effect of <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> events on the reputation of South African banks. The main distinction between this study and previous empirical research is that a small sample of South African banks listed on the JSE, between 2000 and 2014 was used. Insurance companies fell outside the scope of the study. The study primarily focused on identifying reputational risk among Regal Treasury Bank, Saambou Bank, African Bank and Standard Bank. The events announced by these banks occurred between 2000 and 2014. The precise date of the announcement of the operational events was also determined. Stock price data were collected for those banks that had unanticipated <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> announcements (i. e. the event). Microsoft Excel models applied to the reputational loss as the difference between the <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> announcement and the loss in the stock returns of the selected banks. The results indicated significant negative abnormal returns on the announcement day for three of the four banks. For one of the banks it was assumed that the <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> was not significant enough to cause reputational risk. The event methodology similar to previous literature, furthermore examined the behaviour of return volatility after specific <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> events using the sample of banks. The study further aimed at making two contributions. Firstly, to analyse return volatility after <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> announcements had been made among South African banks, and secondly, to compare the sample of affected banks with un-affected banks to further identify whether these events spilled over into the banking industry and the market. The volatility of these four banks were compared to three un-affected South African banks. The results found that the <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> events for Regal Treasury Bank and Saambou Bank had no influence on the unaffected banks. However the <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> events for African Bank and Standard Bank influenced the sample of unaffected banks and the Bank Index, indicating systemic risk. Master...|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} the first press {{cuttings}} regarding operational risk announcements following an <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> event is likely to affect the level of reputational damage incurred by the institutions suffering the loss. The profile of operational risk has increased in recent decades {{becoming one of the}} major risks in the finance industry. Following increasing literature on operational events, reputational risk as a result of <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> events has become a growing area of research. This paper analyses the content of <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> announcements in order to assess whether the content has an effect on the level of reputational damage measured by any stock market decrease greater than the <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> itself. Previously, content analysis has been used to assess connections between earnings and analysts’ reports however; content analysis has not previously been used to test relationships between content of operational announcements and reputational damage. This paper builds on previous reputational effect research, using content analysis as a method to provide further explanation of market overreaction known as the reputational effect. This paper does not demonstrate conclusive evidence to explain the link between the content of narrative <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> disclosures and reputational damage however; it does establish marked areas for further research. Correspondingly, it provides evidence of the effects of specific business lines and event types that have greater negative and positive impacts on the reputational effect...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a tool, based on a Bayesian network model, that provides posteriori predictions of operational risk events, aggregate <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> distributions, and <b>Operational</b> Value-at-Risk, for a structured finance operations unit located within one of Australia&# 039;s major banks. The Bayesian network, based on a previously developed causal framework, has been designed to model the smaller and more frequent, attritional <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> events. Given the limited availability of risk factor event information and <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> data, we rely on the elicitation of subjective probabilities, sourced from domain experts. Parameter sensitivity analysis is performed to validate and check the model&# 039;s robustness against the beliefs of risk management and operational staff. To ensure that the domain&# 039;s evolving risk profile is captured through time, a formal approach to organizational learning is investigated that employs the automatic parameter adaption features of the Bayesian network model. A hypothetical case study is then described to demonstrate model adaption and the application of the tool to <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> forecasting by a business unit risk manager...|$|R
25|$|The {{submarine}} made appearances {{across the}} Sea of Marmara {{over the following}} five days {{to give the impression}} of multiple boats, and several attacks against Turkish ships were made, although all failed because of increasing mechanical problems. News of the submarine's successes was spread to the soldiers ashore to improve morale. On 29 April, AE2 met , one of several submarines that had entered the Dardanelles following the Australian boat's successful attempt. The submarines arranged a rendezvous for the next morning. When AE2 reached the rendezvous point on 30 April, smoke from the torpedo boat Sultanhisar was sighted, so the submarine dove and moved to investigate. At 10:30, about a mile from the torpedo boat, AE2 inexplicably rose and broke the surface. While diving to evade, the boat passed below her safe diving depth; frantic attempts to correct this caused the submarine's stern to break the surface. Sultanhisar immediately fired on the submarine, puncturing the pressure hull in three places near the engine spaces. Stoker ordered the boat's company to evacuate, and scuttled AE2 at 10:45'. All personnel survived the attack and were captured by Sultanhisar, although four died from illness while in captivity. AE2s achievements showed others that the task was possible, and within months Turkish shipping and lines of communication were badly disrupted, with supplies and reinforcements for the Turkish defence of Gallipoli forced to take underdeveloped overland routes. AE2 was the only RAN vessel to be lost as a result of enemy action during World War I, and along with sister boat AE1, the total of the RAN's <b>operational</b> <b>losses</b> in the war.|$|E

40|$|We use robust {{statistical}} methods to analyze <b>operational</b> <b>loss</b> data.

This theory has been aided in the conflicting totals quoted in official records and the apparent lack of detailed surviving reports. For example, some authors claim the Eindhoven airfield attack may have destroyed 141 Hawker Typhoons. RAF loss records refute this claim. Total figures give only 107 operational Typhoons; 17 were destroyed outright, nine damaged beyond repair, 10 badly damaged but repaired and 24 slightly damaged. In a more recent study, Fighter Command Losses of the Second World War: Volume 3, <b>Operational</b> <b>Losses,</b> Aircraft and Crews 1944-1945, the same author states that a report made by No. 85 Group RAF gave 127 operational aircraft destroyed and 133 damaged, while British personnel casualties {{were said to be}} 40 killed (11 pilots; six were killed in the air) and 145 wounded.
