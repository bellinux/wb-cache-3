5|$|Triton and Nereid are unusual {{irregular}} {{satellites and}} are thus treated separately from the other five irregular Neptunian moons, which are more like the outer irregular satellites of the other outer planets. Firstly, they are the largest two known irregular moons in the Solar System, with Triton being almost an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> larger than all other known irregular moons. Secondly, they both have atypically small semi-major axes, with Triton's being over an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> smaller than those of all other known irregular moons. Thirdly, they both have unusual orbital eccentricities: Nereid {{has one of the}} most eccentric orbits of any known irregular satellite, and Triton's orbit is a nearly perfect circle. Finally, Nereid also has the lowest inclination of any known irregular satellite.|$|E

5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{analysis}} considers {{our universe}} as a closed Friedmann universe, dominated by vacuum {{energy in the}} form of a cosmological constant, with cosmological parameters obtained from full mission Planck satellite observations. A few simple assumptions lead to straightforward calculation of general features of large scale structures in the universe and minimum stellar mass as a function of redshift. Those assumptions also generate upper and lower bounds on supermassive black hole mass in relation to total stellar mass of the host galaxy, consistent with observations across four <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> black hole mass and five <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> galactic stellar mass. The results are based only on fundamental constants and measured cosmological parameters. No arbitrary parameters are involved. Comment: Analysis involving no free parameters accounts for observed relation between supermassive black hole mass and total host galaxy stellar mass over four <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> black hole mass and five <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> galaxy mass. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1009. 162...|$|R
5|$|Experiments and ice {{modeling}} {{published in}} 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed.

The greater the deformation of the ice sheet, the more heat is generated.|$|E
5|$|If the {{quantity}} of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated.

5|$|The {{melting point}} of lead—at 327.5°C (621.5°F)—is very low {{compared}} to most metals. Its boiling point of 1749°C (3180°F) is the lowest among the carbon group elements. The electrical resistivity of lead at 20°C is 192 nanoohm-meters, almost an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> {{higher than those of}} other industrial metals (copper at 15.43nΩ·m; gold 20.51nΩ·m; and aluminium at 24.15nΩ·m). Lead is a superconductor at temperatures lower than 7.19K; this is the highest critical temperature of all type-I superconductors and the third highest of the elemental superconductors.|$|E

5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance.

Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum initiated the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee, which unanimously recommended pursuing {{the development of an}} atomic bomb. In July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, and the Tizard Mission's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field. Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E

5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their cavity {{magnetron}} at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC was told {{of their work}} {{and asked if they}} could improve the design. They introduced new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10kW of power at 10cm, an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> better than any existing microwave device. At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not pointing the antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three decades, Kilburn led the {{development}} of a succession of innovative Manchester computers. The first, commenced in 1951, was a development of the Mark I known as the megacycle machine or Meg, that replaced the vacuum tube diodes with solid state ones. This permitted an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnitude</b> increase in the clock rate. To add further speed, Kilburn provided for 10-bit parallel CRT memory. It {{was also one of the}} first computers, if not the first, to have floating point arithmetic. Meg operated for the first time in 1954, and nineteen were sold by Ferranti, six of them to customers overseas.|$|E
