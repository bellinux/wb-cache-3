5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences.

He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.|$|E

In 2001 he became the face of the First World War veterans' association and made frequent public appearances to ensure that awareness of the sacrifices of the First World War was not lost to modern generations. He received many honours and awards for his First World War service and his longevity.|$|E
5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as {{sodium arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood {{but have been}} less frequently used due to their toxicity.

Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the other main retardant types.

5|$|Because the {{pay-per-view}} {{focused on}} the tournament, few major feuds were highlighted. Aside from Owen Hart, the tournament did not figure prominently into the future storylines <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the other participants. The qualifying match between the 1–2–3 Kid and Adam Bomb did, however, help advance a storyline. Bomb and Kwang, both managed by Harvey Wippleman, began feuding shortly after King of the Ring when Wippleman and Kwang turned on Bomb. Bomb began wrestling as a face as a result. Their feud did not end with a major blow off match, however. Instead, it was quietly resolved in a dark match prior to the SummerSlam 1994 broadcast.|$|E
