It immediately faced the strong opposition of the liberal party, the republican faction and {{a wide spectrum of}} the Spanish society. There was nothing personal against the Prince himself, but his father, the Count of Caserta, had been a general in the last Carlist War and had taken part in the looting of the city of Cuenca by Carlist troops. It was feared that Caserta's son marrying Mercedes would bring the Carlist party too close to the Spanish throne. Even the Prince's name - Carlos - aroused suspicion. In addition, the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies was considered the most conservative Catholic dynasty, which worried the liberal party.|$|E

5000|$|Fugue: usually, three- or four-voice {{polyphonic}} {{pieces that}} adhere {{more or less}} strictly to the imitative style. The designation Fugue grave indicates a piece <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character,</b> whereas the Fugue gaie (or gaye) is its opposite. Rarely, four-voice fugal pieces bear the title Quatuor ("quartet"). Nicolas de Grigny cultivated five-voice fugues.|$|R

60|$|The American prairies are of two kinds. Those which lie {{east of the}} Mississippi are {{comparatively}} small, are exceedingly fertile, and {{are always}} surrounded by forests. They are susceptible of high cultivation, and are fast becoming settled. They abound in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana. They labour under the disadvantages of a scarcity of wood and water,--evils <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character,</b> until art has had time to supply the deficiencies of nature. As coal is said to abound in all that region, and wells are generally successful, the enterprise of the emigrants is gradually prevailing against these difficulties.|$|R
60|$|The {{garrison}} was not {{a formidable}} one, consisting only of some thirty Portuguese soldiers, whose appearance did not speak much for the discipline maintained. Their uniforms were worn and rusty in the extreme. They were slovenly in appearance, and wore a look of discontent and hopelessness. A large portion of them, indeed, had been criminals, and had been offered the choice of death or of serving for ten years, which generally meant for life, in the eastern seas. Ned judged that no great reliance could be placed upon this army of scarecrows, {{in the event of}} an attack <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Justice Douglas also {{referenced}} Aldridge {{and concluded}} that the goal of voir dire was to disclose “prejudices <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> character”. He then associated hair growth with prejudice <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character.</b> [...] He points out that “hair growth is symbolic to many of rebellion against traditional society and disapproval of the way the current power structure handles social problems,” and he further acknowledged that for some “people, nonconventional hair growth symbolizes an undesirable lifestyle characterized by unreliability, dishonesty, lack of moral values, communal (communist) tendencies, and the assumption of drug use.” [...] Douglas concluded that denying a petitioner the right to examine this aspect of prejudice was to also deny him an effective means of voir dire.|$|R
60|$|The {{mounting}} tempers of his unnurtured listeners were rebuked by the simple, solemn {{manner of}} the trapper. Ishmael stood sullen and thoughtful; while his companion stole a furtive and involuntary glance at the placid sky, which spread so wide and blue above his head, as if he expected to see the Almighty eye itself beaming from the heavenly vault. But impressions <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character</b> are seldom lasting on minds long indulged in forgetfulness. The hesitation of the squatter was consequently of short duration. The language, however, {{as well as the}} firm and collected air of the speaker, were the means of preventing much subsequent abuse, if not violence.|$|R
50|$|<b>Of</b> a more <b>serious</b> <b>character</b> {{were two}} controversies in which Beza was {{involved}} at this time. The first concerned {{the doctrine of}} predestination and the controversy of Calvin with Jerome Hermes Bolsec. The second referred to the burning of Michael Servetus at Geneva on October 27, 1553. In defense of Calvin and the Genevan magistrates, Beza published, in 1554, the work De haereticis a civili magistratu puniendis (translated into French in 1560).|$|R
6000|$|... "What? how? O do tell me!" [...] cried Marian, {{turning and}} hurrying with her, and {{speaking}} with, such earnestness that Mrs. Lyddell could not doubt of her sympathy now.

60|$|It was {{now clear}} that fighting, and that <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character,</b> was to be undertaken. The Spanish {{commander}} rapidly reconnoitered the position; and saw that here, at least, no flanking movement was possible. He therefore ordered his men to advance, for a direct attack. Being more afraid of the stones from above than of the defenders in the ravine, the Spaniards prepared to advance in skirmishing order; in that way {{they would be able}} to creep up to the barricade of rocks with the least loss, to themselves, from the fire of its defenders; while the stones from above would prove far less dangerous than would be the case upon a solid column.|$|R
60|$|They had, {{on first}} {{arriving}} below, washed {{the blood from}} their faces, and bathed their wounds, which {{were by no means}} <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character.</b> The Fleming agreed with them that, if they separated, there would be no great danger of their being recognized. After taking farewell of the girl, who had all this time been sitting silently by her mother's bedside, they passed through the iron door, preceded by the Fleming carrying a lamp. After passing through the passage they went up a long flight of narrow steps until their course was arrested by a wooden panel. The Fleming applied first his eye and then his ear to a tiny peephole.|$|R
5000|$|The passacaglia was redefined in {{the late}} 1620s by Italian {{composer}} Girolamo Frescobaldi, who transformed it {{into a series of}} continuous variations over a bass (which itself may be varied). Later composers adopted this model, and by the nineteenth century the word came to mean a series of variations over an ostinato pattern, usually <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character.</b> A similar form, the chaconne, was also first developed by Frescobaldi. The two genres are closely related, but since [...] "composers often used the terms chaconne and passacaglia indiscriminately ... modern attempts to arrive at a clear distinction are arbitrary and historically unfounded". In early scholarship, attempts to formally differentiate between the historical chaconne and passacaglia were made, but researchers often came to opposite conclusions.|$|R
6000|$|Xerxes {{admitted}} that what his uncle said was just, but it was, he said, a melancholy subject, {{and so he}} changed the conversation. He asked his uncle whether he still entertained the same doubts and fears in respect to the expedition that he had expressed at Susa when the plan was first proposed in the council. Artabanus replied that he most sincerely hoped that the prognostications of the vision would prove true, {{but that he had}} still great apprehensions of the result. [...] "I have been reflecting," [...] continued he, [...] "with great care on the whole subject, {{and it seems to me}} that there are two dangers <b>of</b> very <b>serious</b> <b>character</b> to which your expedition will be imminently exposed." ...|$|R
60|$|The advance up the Nile did {{not take}} place for some little time, as great {{preparations}} were necessary. Fortunately large numbers of native craft had been captured from the French, and stores were landed and placed on board these {{for the use of the}} troops. Colonel Stewart was in command of the British advanced force which accompanied the Capitan Pasha's division. A large force of gun-boats and rowing-boats were furnished by the fleet, and following the river banks the expedition proceeded up the river. The French resistance was very feeble. Detached parties were taken or driven off, but there was no fighting <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character.</b> For a time Edgar remained with General Hutchinson before Alexandria, then he accompanied him to Rosetta, and, joining the main British division, came up with the Turkish army, that had now been joined by that of the Vizier, and the whole advanced towards Cairo.|$|R
50|$|After 1870, the vogue of parody rapidly declined. The {{decadence}} became {{still more}} apparent when Offenbach {{was no longer}} at hand to assist the two authors with his quaint musical irony, and {{when they had to}} deal with interpreters almost destitute of singing powers. They wrote farces of the old type, consisting of complicated intrigues, with which they cleverly interwove the representation of contemporary whims and social oddities. They generally failed when they attempted comedies <b>of</b> a more <b>serious</b> <b>character</b> and tried to introduce a higher sort of emotion. A solitary exception must be made in the case of Froufrou (1869), which, owing perhaps to the admirable talent of Aimée Desclée, remains their unique Succès de larmes. During this period, they wrote the libretto to Carmen but it was a sideshow to their other work.|$|R
50|$|Doctrine of Mistake - To {{invoke the}} {{equitable}} jurisdiction for a voluntary disposition {{to be set}} aside there needed to be a mistake on the donor’s part either as to the legal effect of the transaction (not as to its tax orother legal consequences) or as to an existing fact that was basic to the transaction proposed by the trustees, <b>of</b> so <b>serious</b> a <b>character</b> as to render it unjust for the donee to retain property, relying on Morgan v Ashcroft 1937 3 All ER 92, per Lord Greene MR, and Ogilvie v Littleboy (1897) 13 TLR 399, 400. Accordingly, the mistake made were not basic enough.|$|R
6000|$|In {{those very}} days while Arthur Coningsby was getting read amid the Scottish moors, [...] "in June, 1833," [...] Sterling, at Bonn in the Rhine-country, fell {{in with his}} old tutor and friend, the Reverend Julius Hare; one with whom he always delighted to communicate, {{especially}} on such topics as then altogether occupied him. A man <b>of</b> cheerful <b>serious</b> <b>character,</b> <b>of</b> much approved accomplishment, of perfect courtesy; surely of much piety, in all senses of that word. Mr. Hare had quitted his scholastic labors and distinctions, some time ago; the call or opportunity for taking orders having come; and as Rector of Herstmonceux in Sussex, a place patrimonially and otherwise endeared to him, was about entering, under the best omens, on a new course of life. He was now on his return from Rome, and a visit of some length to Italy. Such a meeting could not but be welcome and important to Sterling in such a mood. They had much earnest conversation, freely communing on the highest matters; especially of Sterling's purpose to undertake the clerical profession, in which course his reverend friend could not but bid him good speed.|$|R

Not that Mrs. Wade's disturbance was <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character.</b> She had passed the acute stage of widowhood by at least two years, and the slight redness of her soft eyelids {{as well as the}} droop of her pretty mouth were merely the recognized outward and visible signs of the grievously minded religious community in which she lived. The mourning she still wore was also partly in conformity with the sad-colored garments of her neighbors, and the necessities of the rainy season. She was in comfortable circumstances, the mistress of a large ranch in the valley, which had lately become more valuable by the extension of a wagon road through its centre. She was simply worrying whether she should go to a [...] "sociable" [...] ending with [...] "a dance"--a daring innovation of some strangers--at the new hotel, or continue to eschew such follies, that were, according to local belief, unsuited to [...] "a vale of tears." ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{injuries}} {{resulting from}} accidents have {{been regarded as}} a serious and social issue all over the world. Injuries concern all age categories. A significant portion is comprised by injuries resulting from sports activities, such as football. Football is a popular sport played by {{an increasing number of}} people, which leads to a higher occurrence of injuries attributable to this sports activity. Such injuries may be <b>of</b> a very <b>serious</b> <b>character</b> as they require long treatment and sometimes even termination of the player´s sports activity. These factors induce the necessity to continue implementing new precautionary measures to prevent these undesirable consequences to maximum possible extent. The goal of my bachelor´s thesis is to discover the frequency and seriousness of injuries resulting from accident among football players - members of the TJ Sokol Dobsice football club. The set goal has been achieved. The conducted research should have proven or invalidated the following set hypotheses: H 1 : With increasing age increases the frequency of injuries in the TJ Sokol Dobsice football team and H 2 : More than half of the injuries occurred in the 2009 - 2010 season in the TJ Sokol Dobsice team are not <b>of</b> a <b>serious</b> <b>character.</b> The H 1 has been proven. As it followed from the survey based on a questionnaire, that the product category with 15 accidents happened (11 %), 27 students in the category of accidents (20 %), adolescents in 38 accidents (28 %) men 57 injuries (41 %). The second hypothesis has been proven. Only 6 players (21 %) of those who were due to injuries in hospital, had to be hospitalized due to injury, 4 players (5 %) operated on and 9 players (12 %) was needed treatment longer than 3 months. As it follows from the results, 85 players (78 %) use protective devices, 99 players (91 %) do stretching physical exercises prior to match or training, however, only 21 players (19 %) do stretching physical exercises after match. The fact that 36 players (33 %) start fighting with intention to injure the adversary is perceived as alarming as well. It would be possible to share the results with the coaches of TJ Sokol Dobsice who could lead their players to accept higher responsibility and who could accentuate prevention of injuries resulting from accidents...|$|R
60|$|They {{went into}} the dining-room, where the luncheon was set, and while Ida allowed Mr. Quest to cut her some cold boiled beef, an {{operation}} in {{which he did not}} seem to be very much at home, she came to a rapid conclusion in her own mind. She had seen clearly enough from her father's face that his interview with the lawyer had been <b>of</b> a most <b>serious</b> <b>character,</b> but she knew that the chances were that she would never be able to get its upshot out of him, for the old gentleman had a curious habit of keeping such unpleasant matters to himself until he was absolutely forced by circumstances to reveal them. She also knew that her father's affairs were in a most critical condition, for this she had extracted from him on the previous night, and that if any remedy was to be attempted it must be attempted at once, and on some heroic scale. Therefore, she made up her mind to ask her /bete noire/, Mr. Quest, what the truth might be.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{perfectly}} correct. Two days later, {{as it turned}} out, Charles received a [...] "confidential" [...] letter from Paris, purporting {{to come from the}} head of a second-rate financial house with which he had had dealings over the Craig-Ellachie Amalgamation--by this time, I ought to have said, an accomplished union. It was a letter of small importance in itself--a mere matter of detail; but it paved the way, so Medhurst thought, to some later development <b>of</b> more <b>serious</b> <b>character.</b> Here once more the man's singular foresight was justified. For, in another week, we received a second communication, containing other proposals of a delicate financial character, which would have involved the transference of some two thousand pounds {{to the head of the}} Parisian firm at an address given. Both these letters Medhurst cleverly compared with those written to Charles before, in the names of Colonel Clay and of Graf von Lebenstein. At first sight, it is true, the differences between the two seemed quite enormous: the Paris hand was broad and black, large and bold; while the earlier manuscript was small, neat, thin, and gentlemanly. Still, when Medhurst pointed out to us certain persistent twists in the formation of his capitals, and certain curious peculiarities in the relative length of his t's, his l's, his b's, and his h's, we could see for ourselves he was right; both were the work of one hand, writing in the one case with a sharp-pointed nib, very small, and in the other with a quill, very large and freely.|$|R

5000|$|Satie's {{fortunes}} improved {{significantly in}} 1916 with the gradual resumption of cultural life in Paris. He gave a run-through of the Avant-dernières pensées during a concert of the Société Lyre et Palette on April 18 before the official premiere at the Galerie Thomas. The latter {{was part of}} a benefit [...] "for artists affected by the War" [...] sponsored by Germaine Bongard, sister of fashion designer Paul Poiret, and with a programme designed by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. Thanks in part to Satie's patron Misia Sert the event attracted Le Tout-Paris. Biographer Mary E. Davis noted, [...] "For Satie the evening chez Bongard marked a signiﬁcant career juncture, establishing him ﬁrmly as a darling of the creative set and laying the groundwork for his entrée into the city’s loftiest artistic domains." [...] Rouart-Lerolle published the score later in 1916 but by then Satie was moving on to bigger things: his ballet Parade (1917) was in the planning stage and {{towards the end of the}} year he would receive the commission for Socrate (1918). The one-off Neoclassical parody Sonatine bureaucratique (1917) provided what Steven Moore Whiting called [...] "the culmination and also the end of Satie's humoristic piano music." [...] His final solo keyboard compositions, the Nocturnes (1919) and Premier Menuet (1920), were <b>of</b> a markedly <b>serious</b> <b>character.</b>|$|R
