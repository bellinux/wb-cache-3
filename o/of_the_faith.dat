5|$|In the {{circumstances}} {{it was hardly}} possible for the new king to show adaptability or tolerance or diplomatic skill, which are the fruit of long experience in human relationships.

5|$|The Kingdom of Nri was a religio-polity, {{a sort of}} theocratic state, that {{developed}} in the central heartland of the Igbo region. The Nri had a taboo symbolic code with six types.

5|$|Elizabeth {{has held}} many titles and honorary {{military}} positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders {{in her own}} countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world.

Additional styles include Defender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Faith</b> and Duke of Lancaster.

5|$|In East Anglia, Rædwald's {{conversion}} was {{not universally}} accepted by his household {{or his own}} queen. According to the historian Steven Plunkett, she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default in part from {{his commitment to the}} Christian faith. As a result, he kept in the temple two altars, one pagan and another dedicated to Christ. Bede, writing decades later, described how Ealdwulf of East Anglia, a grandson of Rædwald's brother Eni, recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy. It may have been located at Rendlesham, emerging focus of the regio of the Wuffing dynasty, according to Plunkett. Barbara Yorke explains the dual nature of the temple by suggesting that Rædwald would have been unprepared to reject his old religion and fully embrace Christianity, as this act would have been a public acknowledgment of his inferiority to Æthelberht. Rædwald's lack of commitment towards Christianity earned him the enmity of Bede, who regarded him as a renouncer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faith.</b>|$|E

5|$|Islamic {{contact with}} South India began {{as early as}} the 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and Arab lands. Jumma Masjids existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century and many mosques flourished on the Malabar coast by the early 14th century. Muslim {{settlers}} married local women; their children were known as Mappillas (Moplahs) and were actively involved in horse trading and manning shipping fleets. The interactions between the Vijayanagara empire and the Bahamani Sultanates to the north increased the presence of Muslims in the south. The introduction of Christianity began {{as early as the}} 8th century as shown by the finding of copper plates inscribed with land grants to Malabar Christians. Christian travelers wrote of the scarcity of Christians in South India in the Middle Ages, promoting its attractiveness to missionaries. The arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th century and their connections through trade with the empire, the propagation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> by Saint Xavier (1545) and later the presence of Dutch settlements fostered the growth of Christianity in the south.|$|E
5|$|Lakkanna Dandesa, the king's prime {{minister}} and provincial governor, wrote an encyclopaedia on the beliefs and rites of the Veerashaiva faith titled Sivatattva Chintamani.

Numerous references are made in this work to the capital city of Vijayanagara and its suburbs. Jakkanarya, a minister in the court, not only wrote Nurondusthala (one hundred and one stories) but also was patron to Kumarabanka Natha and Mahalinga Deva, poet-saints who wrote vachana poems and books on the Shaiva philosophy (called shatsthala). Other writers of the 15th century worthy of mention are Kavi Linga (1490), court poet of King Saluva NarasimhaI, Adrisappa (Praudaraya Charitra), Bommarasa (Soundara Purana), Kallarasa (Janavasya), Chaturmukha Bommarasa (Revanasiddhesvara Purana), Suranga Kavi (Trisashti Puratanara Charitre), and Nilakanthacharya (Aradhya Charitra), court poet of the Ummattur chieftain Virananjendra.|$|E
