40|$|The joint {{utilization}} of autoscaled data {{such as the}} F 2 peak critical frequency foF 2, the propagation factor M(3000) F 2 and the electron density profile, coming from two reference ionospheric stations (Rome and Gibilmanna), the regional (SIRMUP) and global (IRI) ionospheric models, can provide a valid tool for obtaining a real-time three-dimensional (3 -D) electron density mapping of the ionosphere. Preliminary results of the proposed 3 -D model are shown by comparing the vertical electron density profiles given by the model with the ones measured at three testing ionospheric stations (Athens, Roquetes and S. Vito). Mostly at the solar terminator the vertical electron density profile extracted from the proposed 3 -D model is more representative of the real conditions of the ionosphere than the electron density profile extracted from the IRI-URSI model. Additional tests are planned for geomagnetically disturbed periods, considering more than two reference ionospheric stations, and by using a new <b>oblique-incidence</b> <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> campaign between Rome (41. 8 ° N, 12. 5 °E) and Chania, Greece (35. 7 °N, 24. 0 °E), in order to compare the results from radio path measurements with those obtained by the ray tracing technique applied to the real-time 3 D pictures of the ionosphere specified by the new developed tool...|$|E

A major geomagnetic storm with gradual commencement at about 01 : 00  UT was observed on 31  March  2001. In this paper, we present and discuss salient features from the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements {{carried out at}} S. J. Campos on the three consecutive UT days 30  March (quiet), 31  March (disturbed) and 1  April (recovery) 2001. During most of the storm period, the fo F 2 values showed negative phase, whereas during the two storm-time peaks, large F-region height variations were observed. In order to study the longitudinal differences observed in the F-region during the storm, the simultaneous <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements carried out at S. J. Campos, El Arenosillo (37. 1 ° N, 6. 7 ° W), Spain, Okinawa (26. 3 ° N, 127. 8 ° E), Japan and Wakkanai (45. 5 ° N, 141. 7 ° E), Japan, during the period 30  March- 1  April 2001, have been analyzed. A comparison of the observed ionospheric parameters (h'F and fo F 2) in the two longitudinal zones (1. Japanese and 2. Brazilian-Spanish) shows both similarities and differences associated with the geomagnetic disturbances. Some latitudinal differences are also observed in the two longitudinal zones. In addition, global ionospheric TEC maps from the worldwide network of GPS receivers are presented, showing widespread TEC changes during both the main and recovery phases of the storm. The <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements are compared with the ASPEN-TIMEGCM model runs appropriate for the storm conditions. The model results produce better agreement during the quiet period. During the disturbed period, some of the observed F-region height variations are well reproduced by the model results.

The geomagnetic storm attained | D st | max = 472 nT at 20 : 00 UT (20 November). In this paper we present the simultaneous <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> observations, using the Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosondes (CADIs), carried out from Palmas (PAL; 10. 2 ° S, 48. 2 ° W; dip latitude 5. 5 ° S; a near equatorial station) and São José dos Campos (SJC; 23. 2 ° S, 45. 9 ° W; dip latitude 17. 6 ° S; station located under the crest of equatorial ionospheric anomaly), Brazil. In addition, total electron content (TEC) measurements from several GPS receiving stations in the Brazilian sector during this storm are presented. The simultaneous <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> observations carried out at SJC and PAL, and TEC observations on 3 consecutive days viz., 19 November (quiet), 20 November (disturbed) and 21 November (recovery phase) are presented. Salient features from the ionospheric observations in the Brazilian sector during the superstorm are discussed. The difference in the observed ionospheric response at the two stations (PAL and SJC) is considerable. This is not surprising given that PAL is close to the magnetic equator and SJC is near the crest of the equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA). It should be pointed out that soon after the SSC (about 4 h later), the F-region critical frequency (fo F 2), the F-region peak height (hp F 2), and variations of virtual heights at different frequencies (iso-frequency plots) all show wavelike oscillations of the F-region during daytime at both the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> stations.
