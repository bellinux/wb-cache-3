5|$|There are 12 {{universities}} in Switzerland, ten {{of which are}} maintained at cantonal level and usually offer a range of non-technical subjects. The first university in Switzerland was founded in 1460 in Basel (with a faculty of medicine) and has a tradition <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> medical research in Switzerland. The largest university in Switzerland is the University of Zurich with nearly 25,000 students.The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ) and the University of Zurich are listed 20th and 54th respectively, on the 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities.|$|E
5|$|Turkey has a {{sizeable}} automotive industry, which produced over 1.3 million motor vehicles in 2015, ranking as the 14th largest producer in the world. Turkish shipbuilding exports were worth US$1.2 billion in 2011. The major export markets are Malta, Marshall Islands, Panama and the United Kingdom. Turkish shipyards have 15 floating docks {{of different sizes}} and one dry dock. Tuzla, Yalova, and İzmit have developed into dynamic shipbuilding centres. In 2011, there were 70 active shipyards in Turkey, with another 56 being built. Turkish shipyards are highly regarded both for the production <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> oil tankers up to 10,000 dwt and also for their mega yachts.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{served as}} a member or {{chairman}} of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, {{he was a member}} of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947–52), he was also a member of the Commonwealth government's Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> biological weapons to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled War from a Biological Angle. Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the recognition levels of the hazard symbols <b>of</b> some <b>chemicals</b> <b>of</b> science teacher candidates. The study conducted by survey method and it includes 170 students studying at ESOGU Education Faculty, Department of Science Education in Elementary Education in 2009 - 2010 academic year. Percentage, values of frequency, arithmetic mean and standard deviation values of the data were calculated and comparisons were made. The results of the study shows that students of Science Teaching cannot recognise the hazard symbols <b>of</b> <b>chemicals,</b> <b>and</b> there is a significant difference between students’ recognition level of hazard levels <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> <b>and</b> their levels; and there is no significant difference between students’ recognition level of hazard symbols <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> <b>and</b> gender, interest in chemistry lesson, examining the labels <b>of</b> <b>chemicals</b> <b>and</b> laboratory safety...|$|R

25|$|In 1981, a {{group of}} Soviet {{scientists}} published the results <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> structural characterization of carbon nanoparticles produced by a thermocatalytical disproportionation of carbon monoxide. Using TEM images and XRD patterns, the authors suggested that their “carbon multi-layer tubular crystals” were formed by rolling graphene layers into cylinders. They speculated that by rolling graphene layers into a cylinder, many different arrangements of graphene hexagonal nets are possible. They suggested two possibilities of such arrangements: circular arrangement (armchair nanotube) and a spiral, helical arrangement (chiral tube).|$|E
