40|$|Background: <b>Oral</b> <b>care</b> {{is proven}} to prevent {{colonization}} of pathogenic organisms in the oral cavity and decrease rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). To improve patient health outcomes, one local hospital sought to implement an <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> policy founded on evidence-based research. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine best practice for <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in an intensive care unit. The study is an integral part of creating a comprehensive <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> policy and guide for purchasing hospital-wide <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> products. Methods: <b>Oral</b> <b>care</b> policies at local facilities with intensive care units were reviewed and compared. Clinical practice guidelines and peer-reviewed studies were also utilized. Results: Research revealed inconsistent <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practices with regards to frequency, oral cleansing agent, and concentration of oral cleansing agent. Discussion/Recommendation: The study was limited by the lack of evidence-based <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practices. A multivariable research study needs to be conducted to ascertain the best practices of frequency, oral cleansing agent, and concentration of oral cleansing agent for <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> Areas of interest include patient refusal rates, ventilated versus non-ventilated patients, and acuity of care...|$|R
40|$|Context: <b>Oral</b> <b>care</b> is an {{essential}} aspect of critical care nursing. However, no study has been published on <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practice of Iranian and Asian nurses. The majority of published studies were conducted in western and European countries. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the nursesâ�² opinions and practice about <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in patients under mechanical ventilation. Settings and Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 130 intensive care nurses from 6 intensive care units in the university hospitals of Iran. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was used to gather the data and charts of 45 patients were evaluated. Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistical analysis are presented. Results: <b>Oral</b> <b>care</b> obtained the 7 th rank in prority and a mean score of 5. 7 {{on a scale of}} 1 - 10. More than 21 of subjects did not perform <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in their usual duties. High load of writing tasks and personnel shortages were the major barriers to <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> Only 20 of the patientsâ�² charts contained a report on <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> Conclusions: Nurses did not consider <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in intensive care patients as a high priority. This result highlights the need to continue education programs on <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> for improving the knowledge and attitude of intensive care nurses with respect to <b>oral</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R
40|$|In recent years, <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> has {{attracted}} much attention in relation to pathogenesis of aspiration pneumonitis. Our unit has organized an <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> team of dentists and dental hygienists, and has started <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> intervention for inpatients beginning this fiscal year. Surveys were conducted among ward nursing staff {{with a view to}} understand the actual status of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in our clinic. Eighty-five percent of nursing staff reported an interest in <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and 98 % said that they felt <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> was a necessity. The percentage of nursing staff who were implementing <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> daily was 41 % and most were implementing it three times a day taking approximately 2 - 4 min in each case. The most used method involved a sponge dental brush and the second most involved a toothbrush. The most used oral rinse was povidone-iodine (Isodine) and the second most were over-the-counter oral rinses. These results showed that the awareness level about <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in ward nursing staff is higher than expected, and indicated that establishing standardized guidelines is an urgent task. It is suggested that we, as expert dentists and dental hygienists, need to actively intervene in <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|In 2014, an {{advisory}} report {{was published by}} a national working committee concerning how the current, applied method of evidence-based guideline development in healthcare {{can be used in}} <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in a national guideline programme.

40|$|Background: It is {{reported}} that hospitalised adults require daily <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> to prevent respiratory infections and maintain oral health but patient oral health declines in hospital. Enhancing {{knowledge and attitudes}} has not proven effective for changing behaviours or improving oral health. Reports suggest that some nurses find providing <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> unpleasant, therefore, emotions may influence care provision. Aim: To understand how nurses’ and student nurses’ emotional experiences and reactions influence the provision of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> for hospitalised adult patients. Methods: The initial study explored emotional experiences, reactions and <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practices. Eight focus groups and ten one-to-one semi-structured interviews with 48 subjects were used to collect data. These were analysed with Grounded Theory. A second study developed and tested methods to measure student nurses’ emotions towards <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> This used a self-report questionnaire, interviews and Stroop tests. In the final study, 248 student nurses completed a revised self-report questionnaire, a disgust sensitivity questionnaire and two <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> attitude measures; 41 participants additionally completed emotional Stroop tests, implicit association tests and interviews. Qualitative data were analysed with thematic analysis. Χ 2 tests, correlations, and Principal Component Analysis were used to analyse quantitative data. Results: Nurses and student nurses experience emotions towards the social, moral and physical aspects of providing oral care; emotions vary with different situations. Unclean mouths are associated with unpleasantness. Failure to provide <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> evokes moral disgust and anxiety. Providing <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> can evoke anxiety and disgust in unpleasant situations, this leads to student nurses reporting altering <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> procedures. Conclusions: Nurses’ and student nurses’ emotions of disgust and anxiety influence <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> Although these emotions can motivate nurses to provide care, anxiety and disgust {{can lead to the}} selection of procedures that avoid aspects of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> thus reducing the quality of <b>care</b> provided. Nurses’ <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> training programmes need to address these emotions {{to improve the quality of}} <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> for patients in hospitals...|$|R

40|$|Background: Considering the {{importance}} of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in the ICU {{and the lack of}} comprehensive protocols for <b>oral</b> <b>care,</b> the present study was conducted to review the available literature on <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and to present an evidence-based protocol for <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in ICU patients. Materials and Methods: Fifty-four full-texts original articles, systematic reviews and meta-analysis papers on mouth care in ICU patients published from 2001 to the end of 2010 in English and indexed in the Pubmed, Ovid, Elsevier, and ProQuest databases were searched by using the relative key-words (e. g. <b>oral</b> <b>care,</b> mouth care, critical care, and intensive care) in the title or abstract and then evaluated. Results: ICU patients are prone to dental plaque and VAP due to conditions such as impaired immunological deficiency, the presence of an endotracheal tube, drug side effects, and difficulty with swallowing food and fluids. Due to the lack of a standard protocol for <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in ICU, <b>oral</b> <b>cares</b> haven't properly done in ICU wards. Studies have shown that some <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> interventions (e. g. tooth brushing with toothpaste, brushing all surfaces of teeth, tongue and palate, and also the use of chlorhexidine solution) have largely reduced the incidence of VAP in ICU patients. Conclusion: The results revealed that the oral hygiene may reduce the incidence of VAP. Hence assessing patients, implementing mechanical and pharmaceutical interventions are important in <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and applying the protocol presented in this study can improve the oral health of patients in the ICU...|$|R
40|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>care</b> is an {{important}} feature of nursing; {{it is known that}} oropharynx is considered the main reservoir of bacterial colonization, so the removal of oral infection is a major duty of all health care providers, particularly nurses. We performed this study to explore endotracheal tube and <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practices for mechanically ventilated patients of Jordanian intensive care nurses, and to study Jordanian intensive care nurses' practices during, prior to, and post endotracheal tube and <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> for mechanically ventilated patients. Endotracheal tube and <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> of Jordanian intensive care nurses for mechanically ventilated patients was compared with recommendations for endotracheal tube and <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> of American Association of Critical Care Nurses and guidelines of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Non- participant structured observational design was conducted using a 24 -item structured observational schedule. The findings show that nurses different in their <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practices; did not follow American Association of Critical Care Nurses recommendations; and therefore delivered lower-quality <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> than predictable.

Results: This mixed-methods study involved an online survey of 35 nurses and residential care workers, verified and expanded upon by one focus group of six residential care workers. Results reflected that nurses and residential care workers (a) {{have little or no}} training in recommended <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> techniques, and (b) lack access to the equipment and professional supports needed to provide adequate <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> Basic <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> might be performed less than once per day in some settings and patients with problematic behaviours, dysphagia, or sensitivities associated with poor oral health might be less likely to receive <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> While lack of time was highlighted as a barrier in the survey findings, focus group members considered that time should not be a barrier to prioritising <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practices on a daily basis in residential care settings. Conclusion: There are several important discrepancies between the recommendations made in evidence-based guidelines for <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and the implementation of such practices in residential care settings.

40|$|In the {{international}} literature, {{the most commonly}} recommended intervention for managing oral mucositis is good <b>oral</b> <b>care,</b> assuming that nurses have sufficient knowledge and skills to perform <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> correctly. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate if knowledge and skills about <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> improve when education in <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> is provided to nurses in charge of patients who are at risk of oral mucositis. This intervention study consists of a baseline test on the knowledge and skills of nurses of the haematology wards of two different hospitals. <b>Oral</b> <b>care</b> education sessions were given in one hospital and follow-up tests were performed in both hospitals.

40|$|Poor {{oral hygiene}} has been {{associated}} with ventilator-acquired pneumonia. Yet providing <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> for intubated patients is problematic. Furthermore, concerns that <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> could raise intracranial pressure (ICP) may cause nurses to use foam swabs to provide oral hygiene rather than tooth brushing as recommended by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. Evidence is needed to support the safety of toothbrushing during <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> We therefore evaluated ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) during <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> with a manual or electric toothbrush in intubated patients in a neuroscience intensive care unit (ICU). As part of a larger 2 -year, prospective, randomized clinical trial, 47 adult neuroscience ICU patients with an ICP monitor received <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> with a manual or electric toothbrush. ICP and CPP were recorded before, during, and after <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> over the first 72 h of admission. Groups did not differ significantly in age, gender, or severity of injury. Of 807 ICP and CPP measurements obtained before, during, and after <b>oral</b> <b>care,</b> {{there were no significant differences}} in ICP (P = 0. 72) or CPP (P = 0. 68) between toothbrush methods. Analysis of pooled data from both groups revealed a significant difference across the three time points (Wilks' lambda, 12. 56; P < 0. 001; partial eta(2), 0. 36).

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{care home}} (N) staff knowledge of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> {{in comparison to}} NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) guidelines. To identify barriers to delivering <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and determine if Oral Health Educator (OHE) training had an effect upon staff knowledge of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> delivery. Setting: The study was undertaken within Greater Glasgow, 2005 to 2007. Subjects and Methods: From 33 care homes (N), 28 participated in data gathering comprising 109 staff. A ‘knowledge check-list’ based upon daily <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> protocol from NHS QIS Best Practice Statement (BPS) served as template for knowledge assessment. An OHE undertook small group discussions related to the BPS in a sub-group of original participants and {{a second round of}} data collected. Results: The majority of staff (n= 86, 79 %) agreed that residents required assistance with <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and placed <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> (n= 85, 78 %) as a moderate to high priority. Only 57 % of managers and 49 % of nurses had received training in <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> Most staff (79 % of managers, 85 % of nurses) were unaware of the NHS QIS BPS. Deficiencies in knowledge of key areas within the BPS were identified. Between pre- and post-OHE training, significant differences were identified in prioritisation of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> (p = 0. 009), perceived competence (p = 0. 005) and confidence giving advice (p = 0. 004).

40|$|Introduction: The oral cavity, in {{palliative care}} patients, is {{commonly}} the first site of discomfort {{and loss of}} function. <b>Oral</b> <b>care,</b> however, is often overlooked for these patients. Palliative <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> is a poorly researched area and the experiences of patients, their carers and relatives are seldom explored. Aims: To explore the <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> experiences of palliative care patients, {{from the perspective of}} their carers and/or relatives. Methods: Blogs and discussion forums, on public internet sites, were used as the data source. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Eight blogs and eight discussion forums fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analysed. Three main themes were identified: symptoms, procedures and emotions. Authors described oral symptoms that they could observe themselves and perceived as being distressing. There was an association between <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> procedures and the oral symptoms observed. However routine <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> procedures were poorly described. Conclusion: The data on <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> provided by the blogs and discussion forums included was scarce. It provided, however, preliminary insights into this poorly researched area.

40|$|<b>Oral</b> health <b>care</b> is an {{essential}} aspect of nursing care. There are many variances in the quality and frequency of the <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> that is delivered to patients by nursing staff, such as <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> being given a low priority {{when compared to other}} nursing <b>care</b> elements, <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> being neglected, and <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> delivery being dependent on the nurse’s knowledge of oral hygiene. Additionally, there are some particular patient groups known to be at risk of oral health problems or who have existing oral diseases and conditions. As people age their susceptibility increases to chronic and life-threatening diseases, and they can be at increased risk of acute infections increases compromised by ageing immune systems. The aim of this literature review was to ignite the discussion related to the <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practices of nurses for older acute medical hospitalised patients. The review revealed that nursing staff know that good nursing includes <b>oral</b> health <b>care,</b> but this knowledge does not always mean that <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> is administered. <b>Oral</b> health <b>care</b> seems to be separated from other nursing activities and is not discussed when nursing care plans are written, only when oral problems are obvious...|$|R
40|$|The {{omission}} of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> {{is linked to}} increased nurse workload and may contribute to serious patient infection and growing healthcare costs. Therefore, ineffective <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> comprises a significant patient safety issue across healthcare settings internationally. As studies have demonstrated {{a positive relationship between}} Nurs Leadersh (Tor Ont) and improved patient outcomes, it is imperative that leaders seek effective approaches to facilitate contextual exploration of barriers and facilitators for resolution of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> delivery problems. One approach to improved processes of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> is the creative engagement of front-line clinicians in the problems they confront in everyday practice. By drawing upon the role and process of facilitation, we outline two projects, located in Australia and Canada, that engaged front-line nurses, health leaders, and researchers as partners to identify a path to improved <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> delivery.

40|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>care</b> is {{a crucial}} routine for {{patients}} with dysphagia that, when completed routinely, can prevent the development of aspiration pneumonia. There is no standardised protocol for <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> within government hospitals in South Africa. This study aimed to investigate the outcome of an <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> protocol. Participants were patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, with either stroke or traumatic brain injury as the underlying medical pathology, and nurses. All participants were recruited from one tertiary level government hospital in Gauteng, South Africa. 139 nurses {{participated in the study}} and received training on the <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> protocol. There were two groups of participants with oropharyngeal dysphagia. Group one (study group, n = 23) was recruited by consecutive sampling, received regular <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and were not restricted from drinking water; however, all other liquids were restricted. Group two (comparison group, n = 23) was recruited via a retrospective record review, received inconsistent <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and were placed on thickened liquids or liquid restricted diets.

40|$|Aims and objectives: To (1) {{investigate}} the organisation, provision {{and practice of}} <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in typical UK stroke units; (2) explore stroke survivors', carers' and healthcare professionals' experiences and perceptions about the barriers and facilitators to receiving and undertaking <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in stroke units. Background: Cerebrovascular disease and oral health are major global health concerns. Little {{is known about the}} provision, challenges and practice of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in the stroke unit setting, and there are currently no evidence-based practice guidelines. Design: Cross-sectional survey of 11 stroke units across Greater Manchester and descriptive qualitative study using focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Methods: A self-report questionnaire was used to survey 11 stroke units in Greater Manchester. Data were then collected through two focus groups (n = 10) with healthcare professionals and five semi-structured interviews with stroke survivors and carers. Focus group and interview data were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using framework approach. Results: Eleven stroke units in Greater Manchester responded to the survey. Stroke survivors and carers identified a lack of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practice and enablement by healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals identified a lack of formal training to conduct <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> for stroke patients, inconsistency in the delivery of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and no set protocols or use of formal oral assessment tools. Conclusion: <b>Oral</b> <b>care</b> post-stroke could be improved by increasing healthcare professionals' awareness, understanding and knowledge of the potential health benefits of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> post-stroke. Further research is required to develop and evaluate the provision of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in stroke care to inform evidence-based education and practice.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{people suffer}} from dry mouth (xerostomia) due to {{radiotherapy}} treatment of {{head and neck}} cancer, diseases like Sjogren’s syndrome or as adverse effects to prescribed medications. Salivary substitute products like gels or sprays are often used for treatment. Efficacy of those <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> products are regularly assessed by validated or even not validated questionnaires. To determine the adhesion effect over time more objectively a new and sensitive method was established. The following {{study was designed to}} assess the dwell time of different <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> products in vitro. Method Two different types of surfaces were covered with <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> products and washed using a definite protocol with artificial saliva salt solution. First, <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> gels or <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> sprays were spread to a polystyrene surface of 2. 25  cm 2, then onto cell based three-dimensional gingiva models. The surfaces were washed ten times with artificial saliva salt solution. The resulting washing solutions were examined using mid infrared spectroscopy in order to detect ingredients of the <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> products. Results All assessed <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> gels or <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> sprays and their components were detected very sensitive. Even traces of the products were detected in the eluent and thus enabled to differentiate the dwell times of the different products. In general, the dwell time of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> gels on polystyrene or gingiva models was longer than that of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> sprays. The use of gingiva models improved the differentiation between different products. Conclusions MIR spectroscopy {{turned out to be a}} sensitive method to detect salivary substitutes. Differences between single components and different products can be detected. The described method is a simple, reliable and easy process to evaluate the dwell time of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> products in vitro and thus a useful tool to design optimised salivary substitute products.

40|$|Oral {{health is}} {{essential}} for the general well being of the individual and collectively for the health of the population. Oral health can be maintained by routine dental care and visits to dental professionals, but accessing professional dental care may be a continuing difficulty in vulnerable older adult population. Many older adults are not frequent users of dental <b>care,</b> though <b>oral</b> health is crucial to their well-being and overall health. Access to care is the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes. ^ Objectives: The aims of this review are to (i) to analyze and elucidate the relationship between socio-economic disparities in gender, ethnicity, poverty status, education and the continuing public issue of access to <b>oral</b> <b>care,</b> (ii) to identify the underlying causes through which these factors can affect access to <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> This review will provide a knowledgeable basis for development of interventions to provide adequate access to <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in older adults and implementing policies to ensure access to oral care; through highlighting the various socio economic factors that affect access to <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> among older adults. ^ Methods: This paper used a purposeful review of literature on socioeconomic disparities in access to <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> among older adults. The references considered in this review included all the relevant articles, surveys and reports published in English language, since the year 1985 to 2010, in the United States. The articles selected were scrutinized for relevancy to the topic of access to <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and which included discussions of the effects of gender, ethnicity, poverty status, educational status in accessing <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> ^ Results: Evidence confirmed the continuing disparity in access to <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> among older adults. The possible links identified were gender inequality, ethnic differences, income levels and educational differences affecting access to <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> The underlying causes linking these factors with access to <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> were established. ^ Conclusion: The analysis of the literature review findings supported the prevalence of disparities in gender, ethnicity, income and education with its possible links affecting access to <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> The underlying causes helped to understand the reasons behind this growing issue of inaccessible <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> Further research is needed to develop policies and target dental public health efforts towards specific problem areas ensuring equitable access to oral services and consequently, improve the health of older adults. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> of {{unconscious}} {{patients should}} not be ignored and requires oral antiseptics that have antibacterial properties. This research was a quasi-experimental design with control groups, using pre-post test design. The study was aimed to compare the amount of bacteria colonies after <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> using povidone iodine 1 % and chlorhexidine 0. 2 % on the patients with altered state of consciousness. Using consecutive sampling technique, 30 eligible respondents were divided into three groups. The {{results of this study}} identified that there was a significant decreased of the amount of bacteria colonies after <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> using povidone iodine (p= 0. 007), chlorhexidine (p= 0. 001) and water <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> (p= 0. 001). The difference of the number of colonies for <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> using povidone iodine 1 %, chlorhexidine 0. 2 %, and the control group was not significant (p= 0. 343). It can be concluded that each of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> using chlorhexidine 0. 2 %, povidone iodine 1 % and water has a significant ability to reduce colonies of bacteria and can be used as an <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> For economic reason, it was advised to use water for <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> if clients do not experience oral infections, and to use chlorhexidine 0. 2 % or povidone iodine 1 % when there is infection of the mouth. <b>Oral</b> <b>care</b> klien penurunan tingkat kesadaran tidak boleh diabaikan dan membutuhkan antiseptik oral yang mempunyai sifat antibakteri. Penelitian ini adalah penelitian kuantitatif dengan desain quasi eksperimen dengan kelompok kontrol, pre dan post test untuk mengidentifikasi perbandingkan povidone iodine 1 % dengan chlorhexidine 0. 2 % terhadap jumlah koloni bakteri di mulut klien penurunan kesadaran. Hasil penelitian pada 30 responden yang diambil secara consecutive sampling dibagi tiga kelompok. Ada perbedaan yang signifikan penurunan jumlah koloni bakteri sebelum dan setelah <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> pada povidone iodine (p= 0. 007), chlorhexidine (p= 0. 001) dan air (p= 0. 001). Perbandingan selisih jumlah bakteri antara povidone iodine 1 %, chlorhexidine 0. 2 % dan kontrol tidak signifikan (p= 0, 343). Disimpulkan chlorhexidine 0. 2 %, povidone iodine 1 % dan air minum masing-masing mempunyai kemampuan yang signifikan menurunkan koloni bakteri dan dapat digunakan sebagai pembilas <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> Disarankan secara ekonomis air minum digunakan dalam <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> apabila klien penurunan kesadaran tidak mengalami infeksi mulut, dan chlorhexidine 0. 2 % atau povidone iodine 1 % digunakan bila ada infeksi mulut...|$|R

40|$|Poor {{oral health}} {{has been a}} {{persistent}} problem in nursing home residents for decades, with severe consequences for residents and the health care system. Two major barriers to providing appropriate <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> are residents' responsive behaviors to <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> and residents' lack of ability or motivation to perform <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> on their own. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} strategies that nursing home care providers can apply to either prevent/overcome residents' responsive behaviors to <b>oral</b> <b>care,</b> or enable/motivate residents to perform their own <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> We searched the databases Medline, EMBASE, Evidence Based Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Web of Science for intervention studies assessing the effectiveness of eligible strategies. Two reviewers independently (a) screened titles, abstracts and retrieved full-texts; (b) searched key journal contents, key author publications, and reference lists of all included studies; and (c) assessed methodological quality of included studies. Discrepancies at any stage were resolved by consensus. We conducted a narrative synthesis of study results. We included three one-group pre-test, post-test studies, and one cross-sectional study. Methodological quality was low (n = 3) and low moderate (n = 1). Two studies assessed strategies to enable/motivate nursing home residents to perform their own <b>oral</b> <b>care,</b> and to studies assessed strategies to prevent or overcome responsive behaviors to <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> All studies reported improvements of {{at least some of the}} outcomes measured, but interpretation is limited due to methodological problems. Potentially promising strategies are available that nursing home care providers can apply to prevent/overcome residents' responsive behaviors to <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> or to enable/motivate residents to perform their own <b>oral</b> <b>care.</b> However, studies assessing these strategies have a high risk for bias. To overcome oral health problems in nursing homes, care providers will need practical strategies whose effectiveness was assessed in robust studies...|$|R

Therefore, studying the <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practices {{as well as their}} oral health beliefs is important as these affect the quality of the <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> they perform. Objective: To compare formal and informal caregivers’ <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practices and <b>oral</b> health beliefs when taking care of severely dependent elderly. Material and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a convenience sample of 21 formal caregivers from a long-term residence and 18 informal caregivers from a local primary health care domiciliary programme. Caregivers were surveyed using a questionnaire designed to elicit <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> practices and <b>oral</b> health beliefs. The nursing Dental Coping Beliefs Scale questionnaire was translated and validated in Chile. Results: Significant differences were observed between formal and informal caregivers’ performance of some <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> practices.

40|$|Context: Oral health {{awareness}} and <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> are crucial aspects of oncology nursing practice. However very few studies {{concentrate on the}} <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> of cancer patients undergoing cancer treatment and nursing practice in the Indian subcontinent. Most of the published {{studies have been conducted}} in the Western and European countries. Aim: This study aimed to determine the nurses′ knowledge and education about <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Setting and design: A cross sectional descriptive survey was conducted among 158 staff nurses working in oncology related areas from 4 different hospitals of Dakshina Kannada district and Udupi district of Karnataka state, India. Statistical Analysis: descriptive and inferential statistics was used by using SPSS 16 version. Results: Majority 81 (51. 3 %) of the staff nurses had poor knowledge of <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in cancer patients whereas 87 (55. 1 %) reported that knowledge acquired through basic education in <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> is not sufficient. Most of the staff nurses 115 (72. 8 %) did not receive basic education in <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> of cancer patients. There was significant association between knowledge and variables such as designation (. 005), years of work experience (. 040) and years of experience in cancer wards (. 000) at 0. 05 levels. Conclusion: Lack of knowledge suggest the need to develop and implement continuing nursing education programs on <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> specifically for patients receiving cancer treatments, for improving knowledge of staff nurses′ in order to render comprehensive care to the patients. This study also recommends the importance of inclusion of cancer patient specific <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> in the curriculum which can enhance competency of the qualified nurses in cancer wards...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{functionally}} dependent elderly with natural teeth is increasing. Daily <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> for those living at nursing facilities {{is expected to}} be performed by the nursing staff but has been reported as unsatisfactory. This thesis focuses on the nursing staff's views on <b>oral</b> health <b>care.</b> Further, the effects of an education model, which aims to create more positive, longstanding <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> effects compared with traditional <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> education, were studied. The applied research methods were mainly qualitative, where assessments were performed among staff and residents at intervention and control nursing facilities. 	The general findings revealed that <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> was seen as a part of daily nursing duties, but was regarded as a troublesome activity by most staff personnel. The nursing staff with the shorter education mostly performed <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> and it was this group that held more negative <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> attitudes as compared with nurses with a longer education. All staff personnel expressed a desire to obtain more <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> education, but they also wanted more practical help from the dental team. <b>Oral</b> health <b>care</b> was described as having a low practical priority in nursing. Other daily routines were often considered more urgent because of experiences of negative circumstances associated with <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> work. Most staff personnel expressed a need for better support in <b>oral</b> health <b>care.</b> 	A new education model in <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> was developed and tested. <b>Oral</b> <b>care</b> aides were appointed among the nursing staff at the intervention facilities and supplemented a traditional lecture, which was given to all personnel at both the intervention and control nursing facilities. The <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> aides passed a special training curriculum, including an auscultation period at a dental clinic. Baseline and follow-up assessments were made among both nursing staff and residents in an intervention and a control group. It was shown that the <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> needs of nursing staff could be met in either passive or active ways, but the intervention group expressed a higher commitment to <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> than the control group, where only traditional <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> education had been given. 	The <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> aides reported that they went from <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> novices to competent nursing <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> providers. They took responsibility for the <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> work at their wards, and more dental contacts for the residents were created in the intervention group compared with the control group. Other <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> effects for the residents were not noticeable during an 18 -month follow-up period. Semi-structured interviews with the residents supported the nursing staff's experiences of residents' low <b>oral</b> health <b>care</b> values. <b>Oral</b> health <b>care</b> in nursing remains a duty for the nursing staff; however, to attain and keep up {{with a high level of}} performance in this work well functioning co-operation between the nursing and dental professions is required...|$|R

30|$|Introduction: Despite their {{recommendation}} in {{the prevention}} of ventilator-associated pneumonia, <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> is not still clearly standardized. It generally includes a time for oropharyngeal and tracheal suctions which can induce a cough reflex in non-paralyzed patients leading to the mobilization of the endotracheal tube and a consecutively increased risk of tracheal microaspirations. During the <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> procedure, drainage of subglottic secretions at particular times before oro-tracheal suctions is expected to reduce microaspiration. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess whether this “optimized” <b>oral</b> <b>care</b> including subglottic drainage can reduce microaspirations.|$|R
