50|$|Biological {{reference}} points {{are the primary}} output of stock assessments and fishing regulations are set to meet these biological benchmarks. There are several types of benchmarks are used depending on the preference of the regulating agency. The benchmarks are used to control {{different aspects of the}} fishery or population. Benchmarks that regulate fishing mortality include Fcurr, Fmsy, Emsy, and MFMT. Fcurr is the current level of fishing mortality, Fmsy is the fishing mortality that produces the maximum sustainable yield, and Emsy is the expected level of fishing that will produce the maximum sustainable yield. SSBcurr, SSBmsy, and MSST are used in the regulation of biomass levels. SSBcurr stands for the current spawning stock biomass, SSBmsy is the amount of spawning stock biomass needed to produce the maximum sustainable yield, and MSST is the minimum standing stock threshold. The amount that is available to be harvested is controlled by the benchmarks MSY and OY. MSY is the maximum sustainable yield and OY is the <b>optimum</b> <b>yield</b> of a stock. The main difference between MSY and OY is that MSY considers only the biology of the fish while the OY considers the economic aspect of the harvest.|$|E

Both cultivars produced <b>optimum</b> <b>yields</b> at seeding rates of 120 to 180 lbs/A for the Dec. 1 planting date.
