5|$|The {{lease on}} the house was {{inherited}} by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Pullan completed some of Burges's unfinished projects and wrote two studies of his work. The lease was then purchased by Colonel T. H. Minshall, author <b>of</b> <b>What</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> Germany and Future Germany, and father of Merlin Minshall. Minshall sold his lease to Colonel E. R. B. and Mrs. Graham in 1933. The Tower House was designated a Grade I listed building on 29 July 1949.|$|E
5|$|Upon taking office, Johnson {{faced the}} {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control {{large parts of}} those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after {{ten percent of the}} voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln pocket vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested {{as early as}} 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E

5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the parkway from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the parkway was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The parkway, while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and the issue <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> truck traffic. The parkway, if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{was placed}} on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. His {{assignment}} became significant when President Millard Fillmore in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the old ways, or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.|$|E

25|$|Various {{barriers}} to a nuclear renaissance have been suggested.

There are also concerns about more nuclear accidents, security, and nuclear weapons proliferation.|$|E

25|$|This {{period of}} the war was characterised by the {{ever-increasing}} size and power of Bomber Command's raids on Germany, and the Luftwaffes subsequent attempts to defend against these devastating raids. The Luftwaffes raids on the UK dropped considerably, {{with the exception of the}} mining efforts. This gave the RAF night fighter groups time to rest and re-equip, replacing their older Beaufighters and Mosquitos with new aircraft, mostly the new Mosquito NF.XII with Mk. VIII. This left the question <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the Mk. IV equipped aircraft, many of which found a new life as intruders using the new Serrate radar detectors.|$|E

25|$|The primary aim {{of modern}} warfare (in {{accordance}} {{with the principles of}} doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever {{since the end of the}} nineteenth century, the problem <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, however, {{concerns}} regarding immigration from Asian sources revealed overtly xenophobic and racist attitudes among Canadians, particularly English Canadians on the Pacific coast. At {{the time for}} many Canadian identity, whatever it was to be, did not include non-Europeans. While inexpensive Chinese labour had been needed to complete the transcontinental railway, {{the completion of the}} railway led to questions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the workers who were now no longer needed. Further Chinese immigration was limited and then banned by a series of restrictive and racially motivated dominion statutes. The Komagata Maru incident in 1914 revealed overt hostility towards would-be immigrants, mainly Sikhs from India, who attempted to land in Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|Having been {{in charge}} of {{internment}} of enemy aliens and suspected fascist sympathisers under Defence Regulation 18B, Newsam had in 1944 to consider the vexed question <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the 'Red Book' containing the membership list from Archibald Maule Ramsay's 'Right Club', after Ramsay was released from detention. After discussing the question with a colleague, the idea came up that {{it may be necessary to}} illegally destroy the book and then take the chance that Ramsay would get only token damages out of any legal action that might ensue. In the end, the book was returned to Ramsay. Newsam became Sir Frank in 1943 when he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{stockpile}} of CAIS were destroyed decades ago, there remained the problem <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> CAIS found buried underground. Most {{of the other}} 80,000 or so CAIS were used during training but some were disposed of, the primary method of disposal was burial. The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency was assigned the task of destroying CAIS as they were found, usually through ongoing construction projects. When CAIS items are found the Chemical Materials Agency's Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel Project (NSCMP) is tasked to destroy them using the Single CAIS Access and Neutralization System (SCANS), a small, hand-held container used to access and treat recovered CAIS. After treatment, the SCANS is overpacked in a Department of Transportation-approved transport container and shipped to a permitted facility for final treatment and disposal of the entire SCANS container and its waste contents.|$|E
25|$|Another unique {{building}} is the Voorhees Computing Center (VCC). Originally the St.Joseph's Seminary chapel, built in 1933, {{the building was}} acquired by Rensselaer in 1958, and after renovation served as the institute's library from 1960 until {{the completion of the}} new Folsom Library, in 1976. The Folsom Library, located adjacent to the computing center, has a concrete exterior that was designed to harmonize with the light gray brick of the chapel; architecturally, it is an excellent example of the modern brutalist style. Subsequently, the university was unsure <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the chapel, or whether to keep it at all, but in 1979 decided to preserve it and renovate it to house computer labs and facilities to support the institute's computing initiatives. Today the VCC serves as the backbone for the institute's data and telephony infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{it became}} known at Pisa {{that two of the}} {{cardinals}} of the Obedience of Benedict XIII had abandoned his cause. Cardinal Ludovico Fieschi and Cardinal Antoine de Challant had been declared contumacious in the Fourth Session of the Council, and they were now negotiating to have their status regularized. At Session Sixteen, on 10 June, Cardinal Challant appeared in the Cathedral, and the question <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> him suddenly became critical. Cardinal Niccolò Brancaccio (Avignon Obedience) spoke in his favor, and he was allowed to take his seat with the other cardinals. Then, the Archbishop of Pisa read out a document containing Electoral Capitulations, signed and sealed by each of the cardinals, promising that whoever was elected pope would carry out a reform of the Church, and would not allow the Council to dissolve until that goal had been achieved.|$|E

25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is the dilemma <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is {{the focal point}} for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters {{try to figure out what}} to do about the Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} largely {{reported}} by the press {{to have been a}} flop: badly thought-out, badly executed, and leaving the government with the embarrassing question <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it afterwards. During 2000 the organisers repeatedly asked for, and received, more cash from the Millennium Commission, the Lottery body which supported it. Numerous changes at management and Board level, before and during the exhibition, had only limited, if any, results. Jennifer Page was sacked as chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company just one month after the dome's opening. Press reports suggested that the then Prime Minister Tony Blair personally placed a high priority on making the Dome a success. But part of the problem was that the financial predictions were based on an unrealistically high forecast of visitor numbers at 12 million. During the 12 months it was open there were approximately 6.5 million visitors – significantly fewer than the approximately 10 million paying visitors that attended the Festival of Britain, which only ran from May to September. Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938 held in Glasgow attracted more than 12 million visitors being open May to October. Unlike the press, visitor feedback was extremely positive. It was the most popular tourist attraction in 2000, second was the London Eye; third was Alton Towers, which had been first in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{completely}} cleansing Spain of the Moriscos {{was proposed}} by Juan de Ribera, the Archbishop and Viceroy of Valencia, whose views were influential with Philip III. Philip's eventual decree to eliminate this 'evil sect' in 1609 {{was a popular}} move – the Moriscos were accused of collaborating with the Barbary Pirates to attack the coast, whilst their religion and distinct culture made them unpopular with Christians in Spain, especially in Valencia. Financially, the royal treasury stood to gain by seizing {{the assets of the}} removed peoples, whilst in due course those close to the crown would benefit from cheap land or gifts of estates. Other writers have emphasised the continuing 'anxiety and fear' that surrounded the Morisco presence in Spain, and the role this played in encouraging the expulsion. Estimates vary slightly, but between around 275,000 to over 300,000 Moriscos were forced out of Spain between 1609 and 1614. To accomplish this, the armada, or navy, and 30,000 soldiers were mobilized with the mission of transporting the families to Tunis or Morocco. Philip intervened in the problematic decision <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Morisco children – should they be allowed to take them to Islamic countries, where they would be brought up as Muslims – and if they were to remain in Spain, what should be done with them? Philip paternalistically decreed that Morisco {{children under the age of}} seven could not be taken to Islamic countries, but that any children remaining in Valencia should be free from the threat of enslavement, and rejected some of Ribera's more extreme suggestions.|$|E
