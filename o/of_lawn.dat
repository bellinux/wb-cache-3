5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring <b>of</b> <b>lawn</b> grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E

5|$|The tournament {{generated}} {{a profit of}} £10 and the pony roller stayed in use. When the tournament was finished, Henry Jones gathered all the score cards to analyse the results and found that, of the 601 games played during the tournament, 376 were won by the server ("striker-in") and 225 by the receiver ("striker-out"). At {{a time when the}} service was either made underarm or, usually, at shoulder height, this was seen as a serving dominance and resulted in a modification of the rules for the 1878 Championship. To decrease the target area for the server, the length of the service court was reduced from 26 to 22ft (7.92 to 6.71m) and to make passing shots easier against volleyers the height of the net was reduced to 4ft 9 in (1.45m) at the posts and 3 feet (0.91m) at the centre. These rules were published jointly by the AEC & LTC and the MCC, giving the AEC & LTC an official rule-making authority and in effect retroactively sanctioning its 1877 rules. It marked the moment when the AEC & LTC effectively usurped the rule-making initiative from the MCC although the latter would still ratify rule changes until 1882. In recognition of the importance and popularity <b>of</b> <b>lawn</b> tennis, the club was renamed in 1882 to All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC).|$|E

40|$|Lawn is a homogenized {{element of}} modern urban green space. Due to {{historical}} and cultural characteristics of Swedish urban planning, lawns are the main common typology in Uppsala (77. 3 %). Despite the strong attachment of Uppsala people to green carpets, the multibillion lawn industry is highly costly in terms of maintenance and management. It is also a source of pollution due to excessive mowing regime. In this research, social, cultural and regulatory motives behind establishment and management <b>of</b> Uppsala <b>lawns</b> among different stakeholders were researched and discussed through a transdisciplinary approach. In the light of three pillars of sustainability, I had {{a closer look at}} management and establishment <b>of</b> <b>lawns</b> in Uppsala municipality and Uppsala’s housing corporation. It was found out that social and recreational aspects <b>of</b> <b>lawns</b> are very much appreciated among all respondents. However, economical and environmental aspects <b>of</b> <b>lawns</b> are barley discussed among planners, managers and politicians and they are under the veil of social values. This research also found out that there is a strong attachment of general public to lawns. It can be explained by lacking of ecological knowledge and environmental understanding about the real role <b>of</b> <b>lawns</b> in urban biodiversity. One of the goals of my research was to find sustainable alternative solutions to the conventional lawns that can be implemented on city and neighbourhood scale as well as to educate public and professionals about importance <b>of</b> lawn’s biodiversity. <b>LAWN</b> projec...|$|R

500|$|On 3 March 1875 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), in its {{capacity}} as the governing body for rackets and real tennis, convened {{a meeting at}} Lord's Cricket Ground to test the various versions <b>of</b> <b>lawn</b> tennis with the aim to standardise the game's rules. Wingfield was present to demonstrate Sphairistikè, as was John H. Hale, who presented his version called Germains Lawn Tennis; {{there is no record}} of either Gem or Perera being present to showcase Pelota. After the meeting, the MCC Tennis Committee was tasked with framing the rules. On 29 May 1875 the MCC issued the Laws <b>of</b> <b>Lawn</b> Tennis, the first unified rules for lawn tennis, which were adopted by the club on 24 June. These were significantly based on the rules introduced by Wingfield in February 1874 and published in his [...] rule-booklet titled Sphairistikè or Lawn Tennis. The MCC adopted Wingfield's hourglass-shaped court as well as the rackets method of scoring, in which the player who first scores 15 points wins the game and only the server ("hand-in") was able to score. The height of the net was set at 5ft (1.52m) at the posts and 4ft (1.22m) in the centre. Various aspects of these rules, including the characteristic court shape and the method of scoring, were the subject of prolonged debate in the press. The MCC rules were not universally adhered to following its publication and, among others, the Prince's Club in London stuck to playing on rectangular courts.|$|E
