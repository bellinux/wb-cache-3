5000|$|When using c-clamps {{care must}} be taken to not <b>over-torque</b> the clamp bolt which affixes the clamp to the batten. If this bolt is overtightened, it can easily dimple or [...] "drill" [...] into the batten seriously compromising the {{strength}} of the batten.|$|E
50|$|Jaw {{couplings}} elastomers {{are wearing}} elements that {{do need to}} be inspected and replaced. Jaw coupling elastomers often have signature wear patterns, and failures can often be root caused based {{on the condition of}} the elastomer and hubs. Common failure causes include misalignment, <b>over-torque,</b> chemical exposure, temperature exposure, torsional vibrations, and hub failure.|$|E
50|$|An {{aero engine}} inertia starter uses a pre-rotated {{flywheel}} to transfer kinetic {{energy to the}} crankshaft, normally through reduction gears and a clutch to prevent <b>over-torque</b> conditions. Three variations have been used, hand driven, electrically driven and a combination of both. When the flywheel is fully energised either a manual cable is pulled or a solenoid is used to engage the starter.|$|E

5000|$|If the <b>over-torqueing</b> {{results in}} the failure {{of any of the}} items in the jury rig, the {{fragments}} can injure workers in the line-of-fire.|$|R
5000|$|An {{impact driver}} {{is a tool}} that {{delivers}} a strong, sudden rotational and downward force, often used by mechanics to loosen larger screws (bolts) and nuts that are corrosively [...] "frozen" [...] or <b>over-torqued.</b> The direction can also be reversed for situations where screws have to be tightened with torque greater than a screwdriver can reasonably provide.|$|R
50|$|This type {{is similar}} to a {{friction}} plate clutch. <b>Over-torque</b> will cause the plates to slip. A simple example is found in a fixed-spool fishing reel, where the slipping torque is set by means of a large hand nut in order that the reel will turn and allow more line to unwind before the line breaks under the pull of a fish.|$|E
50|$|A {{ball detent}} type limiter transmits force through {{hardened}} balls which rest in detents {{on the shaft}} and are held in place with springs. An <b>over-torque</b> condition pushes the balls out of their detents, thereby decoupling the shaft. It can have single or multiple detent positions, or a snap acting spring which requires a manual reset. There may be a compression adjustment to adjust the torque limit.|$|E
50|$|Some systems combine {{internally}} geared hubs {{with external}} derailleurs. A freewheeling hub with a sprocket suitable for narrow chain {{can be combined}} with a double or triple crankset and front derailleur, {{in order to provide}} a wider range and closer gear ratio spacing. A chain tensioner or a rear derailleur is needed to take up chain slack, and care is needed not to <b>over-torque</b> the hub by using too small a chainring/sprocket ratio.|$|E
50|$|Maughan {{took off}} from Mitchel Field at 3:58 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, June 23, 1924. He flew through {{intermittent}} rain and fog but still averaged 135 mi/h km/h and reached McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio at 8:10 a.m. EST. Although mechanics serviced the plane around in twenty minutes, one of the field's mechanics <b>over-torqued</b> the filler cap while securing it to the fuel intake housing, and broke off the valve. The housing had to be removed, soldered, and replaced, costing an hour's delay.|$|R
25|$|On June 23, 1924, {{taking off}} at 3:58 A.M., Army test pilot First Lieutenant Russell Maughan left Mitchel Field, New York, in PW-8 24-204, {{modified}} with additional fuel and oil tanks, made a dawn-to-dusk transcontinental flight across the US. Refueling five times, he landed at Crissy Field, San Francisco, California, at 9:46p.m., one minute before dusk, covering 2,670mi (4,297km) in 20 hours and 48 minutes. His flight time included four planned 30-minute stops at McCook Field, Ohio; Saint Joseph, Missouri; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Salduro Siding, Utah; and an unplanned stop in North Platte, Nebraska for additional fuel when a muddy field in Missouri {{did not permit}} him {{to take on a}} full load. He also lost an hour at McCook to repair a broken fuel valve after an over-eager mechanic had <b>over-torqued</b> the valve, damaging it.|$|R
50|$|A helical insert is {{an insert}} made of coiled wire. The {{helically}} formed coils of diamond shaped stainless steel or phosphor bronze wire screw into a threaded hole {{to form a}} mating internal thread for a screw or stud. These inserts provide a convenient means of repairing stripped-out threads and are also used to provide stronger threads in soft materials such as aluminium, zinc die castings, wood, magnesium etc. than {{can be obtained by}} direct tapping of the base metal involved. Another common generic name is screw thread insert (STI), although many users persist in calling them all by a prominent brand name, the registered trademark Heli-Coil. Applications include engine cylinder head repair after unintentional <b>over-torquing</b> or cross-threading of spark plugs strips the thread of the socket. Kits with matched tap and coil exist for this. The straight radial piece in the photo is the driver tang which is used as a key to grip with pliers for driving the coil into place and is discarded after installation.|$|R
50|$|Drive modules for servomotors are a {{standard}} industrial component. Their design is {{a branch of}} power electronics, usually based on a three-phase MOSFET or IGBT H bridge. These standard modules accept a single direction and pulse count (rotation distance) as input. They may also include over-temperature monitoring, <b>over-torque</b> and stall detection features. As the encoder type, gearhead ratio and overall system dynamics are application specific, {{it is more difficult}} to produce the overall controller as an off-the-shelf module and so these are often implemented as part of the main controller.|$|E
40|$|Features {{based on}} {{empirical}} mode decomposition (EMD) of measured vibration data were developed for a Bell OH- 58 helicopter main rotor gearbox. A tooth on the input pinion of the gearbox was notched {{and run for}} an extended period at several <b>over-torque</b> conditions to induce a tooth fracture. Vibration data were recorded at regular intervals until a tooth fractured. The EMD features were found to be more sensitive to the gearbox condition than the kurtosis-based feature (FM 4), and they diagnosed the onset of cracked tooth much earlier...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} helicopter limit cueing (HLC) {{system was}} designed, installed, and evaluated in flight test in early 2002. This paper describes the design, cueing methodology, and interim flight test {{results of this}} project. The system described in this paper used available Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) parameters and a simple and cost-effective mechanical spring/electric motor combination to achieve a tactile cue that warned the pilot of impending exceedences of the transmission torque limit. Three high-workload maneuvers were {{used to evaluate the}} prototype HLC system. Results indicate that with an appropriate design, inadvertent <b>over-torque</b> events could be eliminated with a HLC system while reducing pilot workload...|$|E
5000|$|Trade-off: {{solid wood}} versus {{particle}} board. Solid wood and plywood are durable and strong, but are more costly and offer less dimensional stability at manufacture than particle board. For cabinets and surface finishes that may sustain damage during long use, serviceability is a consideration. In case of damage, solid wood can be repaired by a qualified furniture refinisher, {{other than the}} manufacturer, to achieve a perfect match to the surrounding finish. Veneered MDF and particle board components, if damaged, must {{be replaced by the}} manufacturer. If water reaches the core, particleboard especially will swell irreversibly (therefore it is never used in home sheathing applications, where oriented strand board OSB is used instead). Tolerances for the use of screw fasteners in particleboard are tighter than for solid wood or plywood, and screws often loosen over time if <b>over-torqued.</b> However, MDF and particle board are good choices where cabinets are well-constructed, will be cared-for, where service life is projected as intermediate, e.g., where the kitchen will be remodeled approximately every 15 years, or where the manufacturer can be relied upon to supply replacement components if needed.|$|R
50|$|CFRP bicycle frames weigh {{less than}} one of steel, aluminum, or {{titanium}} for the same strength. The type and orientation of the carbon-fiber weave can be designed to maximize stiffness in required directions. Frames can be tuned to address different riding styles: sprint events require stiffer frames while endurance events may require more flexible frames for rider comfort over longer periods. The variety of shapes it can be built into has further increased stiffness and also allowed aerodynamic tube sections. CFRP forks including suspension fork crowns and steerers, handlebars, seatposts, and crank arms are becoming more common on medium as well as higher-priced bicycles. CFRP rims remain expensive but their stability compared to aluminium reduces the need to re-true a wheel and the reduced mass reduces the moment of inertia of the wheel. CFRP spokes are rare and most carbon wheelsets retain traditional stainless steel spokes. CFRP also appears increasingly in other components such as derailleur parts, brake and shifter levers and bodies, cassette sprocket carriers, suspension linkages, disc brake rotors, pedals, shoe soles, and saddle rails. Although strong and light, impact, <b>over-torquing</b> or improper installation of CFRP components has resulted in cracking and failures, which may be difficult or impossible to repair.|$|R
40|$|After many abusive, <b>over-torqued</b> powershifts, {{the venerable}} T 5 is left a little worse for wear. Couple this with no {{built-in}} shift fork limits and sheer age, {{and the frequency}} of failure is quite high in any spirited driven vehicle. Or, in some cases, the high-mileage often seen on Mustangs results in worn out friction linings on the blocker rings. (My first (and only, so far!) failure was a delaminated fourth gear blocker. I could upshift, but had to pause a while to downshift, until it went out altogether, at 125, 000 miles!) Update: July 2, 1999 : Blew input shaft at lunch! Thing sounded like a grenade going off; left with fourth gear only! Now I feel like a real man, LOL! The solution: Why, a thorough rebuild, of course! While going through the rebuild, do you and your trans a favor by spending some of the money saved on upgrades: the two most notable are a steel input shaft bearing retainer and a decent aftermarket shifter (or at least do something about the factory rubber isolators, like remove them!). Besides learning how to do a rebuild to get yourself out of trouble, it’s a great bartering skill when your “friends” blow theirs up! The sources: I have purchased parts from D&D Performance, Hanlon Motorsports, and National Drivetrain. I have received outstanding service from all, and always receive my parts in a timely manner. However, I will not do business with NDT again over a petty issue (actually, not petty; based on principals that they claim but did not uphold; they do have good deals on inputs and clusters from time to time, but their kits, uh, suck, IMHO…). Personally, I prefer to deal with Hanlon; Linda, Bob’s wife, always makes me laugh when I speak with her, and they had the courtesy to call me several months after I placed an order to let me know the Tremec rebuild manuals were in, and overnight a part that they let slip through. You cannot go wrong with D&D or Hanlon...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the analysis and}} application of magnetic gearbox and magnetic coupling technologies and issues surrounding their use for motion control servo systems. Analysis of a prototype magnetic gear {{is used as a}} basis for demonstrating the underlying nonlinear torque transfer characteristic, nonlinear damping, and `pole-slipping' when subject to <b>over-torque</b> (overload) conditions. It is also shown how `pole-slipping' results in consequential loss of control. A theoretical investigation into the suppression of mechanical torsional resonances in transmission systems encompassing these highly-compliant magnetically-coupled components is included, along with experimental results, from a demonstrator drive-train. The automatic detection of pole-slipping, and recovery scenarios, is also presented...|$|E
40|$|Flanged joints are {{fundamental}} components of pipelines {{and they must}} be optimized to avoid leaks, bolts overstress and flanged joints damage. Overcoming standards indications as overtorqueing, and combination of different parameters, as difference in hardness between flanges and gasket, can cause groove impressions. Aim {{of this study is to}} provide an efficient tool to optimize the choice of characteristic parameters of flanged joints, by numerical simulations. Geometries of a real test case are simulated by FE models, considering different values of flange and gasket hardness, as well as tightening torques, in order to cover possible ranges. From the analyses, it is possible to highlight that a particular combination of hardness difference and <b>over-torque</b> is responsible for permanent flange impression...|$|E
40|$|The {{vibration}} {{resulting from}} a cracked spiral bevel pinion was recorded and analyzed using existing Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) techniques. A tooth on the input pinion to a Bell OH- 58 main rotor gearbox was notched and run {{for an extended period}} at severe <b>over-torque</b> condition to facilitate a tooth fracture. Thirteen vibration-based diagnostic metrics were calculated throughout the run. After 101. 41 hours of run time, some of the metrics indicated damage. At that point a visual inspection did not reveal any damage. The pinion was then run for another 12 minutes until a proximity probe indicated that a tooth had fractured. This paper discusses the damage detection effectiveness of the different metrics and a comparison of effects of the different accelerometer locations...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to analyse the {{abnormal}} incidents on the drill pipe. The reason for this research is to apply the learned theories into the reality by building an automated rig and detect the problems. Also, to participate in Drillbotics competition 2016. Drillbotics 2016 is an international competition arranged by Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) that {{is a part of}} the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), to encourage students to build a small and fully automated rig to drill safety and efficiency a rock sample as vertically and fast as possible. Using literature backgrounds of circumstances combined with theories makes it easier to get an estimated overview of the failures that might occur while applying different drilling parameters. Moreover, which parameters used in term of drilling to drill more safety without failures. The analysis that performed based on the design such twisting, buckling, vibration and leakage, and overpressure testing. Optimising the rotational speed and weight on bit applied; reduces problems such twisting, buckling and vibrational movements. The choice of the rotational speed and the weight on bit is based on the type of drill pipe materials which is the weakest component of the drill string, with respect to the maximum yield and ultimate torque of the drill pipe material. The next step is to build the design and see if it is working properly with the chosen values. Tests like leakage, overpressure, and <b>over-torque</b> performed after calibrating the load cells to evaluate the reaction of the real-time controller, to be able to stop the rotation in case of: - Low circulation pressure, leakage - High circulation pressure, overpressure - <b>Over-torque,</b> sticking Later buckling tests by applying weight on the 2. 2 0 mm thick and 1 m long pipe, to determine the maximum weight that buckles the pipe. In the end, vibrations are observed after rotating at 180 rpm. The rig design is working fine and safe in term of torque, buckling and circulation system, but there are quite high vibrations that made it difficult to read the signal from the accelerometers...|$|E
40|$|Presented {{here is a}} robot {{friendly}} {{coupling device}} for an orbital replacement unit (ORU). The invention will provide a coupling that is detached and attached remotely by a robot. The design of the coupling must allow for slight misalignments, <b>over-torque</b> protection, and precision placement. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} triangular interface comprising three components. A base plate assembly is located on an attachment surface, such as a satellite. The base plate assembly has a cup member, a slotted member, and a post member. The ORU that the robot attaches to the base plate assembly has an ORU plate assembly with two cone members and a post member which mate to the base plate assembly. As the two plates approach one another, one cone member of the ORU plate assembly has to be placed accurately enough to fall into the cup member of the base plate assembly. The cup member forces alignment until a second cone falls into a slotted member which provides final alignment. A single bolt is used to attach the two plates. Two deflecting plates are attached to the backs of the plates. When pressure is applied {{to the center of the}} deflecting plates, the force is distributed preventing the ORU and base plates from deflecting. This accounts for precision in the placement of the article. The novelty is believed to reside in using deflecting plates in conjunction with kinematic mounts to provide distributed forces to the two members...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about {{the control of}} {{magnetic}} gears. A decade ago (2001) the first modern prototype magnetic gear box was constructed using rare earth magnets (NdFeB). Magnetic gear boxes have some desirable properties not found in their mechanical gear box counterparts, these include: contact-less torque transmission, lubrication-free, reduced noise and vibration, and non-destructive torque overload capability. Hitherto, no detailed investigation or analysis has been conducted {{on the effects of}} using a magnetic gear box in place of a mechanical gear box. As will be demonstrated in this thesis, magnetic gears possess a number of undesirable properties which must be given due consideration when designing speed and position controllers. In particular, unlike mechanical gear boxes, magnetic gear boxes have extremely low torsional rigidity. Furthermore, the torque transfer characteristic is fundamentally nonlinear and magnetic gear boxes have the potential to ‘slip’. On the one hand, ‘slipping’ is a great benefit as a non-destructive ‘torque fuse’; but on the other, this represents a consequential loss of control. This thesis examines the control issues that arise {{through the use of a}} specially constructed magnetic coupling integrated into an experimental test rig. The development of a linearized mathematical model of the experimental magnetic coupling is used to derive optimized classical controllers for speed and position, demonstrating outstanding theoretical and experimental results. To compensate for the possibility of ‘slip’, a methodology is presented for the detection and recovery from what is defined as ‘pole-slip’ in a magnetic coupling. To avert ‘pole-slip’, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed that prevents <b>over-torque</b> pole-slipping. Feedback linearization is considered for a nonlinear model of the magnetic coupling and nonlinear control laws and state transformations are derived to produce perfect linearization, for both speed and position control, over the entire operating range of the experimental magnetic coupling...|$|E
