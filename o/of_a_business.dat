The excess or deficit is shown as a change in fund balances, simpler to an increase or decrease in owner's equity.|$|E
5|$|The M-43 {{designation}} {{dates back}} to at least July 1, 1919, when it was used {{on a series of}} roadways running between Kalamazoo and St. Charles. Its northern- and easternmost sections were transferred to other highways in the 1930s. Additions to M-43 extended it to its current termini. Several sections of the highway were realigned during its history, one of these changes led to the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> loop in Grand Ledge. Another former segment of the trunkline in the Lansing area has been renumbered M-143.|$|E
5|$|A {{rerouting}} of trunklines in 1941 lead to {{the creation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Business</b> US12 (BUS US12). M-96 ran concurrently with BUS US12 and M-37 was truncated to end at M-96. US12 was rerouted between Galesburg and Kalamazoo in 1954, and M-96 was extended along the former US12 routing to end in Kalamazoo. M-96 was rerouted in downtown Battle Creek to one-way streets in 1958, and BUS US12/M-96 was extended {{by the end of}} the decade when the I-94/US12 freeway was completed in the area. BUS US12 was redesignated as Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) in 1960 and M-96 was shortened to end at BL I-94/M-78 running on Capital Avenue. M-37 was reextended in 1961 in Battle Creek to a concurrent routing with M-96 in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Erika {{produced}} light rainfall across southern Texas, peaking at 3.83inches (97mm) in Sabinal, {{though most}} locations reported {{less than two}} inches (50mm) of precipitation. In addition, weather radar estimated isolated accumulations of 4 to 6inches (100 to 150mm) of precipitation in Kenedy and Brooks Counties. Sustained winds from Erika in south Texas peaked at 39mph (62km/h) in Brownsville, where a gust of 47mph (75km/h) was also recorded. Strong waves were reported northwards to Corpus Christi. The storm caused minor flooding and beach erosion along South Padre Island. Strong wind gusts of up to 60mph (95km/h) caused isolated, minor wind damage in south Texas, including in South Padre Island, where the winds damaged the roof <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>business.</b> The winds also uprooted a large tree and caused limb damage to several small- to medium-sized trees in Brownsville. In Texas, damage totaled to $10,000 (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; there are risks associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> {{would need to be}} discarded. Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies tend to be the need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E
5|$|NC 98 first {{appeared}} in 1930 as a state route connecting NC 91 and NC 102 in the coastal region of North Carolina. That routing was abolished in 1931 {{in favor of an}} extended NC 58. The current routing of NC 98 was established in 1934 with the road's western terminus at NC 91 (present-day Jones Dairy Road) to US 64 west of Spring Hope. In 1941, NC 98 was moved to a new section of road running from Zebulon Road to US1 in Youngsville, which would later become part of NC 96. In 1952, NC 98 was again relocated along NC 264 through Wake Forest to Durham, and NC 96 took over its abandoned section. In 2003, a bypass was completed around Wake Forest leading to the rerouting of mainline NC98 to the bypass and the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> route through the town center.|$|E

5|$|TCI's {{independence}} as {{a separate}} legal entity from its parent corporation ended in 1952, a century after {{the founding of the}} Sewanee Furnace Company, when the it became the Tennessee Coal & Iron Division of U. S. Steel. The memory of the historic importance of TCI was not lost when a short book to celebrate the Tennessee Company's centenary was published by U. S. Steel in 1960: Biography <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Business.</b> Stagnation and decline began in 1962 when a majority of the mines in the Birmingham region were closed as domestic ores and coal were superseded by cheaper foreign products, especially from Venezuela. The 1970s and 80s brought about a downsizing and eventual consolidation of the Fairfield and Ensley works, mirroring the general decline of heavy industry in the USA throughout those decades.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{has been}} {{studying}} a freeway upgrade for US131 through St. Joseph County for several years. In late 2005, MDOT decided not to pursue an upgrade of the highway, but rescinded that decision in April 2006 under political pressure in the state. The department began building a two-lane bypass west of Constantine. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which {{is in charge of}} US Highway numbering assignments and routings, approved the relocation of the US 131 designation out of Constantine on November 16, 2012. The group's Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering also approved the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> route for the old highway through town. The bypass opened on October 30, 2013, and the business route designation was put into service that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} highways {{were approved}} on November 11, 1926, by AASHTO including 14mainline highways. A handful of these original highway designations no longer run within Michigan, {{and a few}} numbers have been added since the 1930s. Since 1999, there have been 13 mainline highways, and with the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> route for Constantine, there are a total of 30 special routes in the state. Several highways have been converted to freeways, {{some of which are}} now Interstate Highways and no longer part of the US Highway System. These freeway conversions started in the 1940s and 1950s and continued through to the turn of the 21st century.|$|E
