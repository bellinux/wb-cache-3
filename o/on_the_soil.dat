5|$|The First Punic War {{began in}} 264 BC when {{settlements}} on Sicily began {{to appeal to}} the two powers between which they lay– Rome and Carthage– in order to solve internal conflicts. The willingness of both Rome and Carthage to become embroiled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> of a third party may indicate a willingness to test each other's power without wishing to enter a full war of annihilation; certainly there was considerable disagreement within Rome about whether to prosecute the war at all. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on, such as the Battle of Agrigentum, but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. For the Romans, naval warfare was a relatively unexplored concept. Before the First Punic War in 264 BC there was no Roman navy to speak of, as all previous Roman wars had been fought on land in Italy. The new war in Sicily against Carthage, a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train sailors.|$|E

5|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes {{it may not be}} available. To counter this, workers are able to extract a significant amount of water from the sand with 2%–4% water content and 4% from the soil. Meat ants are unable to retrieve as much water from the soil, whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and coarse sand, which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly suck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to dig into moist soil to gain access to water or where water has been spilt, either if the site is nearby their nest or far away.|$|E

60|$|It {{is evident}} that each grain will be {{cultivated}} in preference <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> which are better adapted for it than for the other; and, if the demand is supplied from these alone, {{the values of the}} two grains will have no reference to one another.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate and compare the availability of native and applied P in Central Oregon pumice soils with that in Willamette valley soils and calcareous soils from Eastern Oregon. The experimental work to meet these objectives included laboratory and greenhouse studies. The removal of P from solutions in one hour of eqilibration was much greater in <b>the</b> Willamette valley <b>soils</b> than in <b>the</b> pumice <b>soils,</b> and greater in <b>the</b> pumice <b>soils</b> than in <b>the</b> calcareous <b>soils</b> from Eastern Oregon. The ratio between the P removal by <b>the</b> Willamette valley <b>soils</b> and <b>the</b> removal by <b>the</b> pumice <b>soils</b> increased with <b>the</b> rate of P application, while the ratio between the removal by <b>the</b> pumice <b>soils</b> and that by <b>the</b> calcareous <b>soils</b> was fairly constant at different rates of P application. Generally more P was extracted from these <b>soils</b> by <b>the</b> method of Bray N[superscript o][subscript -] 1 than by the methods of Olsen 1 : 10 (soil to extractant ratio = 10) and Olsen 1 : 20, and more P by these methods than by that of Morgan. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Willamette valley <b>soils</b> <b>the</b> method of Olsen 1 : 20 extracted about 1. 5 times the amount of P extracted by the Olsen 1 : 10 method, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pumice <b>soils</b> <b>the</b> Olsen 1 : 20 method extracted slightly more P than the Olsen 1 : 10 method, while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> calcareous <b>soils</b> <b>the</b> Olsen 1 : 10 method extracted almost the same amount of P as the method of Olsen 1 : 20.
