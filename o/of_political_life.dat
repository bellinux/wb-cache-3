25|$|In February 1647 Cromwell {{suffered}} from an illness {{that kept him}} out <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>life</b> for over a month. By {{the time he had}} recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the king. A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a Presbyterian settlement of the Church. Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another. The New Model Army, radicalised by the failure of the Parliament to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful. In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army's headquarters in Saffron Walden to negotiate with them, but failed to agree.|$|E

25|$|A common {{characteristic}} <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>life</b> in {{the kingdom}} of Kongo was a fierce competition over succession to the throne. Afonso's own contest for the throne was intense, though little is known about it. However, a great deal is known about how such struggles took place from the contest that followed Afonso's death in late 1542 or early 1543. This is in large part due to detailed inquest conducted by royal officials in 1550, which survives in the Portuguese archives. In this inquest one can see that factions formed behind prominent men, such as Afonso I's son, Pedro Nkanga a Mvemba and Diogo Nkumbi a Mpudi, his grandson who ultimately overthrew Pedro in 1545. Although the factions placed themselves in the idiom of kinship (using the Portuguese term geração or lineage, probably kanda in Kikongo) they were not formed strictly along heredity lines since close kin were often in separate factions. The players included nobles holding appointive titles to provincial governorships, members of the royal council and also officials in the now well developed Church hierarchy.|$|E
500|$|Disraeli's last {{completed}} novels were Lothair (1870) and Endymion (1880). The first, {{described by}} Daniel R Schwarz as [...] "Disraeli's ideological Pilgrim's Progress", {{is a story}} <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>life</b> with particular regard to {{the roles of the}} Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. Endymion, despite having a Whig as hero, is a last exposition of the author's economic policies and political beliefs. Disraeli continued to the last to pillory his enemies in barely disguised caricatures: the character St Barbe in Endymion is widely seen as a parody of Thackeray, who had offended Disraeli more than thirty years earlier by lampooning him in Punch as [...] "Codlingsby". Disraeli left an unfinished novel in which the priggish central character, Falconet, is unmistakably a caricature of Gladstone.|$|E

Kennedy's father was elected to Congress in 1986. The pressures <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>life</b> strained Joseph and Sheila's marriage, and they divorced in 1991.

500|$|The crown {{remained}} {{the most important}} element of government throughout the period and, despite the many royal minorities, it saw many of the aspects of aggrandisement associated with [...] "new monarchy" [...] elsewhere in Europe. Theories of limited monarchy and resistance were articulated by Scots, particularly George Buchanan, in the sixteenth century, but James VI advanced the theory of the divine right of kings, and these debates were restated in subsequent reigns and crises. The court remained at the centre <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>life,</b> and in the sixteenth century emerged as a major centre of display and artistic patronage. The Privy Council and the great offices of state, remained central to the administration of the government, even after the departure of the Stuart monarchs to rule in England from 1603, but they were often sidelined and was abolished after the Act of Union of 1707, with rule direct from London. Parliament was also vital to the running of the country, providing laws and taxation, but it had fluctuating fortunes and never achieved the centrality the national life of its counterpart in England before it was disbanded in 1707.|$|E
