5|$|This {{system of}} limited {{suffrage}} caused the predominantly Polish landowning class {{to dominate the}} Diet. Whilst they only made up about 0.4% of the population, they held 28.2% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> in the Diet. Small-scale rural landowners, on the other hand, made up about 95% of the population, but held only 52.3% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> in Diet. This system also skewed representation for different ethnicities in the Diet. Whilst Ruthenians made up about 40% {{of the population of}} Galicia, they only held 15% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> in the Diet, as they lived primarily in rural communities. Reform of the suffrage system in late 1913 added a fifth curia for the upper peasantry, which had the right to elect twenty deputies. Due to the outbreak of the First World War, no further elections to the Diet took place, and hence the fifth curia existed only on paper.|$|E

A new {{integrated}} {{child safety}} seat {{is presented in}} this paper. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> is a two-mode seat for a motor vehicle cooperable with an adult seat belt assembly to provide two modes operation including an adult seat mode and a child <b>seat</b> mode. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> locates in <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>seat.</b> <b>The</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> was designed in detail. <b>The</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> booster <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> can be adjusted continuously according to <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> shoulder height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child passenger. <b>The</b> depth <b>of</b> booster cushion also can be changed according to <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passenger. The sled test with <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> was conducted. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> simulation models with different booster heights were developed using MADYMO software and validated. Then, these models were used to study <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> in frontal impact. Some key parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> were studied in simulation test. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test and simulation show that <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> can provide effective protection for the children aged from 3 to 10 years in frontal impact...|$|R

5|$|As of November 2015, a {{majority}} of seats in the Maryland Senate are held {{by members of the}} Democratic Party, with 33 Democrats and 14 Republicans, greater than a two-thirds majority. This dominance is nothing new, as Democrats have had strong majorities in the chamber for decades. Democrats tend to control seats in the large population centers such as Baltimore City, Montgomery County, and Prince George's County, while Republicans control most seats on the Eastern Shore and in western Maryland.

Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{transmission}} <b>of</b> roll, {{pitch and}} yaw vibration from <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> a small car to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> backrest has been investigated with three road conditions. At <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base, there were distinctive differences between roll vibration at {{the front and rear}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base and between pitch vibration at the left- and right-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base. <b>The</b> yaw motion was generally small relative to the roll and pitch motion. At high frequencies, the yaw motion calculated from the difference between fore-aft vibration at the left- and right-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base was less than the yaw motion calculated from the differences between lateral vibration at the front and back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base. Furthermore, yaw motion calculated from the difference in lateral vibration at <b>the</b> right-hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> was greater than that at the left-hand side, due to differences between the two lateral accelerations at the two right corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base. <b>The</b> measurements indicated that <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base was not a rigid structure in either roll, pitch or yaw. <b>The</b> transmission <b>of</b> rotational vibration from <b>the</b> non-rigid <b>seat</b> base to fore-and-aft, lateral and vertical vibration at <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> backrest was investigated using single- and multi-input models. It was found that pitch and roll vibration, together with translational vibration at <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base, made significant contributions to seat backrest vibration. For predicting <b>seat</b> transmissibility in <b>the</b> fore-aft and vertical directions, a translational model comprising all the least-correlated fore-aft and vertical inputs, and a combined rotational and translational model consisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch vibration input and part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> least-correlated fore-aft and vertical inputs appeared equally good. Low coherency in <b>the</b> transmission <b>of</b> vibration to <b>the</b> lateral direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> backrest observed when considering only translational vibration at <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base was resolved after taking into account <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roll vibration at <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{vibration}} characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occupied car <b>seat</b> {{are usually}} measured using a semi-rigid pad containing accelerometers placed between <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> and <b>the</b> driver.

5|$|Alberta's second dynasty was the United Farmers of Alberta, a farmers' {{movement}} organization, {{formed in}} 1909 as a lobby group, whose political wing rose from a minor party named the Alberta Non-Partisan League, formed in 1916.

The loosely organized farmer candidates running in rural constituencies captured a majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b> The party was allied with Labour candidates, so it did not contest urban ridings, aside from one in Edmonton. Wood did not want the job as premier so the farmers were forced to shop around. UFA lawyer John Brownlee was asked first but declined.

Proper use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> belts reduce <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> death for driver and passengers, up to 50 % for driver, while for <b>the</b> rear <b>seat</b> passengers reduces <b>the</b> risk up to 75 %.
