As compared with the CB-HI group, the COPD-HI group had significantly higher (p < 0. 05) levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha in their SSP, whereas the degree of plasma protein leakage (SSP-to-serum ratio of plasma proteins) and the levels of interleukin (IL) - 8, secretory IgA, and lactoferrin were similar in the two groups. These findings point to differences in pathophysiology in CB-HI and COPD-HI.

All children with acute <b>obstructive</b> <b>bronchitis</b> were treated with oral rehydration, ambroxol orally, salbutamol, budesonide {{in the form of}} an aerosol dosed with a spacer or nebulation in respective age-dependent doses. In the vast majority of children (64. 1 %) the acute <b>obstructive</b> <b>bronchitis</b> first occurred in the first half of their life.

Materials and methods. We have carried out a comprehensive examination of 80 children aged 6 months to 3 years with acute <b>obstructive</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Patients were divided into two groups: children of the first group (n = 40) received systemic glucocorticosteroids, children of the second group (n = 40) were treated with inhaled glucocorticosteroids. Before and after the treatment, in all children we have studied the content of IFN-γ, IL- 4 and IL- 13 in the blood serum using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, the concentration of total IgE — by means of electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. The level of expression of the transcription factor NF-κB in peripheral blood lymphocytes was determined using flow cytometry. Results. Transcription factor NF-κB, having almost the same effect on the concentration of IFN-γ and IgE in the blood serum, determines the characteristics of inflammation, mainly local, in acute <b>obstructive</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Glucocorticosteroid therapy leads to the disappearance of NF-κB influence on the content of proinflammatory cytokines.

40|$|A {{previous}} large medical {{survey of}} active and retired sheet metal workers with 20 {{or more years}} in the trade indicated an unexpectedly high prevalence of obstructive pulmonary disease among both smokers and non-smokers. This study utilised interviews with {{a cross section of}} the previously surveyed group to explore occupational risk factors for lung disease. Four hundred and seven workers were selected from the previously surveyed group {{on the basis of their}} potential for exposure to fibreglass and asbestos. Selection was independent of health state, and excluded welders. A detailed history of occupational exposure was obtained by telephone interview for 333 of these workers. Exposure data were analysed in relation to previously collected data on chronic <b>bronchitis,</b> <b>obstructive</b> lung disease, and personal characteristics. Assessment of the effects of exposure to fibreglass as distinct from the effects of exposure to asbestos has been difficult in previous studies of construction workers. The experienced workers studied here have performed a diversity of jobs involving exposure to many different types of materials, and this enabled exposure to each dust to be evaluated separately. The risk of chronic bronchitis increased sharply by pack-years of cigarettes smoked; current smokers had a double risk compared with those who had never smoked or had stopped smoking. The occurrence of chronic bronchitis also increased with increasing duration of exposure to asbestos. Workers with a history of high intensity exposure to fibreglass had a more than doubled risk of chronic <b>bronchitis.</b> <b>Obstructive</b> lung disease, defined by results of pulmonary function tests at the medical survey, was also related to both smoking and occupational risk factors. Number of pack years smoked was the strongest predictor of obstructive lung disease. Duration of direct and indirect exposure to welding fume was also a positive predictor of obstructive lung disease. Duration of exposure to asbestos was significantly associated with obstructive lung disease but the dose-response relation was inconsistent, especially for those with higher pack-years of smoking exposure. Exposure to fibreglass was not a risk factor for obstructive lung disease...|$|R
40|$|Mucin glycoproteins {{belong to}} a class of high {{molecular}} weight, heavy glycosylated, proteins that together with water, salts and lipids constitute mucous secretions. Particular disease states (e. g. <b>obstructive</b> chronic <b>bronchitis</b> and ovarian tumor) are known to modify the composition and the thickness of those barriers. Therefore, {{it is important to}} address whether the absorption of potential drug candidates to be administered is influenced by the presence of interaction with this class of proteins. Typically, the methods adopted to characterize drug-protein interaction are dialysis, ultrafiltration and gel filtration. Besides these, bio-affinity chromatographic methods have demonstrated to be valuable tools offering the advantageous characteristics such as simplicity, efficiency, high-throughput capability and robustness. The present contribution reports on the synthesis and analytical characterization of a new chromatographic stationary phase based on covalently immobilized mucin and explores the use of LC-UV affinity zonal chromatography as a tool to screen drugs for their affinity to mucin. A series of different binding chemistries for the covalent linkage of mucin to silica-based supports as well as distinct immobilization protocols (static and dynamic) have been evaluated in order to optimize surface coverage. Resultant stationary phases have been characterized chromatographically by studying the effect of mobile phase and analyte structure on the distribution and retention of test compounds.

We aimed to estimate the independent and relative contributions to adult CB from other potential influences spanning childhood to middle age. Methods: The population-based Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study cohort, people born in 1961, completed respiratory questionnaires and spirometry in 1968 (n= 8, 583). Thirty-seven years later, in 2004, two-thirds responded to a detailed postal survey (n= 5, 729), from which the presence of CB was established in middle age. A subsample (n= 1, 389) underwent postbronchodilator spirometry between 2006 and 2008 for the assessment of chronic airflow limitation, from which nonobstructive and obstructive CB were defined. Multivariable and multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate relevant associations. Results: The prevalence of CB in middle age was 6. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 5. 5, 6. 8). Current asthma and/or wheezy breathing in middle age was independently associated with adult CB (odds ratio [OR]: 6. 2 [95 % CI: 4. 6, 8. 4]), and this estimate was significantly higher than for current smokers of at least 20 pack-years (OR: 3. 0 [95 % CI: 2. 1, 4. 3]). Current asthma and smoking in middle age were similarly associated with obstructive CB, in contrast to the association between allergy and nonobstructive CB. Childhood predictors included allergic history (OR: 1. 3 [95 % CI: 1. 1, 1. 7]), current asthma (OR: 1. 8 [95 % CI: 1. 3, 2. 7]), “episodic” childhood asthma (OR: 2. 3 [95 % CI: 1. 4, 3. 9]), and parental bronchitis symptoms (OR: 2. 5 [95 % CI: 1. 6, 4. 1]). Conclusion: The strong independent association between current asthma and CB in middle age suggests that this condition may be even more influential than personal smoking in a general population. The independent associations of childhood allergy and asthma, though not childhood bronchitis, as clinical predictors of adult CB raise the possibility of some of this burden having originated in childhood.

40|$|Cough as {{a symptom}} {{is one of}} the most common reasons for acute presentations to doctors. The burden of illness (number of presentations to doctors, {{impaired}} quality of life, and stress to parents) associated with chronic cough (> 4 wk duration) in children is high and is independent of the etiology. When the chronic cough resolves, the level of stress and quality of life scores significantly improve to population norms. Moreover, chronic cough can be a symptom of an underlying serious disease such as aspiration lung disease or bronchiectasis. Thus, all children with cough require a systematic evaluation and approach. This approach, which is different from adults, is briefly outlined in this review. Physiological reasons why chronic cough in children is different from adults includes the domains that relate to (i) cough-specific physiology, (ii) general respiratory physiology, (iii) other direct systems such as the immune system that influence the respiratory system, and (iv) other general physiology.

40|$|Abstract Background Persons {{affected}} by {{neurofibromatosis type 1}} (NF 1) have a decreased survival, yet information on NF 1 -associated mortality is limited. Methods/Aim The National Mortality Database and individual Multiple-Causes-of-Death records were used to estimate NF 1 -associated mortality in Italy in the period 1995 - 2006, to compare the distribution of age at death (as a proxy of survival) {{to that of the}} general population and to evaluate the relation between NF 1 and other medical conditions by determining whether the distribution of underlying causes of NF 1 -associated deaths differs from that of general population. Results Of the nearly 6. 75 million deaths in the study period, 632 had a diagnosis of NF 1, yet for nearly three-fourths of them the underlying cause was not coded as neurofibromatosis. The age distribution showed that NF 1 -associated deaths also occurred among the elderly, though mortality in early ages was high. The mean age for NF 1 -associated death was approximately 20 years lower than that for the general population. The gender differential may suggest that women are {{affected by}} more severe NF 1 -related complications, or they may simply reflect a greater tendency for NF 1 to be reported on the death certificates of young women. Regarding the relation with other medical conditions, we found an excess, as the underlying cause of death, for malignant neoplasm of connective and other soft tissue and brain, but not for other sites. We also found an excess for <b>obstructive</b> chronic <b>bronchitis</b> and musculoskeletal system diseases among elderly persons. Conclusion This is the first nationally representative population-based study on NF 1 -associated mortality in Italy. It stresses the importance of the Multiple-Causes-of-Death Database in providing a more complete picture of mortality for conditions that are frequently not recorded as the underlying cause of death, or to study complex chronic diseases or diseases that have no specific International Classification of Diseases code, such as NF 1. It also highlights the usefulness of already available data when a surveillance system is not fully operational. </p...|$|R

Four dimensional contingency table analysis by a logistic transform method showed highly significant (p less than 0. 001) additive affects of age (exposure duration), site of work, smoking, and alcohol consumption on development of overall chronic bronchitis (SCB + OCB). Odds ratios were face work:surface work = 1. 78 : 1, smoker:non-smoker = 4. 23 : 1, alcohol greater than 300 g/wk:alcohol less than 300 g/wk = 2. 13 : 1. There was no evidence for synergistic effects of these factors {{on the development of}} mucus hypersecretion. When OCB was analysed separately, the effect of site of work, although in the same direction, was not statistically significant and this was assumed to be due to a "healthy worker" effect or a "swamping" effect of smoking. Age, smoking, and alcohol effects were highly significant (p less than 0. 0001) and there was a sharp increase in prevalence of OCB in the age groups 41 - 50 and 51 - 60.

COPD pulmonary physiology reflects the sum of pathological changes in COPD, which can occur in large central airways, small peripheral airways, and the lung parenchyma. Quantitative or high-resolution computed tomography is used as a surrogate measure for assessment of disease progression. Different biological or molecular markers have been reported that reflect the mechanistic or pathogenic triad of inflammation, proteases, and oxidants and correspond to the different aspects of COPD histopathology. Similar to the pathogenic triad markers, genetic variations or polymorphisms have also been linked to COPD-associated inflammation, protease&ndash;antiprotease imbalance, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, in recent years, there have been reports identifying aging-associated mechanistic markers as downstream consequences of the pathogenic triad in the lungs from COPD patients. For this review, the authors have limited their discussion to a review of mechanistic markers and genetic variations and their association with COPD histopathology and disease status.

40|$|Auscultation is {{a method}} for {{diagnosis}} of especially internal medicine diseases such as cardiac, pulmonary and cardio-pulmonary by listening the internal sounds from the body parts. It is the simplest and the most common physical examination in the assessment processes of the clinical skills. In this study, the lung and heart sounds are recorded synchronously from left and right sides of posterior and anterior chest wall and back using two digital stethoscopes in Antakya State Hospital. The chest X-rays and the pulmonary function test variables and spirometric curves, the St. George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ-C) are collected as multimedia and clinical functional analysis variables of the patients. The 4 channels of heart sounds are focused on aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid and mitral areas. The 12 channels of lung sounds are focused on upper lung, middle lung, lower lung and costophrenic angle areas of posterior and anterior sides of the chest. The recordings are validated and labelled by two pulmonologists evaluating the collected chest x-ray, PFT and auscultation sounds of the subjects. The database consists of 30 healthy subjects and 45 subjects with pulmonary diseases such as asthma, chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary disease, <b>bronchitis.</b> The novelties of the database are the combination ability between auscultation sound results, chest X-ray and PFT; synchronously assessment capability of the lungs sounds; image processing based computerized analysis of the respiratory using chest X-ray and providing opportunity for improving analysis of both lung sounds and heart sounds on pulmonary and cardiac diseases...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} among female subjects to assess the possible association between selected risk factors and lung function as well as airway symptoms in a 32 -year perspective. The Prospective Population Study of Women was initiated in 1968 - 1969 in Göteborg, Sweden (population about 450 000) with follow-ups in 1974 - 1975, 1980 - 1981, 1992 - 1993 and 2000 - 2001. Women born in 1930, representative of women {{of the same age}} in the general population in 1968, were selected. Initially, 372 participants were included in the cohort. In 2000 - 2001, 231 of these women (73 %), now 70 years old, underwent lung function tests. The main outcome measures were lung function values, airway symptoms and health outcome in 2000 - 2001 in relation to self-reported exposures in 1968 - 1969 including smoking status. Smoking in 1968 - 1969 was associated with self-reported chronic <b>bronchitis,</b> <b>obstructive</b> symptoms and poor health 32 years later as well as lower lung function values, compared to non-smokers. Obesity, low socio-economic status and self-reported mental stress in 1968 - 1969 were associated with obstructive symptoms 32 years later. There are only a few longitudinal studies concerning women's health problems in this field and epidemiological studies of lung function impairment in women and risk factors in a long-term perspective are scarce. The results of the study suggest that life-style factors such as mental stress, obesity and smoking among women are related to airway symptoms and also quality of life many years later. </p...|$|R

Dublin, Ireland August 25 – 28, 2016 BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} SCAN is {{to gain a}} better {{understanding}} of the health and health care utilization of the population covered in each participating sites from the AsPEN. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of clinically recognized disease among the study population in Hong Kong (HK), Taiwan (TW), Japan (JP) and the United States (US). METHODS: We utilized the OMOP common data model in the AsPEN converted from a 1 % random sample of Hong Kong Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS), a 5 % random sample from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Japan Medical Data Center Database (JMDC), and 5 % sample from the US Medicare database. Prevalence rates (per 100 persons, age-gender adjusted) of 33 clinically recognized diseases were evaluated. RESULTS: 6, 476, 773 individuals were identified in 4 databases, 47 % were male. Hypertension is the most common disease in HK, TW and US and ranked fourth in JP with the prevalence of 2. 6, 7. 9, 59. 6 and 4. 6 respectively. Diabetes ranked third in HK (1. 3), fourth in TW (3. 8), fifth in JP (3. 7) and third in US (23. 3). Hyperlipidemia is the second most common in TW (5. 1), JP (4. 9) and US (51. 6) and seventh in HK (0. 8). <b>Obstructive</b> chronic <b>bronchitis</b> is the third most common disease in TW and JP (4. 6 for TW, 4. 8 for JP, 0. 7 for HK, 9. 1 for US). Asthma is the most common disease in JP (7. 6) but not in other sites (0. 5 for HK, 2. 3 for TW, 5 for US). Prevalence of cancers were similar among Asian sites ranging from 0. 1 - 0. 5 but were lower than US (0. 4 - 2. 2). Similar pattern was observed in psychiatric disorders; Prevalence of depression and schizophrenia were 0. 4 - 1. 6 and 0. 4 in Asian sites whereas 4. 4 and 1 in US. US has the highest prevalence in most of the diseases. CONCLUSIONS: US has the highest age-gender adjusted prevalence across most of the diseases but the discrepancy was much less in non-CV diseases. This may be due to the difference in diet and lifestyle as well as in health care system and coding between Asian countries and US. Understanding the underlying prevalence of disease across standardized database representations is important when undertaking multi-national studies. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo assess {{potential}} differences in epidemiology {{and management of}} patients admitted with influenza infection {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) during the first post-pandemic influenza period. Observational prospective study comparing September 2009 –January 2010 with September 2010 –January 2011. Variables captured: demographics, co-morbidities, physiological parameters, outcomes and management. Analysis was performed using SPSS v. 13. 0; significance was set at p 0. 5. Data from 53 patients, 38 adults (age, median 41. 5 years; interquartile range (IQR) 32. 8 – 51. 3) and 15 children (age, median 2 years, IQR 0. 5 – 9) are presented. Vaccination rates were 0 % and 4. 3 % during the first and second periods, respectively. Differences postpandemic were: 100 % of episodes developed after December compared with 16. 7 % in the 2009 season. Younger children were affected (median age 0. 8 years (IQR 0. 3 – 4. 8) vs 7 years (IQR 1. 25 – 11. 5), p 0. 05) and influenza B caused 8. 7 % of ICU admissions. Influenza A (H 1 N 1) 2009 and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics occurred simultaneously (42. 8 % of children) and bacterial co-infections doubled (from 10 % to 21. 7 %); the prevalence of co-infections (viral or bacterial) increased from 10 % to 39. 1 % (OR 5. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 – 24. 8). Respiratory syndromes without chest X-ray opacities reflecting exacerbation of asthma or chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary disease, <b>bronchitis</b> or bronchiolitis increased (from 6. 9 % to 39. 1 %, p < 0. 05) and pneumonia decreased (from 83. 3 % to 56. 5 %, p < 0. 05). Primary viral pneumonia predominated among ICU admissions. Postpandemic ICU influenza developed later, with some cases of influenza B, more frequent bacterial and viral co-infections and more patients with severe acute respiratory infection with normal chest X-ray. Increasing vaccination rates among risk-group individuals is warranted to prevent ICU admission and death...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Obstructive sleep apnoea is {{a common}} {{disorder}} with under-rated clinical impact, which is increasingly being recognised as having a major bearing on global disease burden. Men are especially vulnerable and become a priority group for preventative interventions. However, there is limited information on prevalence of the condition in Australia, its co-morbidities, and potential risk factors. Methods We used data from 13, 423 adult men included in the baseline wave of Ten to Men, an Australian national study of the health of males, assembled using stratified cluster sampling with oversampling from rural and regional areas. Those aged 18 – 55 years self-completed a paper-based questionnaire that included a question regarding health professional-diagnosed sleep apnoea, {{physical and mental health}} status, and health-related behaviours. Sampling weights were used to account for the sampling design when reporting the prevalence estimates. Odds ratios were used to describe the association between health professional-diagnosed sleep apnoea and potential correlates while adjusting for age, country of birth, and body-mass index (BMI). Results Prevalence of self-reported health professional-diagnosed sleep apnoea increased from 2. 2  % in age 18 – 25 years to 7. 8  % in the age 45 – 55 years. Compared with those without sleep apnoea, those with sleep apnoea had significantly poorer physical, mental, and self-rated health as well as lower subjective wellbeing and poorer concentration/remembering (p[*]<[*] 0. 001 for all). Sleep apnoea was significantly associated with older age (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), unemployment (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), asthma (p[*]=[*] 0. 011), chronic <b>obstructive</b> pulmonary disease/chronic <b>bronchitis</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 002), diabetes (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), hypercholesterolemia (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), hypertension (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), heart attack (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), heart failure (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), angina (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), depression (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), post-traumatic stress disorder (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), other anxiety disorders (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), schizophrenia (p[*]=[*] 0. 002), overweight/obesity (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), insufficient physical activity (p[*]=[*] 0. 006), smoking (p[*]=[*] 0. 005), and high alcohol consumption (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conclusion Health professional-diagnosed sleep apnoea is relatively common, particularly in older males. Associations between sleep apnoea and cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and psychiatric disorders have important clinical and public health implications. As men are especially vulnerable to sleep apnoea {{as well as some of}} its chronic co-morbidities, they are potentially a priority group for health interventions. Modifiable lifestyle related factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, level of physical activity and BMI are possible key foci for interventions...|$|R
