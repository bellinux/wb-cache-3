5|$|A Chera coin {{with the}} {{portrait}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king</b> wearing a Roman helmet was discovered from Karur. The obverse {{side of the}} silver coin has the portrait <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king,</b> facing left, wearing a Roman-type bristled-crown helmet. This coin maybelong to the 1st century BC and may be earlier to Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins. With a flat nose and protruding lips, he has a wide and thick ear lobe but wears no ear-ring. The person depicted appears to be elderly. Unlike other Chera silver portrait coins, the king's portrait on this coin faces left. The coin points to Romans having had trade contacts with the Chera kings and establishes that the Roman soldiers had landed in the Chera country to give protection to the Roman traders who had come there to buy materials.|$|E
5|$|Mourn for {{the loss}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king,</b> {{descendant}} of great Heracles.Herodotus tells us that Leonidas, {{in line with the}} prophecy, was convinced he was going to certain death since his forces were not adequate for a victory, and so he selected only Spartans with living sons.|$|E
5|$|My loving people, we {{have been}} persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but I assure you, I do not desire to live to {{distrust}} my faithful and loving people...

5|$|Stela 7 {{stands to}} the north of stelae5 and 6. It is in a {{reasonable}} state of preservation and bears the image of a ruler dressed as a ballplayer. This monument was probably dedicated in AD 780, although it records the accession <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king</b> of Seibal in AD 771.|$|E

5|$|A clay tablet {{found in}} ancient Iraq that {{promoted}} more advanced agricultural techniques is sometimes considered {{the first known}} example of public relations. Babylonian, Egyptian and Persian leaders created pyramids, obelisks and statues to promote their divine right to lead. Additionally, claims of magic or religious authority were used to persuade the public <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king</b> or pharaoh's right to rule.|$|E
5|$|Both Calakmul and Tikal were {{sizeable}} Preclassic {{cities that}} survived into the Classic Period. Early hieroglyphic texts from stelae found in Structure 2 record the probable enthronement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king</b> of Calakmul in AD 411 and also records a non-royal site ruler in 514. After this {{there is a}} gap in the hieroglyphic records that lasts over a century, although the Kaan dynasty experienced a major expansion of its power at this time. The lack of inscriptions recording the events of this period may be either {{due to the fact that}} the Kaan dynasty was located elsewhere during this time or perhaps that the monuments were later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Convocation sejm (Sejm konwokacyjny). This sejm {{was called}} upon a death or abdication <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king</b> by the Primate of Poland.

This sejm was to last two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Edinburgh Zoo's long {{association}} with penguins began in January 1914, {{with the arrival}} of three king penguins from the Christian Salvesen whaling expedition which docked in Leith. The subsequent successful hatching <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king</b> penguin chick in 1919 was the first penguin to be hatched in captivity. These were the first penguins to be seen outside of the South Atlantic anywhere in the world. The now famous daily penguin parade started by accident in 1950 with the escape of several birds. This proved so popular with visitors and the penguins that it is a daily feature of the zoo today.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia owned a King Charles Spaniel at {{the time}} of the {{shooting}} of the Romanov family on 17 July 1918. Eight days later, Nicholas Sokolov of the White Forces found a clearing where he believed the bodies of the Romanov family had been burnt, and discovered the corpse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>King</b> Charles Spaniel at the site. In 1920s, the Duchess of Marlborough bred so many King Charles Spaniels at Blenheim Palace that her husband moved out and later evicted the Duchess herself.|$|E
5|$|In February 1685, King Charles II died without {{legitimate}} issue, and George's father-in-law, the Roman Catholic Duke of York, became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. George {{was appointed}} to the Privy Council and invited to attend Cabinet meetings, although he had no power to alter or affect decisions. William of Orange refused to attend James's coronation largely because George would take precedence over him. Although they were both sons-in-law of King James, George was also the son and brother <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king</b> and so outranked William, who was an elected stadtholder of a republic.|$|E

5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king</b> or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
5|$|The Great Officers of State {{traditionally}} participate {{during the}} ceremony. The offices of Lord High Steward and Lord High Constable {{have not been}} regularly filled since the 15th and 16th centuries respectively; they are, however, revived for coronation ceremonies. The Lord Great Chamberlain enrobes the sovereign with the ceremonial vestments, {{with the aid of}} the Groom of the Robes and the Master (in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king)</b> or Mistress (in the case of a queen) of the Robes.|$|E
5|$|Veerasimhan (M. K. Radha) and Sasankan (Ranjan) are {{the sons}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king.</b> When Veerasimhan rides through a village, he meets a local dancer named Chandralekha (T. R. Rajakumari) and they fall in love. At the palace, the king decides to abdicate his throne {{in favour of}} Veerasimhan. This enrages Sasankan, Veerasimhan's younger brother, who forms a gang of thieves; they embark on a crime spree. Chandralekha's father is injured in the ensuing chaos, and dies shortly afterwards. The {{orphaned}} Chandralekha joins a band of travelling musicians, whose caravan is raided by Sasankan's gang.|$|E

5|$|Alfred also {{assisted}} {{his own son}} {{by promoting}} men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. In the view of Barbara Yorke, the compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which magnified Alfred's achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen {{the case for the}} succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as regina, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold's status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward. Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis (son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king),</b> but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} prince, Augustus also gave Phraates IV an Italian slave-girl, {{who later became}} Queen Musa of Parthia. To ensure that her child Phraataces would inherit the throne without incident, Musa {{convinced}} Phraates IV to give his other sons to Augustus as hostages. Again, Augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of Parthia to Rome, listing it as a great accomplishment in his Res Gestae Divi Augusti. When Phraataces took the throne as Phraates V (r. c.2BC – 4AD), Musa married her own son and ruled alongside him. The Parthian nobility, disapproving of both the incestuous relationship and the notion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>king</b> with non-Arsacid blood, forced the pair into exile in Roman territory. Phraates' successor Orodes III of Parthia lasted just two years on the throne, and was followed by Vonones I, who had adopted many Roman mannerisms during time in Rome. The Parthian nobility, angered by Vonones' sympathies for the Romans, backed a rival claimant, Artabanus III of Parthia (r. c.10–38AD), who eventually defeated Vonones and drove him into exile in Roman Syria.|$|E
5|$|Also in 941, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters {{reports that}} a {{chieftain}} named Áed Albanach was slain amongst a vast host of Dublin Vikings by the invading forces of Amargein mac Cináeda, overking of Uí Failge. The fact that Áed bore a Gaelic personal name, died with the Dubliners, and bore an epithet referring to a Scotsman, could be evidence {{that he was a}} successor of Gebeachan. Further evidence of this may be the record of Mór, a woman attested by the twelfth-century pseudo-historical Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil, which identifies her as a daughter of a certain Áed mac Echach, and describes her as the daughter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>King</b> of the Hebrides.|$|E
