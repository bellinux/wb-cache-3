6000|$|... "Well," [...] drawled Baxter, [...] "it's only a half-moon, {{and the man}} wasn't very close, but I think he'd a black plug hat. As most of us wear gray ones, {{that kind}} of struck me. I've a notion that his <b>overall</b> <b>jacket</b> was brown." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{glanced at}} the morass hesitatingly. It did not look inviting. In places the reeds grew as high as their heads, and one could not tell what depths they hid. In other spots there were tracks of slimy ooze in which one might sink a long way. None of them, however, was fastidious, and they waded out into the mire, {{shouting}} warnings to one another, disappearing now and then among the grass. The search was partially rewarded, for while Prescott and a companion were skirting a clump of reeds they saw part of a soaked garment protruding from the slime. For a few moments they stood looking at it irresolutely; and then Prescott, mustering his courage, advanced and seized the stained material. It came away more readily than he had expected, {{and he turned to}} his companion, conscious of keen relief, with a brown <b>overall</b> <b>jacket</b> in his hand. A further examination, shrinkingly made, revealed nothing else, and after marking the place they waded to the bank. The garment was carefully washed in the creek and the men gathered in a ring round Curtis when he inspected it.|$|E
50|$|Cables for industrial, {{commercial}} and apartment buildings may contain many insulated conductors in an <b>overall</b> <b>jacket,</b> with helical tape steel or aluminium armour, or steel wire armour, and perhaps as well an overall PVC or lead jacket {{for protection from}} moisture and physical damage. Cables intended for very flexible service or in marine applications may be protected by woven bronze wires. Power or communications cables (e.g., computer networking) that are routed in or through air-handling spaces (plenums) of office buildings are required under the model building code to be either encased in metal conduit, or rated for low flame and smoke production.|$|E
60|$|During {{the next}} few days the dog made himself at home at the ranch, though with the {{exception}} of Miss Oliver he still eyed its inhabitants suspiciously. Jake said that though almost fully grown he was young and had no sense yet. Then the dog commenced to follow the boys about at a distance, and once fell upon and destroyed their <b>overall</b> <b>jackets</b> which they had taken off when they went to work. They found him sitting upon the tatters, evidently feeling proud of himself, for he wagged his tail and barked delightedly when they approached. As a rule, he did not make much noise, but his growl was deep and ominous, with something in it that discouraged any attempt at undue familiarity.|$|R
5000|$|The first rubber-insulated cables for USA {{building}} wiring {{were introduced in}} 1922 with [...] These were two or more solid copper electrical wires with rubber insulation, plus woven cotton cloth over each conductor for protection of the insulation, with an <b>overall</b> woven <b>jacket,</b> usually impregnated with tar as a protection from moisture. Waxed paper {{was used as a}} filler and separator.|$|R
50|$|Underground {{telegraph}} cables {{into large}} buildings or between stations often needed to carry multiple independent telegraph lines. These cables {{took the form}} of multiple insulated conductors enclosed by a metal screen and <b>overall</b> protective <b>jacket.</b> In such cables the screen can be used as the return conductor. Undersea telegraph cables were usually a single conductor protected by steel-wire armour, effectively a coaxial cable. The first transatlantic cable of this kind was completed in 1866.|$|R
50|$|The FileWare {{diskette}} has {{the same}} <b>overall</b> <b>jacket</b> dimensions of a normal 5¼ inch diskette, {{but because of the}} head arrangement, the jacket has non-standard cutouts for the heads, with two sets of cutouts {{on opposite sides of the}} spindle hole. The write enable sensor is also in a non-standard location, though most FileWare diskettes were produced without a write protect slot. The jacket had a corner cutout that keyed the diskette to prevent insertion in an incorrect orientation, and a rectangular hole that the drive could use to latch the diskette in place, preventing removal until the software allowed it.|$|E
50|$|The company {{produces}} {{sports and}} active lifestyle wear {{for women and}} men. Audimas manufactures the following products: tops (shirts, t-shirts, polo shirts), outerwear (jackets, pants, blouses, tunics, skirts, dresses, coats, <b>jackets,</b> <b>overalls),</b> swimsuits, cycling jerseys and sports clothing (basketball wear), undergarments (lingerie, bras, panties, socks). In addition, the company produces headgear (hats, kerchiefs), accessories (bracelets, belts, gloves, scarves), towels and backpacks.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the days}} of the Old West, a type of heavyweight dark blue {{seersucker}} known as [...] "hickory stripe" [...] was used to make the <b>overalls,</b> work <b>jackets</b> and peaked caps of train engineers and railroad workers such as George [...] "Stormy" [...] Kromer or Casey Jones. It was later worn by butchers and employees of the gasoline companies, most notably Standard Oil. This cotton fabric was durable like denim, cheap to produce, kept the wearer cool in the hot cab of the steam locomotive, and obscured oil or coal tar stains. Even today, the uniforms of American Union Pacific train drivers include [...] "railroad stripe" [...] caps based on those from the steam age, and some rolling stock used for freight, shunting and maintenance work is painted with blue and white [...] "zebra stripes" [...] to improve visibility.|$|R
50|$|A {{submersible}} pump cable is a specialized product {{to be used}} for a {{submersible pump}} in a deep well, or in similarly harsh conditions. The cable needed for this type of application must be durable and reliable as the installation location and environment can be extremely restrictive as well as hostile. As such, submersible pump cable can be used in both fresh and salt water. It is also suitable for direct burial and within well castings. A submersible pump cable's area of installation is physically restrictive. Cable manufacturers must keep these factors in mind to achieve the highest possible degree of reliability. The size and shape of submersible pump cable can vary depending on the usage and preference and pumping instrument of the installer. Pump cables are made in single and multiple conductor types and may be flat or round in cross section; some types include control wires as well as power conductors for the pump motor. Conductors are often color-coded for identification and an <b>overall</b> cable <b>jacket</b> may also be color-coded.|$|R
5000|$|The Duck Head brand {{was founded}} in 1865 in Nashville, Tennessee by George and Joe O'Bryan, two {{brothers}} who were buying surplus U.S. Army tent material. The material was a heavy canvas known as [...] "duck", and the brothers began making work pants and shirts out of the strong material. Their company {{became known as the}} O’Bryan Brothers Manufacturing Company. [...] The brothers sought to register the name [...] "Duck" [...] as a trademark in 1892, but the U.S. Trademark Registration Office rejected their application because the term was in general use. They registered the trademark [...] "Duck Head" [...] instead. The company operated into the late 20th century, producing work clothing such as <b>overalls</b> and denim <b>jackets</b> under the Duck Head brand.|$|R
500|$|For Rainbow, Carey {{embarked}} on her fourth and third worldwide tour, titled the Rainbow World Tour (2000). Throughout it, Carey performed the song live during every show. The synopsis behind each performance was a wrestling match in between Carey and Bianca, where Carey would sing the remix and original {{versions of the}} song throughout each small interlude of the fight. Carey was brought out with boxing gloves to the stage, performing the remix version of the song. After she began wrestling and boxing with Bianca, she defeated her, prompting her to begin the original version of the song. [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] featured a very different set up for Carey's [...] (2002–03). During the tour, Carey wore a sparkling, Swarovski bikini number, and performed both the remix and original versions back-to-back. Several male and female dancers were on stage during the performances, as well as different musicians and back-up vocalists. During Carey's following tour, The Adventures of Mimi Tour, [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] was once again performed {{at each of the}} shows. For the song's recital, Carey's donned a black bikini and matching silk cape, as well as Christian Louboutin platform pumps. Several male dancers were present on stage, wearing black <b>overalls</b> and <b>jackets</b> while performing heavy dance routines. For the show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Carey was joined by both Da Brat and Jay-Z for the remix and original versions, respectively. During the Angels Advocate Tour, the song was paired with Love Hangover by Diana Ross, and performed in a mash-up, the same as she did in VH1 Divas in 2000.|$|R

5000|$|The 1st Battalion went on {{to fight}} at the Battle of Waterloo as part of John Lambert's 10th Brigade in the 6th Division. At about 6:30 PM, the French {{captured}} the key strongpoint of La Haye Sainte farm. After this success, they brought up several cannon and took the Anglo-Allied lines under fire at extremely close range. At this period, the 698-strong battalion was deployed in square {{at the point where}} the Ohain road crossed the Charleroi to Brussels highway. At a range of 300 yd, the French artillery caused the unit enormous casualties within a short time. At day's end, the 3rd Battalion had lost 105 killed and 373 wounded, a total of 478 casualties, without breaking. The unit was described as [...] "lying dead in a square". At the time of Waterloo, the soldiers of the 27th were dressed in red, short-tailed <b>jackets,</b> <b>overall</b> trousers, and a high-fronted shako. The facing colour was buff and it was displayed on the collar, cuffs, and shoulder-straps. The lace on the cuffs and jackets had square-ended loops.|$|R
50|$|The Ducks {{went on a}} roll in {{the month}} of January winning 8 of 11 games. Throughout the month, however, all of Anaheim's wins were very close games with the Ducks winning by only one goal with the {{exception}} of the 6-0 victory over Columbus on January 7. Anaheim was on a long homestand during the first half of the month and started with a 1-1 record in the new year by defeating the defending champion Blackhawks and falling to the Nashville Predators in front of the smallest home crowd of the season (a mere 12,216). After that loss, they took advantage of home ice by taking down the Blue Jackets, rival Sharks, and Blues. Anaheim then fell to the Phoenix Coyotes in a short one game road trip to the desert but then came home to defeat the Edmonton Oilers on January 16 in their final home game until after the All-Star Game. Heading out on the road, the Ducks were to face the Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, and Columbus Blue <b>Jackets.</b> <b>Overall,</b> Anaheim had a very good road trip only falling to Toronto. The game against the Leafs was significant because it was the first time former Ducks netminder (and Ducks starter in the 2003 and 2007 finals) J.S. Giguere would face his old team. Giguere got the best of Anaheim by posting a 5-2 victory. The game at Montreal was also significant because it was Ducks centerman Saku Koivu's first time playing at the Bell Centre since he signed with Anaheim prior to the 2009-10 season. The Canadien faithful gave Koivu an incredibly warm welcome, but in the end, the patrons at the Bell Centre were not pleased with the final result as Anaheim skated away with a 4-3 shootout victory. Going into the All-Star Game, the Ducks had 60 points, enough to be in the top 8 and were honored to send 3 players to the festivities in Raleigh, North Carolina. Ducks winger Corey Perry was selected alongside goaltender Jonas Hiller (the only goaltender from the Western Conference) to participate in the game. Rookie defenseman Cam Fowler also attended, but he (along with many other rookies) were only there to compete in the skills tournament.|$|R
