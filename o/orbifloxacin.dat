40|$|<b>Orbifloxacin</b> is a {{fluoroquinolone}} drug used {{widely in}} companion animal medicine. In this study, we firstly determined post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) and post-antibiotic sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) effects (PA-SMEs) of <b>orbifloxacin</b> for two strains each of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from dogs, and these parameters {{were compared with}} those of enrofloxacin.

40|$|<b>Orbifloxacin</b> is a {{fluoroquinolone}} with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and {{belongs to}} the third generation of quinolones. Regarding the quality control of medicines, a validated microbiological assay for determination of <b>orbifloxacin</b> in pharmaceutical formulations has not as yet been reported. For this purpose, this paper reports the development and validation of a simple, sensitive, accurate and reproducible agar diffusion method to quantify <b>orbifloxacin</b> in tablet formulations. The assay {{is based on the}} inhibitory effect of <b>orbifloxacin</b> upon the strain of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 used as test microorganism. The results were treated statistically by analysis of variance and were found to be linear (r = 0. 9992) in the selected range of 16. 0 - 64. 0 μg/mL, precise with relative standard deviation (RSD) of repeatability intraday = 2. 88 %, intermediate precision RSD = 3. 33 %, and accurate (100. 31 %).

40|$|Pharmacokinetics and {{distribution}} of <b>orbifloxacin</b> into body fluids and endometrium was studied in 6 mares after intragastric (IG) administration at a single dose rate of 7. 5 mg/kg body weight. <b>Orbifloxacin</b> concentrations were serially measured in serum, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and endometrial tissues over 24 hours. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of <b>orbifloxacin</b> were determined for 120 equine pathogens over an 11 -month period. The mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) was 2. 41 +/- 0. 30 microg/mL at 1. 5 hours after administration and decreased to 0. 17 +/- 0. 01 microg/mL (Cmin) at 24 hours. The mean elimination half-life (t 1 / 2) was 9. 06 +/- 1. 33 hours and area under the serum concentration vs time curve (AUC) was 20. 54 +/- 1. 70 mg h/L. Highest mean peritoneal fluid concentration was 2. 15 +/- 0. 49 microg/mL at 2 hours. Highest mean synovial fluid concentration was 1. 17 +/- 0. 28 microg/mL at 4 hours. Highest mean urine concentration was 536. 67 +/- 244. 79 microg/mL at 2 hours. Highest mean endometrial concentration was 0. 72 +/- 0. 23 microg/g at 1. 5 hours.

40|$|O presente estudo teve como objetivos, avaliar o uso da orbifloxacina nas cistites bacterianas de felinos, e seus possíveis efeitos colaterais, mormente a nefro e/ou hepatotoxicidade. Para tanto, foram colhidas amostras de urina de 53 gatos com históricos variados, mas com predisposição à infecção urinária. A cistite bacteriana foi comprovada, através de exame microbiológico, em 13 pacientes. No entanto, apenas 10 apresentaram infecção por agentes sensíveis a orbifloxacina. Esses 10 pacientes foram então submetidos ao tratamento com orbifloxacina na dose de 2, 5 mg kg- 1 a cada 24 horas por 10 dias. Não houve crescimento bacteriano nas amostras de urina submetidas à cultura, 72 horas após a interrupção do tratamento. Não foram observados sinais de nefro e/ou hepatotoxicidade nesses pacientes, uma vez que os níveis séricos de alanina aminotransferase (ALT), aspartato aminotransferase (AST), fosfatase alcalina (FA), albumina, uréia e creatinina não tiveram variação significativa após o uso do fármaco. Portanto, os resultados apresentados sugerem que a orbifloxacina pode ser usada como agente antimicrobiano nas infecções urinárias de felinos. The main {{goals of}} this study were the {{evaluation}} of <b>orbifloxacin</b> in the treatment of lower urinary tract infection in cats, and its toxicity mainly to kidney and/or liver. To achieve these goals, quantitative urine cultures were performed in 53 urine samples, collected from cats with signs of lower urinary tract infection. Bacterial cystitis was confirmed in 13 cats, however in only 10 samples the isolated bacteria was in vitro susceptible to <b>orbifloxacin.</b> These 10 cats with bacterial cystitis were submitted to the treatment with <b>orbifloxacin</b> (2. 5 mg kg- 1 once a day/ 10 days). Seventy two hours after finishing the treatment, urine samples were collected and cultured again. The results were a negative urine culture for all ten cats. No signs of liver and/or kidney toxicity were observed in these cats since the serum liver enzymes alanine aminotranferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and serum albumin, besides urea and creatinine have not changed after using this drug.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{aimed to develop}} a simple, fast, and {{reliable}} technique to detect fluoroquinolones (FQs) -conjugated bovine serum albumin (BSA).

The technique was designed according to the different absorption characteristics of the FQs and BSA; FQs can be detected by both UV and fluorescence detectors, but BSA can only be detected by UV. The results demonstrated that the developed method was efficient in detecting FQs-BSA conjugates. In addition, the method not only trace the FQs and BSA conjugation responses but {{also can be used}} to estimate the level of FQs-BSA conjugation. Therefore, this technique is a valuable toot for the detection drug-carrier-conjugated antigens, especially for FQs-BSA-conjugates during the production of anti-FQs monoclonal antibodies...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 23). Widely considered in the medical field as the last of the golden anti-microbial drugs, fluorinated quinolones provide a "last defense" for the attack on bacterial infections. The drugs are useful for treating gram negative and some gram positive infections. Among the advantages of fluorinated quinolones are oral dosing, resistance that develops slowly via mutation rather than plasmid mediated mutations and high bactericidal activity at low concentrations. All are quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, which inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase, a mechanism of action unique among the antibacterials. The drugs considered in this study were enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, and <b>orbifloxacin.</b> Enrofloxacin, difloxacin, and <b>orbifloxacin</b> are veterinary products used to treat dermal, respiratory and urinary infections in small animals. Ciprofioxacin, however, is a human drug used for similar infections. The human drug, ciprofloxacin, is often cited as effective against selected microorganisms in veterinary medicine, while the veterinary drug, enrofloxacin, is cited as resistant. As a result, veterinarians often use the human drug. Yet, the chemical structures of the drugs suggest that microorganisms should exhibit similar susceptibility patterns. This study hopes to prove an equal effectiveness of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Microbial susceptibility to drugs is measured by determining the MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration). The MIC is measured based on the growth of the targeted bacteria in increasing concentrations of each drug following incubation under standard conditions. A method using microtiter plates containing broth was developed to measure concentrations of growth using colorimetric procedures. Comparisons in 100 bacterial organisms reveal subtle differences in the MIC's between the drugs (based on micromolar concentrations) showing relative effectiveness between the organisms. This study supports our belief that bacterial susceptibility does not differ among enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin available to the veterinary practitioner. This study also attempts to explain mechanisms of resistance in microorganisms found to be resistant to the four fluorinated quinolones. Using biochemical techniques, these organisms will then be used to analyze patterns of resistance on a cellular level with determination of why the organism is resistant. Searching for patterns of resistance involves isolating the DNA, PCR reactions for amplification of the DNA, and bacterial transformation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Orbifloxacin</b> (ORBI) is {{a widely}} used {{antimicrobial}} drug of the fluoroquinolone class. In the official pharmaceutical compendia the existence of polymorphism in this active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is reported. No crystal structure has been reported for this API and {{as described in the}} literature, its solubility is very controversial. Considering that different solid forms of the same API may have different physicochemical properties, these different solubilities may have resulted from analyses inadvertently carried out on different polymorphs. The solubility is the most critical property because it can affect the bioavailability and may compromise the quality of a drug product. The crystalline structure of ORBI determined by SCXRD is reported here for the first time. The structural analysis reveals that the ORBI molecule is zwitterionic and hemihydrated. ORBI hemihydrated form was characterized by the following techniques: TG/DTA, FTIR-ATR, and PXRD. A second crystalline ORBI form is also reported: the ORBI anhydrous form was obtained by heating the hemihydrate. These ORBI solid forms were isomorphous, since no significant change in unit cell and space group symmetry were observed. The solid-state phase transformation between these forms is discussed and the equilibrium solubility data were examined in order to check the impact of the differences observed in their crystalline structures...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The minimum {{inhibitory}} concentrations (MICs), mutation prevention concentrations (MPCs) and {{contribution of}} quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) mutations to fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and <b>orbifloxacin)</b> susceptibility in 23 Pasteurella multocida (Pm) isolates were investigated. Fluoroquinolone-susceptible isolates (MICs ≤ 0. 25 µg/ml, 9 isolates) had no QRDR mutations, {{and their respective}} MPCs were low. Fluoroquinolone-intermediate isolates (MICs= 0. 5 µg/ml, 14 isolates) had QRDR mutations (Asp 87 to Asn or Ala 84 to Pro in gyrA), and their respective MPCs were high (4 – 32 µg/ml). First-step mutants (n= 5) and laboratory-derived highly resistant fluoroquinolone mutants (n= 5) also had QRDR mutations. The MICs of fluoroquinolones for mutant-derived strains were decreased {{in the presence of}} efflux inhibitors. The results indicated that the fluoroquinolone resistance of Pm is mainly due to multiple target gene mutations in gyrA and parC and the overexpression of efflux pump genes.

40|$|Pradofloxacin (PRA) is an 8 -cyano-fluoroquinolone (FQ) being {{developed}} to treat bacterial infections in dogs and cats. Its mutant prevention concentrations (MPC) were determined for Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 at 0. 225 μg/ml, and for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 at 0. 55 μg/ml. At drug concentrations {{equal to or}} above the MPC, growth (implying selective clonal expansion) of first-step FQ-resistant variants, naturally present in large bacterial populations, was inhibited. MPC 90 derived from 10 clinical isolates each of E. coli and Staphylococcus intermedius, the latter species being of greater clinical relevance than S. aureus in companion-animal medicine, amounted to 0. 2 to 0. 225 and 0. 30 to 0. 35 μg/ml, respectively. MPCs of other veterinary FQs were assessed to determine relative in vitro potencies. The MPCs of marbofloxacin, enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, sarafloxacin, <b>orbifloxacin,</b> and difloxacin were 1. 2 -, 1. 4 -, 2. 3 -, 2. 4 -, 5 -, and 7 -fold higher than the MPC of PRA for E. coli ATCC 8739, and 6 -, 6 -, 19 -, 15 -, 15 -, and 31 -fold higher than the MPC of PRA for S. aureus ATCC 6538, respectively. MPC curves revealed a pronounced heterogeneity in susceptibility within populations of ≥ 4 × 109 CFU employed, extending to 10 -fold above the MICs. The duration of incubation and, for S. aureus, inoculum density profoundly affected the MPCs.

40|$|Abstract Background Antimicrobial {{resistance}} in staphylococci, {{often associated with}} treatment failure, is increasingly reported in veterinary medicine. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate patterns and predictors of antimicrobial resistance among Staphylococcus spp. isolates from canine samples submitted to the bacteriology laboratory at the University of Pretoria academic veterinary hospital between 2007 and 2012. Retrospective data of 334 Staphylococcus isolates were used to calculate the proportion of samples resistant to 15 antimicrobial agents. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to investigate temporal trends and logistic regression models were used to investigate predictors of antimicrobial {{resistance in}} Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Results Results show that 98. 2 % (55 / 56) of the S. aureus isolates were resistant to at least one drug while 42. 9 % were multidrug resistant. Seventy-seven percent (214 / 278) of the S. pseudintermedius isolates were resistant to at least one drug and 25. 9 % (72 / 278) were multidrug resistant. Resistance to lincospectin was more common among S. aureus (64. 3 %) than S. pseudintermedius (38. 9 %). Similarly, resistance to clindamycin was higher in S. aureus (51. 8 %) than S. pseudintermedius (31. 7 %) isolates. There was a significant (p =  0. 005) increase in S. aureus resistance to enrofloxacin over the study period. Similarly, S. pseudintermedius exhibited significant increasing temporal trend in resistance to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (p =  0. 004), clindamycin (p =  0. 022) and <b>orbifloxacin</b> (p =  0. 042). However, there was a significant decreasing temporal trend in the proportion of isolates resistant to doxycycline (p =  0. 041), tylosin (p =  0. 008), kanamycin (p =  0. 017) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (p =  0. 032). Conclusions High levels of multidrug resistance and the increasing levels of resistance to sulphonamides, lincosamides and fluoroquinolones among Staphylococcus spp. isolates in this study are concerning. Future studies will need to investigate local drivers of antimicrobial resistance to better guide control efforts to address the problem...|$|E
