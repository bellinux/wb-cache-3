The fouling materials can consist of either living organisms (biofouling) or a non-living substance (inorganic or <b>organic).</b> <b>Fouling</b> is usually distinguished from other surface-growth phenomena, in that it occurs on a surface of a component, system or plant performing a defined and useful function, and that the fouling process impedes or interferes with this function.|$|E
50|$|Clean-in-place {{systems are}} {{typically}} used to remove fouling from membranes after extensive use. The CIP process may use detergents, reactive agents such as sodium hypochlorite and acids and alkalis such as citric acid and sodium hydroxide. Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) {{must be removed}} from the feed in some membrane plants. Bleach oxidizes thin-film membranes. Oxidation will degrade the membranes to a point where they will no longer perform at rated rejection levels and have to be replaced. Bleach can be added to a NaOH sodium hydroxide CIP during an initial system start-up before spirally-wound membranes are loaded into the plant to help disinfect the system. Bleach is also used to CIP perforated stainless steel (Graver) membranes, as their tolerance for sodium hypochlorite is much higher than a spirally-wound membrane. Caustics and acids are most often used as primary CIP chemicals. Caustic removes <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> and acid removes minerals. Enzyme solutions are also used in some systems for helping remove <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> material from the membrane plant. The pH and temperature are important to a CIP program. If pH and temperature are too high the membrane will degrade and flux performance will suffer. If pH and temperature are too low, the system simply will not be cleaned properly. Every application has different CIP requirements. e.g. a dairy RO reverse osmosis plant most likely will require a more rigorous CIP program than a water purification RO plant. Each membrane manufacturer has their own guidelines for CIP procedures for their product.|$|E

40|$|Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a non-destructive, {{real time}} {{monitoring}} technique {{that has the}} ability to detect inorganic and organic foulants on a RO membrane surface. For the inorganic fouling study, calcium sulphate (CaSO 4) and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), which are two typical, scalants observed in RO plants, were used to assess feasibility of EIS to detect inorganic fouling. EIS signals were obtained across a frequency range of 10 - 1 to 106 Hz and it can be concluded that conductance values obtained at low frequencies (10 - 100 Hz), co-relates to the environment on the membrane surface. Scale formation was detected before any significant permeate flux decline was observed. Hence, conductance at low frequencies is the most relevant EIS parameter for scale detection in RO systems. Given the instability of EIS signals at high frequencies, the same approach of measuring conductance at low frequencies was also applied to the <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> experiments. Different concentrations of Tryptophan, alginate and humic acid, in the presence of divalent ions (Ca 2 +) were used to mimic typical organic foulants and were filtered in batch mode till 85 % recovery was achieved. EIS was operated throughout the filtration and the conductance was measured across a range of low frequencies. Based on conductance data at 38 Hz, EIS is able to successfully characterize the initial deposition of <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> on the membrane. However, results obtained from experiments using higher feed concentrations did not detect significant changes highlighting the limitation in using EIS for monitoring <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> formation for feed solutions above a fouling threshold limit. Trends obtained during this study further ascertain the ability of EIS to detect the formation of fouling and to characterize the <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> layer during the initial adsorption phase on the membrane surface. In conclusion, EIS is capable of monitoring inorganic scaling and <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> in situ and in real time through the analysis of the electrical properties of the membrane surface. In particular, in systems that experience <b>organic</b> <b>fouling,</b> EIS can identify and determine the composition during the initial stages of <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> on the RO membrane.

40|$|The {{influence}} of membrane fouling on {{the retention of}} the trace organic contaminant sulfamethoxazole by a nanofiltration (NF) process was investigated. <b>Organic</b> <b>fouling</b> caused a severe flux decline possibly due to pore blocking and adsorption directly after the commencement of the fouling layer development. Such membrane-foulant interactions were absent for colloidal fouling, {{which resulted in a}} more gradual flux decline. Membrane charge {{played a significant role in}} the separation process of inorganic salts, where the retention was the highest in a caustic environment (high pH) due to more swollen membrane material caused by the higher negative charge on the membrane. <b>Organic</b> <b>fouling</b> and a combination of colloidal and <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> led to a significant increase in the membrane negative charge. The {{influence of}} membrane fouling on solute retention was dependent on the fouling behaviour and the physicochemical properties of the model foulants, where the model foulants probably contributed to an increase in the retention of charged solutes due to enhanced electrostatic interactions. <b>Organic</b> <b>fouling</b> caused an increase in the retention of inorganic salts and sulfamethoxazole due to pore blocking. In contrast, colloidal fouling caused a decrease in the retention of inorganic salts due to cake-enhanced concentration polarisation. However, the presence of a colloidal fouling layer did not reduce the retention of sulfamethoxazole. A mixture of colloidal and organic matter improved the retention of inorganic salts. A similar conclusion can be inferred for sulfamethoxazole at pH 4 when the compound exists in a neutral form...|$|E

However, the popular nascent polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes are susceptible to <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> and/or biofouling, which still remain as the main problem that reduces the cost-effectiveness of the processes. Recently, an innovative surface modification approach was developed which involves the doping of anhydrous and hydrated aluminum oxides (γ-alumina, boehmite and gibbsite) onto the PVDF membrane surface in an attempt to improve the membrane anti-fouling property. In this study, the anti-fouling performance of the aluminum oxide-doped membranes was evaluated, in comparison to the nascent PVDF membranes. Filtration of sodium alginate solution found that the nascent PVDF UF membrane was quite susceptible to <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> due to its hydrophobic nature. In contrast, <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> to either the γ-alumina-embedded or gibbsite-grown UF membranes was insignificant. However, during the filtration of calcium alginate dispersion, gel layer was formed on the surface of all tested UF membranes. Nevertheless, the extent of gel layer formation on the γ-alumina-embedded membrane was significantly lower than that on the nascent membrane. It appears that the growth of gibbsite particles did not help to reduce the extent of gel layer formation, which possibly resulted from the increased membrane surface roughness. With regard to biofouling, it showed that the attached bacteria per unit area were reduced with increased coverage ratio of the aluminum oxides on the UF/MF membrane surface. Although γ-alumina embedment could not completely eliminate bacterial attachment, the biofilm growth on it was largely prohibited. It seems that in situ embedment of nanoparticles on the membrane surface is sufficient to reduce common <b>organic</b> <b>fouling,</b> retard gel layer deposition and prohibit biofilm formation. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

The results showed that PAC pretreatment offered high organic matter removal rates for both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV 254) during 10 – 200 mg/L PAC dosage. The removal efficiencies of organic matter by MF membrane filtration decreased with the increase of organic matter removal rate by PAC adsorption. PAC mainly removed organic matter of about 3 kDa molecular weight (MW). MF membrane maintained more than 5 kDa MW organic matter on the membrane after PAC adsorption. The results of membrane filtration indicated that PAC pretreatment slightly promoted membrane flux, regardless of PAC dosage.

40|$|International audienceThe {{optimization}} of permeate flux is {{a particularly}} interesting strategy to control fouling and, as a consequence, enhance productivity for nanofiltration (NF) processes. Critical flux, threshold flux and limiting flux theories represent significant advance in this strategy. The {{aim of this study}} was to apply these concepts to achieve fouling control during NF of a real complex matrix: hospital wastewater after Membrane BioReactor treatment (MBR permeate). At low pressure (3 bar) no flux decline was observed, revealing no fouling conditions. By applying a range of transmembrane pressure and using the square-wave method, the critical flux for irreversibility (70 L h− 1 m− 2) and the corresponding critical pressure (3. 4 bar) were then determined for the NF process in this complex matrix. Above these critical conditions, irreversible fouling started to occur. The threshold pressure and related flux (transition points between low and high fouling regions) were then searched by critical flux data conversion. Our results suggest, even if an exact value for the threshold pressure could not be determined, that it could be located in the range 3. 4 – 10 bar. Operating in this pressure range should lead to acceptable fouling rate and flux decline. During filtrations conducted above the critical flux in the MBR effluent, two stable fluxes behaviours were observed indicating that different fouling stages occur: pseudo stable flux was 67 L h− 1 m− 2 at 5 bar, whereas 33 L h− 1 m− 2 at 10 – 35 bar. It can be then confirmed that a limiting flux occurred in this system, the value of which 33 L h− 1 m− 2 is rather lower than that of the critical flux. This flux behaviour was proved to be related to a severe fouling in the pressure range 10 – 35 bar due to a combined effect of colloidal silica and <b>organics</b> <b>fouling</b> and calcium phosphate scaling. The early fouling stage at 5 bar was expected to be solely related to colloidal silica and organics accumulation. To characterise this change in fouling behaviour, a method allowing the estimation of the permeability before scaling was proposed. The combination of the permeability before scaling and critical flux has enabled a NF working diagram to be drawn from which the fouling stage for a given transmembrane pressure and corresponding permeate flux was able to be determined...|$|R

The NF membrane plant investigated was a 45, 400 -m(3) /d (12 -mgd) water-softening facility in Plantation, Fla. The average AN concentration of raw feedwater was estimated at 158 mu g/L acetate-C. After pretreatment (acid and antiscalant addition), AN levels increased by 12. 7 % (p-value = 0. 055), suggesting that pretreatment chemicals used to control scaling may enhance bacterial growth potential on the membrane surface.

Forward osmosis was employed as a bridge to utilize natural osmotic energy from seawater for concentrating and reusing urban runoff water, and as a barrier to reject runoff-derived contaminants.

The submerged forward osmosis process was conducted under neutral, acidic and natural <b>organic</b> matter <b>fouling</b> condition, respectively. Forward osmosis flux decline was mainly attributed to the dilution of seawater during a semi-batch process in lab scale testing. However, it is possible to minimize flux decrease by maintaining a constant salinity at the draw solution side. Various changes in urban runoff water quality, including acidic conditions (acid rain) and natural organic matter presence, did not show significant effects on the rejection of trace metals and phosphorus, but influenced salt leakage and the rejection of nitrate and total nitrogen.

40|$|Loss of {{membrane}} filtration performance due to <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> {{is still a}} significant drawback {{for the application of}} low-pressure membranes in tertiary wastewater treatment. The present study investigates the relevance of different organic fractions present in secondary effluents in terms of hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling of hollow-fibre ultrafiltration membranes. A good correlation between the hydraulically reversible filtration resistance and the total organic biopolymer concentration according to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was observed. Qualitatively biopolymers consist mainly of polysaccharides as well as proteins with high molecular weight. Polysaccharides are retained by the membrane pores, but can be removed by simple UF backwashing. On the other hand, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analysis indicates that the extent of the hydraulically irreversible fouling correlates with the presence of protein-like substances. Removal of protein-like substances by biological slow sand filtration or chemical coagulation results in the significant reduction of the hydraulically irreversible fouling, which is presumably due to proteins in the molecular range of biopolymers. In contrast to the comparatively low sensitivity of colorimetric methods for the analysis of proteins and polysaccharides, the combined application of size exclusion chromatography and fluorescence EEM analysis is a promising tool for the determination of the <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> propensity of secondary effluents. © 2011 Desalination Publications.

The effect of NH 2 -TNTs on the PA layer of TFN with respect to surface morphology, separation performance and antifouling properties was thoroughly investigated and discussed. The presence of NH 2 -TNTs in PA layer was verified using XPS while the "leaf-like" outgrowth morphology of PA layer was observed using FESEM. Results showed that the TFN membrane with 0. 05 % NH 2 -TNTs embedded was the most promising membrane as it exhibited 93 % higher water flux than the control thin film composite (TFC) membrane, without compensating NaCl rejection. In terms of <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> tendency, the TFN 0. 05 membrane also showed higher tolerance compared to the control membrane during RO process. Furthermore, as high as 94 % of the water flux of TFN 0. 05 was able to retrieve by a simple water rinse process, which suggests that <b>organic</b> <b>fouling</b> in TFN 0. 05 is highly reversible...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of microplastic and carbon-based nanoparticles {{in the environment}} may have implications for the fate and effects of traditional hydrophobic chemicals. Here we present parameters for the sorption of 17 CB congeners to 10 – 180 µm sized polyethylene (micro-PE), 70 nm polystyrene (nano-PS), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), fullerene (C 60), and a natural sediment in the environmentally relevant 10 – 5 – 10 – 1 µg L– 1 concentration range. Effects of salinity and sediment <b>organic</b> matter <b>fouling</b> were assessed by measuring the isotherms in fresh- and seawater, with and without sediment present. Sorption to the “bulk” sorbents sediment organic matter (OM) and micro-PE occurred through linear hydrophobic partitioning with OM and micro-PE having similar sorption affinity. Sorption to MWCNT and nano-PS was nonlinear. PCB sorption to MWCNT and C 60 was 3 – 4 orders of magnitude stronger than to OM and micro-PE. Sorption to nano-PS was 1 – 2 orders of magnitude stronger than to micro-PE, which was attributed to the higher aromaticity and surface–volume ratio of nano-PS. Organic matter effects varied among sorbents, with the largest OM fouling effect observed for the high surface sorbents MWCNT and nano-PS. Salinity decreased sorption for sediment and MWCNT but increased sorption for the polymers nano-PS and micro-PE. The exceptionally strong sorption of (planar) PCBs to C 60, MWCNT, and nano-PS may imply increased hazards upon membrane transfer of these particles...|$|R
40|$|Fouling in {{membrane}} bioreactors (MBR) {{is acknowledged}} to be complex and unclear. An integrated characterization methodology was employed {{in this study}} to understand the fouling on a gravity-driven submerged MBR (GD-SMBR). It involved the use of different analytical tools, including optical coherence tomography (OCT), liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD), total organic carbon (TOC), flow cytometer (FCM), adenosine triphosphate analysis (ATP) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The three-dimensional (3 D) biomass morphology was acquired in a real-time through non-destructive and in situ OCT scanning of 75 % of the total membrane surface directly in the tank. Results showed that the biomass layer was homogeneously distributed on the membrane surface. The amount of biomass was selectively linked with final destructive autopsy techniques. The LC-OCD analysis indicated the abundance of low molecular weight (LMW) <b>organics</b> in the <b>fouling</b> composition. Three different SEM techniques were applied to investigate the detailed fouling morphology on the membrane. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the global performance of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) systems, {{it is important to}} improve the feed water quality before it enters the RO. Currently, many desalination plants experience production losses due to incidents of organic and biofouling. Consequently, monitoring or characterizing the pretreatment step using more advanced organic and biological parameters are required for better operation to lessen fouling issues. In this study, the performance of pretreatment processes (including coagulation, dual media filtration (DMF), polishing with cartridge filter (CF) coupled with anti-scalant) used at Perth Seawater Desalination Plant (PSDP) located in Western Australia were characterized in terms of <b>organic</b> and biological <b>fouling</b> parameters. These analyses were carried out using liquid chromatography with organic carbon detector (LC-OCD), three dimensional-fluorescence excitation emission matrix (3 D-FEEM) and assimilable organic carbon (AOC). Furthermore, the used (exhausted) RO membrane and CF were autopsied so that the fates and behaviors of organic foulants in these treatment systems could be better understood...|$|R
