5000|$|The {{engine was}} very much based on the Rover 16's but the bore had been {{increased}} 2mm. There {{were a number of}} minor improvements. The water inlet pipe was now {{to the other side of}} the engine to provide better access to the valves and tappets. The oil box (reservoir) was now at the left rear of the engine so a catcher for <b>oil</b> <b>thrown</b> up by the flywheel is no longer necessary. Lubrication pipes had been mounted lower. There was a new partition between sump and clutch housing so <b>oil</b> was not <b>thrown</b> to the clutch. Rover's engine braking system was fitted, it has the ability to close the engine's valves.|$|R
60|$|So Alroy and Schirene {{entered the}} serail. An immense cresset-lamp, fed with perfumed <b>oil,</b> <b>threw</b> a soft light round the sumptuous chamber. At the end stood {{a row of}} eunuchs in scarlet dresses, and each holding a tall silver staff. The Caliph and the Sultana threw {{themselves}} upon a couch covered with a hundred cushions; on one side stood a group consisting of {{the captain of the}} guard and other officers of the household, on the other, of beautiful female slaves magnificently attired.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} Lethe nor Nepenthe," [...] remarked he; [...] "but I have learned many new secrets in the wilderness, {{and here is}} one of them--a recipe that an Indian taught me, in requital of some lessons of my own, that were as old as Paracelsus. Drink it! It may be less {{soothing}} than a sinless conscience. That I cannot give thee. But it will calm the swell and heaving of thy passion, like <b>oil</b> <b>thrown</b> on the waves of a tempestuous sea." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Chapter Four, [...] "The Interview", of Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel The Scarlet Letter, Roger Chillingworth administers a {{soothing}} medicine to the sickly infant Pearl, saying to Hester Prynne: [...] "I know not Lethe nor Nepenthe [...] [...] but I have learned many new secrets {{in the wilderness}} [...] [...] Drink it! It may be less soothing than a sinless conscience. That I cannot give thee. But it will calm the swell and heaving of thy passion, like <b>oil</b> <b>thrown</b> on the waves of a tempestuous sea." ...|$|R
50|$|In between many stages {{the players}} find {{themselves}} inside small town stores {{where they can}} restock on common items such as arrows, burning <b>oils,</b> <b>throwing</b> daggers and healing potions. Players can sell items for gold and also trade special items found during boss battles with shopkeepers (by clicking on the shopkeepers head) to earn unique magical items. The players can also come across a special gnome village where the townfolk beg to be saved from a chimera (the gnomes, unlike traditional Dungeons & Dragons gnomes, are very minuscule, standing about a foot tall).|$|R
50|$|When {{the output}} shaft begins to rotate, the <b>oil</b> is <b>thrown</b> {{out of the}} {{reservoir}} by centrifugal force, {{and returns to the}} main body of the coupling, so that normal power transmission is restored.|$|R
60|$|Having thus {{tried to}} <b>throw</b> <b>oil</b> on the troubled waters Nazinred {{came to an}} abrupt pause.|$|R
2500|$|The Radley-England Waterplane was a four-bay biplane with ailerons {{fitted to}} the top wing only. [...] A single {{horizontal}} stabiliser and elevator with twin balanced rudders mounted below it were carried on four wire-braced booms behind the wing. The crew and passengers were carried {{in a pair of}} flat-bottomed floats suspended on struts underneath the lower wing. [...] It was powered by three 50hp (37kW) Gnome Omega rotary engines arranged in line above the wing centre section, each connected by a roller chain to a long shaft at the rear of which was a four-bladed propeller 9ft 10in (3m) diameter. [...] To protect the occupants from the <b>oil</b> <b>thrown</b> out, the front engine was partially enclosed by an aluminium cowling.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. White {{leaned forward}} in her chair with an anxious smile {{designed}} to <b>throw</b> <b>oil</b> upon the troubled waters.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} Jarl Rongvold {{stood up and}} spoke in the bland tones {{of a man who}} wishes to <b>throw</b> <b>oil</b> on troubled waters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a {{doubt about}} that," [...] said the archdeacon. Then Mrs. Grantly interposed, strove {{to change the}} subject, and <b>threw</b> <b>oil</b> upon the waters.|$|R
5000|$|Mbekbka - {{a unique}} Libyan soup with pasta or {{spaghetti}}. Instead of the European way of boiling pasta or spaghetti {{in water and}} then throwing the water away (with all the goodness it contains), the Libyans boil pasta with the sauce, which adds a real pasta flavour to the sauce. You can make it with any type of pasta, and the simplest dish involves frying onions in <b>oil,</b> <b>throwing</b> in the tomato puree, chili powder, turmeric, then adding water and salt and leave to boil, before adding the pasta. But {{the proper way to}} do it is to add some lamb chops, chickpeas and garlic to the sauce. Serve hot with a sprinkle of extra virgin olive oil, lemon, fresh chili and crusty bread (optional). You can also add other vegetable like pumpkin, potato and green pepper ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his inauguration}} speech, Bacar {{declared}} himself [...] "the president of all Anjouan" [...] and {{appealed to the}} Union government [...] "not to <b>throw</b> <b>oil</b> onto the fire".|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] said Pat, <b>throwing</b> <b>oil</b> on {{the troubled}} waters. [...] "We're all frinds at present, and shall be {{as long as}} we don't split on nobody." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{aviation}} {{developed in}} unheated open cockpits, {{the need for}} warm clothing quickly became apparent, as did the need for multiple pockets with closures of buttons, snaps, or zippers to prevent loss of articles during maneuvers. Various types of flight jackets and pants coverings were developed and, during World War I, leather two-piece outfits were common among pilots {{to ward off the}} chill caused by propwash and the cold of low-oxygen high-altitude flying. Leather quickly became the preferred material due to its durability and the protection it offered against flying debris such as insect strikes during climb-outs and landings, and <b>oil</b> <b>thrown</b> off by the simple rotary and inline motors of the time. Australian aviator Frederick Sidney Cotton's experience with high level and low-temperature flying led Cotton in 1917 to develop the revolutionary new [...] "Sidcot" [...] suit, a flying suit which solved the problem pilots had in keeping warm in the cockpit. This flying suit, with improvements, was widely used by the RAF until the 1950s.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Mr. Fenwick," [...] said Lord St. George, in his {{determined}} {{purpose to}} <b>throw</b> <b>oil</b> upon the waters, [...] "what is this unfortunate quarrel {{between you and}} my father?" ...|$|R
50|$|This {{newspaper}} report {{included in}} The Horwood Book {{goes on to}} document multiple attacks on Ms Balsom by Horwood through 1820 and 1821 including <b>throwing</b> <b>oil</b> of vitriol (sulphuric acid) at her.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{used for}} {{a story in the}} Daily Oklahoman newspaper. Caption: "After the Chamber of Commerce dinner the other night the Oklahoma City <b>oil</b> {{fraternity}} <b>threw</b> a little party at the Beacon club for Eugene Holman, president of the Standard Oil Co. (N. J.), and he was made a member of Okla. Tali-Bila, given an inscribed Indian ceremonial drum, with autographs of the group attending the party. ...|$|R
50|$|Christmas Eve 1935 was {{a momentous}} day for Carlton. The {{electricity}} was switched on {{and things were}} never the same again, candles and <b>oil</b> lamps were <b>thrown</b> away. Street lighting was installed in 1963.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} means," [...] I said--reasonable old Bertram, {{always trying to}} <b>throw</b> <b>oil</b> on the troubled w's----"that if he does he will fall {{down the side of}} the house and break his neck." ...|$|R
60|$|Dr Thorne {{raised his}} eyebrows and looked inquiringly at Lady Scatcherd; {{but there was a}} quiet sarcastic motion round his mouth which by no means had the effect of <b>throwing</b> <b>oil</b> on the troubled waters.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Carbuncle came {{up during}} the quarrel, meaning to <b>throw</b> <b>oil</b> upon the waters. [...] "What {{children}} you are!" [...] she said laughing. [...] "As if each of you won't {{have to do what}} the other suggests." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the climactic}} {{scene of the}} film, Angelos gets evicted from his home and his landlady throws all his {{belongings}} on the street. He puts a record on his record player, breaks an <b>oil</b> lantern, <b>throws</b> the fuel on the heap and lights up a cigarette burning his belongings {{in front of his}} neighbours, while the song of Stratos Dionysiou [...] "Vrehei Fotia Stin Strata Mou" [...] (It's raining fire in my way) plays in the background.|$|R
50|$|The admiral for the Song was Cao Bin. The Song {{ships were}} smaller, but the crew on board were better archers. The ships had flamethrowers and {{were filled with}} bundles of reed soaked in <b>oil</b> to be <b>thrown</b> at the enemy ships.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will it {{please you}} to {{represent}} {{to the general}} that we have fought this evening, and that half my gunners are killed. The fire of the sons of Sheitan is too strong for us. Your excellency will see the ground is covered with our dead. Bring fire," [...] he ordered, and at the word {{one of the soldiers}} lighted a torch made of straw, soaked in <b>oil,</b> which <b>threw</b> a lurid flame over the ground. [...] "See, excellency, how we have suffered." ...|$|R
6000|$|Guy made a {{step towards}} the window, and {{a step back}} again. ''Tis not fair to ask such questions,' he replied, after a moment. 'It is <b>throwing</b> <b>oil</b> on the fire. I was trying to forget it. He neither knows my uncle nor the circumstances.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Early engines {{were of the}} [...] "open-crank" [...] style, that is, {{there was}} no {{enclosed}} crankcase. The crankshaft, connecting rod, camshaft, gears, governor, etc. were all completely exposed and could be viewed in operation when the engine was running. This made for a messy environment, as <b>oil</b> was <b>thrown</b> from the engine and could run on the ground. Another disadvantage was that dirt and dust could get on moving engine parts, causing excessive wear and possible malfunction of the engine. Frequent cleaning of the engine was required {{to keep it in}} normal working order.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the period}} between 1893 and 1898 {{restoration}} work took place. The dormers were made, and a neogothic spire clock tower was installed, replacing an earlier 18th century spire. In between the corner towers is a machicolation. From holes in the floor of this outer work, boiling <b>oil</b> could be <b>thrown</b> at enemies.|$|R
5|$|On 12 January 2009, {{at least}} three people, {{including}} two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces, including the four La Venta colossal heads. The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and {{appeared to have been}} carrying out a supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, grape juice, and <b>oil</b> were <b>thrown</b> on the heads. It was estimated that 300,000 pesos (US$21,900) would be needed to repair the damage, and the restoration process would last four months. The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330,000 pesos each.|$|R
5000|$|Centrifugal force {{which can}} be defined as a fictitious force, {{peculiar}} to a particle moving on a circular path, that has the same magnitude and dimensions as the force that keeps the particle on its circular path (the centripetal force) [...] but points in the opposite direction is effective in separating gas from oil. The heavier <b>oil</b> is <b>thrown</b> outward {{against the wall of the}} vortex retainer while the gas occupies the inner portion of the vortex. A properly shaped and sized vortex will allow the gas to ascend while the liquid flows downwardto the bottom of the unit.|$|R
60|$|Things were in {{this state}} when Mr. Brown slowly descended into the arena, while George Robinson, {{standing}} at the distant doorway in the back, looked on with blushing cheeks. One of the girls had explained to Mr. Brown what was the state of affairs, and he immediately attempted to <b>throw</b> <b>oil</b> on the troubled waters.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must secure Mr Boffin alone, Alfred. If {{his wife}} was present, she would <b>throw</b> <b>oil</b> upon the waters. I know I should fail to move him to an angry outburst, if {{his wife was}} there. And as to the girl herself--as I am going to betray her confidence, she is equally out of the question.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Every {{window was}} opened, and anxious faces looked out. The night was dark, {{and the few}} <b>oil</b> lamps alone <b>threw</b> a feeble light on the square. Suddenly a broad glare rose to the west, and the murmur, [...] "There is a house on fire!" [...] passed from mouth to mouth. In another few minutes flames were seen rising at a dozen points, and a cry of consternation arose.|$|R
60|$|As for Peter Pax, {{he assumed}} {{the role of}} peacemaker-general. When the debaters seemed to be getting too warm, he rose to order; and, in a calm dignified manner, commented on the conduct of the disputants with such ineffable {{insolence}} as to draw down their wrath on his devoted head--to the great delight of the other members. Thus he <b>threw</b> <b>oil</b> on the troubled waters, and, generally, kept the meeting lively.|$|R
5000|$|... 21C6 was {{allocated}} to Salisbury Shed where it remained based throughout her working life. Its first livery was unlined black, with hand-painted lettering in gilt with black blocking and yellow highlights. In December 1942 the locomotives Bulleid chain-driven valve gear failed near Honiton on an evening goods service {{when one of}} the valve chains parted, <b>throwing</b> <b>oil</b> over the boiler cladding, track and lineside vegetation, which then ignited.|$|R
60|$|At {{the sound}} of the voice the man drew aside, and through the narrow doorway was now {{revealed}} the interior of the house--a straight, square room, with a few wooden seats disposed about, and at the top end an oblong table covered with a snow-white cloth. An aperture in the wall appeared to lead to an inner chamber, which must indeed have been of diminutive size, for the central room seemed to occupy almost the whole of the interior of the house. Suspended by an iron chain from the ceiling above there hung a small lamp in which flickered a tiny flame fed by some sweet-smelling <b>oil.</b> It <b>threw</b> but little light around and left deep and curious shadows in the angles of the room.|$|R
