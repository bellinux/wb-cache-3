5|$|Legal {{victories}} in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>school</b> curricula, but the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After World War II, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} the Greens were separated, Debora met Michael Farrar, {{a student in}} his twenties {{completing}} his last year <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>school.</b> Farrar was struck by Green's intelligence and vitality, though he was embarrassed by her habit of explosively losing her temper at minor slights. In contrast, Green felt that Farrar was a stable, dependable presence. The couple were married on May 26, 1979. When Farrar was accepted for an internal medicine residency at the University of Cincinnati, the couple moved to Ohio. Green went into practice at Jewish Hospital as an emergency physician, but grew dissatisfied and eventually switched specialties. She began a second residency in internal medicine, joining Farrar's program.|$|E
5|$|Susan is {{identified}} as Mike's bride in the sixth season premiere. Her marriage to Mike destroys her friendship with Katherine. After the wedding, Julie is strangled outside of Susan's home. Julie slips into a coma following her attack. While {{waiting for her to}} awaken, Susan learns that Julie had dropped out <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>school,</b> was involved with a married man, and had a pregnancy scare before her attack. When Julie awakens, she refuses to identify the married man she was seeing. Later in the season, Julie's attacker is revealed to be Eddie Orlofsky (Josh Zuckerman), a local young adult who is also responsible for a handful of murders in Fairview. Prior to the attack, Susan had taken Eddie on as an art student and he developed a crush on her. When he discovered that she was remarrying Mike and that she did not see him as a romantic suitor, he attacked Julie, mistaking her for Susan.|$|E

5|$|Two {{important}} legal {{decisions in}} the 1930s helped increase the accessibility of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued {{each other in the}} Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.Rose, Melody, Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.Tone, p. 178: Tone calls the ruling a coup d'etat for Sanger. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>school</b> curricula..

However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.|$|E
