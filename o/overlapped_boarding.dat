While these functions are almost always legally separated from the hospital, their impact on hospital policymaking may be far more direct.

40|$|The nonprofit {{sector and}} matters of nonprofit {{governance}} {{have been in}} the national spotlight much of late. One area of heightened interest is directors of healthcare entities regularly serving on the board of more than one healthcare organization. Even when board membership of related entities is relatively independent, one corporation 2 ̆ 7 s business plan frequently is affected (or even controlled) by the business needs of a separately incorporated parent, affiliate, or other related organization. Very little case law addresses 2 ̆ 2 interlocking 2 ̆ 2 directorates for nonprofit board members, and the case law that does exist tends to address narrow, fact-based state law interpretive issues rather than elucidating the nature and scope of fiduciary duties. The result is that the doctrine in this area is severely underdeveloped. State statutes and supplementary guidance documents such as the Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act provide little insight as well. Within this vacuum, considerable tension exists between the modern reality of <b>overlapping</b> <b>boards,</b> which often occur due to integration of healthcare entities into 2 ̆ 2 delivery systems, 2 ̆ 2 and the traditional doclarge trine of fiduciary duties, which contemplates that directors will serve only one corporation. It is a long-standing principle of corporate law that directors owe fiduciary duties to the corporation(s) on whose boards they sit. Nonprofit directors 2 ̆ 7 fiduciary duties are threefold: the duty of care, the duty of loyalty, and the duty of obedience. The duty of care requires directors to act in an informed, careful manner in their decisionmaking. The duty of loyalty commands directors to act without self-interest, in good faith, and {{in the best interests of}} the corporation at all times. The duty of obedience obliges directors to ensure that the charitable mission of the corporation is carried out and to obey laws relevant to the organization.

Using a panel of 684 Australian listed firms from 2001 to 2011, we find that firms with busy directors pay high remunerations to their CEOs, and experience low CEO pay-performance and low CEO turnover-performance sensitivities. Our results also suggest that firms with overlap directors have a lower probability of receiving a qualified audit opinion {{and are able to}} negotiate lower payments, both to their CEOs and to the external auditors. These results hold for alternative specifications and proxies.

50|$|Most siding {{consists}} {{of pieces of}} weather-resistant material that are smaller than the wall they cover, to allow for expansion and contraction of the materials due to moisture and temperature changes.

40|$|AbstractPeople {{sitting on}} the same board have the {{possibility}} to meet and interact. Therefore, directors holding many directorships constitute a link between <b>boards.</b> <b>Overlap</b> in group membership allows for {{the flow of information}} between groups, and perhaps coordination of the group's actions. In comparison to the body of literature on interlocking directorates, there are relatively few studies on the network of French interlocks. In our study, and to detect community structure within the French board network among the companies listed in the French Financial Index CAC 40, we use the maximum modularity approach. To our knowledge, this is the only study on French interlocks that employees a maximum modularity approach. The main result is that the network shows a strong community structure. This is due to several reasons. On the one hand, we have the existence directors serving in several boards. Generally, this means that the “small world” of French listed companies is actually split into identifiable communities. On the other hand, we have motives to control and reduce environmental uncertainty. Overlap in group membership allows for the flow of information between groups, and perhaps coordination of the group's actions. According to Sonquist and Koenig (1975), interlocking among boards through common directors make easily coordination among firms. Lang and Lockhart (1990) justified that a firm creates a connection through an interlock to guarantee access to external resource.

40|$|During {{the last}} years the {{development}} of e-banking in Estonia has been very significant. According to {{the report of the}} World Economic Forum, the Estonian IT-development has been substantial. The success of e-banking in Estonia can be compared to the corresponding success of the Nordic countries. According to the Deutsche Bank Research, around 70 - 80 % of the Internet users in Estonia use Internet banking and in this respect, Estonia could be compared to Finland, Norway and Iceland. Despite of certain benefits, e-banking has turned out a great risk, as bank clients are expecting e-banking services to be available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. The major risks associated with e-banking are strategic, operational, legal and reputational. Security is considered the central operational risk of e-banking. Some of the specific problems cut across risk categories, e. g. breach of security allowing unauthorised access to customer information can be classified as an operational risk, but such an event also exposes the bank to legal risk and reputational risk. Customer education on security risks and precautions can play an important role for consumer protection and for limiting reputational risk. In Estonia, all commercial banks which are engaged in e-banking activities have published on their websites recommendations to potential customers on how to increase the security while making transactions in electronic environment. The Estonian Financial Supervision Authority responsible for the banking supervision has disseminated on its website a special brochure to e-banking customers on how to use the Internet bank safely. At the international level the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has elaborated risk management principles for e-banking. These risk management principles fall into three broad, and often <b>overlapping,</b> categories: <b>Board</b> and Management Oversight, Security Controls and Legal and Reputational Risk Management. The research question of this paper is whether these risk management principles are implemented at the Estonian banks. In order to assess the risk management practices of the Estonian banks in the field of e-banking as well as their conformity to the BCBS guidelines, the author has prepared a questionnaire and circulated it to all banks. According to the results of the survey, the Estonian banks generally comply with all BCBS guidelines in the field of e-banking risk management. e-banking, risks, risk management...|$|R
5000|$|Historians like Henri Brunschwig {{have pointed}} to the {{importance}} of the BOA in the assimilation of French West Africa into the French economic system. [...] Its founding in 1901 came after the extension of limited taxation of subjects, forced labor laws, and voting in the colonial possessions (notably the communes of Dakar and Saint-Louis, Senegal). The creation of and government support for the BOA was part of an attempt to inject investment into the French colonies. In 1880, almost all French economic interests in the area were in the form of family-run trading houses based in French port cities like Bordeaux and Marseilles. The creation of the BOA coincided with the consolidation of these trading houses into joint stock companies, the ending of formal government concessions to these houses, and the rise of a de facto monopoly of their successors. Émile Maurel (CEO of Maurel et Prom) and Henri Nouvion (managing director of Banque du Sénégal) were respectively the first president and managing director of the newly created BOA. By the 1920s, business in the AOF was dominated by just three private joint stock companies: the Compagnie Française de l'Afrique Occidentale, the Nouvelle Société Commerciale africaine, and the Société Commerciale de l'Ouest Africain (lagging slightly were the growing plantation and mining interests of the Unilever company). The BAO's <b>board</b> largely <b>overlapped</b> with the <b>boards</b> of these trading companies. When the initial privileges granted to the BOA expired in 1929, the French government granted it a further forty-year concession, with the only stipulation being that the government reserved the right to nominate the BOA's chair, and four members of its board.|$|R
