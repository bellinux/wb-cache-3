In 2010, he appeared in an episode <b>of</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Was 17 on the MTV network, describing his experiences in high school. In season three of The Rachel Zoe Project, Weir was dressed by Rachel and her assistant Brad Goreski to attend an event. In 2010 he was a judge on the U.S. reality show Skating with the Stars. He was also a guest judge on the Logo reality series RuPaul's Drag Race season three.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of this enquiry I found that much more had been done than I had been aware <b>of,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first {{published}} the Essay. The poverty and misery arising from a too rapid increase of population had been distinctly seen, and the most violent remedies proposed, so long ago as the times of Plato and Aristotle. And of late years the subject has been treated in such a manner by some of the French Economists; occasionally by Montesquieu, and, among our own writers, by Dr. Franklin, Sir James Stewart, Mr. Arthur Young, and Mr. Townsend, as to create a natural surprise that it had not excited more of the public attention.|$|E
500|$|Rain in England {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} referenced for its uniqueness and its demonstration of Lil B's {{broad range of}} styles. Hip hop writer Andrew Nosnitsky remarked in The Wire that Lil B was likely the only rapper who could pull off both an ambient release on Weird Forest and a collaboration with Soulja Boy in the same year. The San Francisco Bay Guardian said the album demonstrated Lil B's unpredictability; similarly, SF Weekly called it [...] "a different beast entirely" [...] {{from the rest of}} his work. In Seattle Weekly, Eric Grandy called Rain in England an [...] "oddity" [...] and said Lil B's music is better served by randomly listening to him on YouTube then in a long-form album format. In a 2012 profile of Lil B's career so far, The Wires Lisa Blanning said the album [...] "feels like a new musical expression." [...] Lil B himself described Rain in England as [...] "my favorite work ... I think that's my most powerful work, to myself. ... That's my favorite, because I know no one else has done that, and that's what I'm most proud <b>of,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> do things that I know nobody else has done before." ...|$|E

Yes, there was that in her eyes that made them the eyes of Lei-Lei whom I left with a laugh on my lips, {{the eyes of the}} Lady Om for forty years my beggar-mate on highway and byway, the eyes of Philippa for whom I was slain on the grass in old France, the eyes <b>of</b> my mother <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was the lad Jesse at the Mountain Meadows in the circle of our forty great wagons.|$|R

2500|$|Frank Mir was a color {{commentator}} for World Extreme Cagefighting until WEC 47, when he {{was replaced}} by Stephan Bonnar. In June 2012, Mir stated {{in an interview with}} The Chronicle-Journal that he wants to pursue commentary after he retires from fighting. [...] "I like analyzing fights, and I like doing color commentating," [...] he said. [...] "It’s an opportunity I would take advantage <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> run into it. Hopefully it’s something I can do full time". Mir has also done commentary for Absolute Championship Berkut.|$|E
2500|$|The record's {{message was}} {{controversial}} at the time, and was banned by many radio stations. NBC, in particular, {{was troubled by}} the lyric, [...] "It brings back memories <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a trustful wife". Wells' slight alteration of [...] "trustful" [...] to [...] "trusting" [...] lifted the network ban on the song. It was temporarily banned from the Grand Ole Opry. Nevertheless, audiences couldn’t get enough of it. The single took off {{during the summer of}} 1952, and sold more than 800,000 copies in its initial release. It was the first single by a female singer to peak at No. 1 in the eight-year history of the country music chart, where it remained for six weeks. [...] (Certain female country songs, notably Patsy Montana's million-selling [...] "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart" [...] predate the creation of Billboards country chart in 1944.) [...] "It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels" [...] also crossed over to Billboard’s pop charts, hitting No. 27. Thanks to her breakthrough, she received a membership to the Grand Ole Opry, which had originally banned the single.|$|E

2500|$|Kylie Christmas is Minogue's first Christmas studio {{album and}} her thirteenth overall studio album. Minogue {{previously}} released the Christmas track [...] "Santa Baby", which appeared on her 2000 single, [...] "Please Stay"; {{a recording of}} [...] "Let It Snow" [...] in 2010; and two Christmas extended plays in 2010, A Kylie Christmas and A Christmas Gift. Speaking with Idolator's Mike Wass, Minogue stated [...] "I always thought I would do a Christmas album, {{it was just a}} case <b>of</b> <b>when...</b> <b>I</b> mentioned it to a couple of people on my team and they were saying, 'What {{do you want to do}} for the rest of the year? What do you want to do next?' I said, 'I'm thinking about a Christmas album, actually.' Some of that stems from last Christmas." [...] Minogue said that she had Christmas in Los Angeles, California in 2014, and her friend suggest recording a Christmas album; [...] "They just assumed I had done one, and when I said I hadn't done an entire album they just started, 'You've got to do it. It would be amazing. We just want to see your little outfits.'" [...] Kylie Christmas was recorded at Angel Studios and Sarm Music Village, and features a mix of both classical Christmas songs and new original material. American guitarist and producer Nile Rodgers and Minogue's sister Dannii Minogue were reported to be working on the album, while The Sun claimed she had recorded [...] "half of the album".|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the album, the band spent time revisiting music from their youth that first {{inspired}} {{them to be}} in a band. Chad Gilbert described how he spent six months [...] "only listening to the Ramones, old Lookout! Records stuff, Green Day's Dookie, Descendents, Rancid's Let's Go and that's pretty much it." [...] Gilbert had a direct musical vision for the album, similar to how he describes that Coming Home (2006) had, as opposed to Not Without a Fight (2009), where the attitude was simply [...] "let's record a New Found Glory album." [...] The band strove to [...] "apply the throwback vibe to their always-evolving style," [...] by incorporating the elements from those classic albums; [...] "it was simple, it was fun, it was heartfelt, but it also kind of had an attitude," [...] with the hallmarks of their own career. Gilbert described how he wanted to [...] "bridge the gap between generations", hoping for reactions such as [...] "Dude that's totally Ramones, but it's not the Ramones, it's New Found Glory. Or like, Dude, that totally reminds me <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard Dookie for the first time, but it's totally not, it's New Found Glory." [...] As such, the band were meticulous in the writing process, discarding anything that was not in line with the album's vision or songs that felt [...] "safe". Gilbert described that because they wanted a [...] "fun, punk, upbeat record," [...] any songs he would write that appeared [...] "a slower, mellower, mid-pace thing," [...] would be scrapped. Jordan Pundik told Rock Sound magazine that, [...] " [...] we simplified the songs. There's no riffing or jamming going on. It's just straight up and in-your-face." ...|$|E
