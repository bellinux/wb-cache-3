5|$|Artificial {{birth control}} predates Christianity; the Catholic Church has {{condemned}} these methods throughout its history. In {{response to the}} Church of England accepting the practice <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> contraception in 1930, the Catholic Church issued the papal encyclical Casti connubii on 31 December 1930. The 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae is a reaffirmation of the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage and marital relations, and a continued condemnation <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> birth control.|$|E

5|$|Artificial trees made of goose {{feathers}} were {{in use in}} American homes {{since the}} 1880s. In the 1930s, however, The Addis Brush Company, an American toilet bowl brush manufacturer, began making artificial trees of green-dyed bristles and then supplied the British (who suffered a dearth of wild trees) with thousands <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> trees in the post-War years. Americans took {{little interest in the}} Addis artificial trees and remained loyal to real trees.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} sports, vinkensport {{has had its}} {{cheating}} scandals, as well as accusations <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> enhancement. One finch sang a record 1,278 susk-e-weits in one hour, and the owner was later accused of doping the bird with testosterone. After one contestant sang exactly {{the same number of}} calls in two rounds, the box was opened and a mini CD player was discovered within.|$|E

5|$|Caerphilly's water defences {{were almost}} {{certainly}} inspired by those at Kenilworth, where a similar set <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> lakes and dams was created. Gilbert de Clare had fought at {{the siege of}} Kenilworth in 1266 and would have seen these at first hand. Caerphilly's water defences provided particular protection against mining, which could otherwise undermine castle walls during the period, and are considered the most advanced of their kind in Britain.|$|E

Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical compound of gallium in electronics, {{is used in}} microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Semiconductive gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and diode lasers. Gallium is also used in the production <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer {{worked with}} his first {{doctoral}} student, Melba Phillips, on calculations <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> radioactivity under bombardment by deuterons. When Ernest Lawrence and Edwin McMillan bombarded nuclei with deuterons they found the results agreed closely with the predictions of George Gamow, but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did not conform to the theory. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips worked out a theory {{now known as the}} Oppenheimer–Phillips process to explain the results, a theory still in use today.|$|E

5|$|Snakes {{have been}} {{part and parcel of}} culture and religion. Vivid scale {{patterns}} have been thought to have influenced early art. The use of snake-skin in manufacture of purses, apparel and other articles led to large-scale killing of snakes, giving rise to advocacy for use <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> snake-skin. Snake scales are also to be found as motifs in fiction, art and films.|$|E
5|$|Snakeskin, {{with its}} highly {{periodic}} cross-hatch or grid patterns, appeals to people's aesthetics {{and have been}} used to manufacture many leather articles including fashionable accessories. The use of snakeskin has however endangered snake populations and resulted in international restrictions in trade of certain snake species and populations in the form of CITES provisions. Animal lovers in many countries now propagate the use <b>of</b> <b>artificial</b> snakeskin instead, which are easily produced from embossed leather, patterned fabric, plastics and other materials.|$|E
