5|$|Legends from Jewish {{communities}} of Arabia which {{were using the}} Septuagint version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Daniel made the confusion between the fourth character, the angel who is like the son of god, and Azariah himself, as confirmed by H. Schwarzbaum.|$|E
5|$|Most owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead were evidently part of {{the social}} elite; they were {{initially}} reserved for the royal family, but later papyri are found in the tombs of scribes, priests and officials. Most owners were men, and generally the vignettes included the owner's wife as well. Towards the beginning of the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead, there are roughly 10 copies belonging to men for every one for a woman. However, during the Third Intermediate Period, 2/3 were for women; and women owned roughly a third of the hieratic paypri from the Late and Ptolemaic Periods.|$|E

5|$|As Threni was {{intended}} for concert rather than liturgical use, Stravinsky chose the text freely from the early chapters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Lamentations. It has three movements: the large central movement is surrounded by two much shorter ones. Ernst Krenek composed a setting of the Lamentations in 1942, and Stravinsky acknowledged {{that it might have}} influenced him. He considered it less likely that works by Renaissance composers, including Tallis, Byrd and Palestrina, had influenced him, although he had studied such music.|$|E
5|$|Each sermon {{begins with}} a scriptural passage that {{reinforces}} the ideas that {{will be discussed in}} the sermon and each was preceded with the same opening prayer (which Swift also delivered). The sermons are plainly written and apply a common-sense approach to contemporary moral issues in Dublin. Swift patterned his sermons on the plain style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Common Prayer and the Church of Ireland Authorized Version of the Bible.|$|E
5|$|Edward-Rhys Harry reconstructed Parry's {{setting of}} the Te Deum taken from the text <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Common Prayer. The {{manuscript}} was discovered in the National Library of Wales archives. Parry wrote the manuscript in 1863, while living in Danville. Harry uncovered the manuscript while researching choral traditions at the library. He worked a year at transcribing the original Parry manuscript. The London Welsh Chorale gave the work its world première performance under Harry at StGiles Cripplegate, Barbican, London on 14 July 2012.|$|E

5|$|Features on Enceladus {{are named}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) after {{characters}} and places from Burton's translation <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> One Thousand and One Nights. Impact craters are named after characters, whereas other feature types, such as fossae (long, narrow depressions), dorsa (ridges), planitia (plains), and sulci (long parallel grooves), are named after places. The IAU has officially named 85 features on Enceladus, most recently Samaria Rupes, formerly called Samaria Fossa.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{supposed}} deciphering of the Egyptian alphabet in July and October 1835, Smith ostensibly translated the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Abraham in November 1835 {{and did some}} minor revisions in March 1842. In translating the book, Smith dictated and Phelps, Warren Parrish, and Frederick G. Williams acted as scribes. The complete work was first published serially in Times and Seasons in 1842, and was later canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church {{as part of its}} Pearl of Great Price.|$|E
5|$|From the 21st Dynasty onward, more copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> the Dead {{are found}} in hieratic script. The {{calligraphy}} {{is similar to that}} of other hieratic manuscripts of the New Kingdom; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns (often the column size corresponds to the size of the papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up). Occasionally a hieratic Book of the Dead contains captions in hieroglyphic.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, Rutherford {{published}} a systematic reinterpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>of</b> Revelation. Many of the symbols {{recorded in the}} book were applied to events following 1918, specifically to Watch Tower conventions held in the years 1922 through 1928. These reinterpretations reflected both a wholesale rejection of his own earlier views {{as well as the}} historicist interpretations of Pastor Russell.|$|E
5|$|In July 1877, Young tried {{one more}} time at a {{spelling}} reform, ordering lead type designed for the orthography of Benn Pitman (Isaac's brother) {{with the intention of}} printing an edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants using it. Most of the type had arrived by August, but with Young's death, the translation was never undertaken and the type never used. Young's death thus marked the end of the Mormon experimentation with English spelling reforms.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 24 September 1554, Knox {{received}} {{an invitation from}} a congregation of English exiles in Frankfurt {{to become one of}} their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than he found himself in a conflict. The first set of refugees to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used a modified version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Common Prayer. More recently arrived refugees, however, including Edmund Grindal, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, William Whittingham, wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included Richard Cox, one of the principal authors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Common Prayer. Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor {{to the attention of the}} Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.|$|E

5|$|Morton and {{his colleagues}} {{anticipated}} that copies {{of the new book}} would be prepared quickly. However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV returned from a trip to Australia where he realized that some changes should be made to the written Tongan language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with Tongan grammar. For a year, he studied the language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945. The Tongan version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Mormon was published in April 1946.|$|E
