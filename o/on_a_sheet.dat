25|$|To draw an {{algebraic}} curve, it {{is important}} to know the remarkable points and their tangents, the infinite branches and their asymptotes (if any) and the way in which the arcs connect them. It is also useful to consider the inflection points as remarkable points. When all this information is drawn <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper, the shape of the curve usually appears rather clearly. If not, it suffices to add a few other points and their tangents to get a good description of the curve.|$|E

Gamper painted the picture of a face <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of celluloid, which he then taped to the window of his studio {{overlooking}} Lake Zurich and photographed at sunset, with the setting sun shining through the unpainted eye to create a 'glowing eye' effect. The CD inlay booklet featured a photograph of Blank and Meier standing by the same window, with the painting visible on the window between them.|$|E
25|$|Before any procedures, the oreo {{cookies are}} frozen for 3 hours {{and the oil}} is {{preheated}} to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. After that, the buttermilk pancake mix is stirred with {{the water in a}} mixing bowl. The oreo cookies are dipped in the mixture, making sure the oreo is fully covered with the batter. The coated oreo cookies are then dropped into hot oil until the cookies turn golden brown. The cookies are removed from the oil and placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> pan with paper towels for draining the excessive oil. In the meantime, the tops of the fried oreos are dusted with confectioners sugar.|$|E

25|$|Paxton {{was visiting}} London in his {{capacity}} as a director of the Midland Railway to meet the chairman John Ellis who was also a member of parliament. He happened to mention an idea he had for the hall, and Ellis promptly encouraged to produce some plans, provided they could be ready in nine days. Unfortunately he was committed for the next few days, but at a board meeting of the railway in Derby, it is said he appeared to be spending much of his time doodling <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of blotting paper. At the end of the meeting he held up his first sketch of the Crystal Palace, inspired by the Victoria Regia House. The sketch is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
25|$|Blake's great {{innovation}} in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, {{parts of the}} plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid {{about a quarter of}} an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern rubber stamp. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press. This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio. The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he wrote in reverse. Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.|$|E
500|$|On 29 September 1638, Horrocks {{wrote to}} Crabtree about a likely {{forthcoming}} transit of Mercury on 21 October 1638 (Old Style) which Kepler had not predicted. He {{explained that he}} intended to construct what would later be called a helioscope by attaching his telescope to an [...] "oblong stick, carrying a plane surface at right angles to itself on which to receive the Sun’s image", and that he would draw a circle with numerical markings <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper on which to project the image of the Sun. In the event, no such transit took place as Mercury passed over the Sun well outside the limit for a transit, but the exercise proved to be an important dry-run for the later observation of the transit of Venus.|$|E

500|$|During {{the writing}} for the season, Ward and series' head writer Kent Osborne noted that it was {{increasingly}} difficult to produce new episode concepts because the writers had [...] "already used a lot of cool ideas". Osborne called this slump the [...] "season four blues". Ward went on to clarify that, [...] "everything's still coming out super weird and interesting—but it just gets a little harder. You have to dig deeper." [...] To combat these issues, the writer staff tried different story writing methods, such as a technique called exquisite corpse, in which one writer starts a story <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper, and the paper is folded and another writer tries to finish it. Ward, however, noted that [...] "the ideas are usually terrible". They also decided to experiment with different types of storytelling and to introduce more new characters to the show.|$|E

Selected press were invited to the event and were given a brief opportunity to question Boyd about the book's title. Boyd believes the short title is [...] "strikingly apt" [...] for the novel. He remarked that [...] "titles are very important" [...] to him, and that as soon as he [...] "wrote down Solo <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper I saw its potential. Not only did it fit the theme of the novel perfectly, it's also a great punchy word, instantly and internationally comprehensible, graphically alluring and, as an extra bonus, it's strangely Bondian {{in the sense that we}} might be subliminally aware of the '00' of '007' lurking just behind those juxtaposed O's of SOLO".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, {{during the}} Renegades sessions, {{a number of}} tracks were left off the album before then being {{considered}} for inclusion for the follow-up to that album. As there were not enough to fit on the album, more were recorded during the closing stages of the year, with the band {{taking a break from}} recording on 19 December, before resuming recording on 10 January 2011. Between 16 January and 24 January a production session began in New York City, this included overdubs, guitars and keyboards with Grant also flying over to record vocals, while some of the album was already recorded in London. On 19 January 2011 a photo of song lyrics written <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper was posted on their official Facebook page. The first of these songs to enter public knowledge, with different working titles was [...] "Borders", with other working titles being [...] "Jessie" [...] and [...] "White City Rock". In an interview with Heineken Music, on 27 January 2011 Grant revealed that 19 or 20 songs are so far in the recording stages, while the album is planned to be released after their tour of the United Kingdom and Europe ends in March, and like Renegades, looks likely to be released domestically on their own Big Teeth Music imprint.|$|E

500|$|The {{bachelor}} auction {{was created}} solely {{to provide more}} evidence that Apu was the best bachelor in Springfield. Appel found that the scene [...] "wrote itself", as every other man in Springfield is essentially a loser compared to Apu. The scene acted as the episode's opening set piece, a concept that Scully liked to use in every episode. The montage of Apu getting several different hair styles originally included three more, but they ended up being cut for time. The shot in which Apu's mother falls to the ground, a joke that the staff love, was inspired by an incident when Moore saw a man fall {{in much the same}} way. The joke was only inserted to buy Apu and Homer more time {{to come up with a}} lie. Homer writing [...] "Where are the sticky buns" [...] <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper after Apu asks him for advice is one of Mike Scully's favorite jokes.
