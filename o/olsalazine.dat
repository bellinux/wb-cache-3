40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>olsalazine,</b> an {{analogue}} of sulphasalazine, {{consisting of two}} molecules 5 -aminosalicylic acid linked by an azobond has been investigated {{for the treatment of}} ulcerative colitis. In a randomised double blind trial we compared 2 g <b>olsalazine</b> with placebo for four weeks. Of the 105 patients, with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, entered in the trial 52 received <b>olsalazine,</b> and 53 placebo. Treatment had to be terminated prematurely because of untoward effects of <b>olsalazine</b> (mainly diarrhoea) in three patients and treatment failure [...] that is, increased rectal bleeding in four patients (<b>olsalazine</b> group: one placebo group: three). After four weeks' treatment, a statistically significant improvement in the endoscopic findings in rectum and a positive trend in the reduction of rectal mucus and blood discharge was observed in the patients treated with <b>olsalazine.</b> No statistically significant difference was found for other factors, including stool frequency, consistency, urge to defecate, abdominal pain, and biopsy findings. A comparison between these clinical and endoscopic parameters at study entry and those at study completion (within drug evaluation) showed significant improvement in six of 10 parameters during treatment with <b>olsalazine</b> and in two of 10 during placebo treatment. This difference suggests the significant effect of <b>olsalazine.</b> We conclude that 2 g <b>olsalazine</b> was tolerated as well as placebo, apart from causing diarrhoea in some patients and was slightly superior to placebo during four weeks' treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. A study with 3 or 4 g <b>olsalazine</b> per day may show a more definite effect...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The {{benefit of}} 5 -aminosalicylic acid therapy for {{maintenance}} of remission in Crohn's disease is controversial. The primary {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the prophylactic properties of <b>olsalazine</b> in comparison with placebo for maintenance of remission in quiescent Crohn's colitis and/or ileocolitis. METHODS: In this randomised, double blind, parallel group study of <b>olsalazine</b> versus placebo, 328 patients with quiescent Crohn's colitis and/or ileocolitis were recruited. Treatment consisted of <b>olsalazine</b> 2. 0 g daily or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point of efficacy was relapse, as defined by the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and by clinical relapse. Laboratory and clinical disease activity indicators were also measured. Safety analysis consisted of documentation of adverse events and laboratory values. RESULTS: No differences in the frequency of termination due to relapse or time to termination due to relapse were noted between the two treatment groups (<b>olsalazine</b> 48. 5 % v placebo 45 %) for either colitis or ileocolitis. The failure rate, defined as not completing the study, was significantly higher in <b>olsalazine</b> treated patients compared with placebo treated patients for the overall population (colitis and/or ileocolitis: <b>olsalazine</b> 65. 4 % v 53. 9 %; p= 0. 038). Similar failure rates were seen for patients with colitis. A significantly higher percentage of <b>olsalazine</b> treated patients experienced adverse gastrointestinal events. Drug attributed adverse events were reported more frequently in the <b>olsalazine</b> treated group with gastrointestinal symptoms being causally related to <b>olsalazine</b> treatment (<b>olsalazine</b> 40. 7 % v placebo 26. 9 %; p= 0. 010). Back pain was reported significantly more often by the placebo treated group. However, serious medical events did not differ between the two groups. Adverse events led to more early withdrawals in the <b>olsalazine</b> treated group than in the placebo treated group; thus average time in the study for patients in the <b>olsalazine</b> treatment group was significantly shorter than that of patients in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with <b>olsalazine</b> were more likely to terminate their participation in the trial than those taking placebo. This difference was not related to relapse of disease, as measured by CDAI and clinical measures, but rather was due to the development of intolerable adverse medical events of a non-serious nature related to the gastrointestinal tract. The gastrointestinal related events in the <b>olsalazine</b> treated group may be due to the difference in gastrointestinal status at baseline which favoured the placebo treatment group...|$|E
40|$|<b>Olsalazine</b> and sulphasalazine were {{compared}} in a double-blind, double-dummy {{trial in the}} prevention of relapse of ulcerative colitis over 6 months. The majority were taking sulphasalazine. They were randomized to receive either <b>olsalazine,</b> 500 mg b. d., or sulphasalazine, 1 g b. d. Of 82 patients, 16 relapsed on <b>olsalazine</b> compared with 10 of 82 on sulphasalazine. This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0. 16). Twenty-one patients reported adverse events in the <b>olsalazine</b> group, of whom 16 were withdrawn, while 20 patients reported adverse events in the sulphasalazine group, with 9 of them being withdrawn. The differences were not statistically significant. No major haematological or biochemical abnormalities occurred. Thus, <b>olsalazine</b> is similar to sulphasalazine for the prevention of relapse of ulcerative colitis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Olsalazine</b> (azodisalicylate) is a {{new drug}} in which two {{molecules}} of 5 -aminosalicylic acid are linked by an azo bond. Its role {{in the treatment of}} mildly active, distal ulcerative colitis was investigated. Sixty patients were randomly allocated to receive <b>olsalazine</b> 1 g or a placebo as a retention enema nightly for two weeks. Clinical improvement was seen in 19 (66 %) and sigmoidoscopic improvement in 17 (59 %) of the 29 patients receiving <b>olsalazine</b> compared with 12 (43 %) and 11 (39 %), respectively, of the 28 in the control group. These differences were not significant. In a second trial 40 patients were randomised to receive oral <b>olsalazine</b> 2 g daily or a placebo capsule for two weeks. Significant clinical and sigmoidoscopic improvement was seen in the patients receiving oral <b>olsalazine</b> compared with the patients receiving placebo capsules. Oral <b>olsalazine</b> may be valuable in the treatment of mildly active ulcerative colitis. Its role in maintaining remission is yet to be determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} sulphasalazine and <b>olsalazine</b> on jejunal and ileal water and {{electrolyte}} absorption {{was investigated in}} normal subjects by a steady state intestinal perfusion of a physiological glucose bicarbonate electrolyte solution in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of each drug. (<b>Olsalazine</b> 0. 25 g/l, 1. 0 g/l, jejunum; 0. 5 g/l, 1. 0 g/l, ileum; sulphasalazine 0. 25 g/l, 0. 5 g/l, 2. 0 g/l jejunum; 1. 0 g/l, 2. 0 g/l, ileum.) In the jejunum <b>olsalazine</b> at 1. 0 g/l significantly inhibited water, sodium, chloride, and potassium absorption (p less than 0. 05). In the ileum <b>olsalazine</b> at 0. 5 and 1 g/l significantly inhibited glucose uptake (p less than 0. 04) and water absorption (p less than 0. 03). In the jejunum sulphasalazine had a dose related and significant inhibitory effect on water, bicarbonate, and sodium absorption and at 2. 0 g/l an inhibitory effect on chloride, potassium (p less than 0. 005), and glucose (p less than 0. 05) absorption. In the ileum sulphasalazine had no significant effect on water and electrolyte absorption. All inhibitory effects were rapidly reversible. These data show that unexplained diarrhoea in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with <b>olsalazine</b> may occur {{as a consequence of}} inhibition of water and electrolyte absorption in the small intestine and that the mechanisms of inhibition of sulphasalazine and <b>olsalazine</b> are different...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty four {{patients}} with ulcerative colitis in remission were entered into a double blind, double dummy trial comparing <b>olsalazine</b> 500 mg bd and sulphasalazine 1 g bd. Clinical examination, sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy were performed at 0, three, and six months. Sixteen of 82 (19. 5 %) patients relapsed on <b>olsalazine</b> and 10 / 82 (12. 2 %) relapsed on sulphasalazine. The difference {{was not statistically significant}} (p = 0. 1632). Adverse events were minor and were similar in both groups. No haematological or biochemical abnormalities were detected.

40|$|<b>Olsalazine</b> (2 g/day) and sulphasalazine (3 g/day) were {{compared}} {{in a double}} blind three centre trial in 37 patients presenting with first attack of distal colitis.

Both groups showed a similar decrease in stool frequency (p less than 0. 001). The proportion of unformed stools was also decreased, but to a lesser extent (p less than 0. 05) in those taking <b>olsalazine</b> (78 % v 55 %; p less than 0. 001) compared with those taking sulphasalazine (72 % v 28 %; p less than 0. 001). There was a diminution in the proportion of stools containing blood in both groups (olsalazine: 61 % v 22 %; p less than 0. 001 /sulphasalazine: 67 % v 37 %; p less than 0. 001). Sigmoidoscopic and histological appearances and clinical activity improved significantly and to a similar extent in both groups. Intolerance was encountered in two patients on <b>olsalazine</b> and four on sulphasalazine; intolerance to sulphasalazine being even higher (five of seven patients) in a preliminary study using a dose of sulphasalazine releasing the same amount of 5 -aminosalicylic acid as 2 g <b>olsalazine.</b> <b>Olsalazine</b> was at least as effective as sulphasalazine in the treatment of new patients with distal colitis, and in a dose releasing an equivalent amount of 5 -aminosalicylic acid was better tolerated...|$|E
40|$|The voltammetric {{properties}} of <b>Olsalazine</b> sodium, seven other azosalicylic acids and the azoxy analogue of <b>Olsalazine</b> sodium {{have been studied}} in aqueous solutions mainly by cyclic voltammetry and constant potential coulometry.

The reduction and oxidation potentials of the compounds were dependent on the pH {{and the structure of}} the compounds. All compounds, except 4, 4 '-azobis-(2 -hydroxybenzoic acid), were reduced to the corresponding amino salicylic acids in a 4 e-, 4 H+ reaction, as shown by spectrophotometric and voltammetric investigations of the reduced solutions. A further electrochemical characterisation of the formed reduction products 3 -, 4 - and 5 -aminosalicylic acid was also carried out. It was found that the oxidation of the investigated azo compounds occurs according to two different pathways.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{disposition}} of 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) and its acetylated metabolite during treatment with <b>olsalazine</b> and mesalazine, 14 patients with inactive ulcerative colitis {{were randomly assigned to}} <b>olsalazine</b> (1 g twice daily) and the mesalazines, Asacol (800 + 400 + 800 mg daily), Pentasa (750 + 500 + 750 mg daily), and Salofalk (750 + 500 + 750 mg daily) in a crossover design trial so that all received each drug for seven days. Intraluminal colonic concentrations of 5 -ASA were estimated after five days by the method of equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces. A predose serum sample and a 24 hour urine collection were obtained on day seven. The 5 -ASA and acetyl- 5 -aminosalicylic acid (Ac- 5 -ASA) values were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. <b>Olsalazine</b> almost doubled the colonic concentrations (mean 23. 7 (SEM) (1. 9) mmol/l) of its therapeutically active ingredient (5 -ASA) compared with equimolar doses of Pentasa (12. 6 (2. 2) mmol/l; p less than 0. 0003) and Salofalk (15. 0 (2. 0) mmol/l; p less than 0. 003). At the same time, <b>olsalazine</b> treatment was associated with lower serum concentrations and urinary excretions (p less than 0. 05) of 5 -ASA and Ac- 5 -ASA compared with the mesalazine preparations. The low systemic load of 5 -ASA provided by <b>olsalazine</b> reduces the potential risk of nephrotoxicity during long term treatment...|$|E

40|$|To examine {{pharmacokinetics}} {{and tolerance}} of long term administration of <b>olsalazine</b> (azodisalicylate), increasing {{doses of the}} drug were given for one year to 31 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and nine patients with Crohn's colitis (CC), refractory to, or intolerant of sulphasalazine, until sustained remission was obtained or a maximum of 4 g/day was reached. Colonic drug metabolism was studied by equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces. Complete azoreduction occurred in most cases. Concentrations of 5 -aminosalicylic acid, but not N-acetyl- 5 -aminosalicylic acid, in faecal dialysates increased dose dependently. Serum concentrations disclosed no cumulation {{in the long term}} and <b>olsalazine</b> was well tolerated, although loose stools occurred transiently in some patients with extensive disease: this was associated with a larger proportion of unsplit <b>olsalazine</b> in the faecal dialysates. Patients with ulcerative colitis having a high prostaglandin E 2 concentration (greater than ng/ml) determined by equilibrium dialysis of rectum, were less likely to benefit from treatment. <b>Olsalazine</b> is a very effective means of delivery of 5 -aminosalicylic acid to the colonic mucosa in active disease.

40|$|The drug <b>olsalazine</b> (H_ 4 olz) was {{employed}} as a ligand to synthesize {{a new series of}} mesoporous metal–organic frameworks that are expanded analogues of the well-known M_ 2 (dobdc) materials (dobdc^ 4 – = 2, 5 -dioxido- 1, 4 -benzenedicarboxylate; M-MOF- 74). The M_ 2 (olz) frameworks (M = Mg, Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn) exhibit high surface areas with large hexagonal pore apertures that are approximately 27 Å in diameter. Variable temperature H_ 2 adsorption isotherms revealed strong adsorption at the open metal sites, and in situ infrared spectroscopy experiments on Mg_ 2 (olz) and Ni_ 2 (olz) were used to determine site-specific H_ 2 binding enthalpies. In addition to its capabilities for gas sorption, the highly biocompatible Mg_ 2 (olz) framework was also evaluated as a platform for the delivery of <b>olsalazine</b> and other encapsulated therapeutics. The Mg_ 2 (olz) material (86 wt % <b>olsalazine)</b> was shown to release the therapeutic linker through dissolution of the framework under simulated physiological conditions. Furthermore, Mg_ 2 (olz) was used to encapsulate phenethylamine (PEA), a model drug for a broad class of bioactive compounds. Under simulated physiological conditions, Mg_ 2 (olz) (PEA) _ 2 disassembled to release PEA from the pores and <b>olsalazine</b> from the framework itself, demonstrating that multiple therapeutic components can be delivered together at different rates.

Here we used the protein-ligand docking software idock to virtually screen potential XOD inhibitors from 3167 approved small compounds/drugs. The inhibitory activities of the ten compounds with the highest scores were tested on XOD in vitro. Interestingly, all the ten compounds inhibited the activity of XOD at certain degrees. Particularly, the anti-ulcerative-colitis drug <b>olsalazine</b> sodium demonstrated a great inhibitory activity for XOD (IC 50  =  3. 4  mg/L). Enzymatic kinetic studies revealed that the drug was a hybrid-type inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Furthermore, the drug strikingly decreased serum urate levels, serum/hepatic activities of XOD at a dose-dependent manner in vivo.

Similar results were obtained when DR was induced by 100 U/ml of interferon-gamma except with 10 (- 2) M 4 ASA which reduced expression from 77 (4) % to 68 (3) % (p less than 0. 05). Sulphapyridine, prednisolone, indomethacin and cyclosporin A had no effect. Concurrent staining with propidium iodide showed that these results were unchanged when viable cells alone were analysed. Prior incubation of cells with drug, followed by washing, had no effect on interferon-gamma induced DR expression. 5 ASA, N-acetyl 5 ASA, 4 ASA, N-acetyl 4 ASA, <b>olsalazine</b> and colchicine reduce interferon-gamma induced HLA-DR expression. In inflammatory bowel disease these compounds may impair antigen presentation by the colonic epithelium...|$|E
40|$|Strong {{evidence}} has been accumulating that mesalazine (5 - aminosalicylic acid, 5 -ASA) represents the therapeutic moiety of the standard drug sulphasalazine. Since the active metabolite avoids the toxic potential of sulphapyridine, this perception has initiated new therapeutic approaches, for example, two 5 -ASA molecules have been coupled to form another prodrug (<b>olsalazine)</b> which again depends on a proper cleavage of the azobond by bacteria in the colon A more direct way has been applied successfully by administering 5 -ASA itself in special galenic formulation (suppositories, enemas, controlled release preparations) to provide enough active material at the proposed sites of action in the terminal ileum and/or colon. One major advantage of all 5 -ASA compounds, compared to sulphasalazine, is their 10 -fold lower potential (incidence) for inducing allergic reactions or causing intolerance. Aside from rare hypersensitivity reactions, 5 -ASA can cause nausea. vomiting, headache and gastrointestinal disturbances in 1 to 5 % of patients. However, the new azocompound <b>olsalazine</b> induced diarrhea or loose stool in at least 10 to 15 % of the treated patients which might limit its use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In conclusion, the ‘old’ metabolite 5 -ASA, in a ‘new’ design, offers an effective and very safe choice {{for the treatment of}} IBD...|$|E
40|$|Intestinal luminal pH in {{inflammatory}} bowel disease: possible determinants {{and implications}} for therapy with aminosalicylates and other drugs Summary Measurements of luminal pH in the normal gastro-intestinal tract have shown a progressive increase in pH from the duodenum to the terminal ileum, {{a decrease in the}} caecum, and then a slow rise along the colon to the rectum. Some data in patients with ulcerative colitis suggest a substantial reduction below normal values in the right colon, while limited results in Crohn’s disease have been contradictory. Determinants of luminal pH in the colon include mucosal bicarbonate and lactate production, bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and mucosal absorption of short chain fatty acids, and possibly intestinal transit. Alterations in these factors, as a result of mucosal disease and changes in diet, are likely to explain abnormal pH measurements in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is conceivable that reduced intracolonic pH in active ulcerative colitis impairs bioavailability of 5 -aminosalicylic acid from pH dependent release formulations (Asacol, Salofalk) and those requiring cleavage by bacterial azo reductase (sulphasalazine, <b>olsalazine,</b> balsalazide), but fur-ther pharmacokinetic studies are needed to confirm this possibility. Reports that balsalazide and <b>olsalazine</b> may be more eYcacious in active and quiescent ulcerative colitis, respectively, than Asacol suggest that low pH may be a more critical factor in patients taking directly pH depend-ent release than azo bonded preparations. Reduced intracolonic pH also needs to be considered in the development of pH dependent colonic release formula-tions of budesonide and azathioprine for use in ulcerative and Crohn’s colitis. This paper reviews methods for meas-uring gut pH, its changes in IBD, and how these may influ-ence current and future therapies...|$|E
