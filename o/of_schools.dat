50|$|A 2016 Pew Center global {{study on}} {{religion}} and education around the world ranked Jews as the most educated (13.4 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling)</b> followed by Christians (9.3 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling).</b> The religiously unaffiliated—a category which includes atheists, agnostics and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”—ranked overall as the third most educated religious group (8.8 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling)</b> followed by Buddhists (7.9 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling),</b> Muslims (5.6 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling),</b> and Hindus (5.6 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling).</b> In the youngest age (25-34) group surveyed, Jews averaged 13.8 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling,</b> the unaffiliated group averaged 10.3 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling,</b> Christians averaged 9.9 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling,</b> Buddhists averaged 9.7 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling,</b> Hindus averaged 7.1 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling,</b> and Muslims averaged 6.7 years <b>of</b> <b>schooling.</b> 61% <b>of</b> Jews, 20% of Christians, 16% of the unaffiliated, 12% of Buddhists, 10% of Hindus, and 8% of Muslims have graduate and post-graduate degrees.

5|$|Because R. norvegicus {{and related}} species {{are seen as}} pests, their {{intentional}} import into foreign countries is often regulated.

In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside <b>of</b> <b>schools,</b> laboratories, and zoos is illegal.|$|E
