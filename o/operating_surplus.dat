The three temporary stands with a total capacity of 16,000 were dismantled, and replaced with a permanent structure of similar design to the existing one at the southern end. This work took nearly a year to complete and added 23,000 permanent seats, increasing the capacity of the converted stadium by 7,000 to approximately 48,000. Manchester City F.C. moved to the ground in time {{for the start of the}} 2003–04 season. The total cost of this conversion was in excess of £40 million, with the track, pitch and seating conversion being funded by the city council at a cost of £22million; and the installation of bars, restaurants and corporate entertainment areas throughout the stadium being funded by the football club at a cost of £20million. The Games had made a small <b>operating</b> <b>surplus,</b> and Sport England agreed that this could be reinvested in converting the athletics warm-up track adjacent to the main stadium into the 6,000 seat Manchester Regional Arena at a cost of £3.5 million.|$|E

40|$|With {{continued}} <b>operating</b> <b>surpluses</b> and {{low levels}} of debt, this report finds that Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s university sector remains in a relatively healthy financial position, but that active management is required given that <b>operating</b> <b>surpluses</b> have continued their decline since 2009. Summary This report covers the results of the 2013 financial audits of 64 entities, comprising eight universities and the 56 entities they control. Clear audit opinions were issued on the financial reports of 59 entities. Two qualified opinions were issued, relating to the financial reports of Deakin University and The University of Melbourne, {{as a result of their}} accounting treatments of grants received in 2013. Three entities are yet to finalise their financial reports. The eight universities generated a net surplus of 381. 7 million in 2013, a decrease of 73 million from 2012. With continued <b>operating</b> <b>surpluses</b> and {{low levels of}} debt, the university sector remains in a relatively healthy financial position. However, active management is required given that <b>operating</b> <b>surpluses</b> have continued their decline since 2009. While student revenue and the number of students enrolled in higher education continue to increase, they mask a significant decline in domestic and international vocational education and training student numbers during 2013. Three universities were assessed as having a high risk to self-financing in 2013. The remaining five were assessed as having a medium risk. This indicates that some universities may be unable to fund asset replacement in future periods from cash generated from their operations. In 2013 Monash University signed agreements with a private sector entity to assume control of its South African operations. From 2001 to 2013 Monash University provided 101. 8 million in loan funding to its subsidiary entities associated with the South Africa campus. Monash University has incurred a net loss of 60. 5  million in relation to the operation and disposal of this subsidiary, including debt write‑offs of 44. 7 million...|$|R
25|$|For {{the final}} 30 {{years of the}} nineteenth century, the Shropshire Union network had made a small <b>operating</b> <b>surplus,</b> {{although}} it did not cover dividends or interest in its debts. The situation improved {{during the early years}} of the twentieth century, but collapsed again at the start of the First World War. Government subsidies propped up the operation when hostilities ceased, but wages had increased significantly, the eight-hour day had been extended to boatmen and rivermen, and raw materials were more expensive. When subsidies were withdrawn from 14 August 1920, the operation was no longer viable. Boating families who lived on 202 boats were told that all carrying would cease, although the waterways would stay open, in the hope that private boats might use them. The Ellesmere Port facilities were leased to the Manchester Ship Canal, for a period of 50 years, while the Great Western Railway took over those at Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the New York City Transit System {{showed an}} <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> on the five-cent fare, because {{gasoline}} was rationed and auto riders had {{to abandon their}} cars for subway and bus travel. Factories began to work around the clock, and therefore business boomed. Transit repairs were kept at a minimum as basic materials were in short supply for civilian use. Operating revenues were raised and maintenance costs were reduced, but as a result, the future problems of deferred maintenance and falling ridership. In 1946, costs rose and profits turned to losses, and to obtain needed funds, the fare was raised in 1948 to ten cents on the subways and elevated, and to seven cents on the surface lines. This increase only produced a revenue surplus for a single year. In 1951 a uniform ten-cent fare was established on both the rapid transit and surface lines. Operating deficits continued to add up and public dissatisfaction with the transit system grew, as equipment was deteriorating, and train schedules being difficult to abide by.|$|E
25|$|Services {{in rural}} areas are {{provided}} by thousands of community-based water committees. According to a 2000 World Bank report, at that time communities were insufficiently involved in water system design and government and donor-supported schemes usually fell short of developing effective community construction and management mechanisms. Water committees were imposed local institutions, often suffering from internal management conflicts, leading to negligence of operation and maintenance which resulted in frequent break-downs. More than 50 percent of systems were broken down. Systems were often over-designed, and users can not afford paying {{the full cost of}} operating the schemes, let alone producing an <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> for the purchase of spare parts and major repairs. In addition, political and tribal leaders frequently demanded that the government allocates its resources to particular projects, thereby interrupting—even abandoning—the work of started schemes. According to a 1996 Review, there were several hundreds of incomplete projects at that time. Little was done in the area of hygiene education, safe drinking water storage, and wastewater and excreta disposal.|$|E

25|$|Organizations {{increasingly}} {{make money}} from trading in already existing assets which are not used by them to produce any new products and services with. Put differently, an increasing share of total generic profit income consists of net interest, net taxes, net capital gains, fees & royalties, and rents. This can happen {{because a lot of}} non-productive assets have been accumulated that are available for trade; second-hand physical assets, financial assets and properties are being traded; all sorts of things are traded internationally, taking advantage of currency and cost differentials; assets are being held via all kinds of special financial constructions to extract profit, etc. And, an increasing amount of interest payments, rents and capital gains have been excluded from <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> because, by statistical definition, they are not classified as production expenditure at all (i.e. they are not counted as value-added). Post-Keynesian researchers such as Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie therefore tried to devise more adequate measures of the real financial profitability of companies. If a lot of capital is borrowed at a cost which is lower than the income obtained from reinvesting it in assets that appreciate in value, then a lot of profit income is earnt which has nothing directly to do with creating new product value, and therefore is not counted as value-added. Instead, existing wealth is transferred from one set of owners to another.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{artificial}} <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> during World War II, {{brought on by}} gas and rubber rations leading to increased mass transit usage, the Board of Transportation had its first operational deficit in 1947, amounting to $18 million. On March 30, 1948, Governor Thomas E. Dewey signed legislation to allow the BOT to increase fares {{with the approval of}} the New York City mayor. On July 1, 1948, the Board of Transportation raised the fare for its rapid transit system from five cents to ten cents, with the approval of Mayor William O'Dwyer. The nickel fare had been in place in the subway system since October 27, 1904, a period of 45 years, {{and was one of the}} main provisions of the Dual Contracts. New York City was the last major city to have a five-cent fare. The BOT also created 14 new free transfers between the formerly-separate subway divisions. The fare increase was put forward due to increasing debt, inflation in the post-war period, expenditure on new subway routes, equipment and facilities, and maintenance of the existing system which was in disrepair. In addition, city planner Robert Moses pushed for the fare increase to allow more city funding to go towards highway development, while Transport Workers Union of America leader Michael J. Quill supported the fare hike in order to give transit workers a 30-cent per hour wage increase. In 1950, the fare of BOT surface transit was also raised to ten cents. Upon the initial 1948 increases, a twelve-cent fare had been put in place for a combined trip on the subway and either bus or trolley, but this was eliminated on July 1, 1952.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1996, the CPA {{informed}} the President that for 1997 the CPF Board had budgeted for capital expenditure of S$27 million, which exceeded its <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> of $23 million. Although the intention {{was for the}} excess of $4 million to be funded out of the Board's accumulated surpluses, because a general election was due in 1997 the Board's accumulated surpluses would become past reserves and require the President's approval to be drawn upon. The Government explained that the CPF Board's accounts were prepared on an accrual basis. Thus, capital expenditure was depreciated over the useful life of each asset and not indicated as a lump sum {{in the year of}} expenditure. The Board's <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> of $23 million had been computed on the basis of annual depreciation of $11 million being charged against the year's income. Hence, no drawdown on past reserves was required. The President expressed concern that accrual accounting would [...] "allow a profligate Government to hide its lavish spending under the guise of capital expenditures". The Government disagreed, taking the view that accrual accounting was well established.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{that more}} {{is known about}} the trends in {{empirical}} measures of profitability, the debate focuses more on the underlying concepts. Simon Mohun states that the rate of profit is [...] "most easily measured as the proportion of net output not returned as wages to the aggregate fixed capital stock" [...] and that it is this rate of profit that is [...] "generally used in empirical work". If the growth of the gross profit component of value-added (P) is statistically compared with the growth of the estimated fixed capital stock plus inventory holdings (C), it is certainly true that almost all measures will show that the ratio P/C does drop over time. The real value of the physical capital stock appears to grow faster in real terms than the real value of the <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> associated with that physical stock, in the long run. The same effect persists even when various different depreciation techniques are used. The data trend is analogous to a rising tendency of the capital coefficient, where in the course of time more and more capital is required to obtain each additional increase in output. The profit rate rises again, only after a major crisis or a war which destroys a sufficiently large amount of capital value, raises the rate of surplus value, and clears the way for new production techniques.|$|E
