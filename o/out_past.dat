5|$|If {{the police}} {{identified}} Bostic {{even before the}} shooting occurred, he would have faced a two-year prison sentence for violating the terms of his parole, since he was <b>out</b> <b>past</b> his curfew. After the shooting, police discovered the BMW had been stolen from the Five Towns Mitsubishi car dealership in Inwood, Long Island, where Bostic worked as a salesman. A motor vehicle theft or gun possession conviction would have been Bostic's third felony, likely resulting in a lengthy prison sentence.|$|E
5|$|Since 1991, {{members of}} the band have {{branched}} <b>out</b> <b>past</b> Green Day, starting other projects with various musicians. Notable projects related to Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder with Jason White, The Frustrators with Mike Dirnt, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and {{members of the}} band Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, which the band uses to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a family band called The Boo which recorded a one off Christmas record for their friends and family making a few copies available in a local store.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope <b>out</b> <b>past</b> the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Katia, {{also known}} as the Affair of Qatia by the British, was an {{engagement}} fought east of the Suez Canal and north of El Ferdan Station, in the vicinity of Katia and Oghratina, on 23 April 1916 during the Defence of the Suez Canal Campaign of World War I. An Ottoman force led by the German General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein made a surprise attack on three and a half squadrons of the British 5th Mounted Brigade, which was widely scattered to the east of Romani. The mounted brigade had been ordered to the area to protect the new railway and water pipeline being built from Kantara on the Suez Canal, as this infrastructure extended <b>out</b> <b>past</b> the Canal's zone of defences into the Sinai Peninsula towards Romani. Kress Von Kressenstein's attack was completely successful, decimating the equivalent of little more than a regiment. On the same day, an associated Ottoman attack on Duidar, very close to the Suez Canal, failed when it met with strong British opposition.|$|E

25|$|Open gun battles were televised, {{including}} one well-publicized incident where Korean shopkeepers armed with M1 carbines, Ruger Mini-14s, pump-action shotguns, and handguns exchanged gunfire {{with a group}} of armed looters and forced their retreat. Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda's statement criticizing rioters burning down their own neighborhoods resulted in death threats. He was relocated to the LAPD academy for protection, where the 670th MP Company had been redeployed to reinforce police patrols and to guard the Korean Cultural Center and Embassy after events in Koreatown. That evening at the Korean Cultural Center, two men <b>out</b> <b>past</b> curfew were nearly shot after attempting to take a rifle from a 670th MP member.

25|$|Beyond {{the inner}} range of hills lie Dunedin's outer suburbs, notably to the northwest, beyond Roslyn. This {{direction}} contains Taieri Road and Three Mile Hill, which between them formed the original road {{route to the}} Taieri Plains. The modern State Highway 1 follows a different route, passing through Caversham {{in the west and}} <b>out</b> <b>past</b> Saddle Hill. Lying between Saddle Hill and Caversham are the outer suburbs of Green Island and Abbotsford. Between Green Island and Roslyn lies the steep-sided valley of the Kaikorai Stream, which is today a residential and light industrial area. Suburban settlements – mostly regarded as separate townships – also lie along both edges of the Otago Harbour. Notable among these are Portobello and Macandrew Bay, on the Otago Peninsula coast, and Port Chalmers {{on the opposite side of}} the harbour. Port Chalmers provides Dunedin's main deep-water port, including the city's container port.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} October, the 25th Brigade {{became the}} {{spearhead}} of the 7th Division.

Pushing <b>out</b> <b>past</b> the Mene River towards the Eapia River, while commandos from the 2/6th Commando Squadron pushed towards Orgoruna throughout November. In mid-December, the Australians—who had managed to ensconce themselves on the southern slope—were ready to launch their assault on Shaggy Ridge, starting with an attack on the Pimple, by elements of the 21st Brigade, which had taken over from the 25th. Throughout December and into January 1944, a series of actions were fought along the steep ridges, culminating with the capture of the Kankiryo Saddle and Crater Hill. Following this, the Australians pushed north towards Bogadjim and Madang, which was captured in mid-April.|$|E

25|$|The town {{formerly}} had excellent beaches, {{which were}} supplied by longshore drift constantly moving sand {{along the coast}} from west to east. However, in the early 20th century a large breakwater was constructed at Newhaven Harbour and the harbour entrance was regularly dredged. These works cut off the supply of fresh sand to the beach. By the 1980s the beach at Seaford had all but vanished, the shoreline becoming steep, narrow and largely composed of small boulders. This made Seaford attractive to watersports enthusiasts (since water visibility was good {{and there was a}} rapid drop-off into deep water) but it discouraged more general seaside visitors. So in 1987 a massive beach replenishment operation was carried out, in which around 1 million tonnes of material was dredged from sandbanks out to sea and deposited on the shore. During a severe storm in October of the same year a substantial amount of the deposited material on {{the upper part of the}} beach was washed <b>out</b> <b>past</b> low tide level, leading to questions in the House of Commons. The beach has been topped up several times since then, giving the town a broad beach of sand and shingle.|$|E
500|$|The {{area around}} the Bastille was {{transformed}} in the reign of Louis XIV. Paris' growing population reached 400,000 during the period, causing the city to spill <b>out</b> <b>past</b> the Bastille and the old city into the arable farmland beyond, forming more thinly populated [...] "faubourgs", or suburbs. Influenced {{by the events of}} the Fronde, Louis XIV rebuilt the {{area around the}} Bastille, erecting a new archway at the Porte Saint-Antoine in 1660, and then ten years later pulling down the city walls and their supporting fortifications to replace them with an avenue of trees, later called Louis XIV's boulevard, which passed around the Bastille. The Bastille's bastion survived the redevelopment, becoming a garden {{for the use of the}} prisoners.|$|E

500|$|In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{designated}} a scenic shoreline trunkline to run north from Negaunee to Skanee and L'Anse {{by way of}} Big Bay.
