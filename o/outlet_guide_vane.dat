The Vector graphs of airfoil flow were analyzed in the different operating conditions for different adjustable angles of guide vane. BP-ANN prediction model was established {{about the effect of}} adjustable <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> on the hydraulic performance of axial-flow pump based on the numerical results. The effectiveness of prediction model was verified by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The results show that, with the adjustable angle of guide vane increasing along clockwise, the high efficiency area moves to the large flow rate direction; otherwise, that moves to the small flow rate direction. The internal flow field of guide vane is improved by adjusting angle, and the flow separation of tail and guide vane inlet ledge are decreased or eliminated, so that the hydraulic efficiency of pumping system will be improved. The prediction accuracy of BP-ANN model is 1 %, which can meet the requirement of practical engineering...|$|E

In order to more fully understand the physics of noise in a turbofan engine, a comprehensive aeroacoustic wind tunnel test programs was conducted called the 'Source Diagnostic Test. ' The text was cooperative effort between NASA and General Electric Aircraft Engines, as part of the NASA Advanced Subsonic Technology Noise Reduction Program. A 1 / 5 -scale model simulator representing the bypass stage of a current technology high bypass ratio turbofan engine was used in the test. The test article consisted of the bypass fan and outlet guide vanes in a flight-type nacelle. The fan used was a medium pressure ratio design with 22 individual, wide chord blades. Three <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> design configurations were investigated, representing a 54 -vane radial Baseline configuration, a 26 -vane radial, wide chord Low Count configuration and a 26 -vane, wide chord Low Noise configuration with 30 deg of aft sweep. The test was conducted in the NASA Glenn Research Center 9 by 15 -Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel at velocities simulating the takeoff and approach phases of the aircraft flight envelope. The Source Diagnostic Test had several acoustic and aerodynamic technical objectives: (1) establish the performance of a scale model fan selected to represent the current technology turbofan product; (2) assess the performance of the fan stage with each of the three distinct <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> designs; (3) determine the effect of the <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> configuration on the fan baseline performance; and (4) conduct detailed flowfield diagnostic surveys, both acoustic and aerodynamic, to characterize and understand the noise generation mechanisms in a turbofan engine.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{performance of}} an isolated fan or rotor alone model {{was measured in}} the NASA Glenn Research Center 9 - by 15 - Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel {{as part of the}} Fan Broadband Source Diagnostic Test conducted at NASA Glenn. The Source Diagnostic Test was conducted to identify the noise sources within a wind tunnel scale model of a turbofan engine and quantify their contribution to the overall system noise level. The fan was part of a 1 / 5 th scale model representation of the bypass stage of a current technology turbofan engine. For the rotor alone testing, the fan and nacelle, including the inlet, external cowl, and fixed area fan exit nozzle, were modeled in the test hardware; the internal <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> located behind the fan were removed. Without the <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> the velocity at the nozzle exit changes significantly, thereby affecting the fan performance. As part of the investigation, variations in the fan nozzle area were tested in order to match as closely as possible the rotor alone performance with the fan performance obtained with the <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> installed. The fan operating performance was determined using fixed pressure/temperature combination rakes and the corrected weight flow. The performance results indicate that a suitable nozzle exit was achieved to be able to closely match the rotor alone and fan/outlet <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> configuration performance on the sea level operating line. A small shift in the slope of the sea level operating line was measured, which resulted in a slightly higher rotor alone fan pressure ratio at take-off conditions, matched fan performance at cutback conditions, and a slightly lower rotor alone fan pressure ratio at approach conditions. However, the small differences in fan performance at all fan conditions were considered too small to affect the fan acoustic performance...|$|R

The temperature-rise efficiency increased with speed from 0. 70 at 8500 rpm to 0. 74 at 13, 600 rpm and dropped gradually to 0. 70 at 17, 000 rpm. At the design speed of 17, 000 rpm, the pressure ratio at the peak efficiency point was 3. 63. The maximum pressure ratio at design speed was 4. 15 at an equivalent weight flow of 29. 8 pounds per second. The altered compressor operated very. near the design specifications of pressure ratio and equivalent weight flow. At the high speeds, the peak adiabatic temperature-rise efficiency was increased 0. 02 to 0, 06 by altering the blade angles. The peak pressure ratio was increased 0. 29 at design speed (17, 000 rpm) and 0. 05 and 0. 13 at 11, 900 and 13, 600 rpm, respectively. The equivalent weight flow through the altered compressor was reduced 2 pounds per second at 15, 300 and 17, 000 rpm, as was expected from the design calculations.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} fan <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> pressure fluctuations and their link to rotor-stator interaction noise, time histories of vane fluctuating pressures were digitally acquired {{as part of the}} Fan Noise Source Diagnostic Test. Vane unsteady pressures were measured at seven fan tip speeds for both a radial and a swept vane configuration. Using time-domain averaging and spectral analysis, the blade passing frequency (BPF) harmonic and broadband contents of the vane pressures were individually analyzed. Significant Sound Pressure Level (SPL) reductions were observed for the swept vane relative to the radial vane for the BPF harmonics of vane pressure, but vane broadband reductions due to sweep turned out to be much smaller especially on an average basis. Cross-correlation analysis was used to establish the level of spatial coherence of broadband pressures between different locations on the vane and integral length scales of pressure fluctuations were estimated from these correlations. Two main results of this work are: (1) the average broadband level on the vane (in dB) increases linearly with the fan tip speed for both the radial and swept vanes, and (2) the broadband pressure distribution on the vane is nearly homogeneous and its integral length scale is a monotonically decreasing function of fan tip speed...|$|E

The angular component in the outgoing flow is due to load on the low pressure turbine. The most interesting part of the turbine rear frame from an aerodynamic {{point of view is}} the gas channel consisting of outlet guide vanes, a hub, and a shroud. Volvane is a powerful in-house design tool used to create guide vanes and includes a 2 D panel which is a potential flow solver and a G 3 D Euler solver. Minimizing the number of design parameters is a main issue and may result in a significant improvement in the <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> design process with Volvane. Initially a reference design of an <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is created in Volvane. The design is simulated in Volvane and with different RANS-solvers and computational grids. After analysis of the ow results, a RANS-solver is selected for further use in the investigation. In Part 1, the design tool validation is the target {{to reduce the number of}} design parameters. Three different design of experiments (DoEs) are created. Design parameters and boundary conditions were varied to investigate how the flow behaves around the outlet guide vanes for different geometries and operating conditions. The same changes were simulated in RANS-solvers and the results compared with those of the Volvane program. Analysis in Part 1 resulted in updates of new V olvane versions. The V olvane G 3 D Euler solver has more difficulties in predicting changes in lean compared to changes in sweep and is more able to predict an increased than a decreased sweep angle. If the boundary condition of the swirl is increased, the V olvane G 3 D Euler solver has difficulties in predicting the diffusion factor. Simulations with wall function mesh in the selected RANS-solver showed a 2 % outlet swirl angle difference from the low Reynolds mesh. This aspect should be taken into account when analyzing results from flow simulations. The loss estimations from the V olvane G 3 D Euler solver are approximately 35 % of the loss estimations from the RANS-solver. Generally the V olvane G 3 D Euler solver and the RANS-solver are in good agreement. In Part 2, the design process rationalization, response surface methodology (RSM) is created to find correlations between design and output parameters. A statistical software is the main tool used. The correlations measure the relations between different design and output parameters. Two additional DoEs are constructed. The analysis suggests the maximum thickness location of the vane can be shifted without affecting the axial position of maximum velocity.

Salient results are as follows: tradeoff evaluation of fan tip speed and blade loading; systematic data on source noise characteristics and suppression effectiveness; documentation of high- and low-fan-speed aerodynamic and acoustic technology; aerodynamic and acoustic evaluation of acoustic treatment configurations, casing tip bleed, serrated and variable pitch rotor blades, leaned <b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> slotted tip casings, rotor blade shape modifications, and inlet noise suppression; systematic evaluation of aerodynamic and acoustic effects; flyover noise projections of engine test data; turbine noise suppression technology development; and tradeoff evaluation of preliminary design high-fan-speed and low-fan-speed flight engines...|$|R

Experiments {{have been carried out}} on an Optimum (C •) Diffuser (Area Ratio- 2 : 1) to investigate the way in which compressor exit conditions influence the performance and boundary layer growth within the diffuser. Three sets of conditions simulated by 0 °, 15 ° and 30 ° Radially Tilted O. G. V. (<b>outlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes)</b> have been studied. Compressor delivery conditions were simulated by a single Rotor row just upstream of the O. G. V. The Rotor/O. G. V. constituted a single compressor stage and was sited 0. 125 blade chord lengths upstream of diffuser inlet. The diffuser static pressure recovery, total pressure loss and flow stability were, in all cases, better than that achieved with fully developed flow at inlet to the diffuser. The 30 o O. G. V. configuration being the most superior [continued]...|$|R
