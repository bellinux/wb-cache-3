5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, {{to the dismay}} <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived {{as the product of}} desperation.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XII, the Light of Kiltia, a polytheistic religion, is the {{dominant}} church in Ivalice, having influence in the political affairs of the region around the Galtean Peninsula. Despite this, the church maintains an apolitical stance, with its most high-ranking officials banned from participating in political affairs altogether. At its head is the Gran Kiltias, being the Helgas Anastasis {{at the time of}} Final Fantasy XII, until his death during the events of the story. Like Glabados followers in Final Fantasy Tactics, Kiltias swear on the name of Faram, the Father <b>of</b> <b>All,</b> <b>in</b> the manner of the Christian amen. The Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Ω guide considers the Glabados Church a possible branch of Kiltia.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off <b>of</b> <b>All</b> <b>in</b> the Family) twice, because the writers {{could not think of}} any more spin-offs.|$|E

Like its British predecessor Till Death Us Do Part, the show lent dramatic social substance {{to the traditional}} sitcom format. Archie Bunker's popularity made O'Connor a top-billing star of the 1970s.
