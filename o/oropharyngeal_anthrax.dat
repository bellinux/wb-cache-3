40|$|When swallowed, {{anthrax spores}} may cause lesions from the oral cavity to the cecum. Gastrointestinal anthrax is greatly underreported in rural disease-endemic {{areas of the}} world. The {{apparent}} paucity of this form of anthrax reflects the lack of facilities {{able to make the}} diagnosis in these areas. The spectrum of disease, ranging from subclinical infection to death, has not been fully recognized. In some communitybased studies, cases of gastrointestinal anthrax outnumbered those of cutaneous anthrax. The oropharyngeal variant, in particular, is unfamiliar to most physicians. The clinical features of <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>anthrax</b> include fever and toxemia, inflammatory lesion(s) in the oral cavity or oropharynx, enlargement of cervical lymph nodes associated with edema of the soft tissue of the cervical area, and a high case-fatality rate. Awareness of gastrointestinal anthrax in a differential diagnosis remains important in anthrax-endemic areas but now also in settings of possible bioterrorism...|$|E
40|$|Anthrax {{which is}} caused by Bacillus anthracis is {{typically}} a disease of herbivores. Spores existing in the skin, meat, hair or mouth and nose of animals are transmitted to humans through contact with {{a break in the}} skin, consumption of infected meat or inhalation of spores [1]. Infected uncooked or insufficiently cooked meats cause oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal system (GIS) anthrax. When this infected materials swallowed anthrax spores may cause lesions from the oral cavity to the caecum. The diagnosis of gastrointestinal system (GIS) anthrax is difficult due to insidious clinical progression of the disease and difficulty in the isolation of agent pathogen. Releated symptoms of GIS anthrax are sore throat, neck swelling, diffuculty swallowing, stomach pain, anoreksia, bloody diarrhea, nause, bloody vomiting and fever. Supportive and antibiotic treatments are required. Benzylpenicillin, rifampicin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, imipenem/cilastatin, or vancomycin can be use for treatment, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline may be added to this treat-ment for serious cases. To emphasize the necessity of taking precautions, an <b>oropharyngeal</b> and intestinal <b>anthrax</b> case due to consumption of infected and insufficiently cooked meat is presented below...|$|R
