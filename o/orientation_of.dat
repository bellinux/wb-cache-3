40|$|This study {{explores the}} career/achievement and family <b>orientations</b> <b>of</b> {{entrepreneurs}} - specifically {{the impact of}} sex and dependent child status. While {{a growing body of}} research has explored the similarities and uniqueness of women, none have explicitly analyzed entrepreneurs employing a career/achievement and family framework. Additionally, no studies have sought to explore the career/achievement and family <b>orientations</b> <b>of</b> female entrepreneurs with female non-entrepreneurs of similar backgrounds. Consequently, this research explores and compares the career/achievement and family <b>orientations</b> <b>of</b> female entrepreneurs with a group of female non-entrepreneurs with similar educational levels, ages, and work experience. It also compares the <b>orientations</b> <b>of</b> male entrepreneurs with a group of male non-entrepreneurs in order to both confirm existing literature and create a means to compare intra-female with intra-male career and family orientations. The analysis shows no statically significant differences in the career/achievement and family <b>orientations</b> <b>of</b> women entrepreneurs and similar female non-entrepreneurs. It also finds, confirming existing literature, that male entrepreneurs possess a greater career/achievement orientation as compared to male non-entrepreneurs...|$|R

5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly understood, the <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E
