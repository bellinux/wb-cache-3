5|$|Predecessor and {{successor}} queries can {{be performed}} with rank queries. Once the rank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> value is known, its predecessor is the element at the position given by its rank (as {{it is the largest}} element that is smaller than the target value). Its successor is the element after it (if it is present in the array) or at the next position after the predecessor (otherwise). The nearest neighbor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> value is either its predecessor or successor, whichever is closer.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{recommended}} balance <b>of</b> <b>target</b> distances is that 30 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> {{are placed}} closer than 60 meters, 50 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> between 60 and 150 meters and 20 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> between 150 and 300 meters.|$|R
30|$|Given the {{constraints}} mentioned above, {{we believe that}} in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high occlusion rate and <b>the</b> chaotic dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> additional data (third dimension) is required to ensure robust detection and tracking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} <b>the</b> methods <b>of</b> parametrically reconstructing <b>the</b> {{position}} <b>of</b> a 3 D scattering center model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> from SAR images for a target recognition application. First, {{a framework for}} reconstructing the 3 D position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> from <b>the</b> SAR images is proposed. Then, a method that uses the parameters obtained from <b>the</b> scattering center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> from <b>the</b> SAR images is used for reconstructing the 3 D scattering center model. Finally, the proposed methods are confirmed using the simulated data...|$|R
5|$|The {{concept was}} for the {{satellite}} to be launched ahead of its target, so that the target would come close to it. After this the Agena would be used as fuel to put the SAINT in a co-orbit with its target, and then the SAINT would locate the target using its long range radar, and jettison its Agena once it had acquired the target. Then within the next 8 to 12 minutes the SAINT's radar and orientation systems would guide it to within 39ft (12m) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> If a SAINT was launched from Cape Canaveral, it {{would be able to}} provide initial video <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and data dumps to the NORAD station in Rhodesia. A full inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> would take two hours, and be recorded, then sent to a ground station as soon as it came within the range of the station. It would then stay within 200ft (60m) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> for up to two days, taking pictures and measurements at different angles. After this it would be depleted of battery power and propellant.|$|E
5|$|The join-irreducible {{elements}} of this lattice are exactly connected graphs. This can be shown using {{the fact that a}} homomorphism maps a connected graph into one connected component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> graph.|$|E
5|$|A {{novelisation}} of this serial {{written by}} Ian Marter {{was published by}} Target Books in August 1987. Marter died soon after completing the manuscript. It was subsequently edited and published, with some new material added by Nigel Robinson, editor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Target</b> Books line. An unabridged audio reading of the novelisation, read by O'Brien, was released by AudioGo on 1 April 2013.|$|E
50|$|Nessus {{offers a}} non-{{intrusive}} scan, an intrusive scan that can harm <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> and a custom scan. A scan requires the IP addresses or domain names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets.</b> Nessus {{begins with a}} port scan to identify the programs that are running and <b>the</b> operating systems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets.</b> It ends with a report that specifies all open ports and their associated vulnerabilities.|$|R

5|$|A second {{method of}} rear delay array {{combines}} end-fire topology with polarity reversal, using two subwoofers positioned front to back, the drivers spaced one-quarter wavelength apart, the rear enclosure inverted in polarity and delayed {{by a few}} milliseconds for maximum cancellation on stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> frequency. This method has the least output power directed toward the audience, compared to other directional methods.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 {{the first}} {{aircraft}} began to take-off. The first RAF aircraft over Germany were medium bomber variants of the de Havilland Mosquito. No. 8 Group RAF committed 89 to bomb Berlin and Würzburg. The Mosquitos marked {{the area with}} target indicators while 64 others dropped 59 tons of bombs. Six Mosquitos marked Würzburg which was then while 24 others each dropped a Blockbuster bomb in a concentrated area east of the river causing a large fire. None of the crews noticed any defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b>|$|E
5|$|Axons {{transmit}} {{signals to}} other neurons {{by means of}} specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> cell.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{aiming at}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> UAV path {{planning}} for multiple moving <b>targets,</b> after <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> are determined, radar {{is used to}} observe <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> and obtain their observation positions. According to <b>the</b> observation positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> <b>the</b> Kalman filtering is used to obtain the state positions and <b>the</b> predicted positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> and <b>the</b> ant colony algorithm is used to perform path planning for multiple moving <b>targets.</b> <b>The</b> experimental results show that by predicting <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moving <b>targets</b> for path planning, the UAV path can be corrected and updated in advance, which improves <b>the</b> tracking efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UAV, thus enhancing <b>the</b> intelligence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UAV multiple moving targets tracking.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, <b>the</b> {{observation}} states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radar can be filtered by {{the above}} formula to obtain <b>the</b> state equation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> because <b>the</b> UAV {{takes a long}} time in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> approaching <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> If only relying on <b>the</b> existing states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> <b>the</b> direct interval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control signal and the delay in the signal transmission may cause the flight direction to be updated backward, so that the shorter tracking path cannot be obtained. Thus, in this paper, the predicted positions in the Kalman filter algorithm are extracted in order to take control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UAV.|$|R
50|$|There are {{multiple}} theories surrounding <b>the</b> neural correlates <b>of</b> masking, {{but most of}} them agree on a few key ideas. First, backward visual masking comes about from suppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> “after-discharge”, where <b>the</b> after-discharge can be thought <b>of</b> as <b>the</b> neural response to <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> termination. Forward masking, on the other hand, is correlated to <b>the</b> suppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> “onset-response”, which can be thought <b>of</b> as <b>the</b> neural response to <b>the</b> <b>target’s</b> appearance.|$|R
5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be {{sensitive}} primarily in a single direction, {{the length of the}} blips depended on the position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see {{directly in front of the}} fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one on either side of the centreline.|$|E
5|$|Between December 18 and December 28, 1995—during {{which time}} Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times—342 images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> {{area in the}} chosen filters were taken. The total {{exposure}} times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300nm), 33.5 hours (450nm), 30.3 hours (606nm) and 34.3 hours (814nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by cosmic rays, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.|$|E

If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.

40|$|Abstract. The level set method (LSM) is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{methods used}} {{frequently}} to get <b>the</b> precise contours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> when <b>the</b> background is dynamic. In order {{to use the}} motion information and improve the processing efficiency, an adaptive level set method (ALSM) is proposed. In this approach, the particle filter algorithm is used to track <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> so we get the rough external contours and their centroids. Then the level set curve evolution is performed to get the precise external contours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets.</b> Lastly, <b>the</b> detection results are fed back to the tracking frame to revise the updating regions. The experiment {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm can adapt to <b>the</b> motion variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets,</b> and distinguish <b>the</b> <b>targets...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> this {{research}} is to add automatic target recognition (ATR) capabilities to existing passive radar systems. We do so by comparing the radar cross section (RCS) <b>of</b> detected <b>targets</b> to <b>the</b> precomputed RCS <b>of</b> known <b>targets</b> in <b>the</b> <b>target</b> class. <b>The</b> precomputed RCS <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> comprising <b>the</b> <b>target</b> class is modeled using a multi-step process involving {{programs such as the}} Fast Illinois Solver Code (FISC), Advanced Refractive E#ects Prediction System (AREPS), and Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC 2). A Rician likelihood model compares <b>the</b> power profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detected <b>target</b> to <b>the</b> precomputed power profiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> in <b>the</b> <b>target</b> class; this comparison results in target identification...|$|R
5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting the image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally {{designed so}} that individual nucleic acid strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with specification of a desired target structure or function. Then, the overall secondary structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand.|$|E

5|$|Noisy {{binary search}} {{algorithms}} solve {{the case where}} the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array.

Noisy binary search can find the correct position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. The noisy binary search problem can be considered as a case of the Rényi-Ulam game, which Alfréd Rényi introduced in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The attack {{followed}} a two-year lull in Allied aircraft carrier operations against Norway, {{and took the}} German forces by surprise. The choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> area was guided by intelligence gained from decoding German radio signals and reports from Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service agents, and two Norwegian airmen flew with the attack force to provide advice on the local geography. While historians have {{found it difficult to}} determine the exact number of ships sunk, Operation Leader damaged the German war effort by considerably disrupting the convoy system in the region and reducing shipments of iron ore.|$|E
