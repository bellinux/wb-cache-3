50|$|The <b>Tripod</b> <b>foundation</b> for <b>offshore</b> wind {{turbines}} represents a remarkable {{contribution to the}} beginning of the industrial utilisation of offshore wind energy in German waters. It was born within a creative nut shell of German offshore wind pioneers and it expanded its potential gaining further partners to a large multidisciplinary team realising the vision. The fact, that 126 turbines founded on top of Tripods are nowadays operational, is the result of a long lasting reliable collaboration of a number of stakeholders.|$|R
40|$|Regarding {{offshore}} constructions, {{there is}} still a lack in knowledge of scour progression for complex structures like foundations for offshore wind energy converters at present, which is however necessary for its dimensioning. As an example of such complex structure types, <b>Tripod</b> <b>foundations</b> are constructed in German offshore wind farms at present. In order to describe physical processes and influencing factors on scour progression from a scientific point of view, comprehensive investigations on the scouring phenomena for <b>Tripod</b> <b>foundations</b> have been carried out and will be partly presented here. The overall investigation method consists of a combination of 1 : 40 small and 1 : 12 large scale physical model tests in wave flumes, numerical simulations using CFD methods and in-situ measured scour data. For the numerical modeling part, a sediment transport model formulation has been implemented into OpenFOAM software code. The results show a general variability of scour depending on the load boundary conditions and structural parameters. Scours occur both at the foundation piles and directly under the structure, which in this form could not be predicted using standard approaches, but which has {{to be taken into account}} when regarding the soil mechanical stability and the final dimensioning of the foundations...|$|R
40|$|As a step {{to further}} develop {{the share of}} {{renewable}} energies, the first German offshore test site alpha ventus has been installed in the North Sea in 2009 in water depths of 30 m, where experience shall be gained and made available for future offshore wind farms. Regarding converter foundations in deep water, {{it is well known}} that in most cases scour phenomena occur around the structures. Due to the complexity of the <b>tripod</b> <b>foundations,</b> significant knowledge gaps in scour progression in general and especially in detail as well as its probable effects on the stability and durability are given. Therefore, investigations on scouring phenomena around complex foundation structures like the tripod are carried out within the research project. The investigation method consists of a unique combination of local scour monitoring as well as physical and numerical modeling, whereas the physical modeling part was carried by means of 1 : 40 laboratory tests and 1 : 12 large-scale physical model tests in wave flumes. The results show that scours around the <b>tripod</b> <b>foundation</b> do not only occur directly around the foundation piles, but also in the near-field of the structure. Compared to first in-situ measured scours in the test site, at least a good qualitative agreement of the modeled scour depths and evolutions could be shown...|$|R
50|$|Higher wind speeds with {{an average}} of 10 m/s and more full rated hours with up to 4.700h are the {{economic}} reasons to go offshore with wind turbines. Engineering, construction and installation of 1.000t wind turbine foundations was one of the upcoming disciplines within this new sector. The <b>Tripod</b> <b>foundation</b> is one representative of solutions found for this. The design is strictly guided by the functional requirements of a long lasting predominantly dynamic loaded structure in harsh environment. But the Tripod has been displaced by less detailed structures for capital expenditure reasons. The bigger the turbines and in water depth of 40m and more the cost disadvantage might be compensated, even when durability is also taken into account.|$|R
40|$|Marine lifting {{operations}} play a {{key role}} in the installation of turbines and bottom-fixed foundations. Offshroe installations of the bottom-fixed <b>foundations,</b> <b>tripod</b> <b>foundation</b> in this study, are costly and risky due to the challenging environmental conditons and the bulkiness of the object. It becomes more and more challenging due to the tendency to intall larger turbines in the sites further away from shoreline. To minimize the risks and better prepare the operations, careful study and analysis are essential. This thesis addresses numerical studies of the installation of <b>tripod</b> <b>foundations</b> using a heavy lift vessel (HLV). Both frequency and time-domain methods are applied in the study. Investigation is first carried out in the frequency domain using the response aptitude operators (RAOs) of the HLV. The wave induced rigid body motions of the vessel are calculated, represented by response spectrum and spectral moment. Thus, the vertical motion of the crane tip can be predicted, which is used as a criterion to find the limiting weather. As the frequency domain method is based on the simplification of linear response, detailed numerical modelling and simulation of the installation system have been carried out in time domain to analyse the coupled dynamic system. The predicted limiting weather using frequency domain method is firstly verified in time domain by running stationary simulations. It is found that the predicted limiting sea states are inaccurate. The calculated limiting (significant wave height) is underestimated with (spectral peak period of the wave) approaching the natural periods of the installation vessel. During the lifting operations, some potential critical events may be encountered, such as slack wire or re-hit, collision with the lifting vessel due to excessive motions of the tripod. To identify the potential risks, nonstationary simulations are conducted with emphasis on two lifting scenarios, the lift-off and the lowering phases. Moreover, comparative studies in response using two types of installation vessel, the HLV and the Jack-up, are investigated for the lowering process. Furthermore, sensitivity study on various hoisting speeds is also performed for the case onboard lift-off. It is found that the wire tension and response of the tripod using the jack-up are relatively smaller, during the lowering process in the selected sea states, than the case utilizing floating vessel. Especially for the lowering in air, huge difference exists between the two types of installation vessels and barely any tripod motion is induced for the jack-up case thanks to the great bottom-fixed stability. Compared to the onboard lift-off, it turns out that there would be much more challenges for the lift-off from barge. Under the considered wave condition, the onboard lift-off operation can be smoothly implemented while the operation from the barge experiences snap load and re-hit...|$|R
40|$|Offshore wind {{industry}} is developing very fast. Transport and installation are important aspects {{for reducing the}} life-cycle cost of offshorewind farms. In shallowwaters (10 - 30 mof water depths), monopile foundations have been widely used, while in deep waters (water depths > 50 m), it is beneficial to use jacket foundations which are transparent to the wave loads. For the water depths in between, the <b>tripod</b> <b>foundation</b> might be considered due to its simplicity as well as high stiffness. This thesis addresses the modelling and dynamic analysis one installation phase for tripods: the lowering into the sea. Due to non-stationarity, current numerical methods used for steadystate conditions are not applicable for simulating the lowering phase. In this thesis, timedomain simulations were performed {{to account for the}} responses of the coupled vessel-tripod system. A systematic methodology to assess the operational limits based on the installation procedure, numerical models and safety criteria was introduced. For the tripod lowering process, the allowable sea states were also established by using the methodology. These numerical models, methods and dynamic analysis form the basis for assessing the operational limits for the tripod lowering operation. The operational limits are necessary during the planning phase of the operation. The allowable sea states together with weather forecasts provide the basis for the decision making during the execution of the operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{economics}} of {{offshore wind energy}} are (currently) less favorable than for onshore wind energy {{and there is a}} strong need for significant cost reductions in order to become competitive with fossil fuel sources. As about 70 % part of the electricity cost is determined by the initial investment costs, we explored the ranges of possible cost reductions of offshore wind farms until 2020. The investment costs of offshore wind farms mainly consist of the wind turbine, the foundation, internal and external grid-connection and installation costs. For each of these components we analyzed technological developments and cost reduction trends in the offshore wind sector itself, but also in the onshore wind energy sector, the offshore oil and gas sector, and the high-voltage submarine transmission of electricity. Cost reduction trends where either quantified using the experience curve concept, or based on expert judgments. Main drivers for cost reduction appear to be design improvements and upscaling of wind turbines and the development and high utilization rates of purpose-built installation vessels. Other factors are the reduction of steel prices, technological development of HVDC converter stations, standardization of turbine and foundation design, and economies of scale for wind turbine and <b>tripod</b> <b>foundation</b> production. We conclude that under different growth scenarios investment costs of offshore wind farms may decline in the range of 25 - 40 % until 2020...|$|R
50|$|One {{result was}} the <b>Tripod</b> <b>foundation.</b> The first design was drawn by OWT - Offshore Wind Technology in Leer (Germany) in 2005. The Tripod was {{integrally}} designed with the tower from this early beginning. The three-legged structure reaches from the sea bed up to typically 20m above the sea water level, keeping the bolted flange on top safely apart from {{the crest of the}} waves. This section allows to be outfitted onshore with all functionalities needed in terms of boat landing, cable guiding and last but not least corrosion protection systems. The central column is designed as an open system allowing an unrestricted water exchange in each tide cycle. This circumstance is beneficial when the corrosion protection system has to be designed for the inner surfaces.The Tripod is fixed with midsized pin piles at the sea bed. The piles might be pre piled or post piled. A suction bucket foundation was designed as well. The first tower section, called S3, is foreseen to be mounted offshore on top of the Tripod with a bolted flange connection. This section contains the outer service platform and the entry door. This section is independently accessible for electrical equipment and cold commissioning procedures. Additionally it provides simply height, what can be saved on Tripod side. The height of a Tripod amounts already about 60m for 40m water depth.|$|R

40|$|While the {{offshore}} climate in the North Sea bears a {{great potential for}} the exploitation of reliable and powerful wind energy it poses a challenge for the constructors of offshore wind farms. Large heavy lift jack-up vessels (HLJV) are employed to transport {{the components of the}} wind energy converters to {{the offshore}} location. After a preloading and jacking procedure, subsea lifts of <b>tripod</b> <b>foundations</b> weighing up to 950 tons as well as tower and nacelle installations at large heights need to be undertaken. As typical offshore wind farms consist of 80 or more separate wind turbines the installation works are conducted in a serial manner- often through the winter season. Thus, many critical offshore operations are conducted consecutively on the basis of daily or weekly weather reports. These operations cannot rely on optimal weather conditions therefore planning and engineering has to cover appropriate wind and wave conditions taking into account contingencies for uncertainties in the reliability of weather windows {{as well as in the}} soil conditions. This paper shows how the weather criteria derived from numerical seakeeping and structural simulations are taken into a project simulation model covering 90 separate serial installations. Based on hindcast re-analyses installation simulations are conducted in multi-seasonal weather scenarios. This enables the quantification of the suitability of a particular marine spread and its associated installation processes in combination. The risk profile of weather related delays are derived...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{was a study}} into geotechnics and offshore renewable energy. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess and apply the geotechnicai requirements for the offshore siting of a range of renewable energy structures. The types of renewable energy that can be used offshore are wind energy, wave energy, ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) and energy from tidal streams. Two suites of geotechnicai data for independent locations were supplied by 'Thaies geosolutions'. Location one is composed mainly of sand, while location two is composed mainly of till. Geotechnicai analysis of the two locations shows them to be both strong and stable and suitable for all the different forms of renewable energy. For wind energy the most appropriate foundation type to use is the mono-pile, although gravity and <b>tripod</b> <b>foundations</b> can also be used. The mono-pile is the only viable foundation type for tidal stream turbines. The only existing technology for wave energy use at present is catenary mooring and anchoring. Tension leg moorings are an alternative option for wave energy devices but further research needs to be carried out. OTEC platforms can be used with a single point mooring system and anchor. The siting of each type of energy has been based solely on the geotechnics of the areas and not other governing factors such as wind speed or water depth. To do this would involve the construction of a much more comprehensive research study. This is an area of future research and a possible continuation for this work. Faculty of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of {{offshore wind energy}} in Europe, {{a large number of}} piled structures are being installed. In areas with sandy seabed conditions, erosion of sediment by the actions of wave and current can negatively influence foundation capacity. An accurate prediction model of scour around the piles is therefore required. Well-accepted scour prediction methods exist; both for the equilibrium scour depth and the time scale of scour [1] around single piles. These standard formulas have been combined with metocean data and a hindcasting model to calculate the expected scour depth around piles of wind turbine <b>tripod</b> <b>foundations.</b> Other causes of scour, such as pile-pile interaction, effect of proximity of structural members to the seabed, and seabed mobility were also assessed {{in order to determine the}} amount of global scour to be considered. The scour predictions were compared to measurements taken at an offshore wind turbine foundation at Park Alpha Ventus (PAV) in the German North Sea [2]. The data showed very good agreement with the measured scour around the piles. Both the equilibrium scour depth and time scale of scour were well predicted using the hindcasting model. The measured scour below the central column of the tripod structure exceeded expectations; this is believed to be due to a pumping effect during storm episodes. Finally, the effect of scour on the vertical effective stress around the tripod piles was assessed with a finite element model. Local scour had an important effect while scour below the centre of the structure had a much more limited effect. Considering the combined effects of multiple pile interaction, scour below the central column, and making an allowance for seabed mobility, an equivalent global scour depth for pile capacity calculations was established...|$|R
5000|$|The year 2010 {{marked the}} next {{milestone}} in rolling out the M5000 turbine with the <b>Tripod</b> <b>foundation.</b> The two projects Borkum West II and Global Tech I decided to erect their farms using this technology platform. 40 Tripods were ordered by each project in first instance nearly {{at the same}} time. Anticipating this demand WeserWind has developed a serial production approach for Tripods in the years before, together with Dr. Möller GmbH / IMS Nord, Bremerhaven. The key parameters of this approach are the upright assembly concept, the setup of an assembly line with up to nine work stations, the transportation of the growing structures on behalf of heavy load rail carriers along the assembly line and the integrated load out operation to a tailor made pontoon. Based on this concept Georgsmarienhütte released the investment program building this assembly shop with two parallel lines at Lunedeich, Bremerhaven. The building was operational {{in the beginning of}} 2011 and in June the first Borkum-West II-Tripod was completed. In December 2011 the pontoon was baptised and the offshore terminal ABC-Peninsula was commissioned by BLG Logistics Solutions GmbH & Co. KG after essential upgrading. Finally 100 Tripods have been built at this site in the years from 2011 to 2013. The cycle time for the whole plant was reached with down to five calendar days per structure. The load out cycle was achieved to four hours. Also SIAG Emden and the consortium Iemants N.V. with Eiffage Construction Métallique S.A.S. in Vlissingen produced in total 20 Tripods in that time in upright position. The offshore transportation technology has been developed significantly since Alpha Ventus. The Offshore Construction Jack Up “Innovation” by HGO InfraSea Solutions GmbH & Co. KG was commissioned in 2012 and did her first job for Global Tech 1 carrying three Tripods and pile sets per sail. The crane ships “Stanislaw Yudin” and “Oleg Strassnow” by SHL Seaway Heavy Lifting were in operation for Borkum West II.|$|R
40|$|A jacket, or template, {{structures}} {{are still the}} most common offshore structures used for drilling and production. Fixed jacket structures consist of tubular members interconnected to form a threedimensional space frame. Hence, the jacket structure can be categorized into a column structure. The D/t ratio of a typical member on the jacket structure has significant influence to buckling strength. Although only the axial load acts on the jacket legs, the local and global deformation of the structural member due to this load {{must be taken into}} account. This paper discusses the effect of D/t ratio on fixed jacket platform in the buckling strength analysis. A kind of fixed jacket <b>offshore</b> structure namely <b>tripod</b> is taken as the object of the analysis. Only the axial load is considered and it is applied to all jacket legs. The material and dimension of the structure are taken based on the structural member. Crack and corrosion are not considered in the analysis. To assess the buckling strength of the structure due to the effect of D/t ratio, the Finite Element Method (FEM) is performed. As a fundamental case, the buckling strength analysis is conducted on the structure by taking two dimensional planes (2 D) into consideration to obtain the critical buckling load due to the effect of D/t ratio for two dimensional plane. The result obtained by FEA is compared with the analytical solution...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to investigate the effects on tower dynamics when mounting a turbine on a monopile foundation offshore compared to a similar onshore installation. Changes in frequency, modeshapes and damping are investigated including effects of hydrodynamics and nonlinear soil properties. The tool used for the investigation is the new aeroelastic code HAWC 2, {{which is based on}} a multibody formulation. The multibody formulation used in the HAWC 2 code is very generally formulated which means that it can handle any structural object (body) as well as large rotations between the bodies and their associated nonlinear effects. This means e. g. that complex foundation types as very flexible monopile <b>foundations,</b> <b>tripod</b> structures and floating support structures can be simulated in the code. In the present investigation the monopile foundation will be considered. It is possible to apply non-linear springs and dampers on the structure, which are used for soil properties. In the hydrodynamic module of the code the hydrodynamic forces are calculated using Morisons equation. The investigations performed are based on time simulations of a typical 2 MW turbine during operation and standstill. Parameter variations are carried out to investigate the influence of wind speed, water depth, monopile length and diameter...|$|R
40|$|Several {{thousand}} planned {{wind turbine}} foundations will substantially {{increase the amount}} of habitat available for hard-bottom associated mobile demersal megafauna (MDM) in the German Bight (North Sea). To assess the effect of the large-scale habitat creation on MDM-stocks, the <b>foundations</b> (<b>tripods</b> and jackets) of the small-scale alpha ventus wind farm were systematically scrutinized by diving. Two years after construction, hard-bottom species already reached 100 fold higher abundances at the foundations than at autochthonous soft sediments. Large concentrations of pouting (Trisopterus luscus) and the Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) were detected at the foundations. The brown crab (Cancer pagurus) reached abundances of 2, 300 individuals at single foundations, whereas it reached only 29 individuals in the reference areas. The uppermost parts of the foundation structures were densely and exclusively colonised by young C. pagurus – they potentially function as nursery grounds. The stocks of predatory hard bottom species could multiply with the installation of numerous offshore wind farm foundations in the North Sea. The settlement of MDM at the foundations of wind farms should be considered when assessing offshore wind farm reef effects and possible environmental impacts. The effects of alpha ventus on pelagic fish were investigated by hydroacoustic surveys, by sampling with net catches and by fish stomach content analysis. A relative decline in abundance of pelagic fish in alpha ventus during the construction phase suggests scaring effects on fish caused by pile driving and other construction related activities. Stomach content analysis shows that hard substrate associated organisms were an insignificant food component of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and T. trachurus captured within the alpha ventus wind farm. Mackerels caught within the wind farm showed a significantly reduced degree of stomach fullness compared to mackerels caught outside the wind farm, suggesting disturbed food gathering behaviour or differences in food composition and distribution within the wind farm area. ...|$|R
