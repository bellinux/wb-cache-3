40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the provision of}} targeted health care to nuclear workers in Russia based on radiationepidemiological estimates of cancer risks. Cancer incidence rates are analyzed for the workers of the IPPE (the world’s first nuclear installation) who were subjected to individual <b>dosimetric</b> <b>monitoring</b> from 1950 to 2002. The value of the excess relative risk for solid cancers {{was found to be}} ERR/Gy= 0. 22 (95 % CI:- 4. 22; 7. 96). The derived ERR/Gy is about half of that derived for the LSS cohort (Hiroshima and Nagasaki). The difference can possibly be explained by the protracted character of radiation exposure for nuclear industry workers. It has been shown that 81. 8 % of the persons covered by individual <b>dosimetric</b> <b>monitoring</b> have a potential attributive risk up to 5 %, and the risk is more than 10 % for 3. 7 % of the workers. Among the detected cancer cases, 73. 5 % of the individuals show the attributive risk up to 5 % and the risk is in excess of 10 % for 3. 9 % of the workers. Principles for provision of targeted health care, given voluntary health insurance, are outlined...|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} dose {{delivered to the}} patient was determined, by modeling, for 257 types of examinations covering the different modalities of diagnostic and interventional radiology. The basic <b>operational</b> <b>dosimetric</b> quantities considered {{were obtained from the}} parameters of the examinations on the basis of dosimetric models. These models required a precise characterization of each examination. The <b>operational</b> <b>dosimetric</b> quantities were converted into doses to organs and {{effective dose}}s using appropriate conversion factors. The determination of the collective effective dose to the Swiss population requires a number of corrections to account for the variability of several parameters: sensitivity of the detection system, age, gender, and build of the patient. The use of various dosimetric models is illustrated in this paper for a limited number of examination types covering the different radiological modalities, for which the established typical effective doses are given. With regard to individual doses, the study indicated that the average effective doses per type of examination can be classified into three levels: (a) the weakly irradiating examinations (less than 0. 1 mSv), which represent 78 % of the examinations and 4 % of the collective dose, (b) the moderately irradiating examinations (between 0. 1 mSv and 10 mSv), which represent 21 % of the examinations and 72 % of the collective dose, (c) the strongly irradiating examinations (more than 10 mSv), which represent 1 % of the examinations and 24 % of the collective dose...|$|R
40|$|Background: Geothermal waters contain, {{among other}} components, soluble radon gas. Alpha {{radioactive}} radon is a health hazard to humans, {{especially when it}} gets into the respiratory tract. SPA facilities that use geothermal water can {{be a source of}} an increased radiation dose to people who stay there. Based on the available literature concerning radon concentrations, we assessed exposure to radon among people - workers and visitors of Spa centers that use geothermal waters. Material and Methods: Radon concentrations were analyzed in 17 geothermal centers: in Greece (3 centers), Iran (5), China (4) and India (5). Doses recived by people in the SPA were estimated using the formula that 1 hour exposure to 1 Bq/m 3 of radon concentration and equilibrium factor F = 0. 4 corresponds to an effective dose of 3. 2 nSv. Results: We have found that radon levels in SPAs are from a few to several times higher than those in confined spaces, where geothermal waters are not used (e. g., residential buildings). In 82 % of the analyzed SPAs, workers may receive doses above 1 mSv/year. According to the relevant Polish regulations, people receiving doses higher than 1 mSv/year are included in category B of radiation exposure and require regular <b>dosimetric</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Doses received by SPA visitors are much lower because the time of their exposure to radon released from geothermal water is rather short. Conclusions: The analysis of radon concentration in SPA facilities shows that the radiological protection of people working with geothermal waters plays an important role. It seems reasonable to include SPA workers staying close to geotermal waters into a <b>dosimetric</b> <b>monitoring</b> program. Med Pr 2013; 64 (2) : 193 – 19...|$|R
40|$|One {{group that}} has the {{potential}} to be exposed to radiation is workers in the nuclear industry. Results of a systematic medical follow-up and <b>dosimetric</b> <b>monitoring</b> of these workers can form the basis for a study of the relationship between cancer incidence and radiation dose. As part of such efforts in Russia, a major institution of the nuclear industry was selected with an established medical care unit, archiving capabilities and dosimetry department: the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering (IPPE) in Obninsk. In the study a comparative analysis of cancer incidence rates for the IPPE workers and for the general population of Russia in 1991 - 1997 was carried out. The subjects were the IPPE workers hired before 1981. This restriction was imposed to reduce the uncertainty associated with the possible latent period in the development of solid cancers. Thus the possibility of including persons who already had the disease at the time when they were hired was minimized. The analysis is based on information about 158 cancer cases, including 24 cancers in persons under individual <b>dosimetric</b> <b>monitoring.</b> A statistically significant excess in cancer incidence was found among the IPPE workers compared with a comparison population (the general population of Russia) for some types of cancers. The SIR values for all cancers (ICD- 9 : 140 - 208) is 0. 93 (0. 76, 1. 12 95 % CI) for males and 1. 42 (1. 06, 1. 87 95 % CI) for females. A statistically significant excess for all cancers was also observed for residents of Obninsk compared to the control comparison population. The corresponding SIR value was 1. 20 (1. 12, 1. 28 95 %CI) for males and 1. 58 (1. 49, 1. 69 95 % CI). An important reason for the observed excess in cancer incidence compared to the control population may be the higher level of health care in the socalle...|$|R
40|$|This {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the level of radiation exposure of traineeanaesthetists working in urology, orthopaedics and radiology environments. Anaesthetists worelithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) badges over a 6 -month period. The positionof badges was standardised at the collar site (TLD 1) and at waist level (TLD 2). Area specificdosimeters were used and exchanged between anaesthetists. Of a total of 723 procedures, anaesthetistswere exposed to radiation in 33 % of procedures in orthopaedics, 30 % in urology and 39 % inradiology. The mean (SD) exposure time to radiation per case was significantly greater in orthopaedicsthan in urology (9. 2 (4) min vs. 4. 2 (2) min). The radiation exposure per case was highest inradiology (19. 2 (22) min). The net combined exposure over a 6 -month period was 0. 2177 mSvin urology, 0. 4265 mSv in orthopaedics and 3. 8457 mSv in radiology.

40|$|The public {{expects that}} the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) will {{operate in a}} manner that {{prevents}} negative impacts to the environment and protects the safety and health of its employees and the public. To achieve this goal within budget, the Department of Energy (DOE) and LANL must develop new and improved environment, safety, and health (ES and H) technologies and implement innovative, more cost-effective ES and H approaches to operations. In FY 95, the Environment, Safety, and Health (ESH) Division initiated a Technology Development, Evaluation, and Application (TDEA) program. The purpose of this unique program is to test and develop technologies that solve LANL ES and H problems and improve the safety of LANL operations. This progress report presents the results of 10 projects funded in FY 97 by the TDEA Committee of the Environment, Safety, and Health Division. Products generated from the projects funded in FY 97 included implementation of radiation worker <b>dosimetric</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems (two); evaluation and validation of cost-effective animal-tracking systems for environmental studies (two); evaluation of personal protective equipment (two); and development of a method for optimal placement of continuous air monitors in the workplace...|$|R
40|$|Photodynamic {{therapy for}} the {{treatment}} of cancer relies on the presence of light, sensitizer and oxygen. By monitoring these three parameters during the treatment a better understanding and treatment control could possibly be achieved. Here we present data from in vivo treatments of solid skin tumors using an instrument for interstitial photodynamic therapy with integrated <b>dosimetric</b> <b>monitoring.</b> By using intra-tumoral ALA-administration and interstitial light delivery solid tumors are targeted. The same fibers are used for measuring the fluence rate at the treatment wavelength, the sensitizer fluorescence and the local blood oxygen saturation during the treatment. The data presented is based on 10 treatments in 8 patients with thick basal cell carcinomas. The fluence rate measurements at 635 nm indicate a major treatment induced absorption increase, leading to a limited light penetration at the treatment wavelength. This leads to a far from optimal treatment since the absorption increase prevents peripheral tumor regions from being fully treated. An interactive treatment has been implemented assisting the physician in delivering the correct light dose. The absorption increase can be compensated for by either prolonging the treatment time or increasing the output power of each individual treatment fiber. The other parameters of importance, i. e. the sensitizer fluorescence at 705 nm and the local blood oxygen saturation, are monitored in order to get an estimate of the amount of photobleaching and oxygen consumption. Based on the oxygen saturation signal, a fractionized irradiation can be introduced in order to allow for a re-oxygenation of the tissu...|$|R
40|$|As {{of today}} {{it does not}} seem {{possible}} to assess objectively the causality between cancer diseases and professional exposure using clinical evidence only. The medical-dosimetric registries can do little to reveal statistically significant effects in the low dose range and do not provide unambiguous recommendations as to quantifying occurrence of malignant neoplasms in case of protracted exposure. The remaining option is to use the accumulated experience of large-scale epidemiological studies and existing recommendations for probabilistic assessment of possible occurrence of malignant neoplasms associated with professional activity for a given individual with allowance for his personal characteristics. In the paper thse personnel of the Leningrad NPP that were under individual <b>dosimetric</b> <b>monitoring</b> is were grouped with respect to potential risk. The projection methodology recommended by UNSCEAR- 94 is used. The source information is personalized data allowing for sex, age and year-by-year dynamics of dose accumulation. A total of 5086 males are considered, their average accumulated dose being 74 mSv. Since the large-scale epidemiological studies have not revealed radiation induction of cancer diseases in the low dose range, in the first stage the cohort of the Leningrad NPP workers with accumulated radiation doses more than 200 mSv was selected. For 289 persons who received accumulated doses more than 200 mSv (5. 6 % of the whole staff) the following distribution is derived: 138 workers had the attributive risk ranging from 5 % to 10 %, 7 workers- from 10 % to 15 %. The derived distribution {{can be used as a}} basis for administrative decision making. The proposed methodology for assessing individual potential risk o...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAimTo {{study the}} {{influence}} of segment width on plan quality for volumetric modulated arc based stereotactic body radiotherapy. BackgroundThe redundancy of modulation for regularly shaped small volume tumors results in creation of many small segments and an increase of monitor units, with a consequent prolongation of treatment and uncertainty in treatment delivery. Materials and methodsSix cases each in lung, abdomen and liver were taken for the study. For each case, three VMAT SBRT plans were generated with different penalties on minimum segment width of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 cm. A comparison was made on the metrics of dose volume histogram, <b>dosimetric</b> indices, <b>monitor</b> units (MUs) and delivery accuracy. ResultsThe mean reduction of total MUs when compared with 0. 5 cm plan was observed as 12. 7 ± 6. 0 % and 17. 5 ± 7. 2 % for 1. 0 cm and 1. 5 cm of minimum segment width, respectively. The p value showed a significant degradation in dosimetric indices for 1. 5 cm plans when compared with 0. 5 cm and 1. 0 cm plans. The average deviation of measured dose with TPS calculated was 3. 0 ± 1. 1 %, 2. 1 ± 0. 84 % and 1. 8 ± 0. 9 % for 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 cm, respectively. The calculated gamma index with pass criteria of 2 % dose difference and 2 mm distance to agreement was 95. 9 ± 2. 8 %, 96. 5 ± 2. 6 % and 97. 8 ± 1. 6 % as calculated for 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 cm of penalties, respectively. In view of the trade off between delivery efficiency and plan quality, 1 cm minimum segment width plans showed an improvement. ConclusionsVMAT SBRT plans with increased optimal value of minimum segment width showed better plan quality and delivery efficiency for stereotactic body radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose: We {{propose a}} process of quality {{assurance}} to validate and implement the single isocenter technique for breast cancer radiotherapy. We evaluated the dosimetric and temporal gains using the single isocenter technique compared to classic source to skin distance (SSD) technique. Methods: 6 patients of breast cancer localization were studied. For each patient 2 treatment plans were generated. In plan 1 the dose was calculated using SSD technique. In plan 2 the dose was calculated using single isocenter technique. To implement the plan 2 a <b>dosimetric</b> analysis including <b>monitor</b> units (MU), isodose curves, cumulative and differential dose volume histograms cDVH, dDVH respectively, coverage index, conformity index for planning target volume were used. The measurements using a PMMA phantom consist of measuring point dose by an ionization chamber and 2 D dose distributions using 2 D diodes arrays. Wilcoxon signed rank and Spearman’s tests were used to calculate p-value and correlation coefficient, respectively. Results: The single isocenter technique reduced the MU by average on - 30. 1 ± 13. 6 %, (p = 0. 03). We observed an improvement with statistical significance between the two techniques for the mean dose, minimum dose and volume receiving 95 % of the prescribed dose without over-dosage. The analysis for dDVH showed that the dose distribution in the target volume calculated in the single isocenter technique is more homogeneous than the SSD technique. Wilcoxon test showed that the two treatment plans had the same quality (p > 0. 05). The difference between calculated and measured dose was within 2. 4 ± 3. 3 % for absolute point dose {{and the percentage of}} points passing gamma criteria was on average 99. 8 ± 0. 2 %. Conclusion: This method provides a quantitative evaluation and comparison of the two irradiation techniques for breast cancer and the consequences of the technical change on dose calculation...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is {{a popular}} imaging {{modality}} due to its ability to provide excellent soft tissue contrast without exposure to ionizing radiation. It {{can be used for}} temperature monitoring (thermometry) as well as for assessing the biochemistry in vivo (MRS). This dissertation focuses separately on the development, application and quantitation issues of these two aspects of MRI. ^ Radiofrequency (RF) -induced tissue heating is a concern in MRI. The <b>dosimetric</b> quantity for <b>monitoring</b> RF heating is the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) defined as the RF power absorbed per unit mass of tissue. A novel approach for imaging SAR from absolute temperature images obtained using a paramagnetic lanthanide complex-Thulium 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane- 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetrakis (methylene phosphonate) (TmDOTP 5 -) was developed. The effects of a bare-ended, insulated conductor in a phantom were investigated by 3 D SAR imaging. 3 D SAR maps were also generated using a high SAR sequence while varying the pulse duration. The high spatial resolution SAR maps correctly identified the local SAR rise near the wire end and also revealed increasing SAR with increasing pulse duration in the high SAR sequence, as expected. These results demonstrate the potential of MR thermometry with paramagnetic lanthanide complexes for evaluating safety of implants, medical devices as well as different pulse sequences. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the technique of measuring in vivo levels of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) using MRS. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain which is involved in the control of fine movement and balance. GABA MRS with spectral editing was performed and GABA was quantified using custom fitting parameters in the tool LCModel to measure changes in movement disorders - particularly Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD) and sleep bruxism. Higher levels of thalamic GABA were detected in PD with correlation to disease severity indicating the possibility to use GABA MRS as a biomarker for PD progression. On the other hand, in the bruxers, lower levels of GABA correlating with higher levels of glutamate in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex were detected indicating disturbances in the GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways. ^ Lastly, since GABA quantification is a much discussed topic in literature with no one, clear and best approach, an effort was made to compare some popular fitting approaches in LCModel. Semi-synthetic simulated GABA spectra were used to test the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of methods, all of which handled the baseline and macromolecules in the GABA spectra differently. Overall, the approaches using a fully flexible baseline ranked best in the tested aspects. ...|$|R
