5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based {{on the degree of}} separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which the tips of the arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> L.mokusin, and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E

25|$|Despite renewed {{division}} after a {{short time}} of reunification, Bavaria gained new heights of power with Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, who became the first Wittelsbach emperor in 1328. The newly gained areas of Brandenburg (1323), Tyrol (1342), the Dutch provinces Holland, Zeeland and Friesland and the Hainaut (1345) were, however, lost under his successors. In 1369, Tyrol fell through the Treaty of Schärding to the Habsburgs. The Luxemburgish rider followed in 1373 and the Dutch counties fell to Burgundy in 1436. In the 1329 Treaty of Pavia, Emperor Louis divided ownership in a Palatine region, with the Rhine Palatinate, and a later so-called Upper Palatinate. Thus, the electoral dignity for the line onwards to the Palatinate was also lost. With the recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> domination by the Bavarian Duke in the year 1275, Salzburg of Bavaria went into their final phase. When the Salzburg Archbishop issued its own country regulations in 1328, Salzburg become a largely independent state within the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

25|$|One {{practice}} session lasting {{half an hour}} was held on Thursday before the two races. Leimer for Racing Engineering set a benchmark which was the fastest time in the sole {{practice session}}—held in variable weather conditions and warm track temperatures—with a lap of one minute and 41.361 seconds on the hard compound tyres, one second faster than any one else on the track. His closest challenger was Sam Bird in second in front of third-placed Coletti and Rossi in fourth position. Marcus Ericsson was fifth-fastest, ahead of Nasr. Calado was seventh-fastest, Tom Dillmann eighth, Johnny Cecotto Jr. ninth and Daniel Abt completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Frijns spun early on but recovered without needing external assistance. Smoke bellowed out of Cecotto's car while driving at high-speed and later locked his tyres at the first corner before overshooting into the sand. Julián Leal stalled at the exit of the pit lane and {{this led to a}} stewards investigation over whether his team's mechanics restarted the car outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the pit lane.

25|$|Karl Popper {{tried to}} {{establish}} a criterion of demarcation between science and metaphysics, but the speculative turn taken by certain developments in theoretical physics has contributed to muddle the issue again. Mosterín has been concerned {{with the question of}} the reliability of theories and claims. He makes a distinction between the standard core of a scientific discipline, that at a certain point in time should only include relatively reliable and empirically supported ideas, and the cloud of speculative hypotheses surrounding it. Part of the theoretical progress consists in the incorporation of newly tested hypotheses of the cloud to the standard core. In this connection, he has analyzed epistemic notions like detection and observation. Observation, but not detection, is accompanied by awareness. Detection is always mediated by technological instruments, but observation only sometimes (like glasses in vision). The signals received by detectors have to be transduced into types of energy accessible to our senses. Following the path open by Patrick Suppes, Mosterín has paid much attention to the structure of metric concepts, because of their indispensable mediating role at the interface between theory and observation where reliability is tested. He has also made contributions to the study of mathematical modeling and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the axiomatic method in the characterization of real-world structures. The real world is extremely complex, and sometimes {{the best we can do}} is to apply the method of theoretical science: to pick up in the set-theoretical universe a mathematical structure with some formal similarities with the situation we are interested in, and use it as a model of that parcel of the world. Together with Roberto Torretti, Mosterín has written a uniquely comprehensive encyclopedic dictionary of logic and philosophy of science.|$|E

Rutherford baulked at the price tag, but a £250,000 gift from Lord Austin enabled a [...] cyclotron, based on Lawrence's design, to be built, along with a new wing to house it. Cockcroft supervised the work. The cyclotron was in operation by October 1938, and the new wing was completed in 1940. Oliphant felt that the cyclotron was not big enough, and commenced construction of a larger 60-inch cyclotron at the University of Birmingham. Its construction was delayed by the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe in 1939, and it too would be obsolescent when it was completed after the war.|$|E
