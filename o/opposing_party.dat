5|$|The Romualdez clan {{was torn}} apart by the presidential campaign. To fix this, Imelda {{allegedly}} sent out invitations to family members, some of whom supported the <b>opposing</b> <b>party,</b> and told them they were all welcome at their house in Ortega.|$|E
5|$|The barons did {{not find}} a {{compromise}} candidate to succeed King Louis II who perished {{in the battle of}} Mohács in 1526. First the voivode, John Szapolyai was proclaimed king by a group of nobles, but the <b>opposing</b> <b>party</b> also elected its own king, Ferdinand I, a scion of the Habsburg family, {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|That same year, in {{the general}} {{elections}} held in November, Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and <b>opposing</b> <b>party</b> rival Rafael Hernández Colón (PPD). It is widely accepted that Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case, since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed, and since his political rivals used his defense of the officers {{as an indication of}} a possible conspiracy.|$|E

5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the <b>opposing</b> <b>party</b> is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing {{what was going on in}} the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that the Junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the <b>opposing</b> <b>party</b> won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{contributions}} of Venizelos to Greek political life was the creation, in 1910, of the Liberal Party, which contrasted with the Greek parties of that period. Until the early twentieth century, the Greek parties were inspired by the protecting powers (French or English Party for example) or clustered around a political personality, such as Charilaos Trikoupis. The Liberal Party was based around the ideas of Venizelos (and the military coup of Goudi), but it survived its creator. In addition, {{the birth of a}} leading party would coincide with the birth of an <b>opposing</b> <b>party.</b> The <b>opposing</b> <b>party</b> was reflected around the personality of the king, but that survived the various abolitions of the monarchy. Venizelism, from its inception, is essentially a liberal Republican movement, which opposes anti-venizelist monarchist and conservative ideologies. These two competed for power throughout the inter-war period.|$|E
25|$|Rhee regained {{control of}} {{parliament}} in the 1954 elections, and thereupon pushed through {{an amendment to}} exempt himself from the eight-year term limit, and was once again re-elected in 1956.

25|$|Just a {{week before}} the presidential {{election}} date, the <b>opposing</b> <b>party</b> alleged that the public servants from National Intelligence Service (NIS) have organized to promote Park's election campaign by way of posting online articles favorable to Park and slanderous to the opposing candidates. This political behavior by public servants is strictly prohibited by Korean Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that night}} of the presidential debate, Kim Yong-pan, then the chief of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, {{publicly}} announced {{there was no evidence}} of illegal online postings from the collected laptop of the female agent. This announcement, which took place three days before the election, was believed to have significantly affected the outcome of the presidential election according to the <b>opposing</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} was in large respect {{the same as}} the rolprocedure in first instance, except for the following differences: firstly, not only the other party was summoned, but also the judges who had made the decree or verdict of which appeal (the reason for this was that the judges could be asked to explain their reasoning). The latter were called geintihimeerden, but this term was often also (incorrectly) used for the <b>opposing</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{played a}} {{significant}} role in Adolf Hitler's rise to power in the 1920s and 1930s. Their primary purposes were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, disrupting the meetings of <b>opposing</b> <b>parties,</b> fighting against the paramilitary units of the <b>opposing</b> <b>parties,</b> especially the Red Front Fighters League (Rotfrontkämpferbund) of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), and intimidating Slavic and Romani citizens, unionists, and Jews - for instance, during the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses.|$|R

As it happened, in the fulness of time our {{distinguished}} apostles of Efficiency came into supreme power, with {{a share in the}} finest field for efficient diplomacy and an armed struggle, that could have been imagined. Unhappily they broke down, or thought they had (1915), and could discover no better way out of their scrape than to seek deliverance (not without a trace of arbitrary proscription) from the <b>opposing</b> <b>party</b> that counted Liberalism, old or new, for dangerous and deluding moonshine.|$|E
25|$|Acevedo Vilá {{was finally}} sworn as Governor on 2 January 2005. During his term, he faced many {{political}} challenges, {{due to the}} fact that the main <b>opposing</b> <b>party,</b> New Progressive Party (NPP) gained control of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico, the Resident Commissioner in Congress (Luis Fortuño), and Acevedo Vilá's main political rival, Pedro Rosselló (former Governor or Puerto Rico who had just lost the election against Acevedo), managed to gain a seat in the Senate of Puerto Rico after a young first-term Senator from Arecibo unexpectedly resigned shortly after taking the oath of office, and unsuccessfully attempted to topple Senate President Kenneth McClintock.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2015 {{electoral reform}} {{intended}} to address disproportion in voter representation, Aoki's Shimane district was {{merged with the}} neighbouring Tottori at-large district to create the Tottori-Shimane at-large district. Tottori was represented by Kazuyuki Hamada, who was elected in 2010 as an LDP candidate but defected to an <b>opposing</b> <b>party</b> a year later. As the only incumbent LDP member in the new district, Aoki received the party's nomination to contest the newly merged district at the July 2016 election and an endorsement from Komeito, the LDP's junior coalition partner. In the election Aoki received 62.7% of the vote to defeat Hirohiko Fukushima, a nominally independent candidate who was jointly endorsed by the main opposition parties.|$|E

500|$|Randall's {{positions}} {{on tariffs and}} pensions had made him, according to The New York Times, [...] "a practical Republican" [...] by 1888. Voting with the <b>opposing</b> <b>party</b> so frequently was an effective tactic, as he faced only token Republican opposition for reelection that year. Randall's health continued to decline. When the new congress began in 1889, he received special permission to be sworn into office from his bed, where he was confined. The new Speaker, Republican Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine, appointed Randall to the Rules and Appropriations committees, {{but he had no}} impact during that term.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, PedroII worked to prevent quarrels between the {{national}} political parties from impairing the military response. The Emperor prevailed over a serious political crisis in July 1868 resulting from a quarrel between the cabinet and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then-Marques and later Duke of Caxias), the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian forces in Paraguay. Caxias was also a politician {{and was a member}} of the <b>opposing</b> <b>party</b> to the ministry. [...] The Emperor sided with him, leading to the cabinet's resignation. As PedroII maneuvered to bring about a victorious outcome in the conflict with Paraguay, he threw his support behind the political parties and factions that seemed to be most useful in the effort. The reputation of the monarchy was harmed and its trusted position as an impartial mediator was severely impacted in the long term. He was unconcerned for his personal position, and regardless of the impact upon the imperial system, he determined to put the national interest ahead of any potential harm caused by such expediencies.|$|E
