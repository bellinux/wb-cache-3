40|$|Recent {{research}} shows that <b>orthogonal</b> <b>array</b> based crossovers outperform standard and existing crossovers in evolutionary algorithms in solving parametrical problems with high dimensions and multi-optima. However those crossovers employed so far, ignore the consideration of interactions between genes. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the existing <b>orthogonal</b> <b>array</b> based crossovers by integrating information of interactions between genes. It is empirically shown that the proposed <b>orthogonal</b> <b>array</b> based crossover outperforms significantly both the existing <b>orthogonal</b> <b>array</b> based crossovers and standard crossovers on solving parametrical benchmark functions that interactions exist between variables. To further compare the proposed <b>orthogonal</b> <b>array</b> based crossover with the existing crossovers in evolutionary algorithms, a validation test based on car door design is used in which {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed <b>orthogonal</b> <b>array</b> based crossover is studied...|$|R
