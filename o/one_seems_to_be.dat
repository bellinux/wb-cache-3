2500|$|One {{theory of}} déjà vu {{attributes}} {{the feeling of}} having previously seen or experienced something that is currently being seen or experienced to that of having dreamt about a similar situation or place and then forgetting about it until <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake. The spontaneity {{of these types of}} déjà vu [...] "moments" [...] can catch many people off-guard, especially when they get the sensation from visiting a specific place they have never been to before, {{to the point where they}} are in a temporary state of shock and disbelief.|$|E
60|$|The wizard looked round quickly, but no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{thinking}} of him.|$|R
6000|$|Every <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{waiting for}} him to speak. Awkwardly he said, {{wondering}} all the while if she meant what her tone said she meant, by [...] "bad influences": ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{much the}} worse," [...] Granet replied. [...] "I didn't think of {{anything}} of that sort in connection with Collins, though. Perhaps he might have got hurt." ...|$|R
2500|$|A strong {{supporter}} of the Romantic painter Delacroix, Baudelaire called him [...] "a poet in painting". Baudelaire also absorbed much of Delacroix's aesthetic ideas as expressed in his journals. As Baudelaire elaborated in his [...] "Salon of 1846", [...] "As one contemplates his series of pictures, <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attending the celebration of some grievous mystery.... This grave and lofty melancholy shines with a dull light ... plaintive and profound like a melody by Weber." [...] Delacroix, though appreciative, kept his distance from Baudelaire, particularly after the scandal of Les Fleurs du mal. In private correspondence, Delacroix stated that Baudelaire [...] "really gets on my nerves" [...] and he expressed his unhappiness with Baudelaire's persistent comments about [...] "melancholy" [...] and [...] "feverishness".|$|E
2500|$|Manichaean {{also was}} her lifelong {{struggle}} with the very {{question of how to}} deal with dualisms. At times she appears to favor the merging of opposites, for which Byzantium served as a model: [...] "church and state, love and violence, life and death, were to be fused again as in Byzantium." [...] More dominant, however, was her tendency to view the tensions generated in the space between dualistic terms as life-sustaining and creative; hence, her aversion to homosexuality and her warning not to confuse the drive for feminist emancipation with the woman's desire to become like a man. Her insistence on the fundamental difference between men and women reveals her essentialism, but it also bespeaks her innate Manichaean sensibility. She wanted respect and equal rights for women, {{but at the same time}} she required that women retain their specifically feminine qualities, notably an affinity with the life force: [...] "Men have a disposition to violence; women have not. If one says that men are on the side of death, women on the side of life, <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> making an accusation against men. One is not doing that." [...] One reason why she does not want to make an accusation against men is that they are simply playing their assigned role in a flawed universe, which is, of course, the result of an imperfect deity. Only love can alleviate destructive aspects of the sex-antagonism: [...] "I loathe the way the two cancers of sadism and masochism eat into the sexual life of humanity, so that the one lifts the lash and the other offers blood to the blow, and both are drunken with the beastly pleasure of misery and do not proceed with love's business of building a shelter from the cruelty of the universe." [...] In addition to the operations of love, female emancipation is crucial to removing the moral, professional, and social stigma associated with the notion of the [...] "weaker sex," [...] without trying to do away altogether with the temperamental and metaphysical aspects of the gender dualism itself. Thus, the [...] "sex war" [...] described in West's early short story [...] "Indissoluble Matrimony" [...] (1914) elevates the female character, Evadne, in the end because she accepts the terms of the contest without superficially trying to [...] "win" [...] that war.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see {{no reason}} why eloquence should not be taught by mail. <b>One</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to acquire every other {{desirable}} quality in that manner nowadays." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} Queen, like her people, had got a severe fright; but, seeing that no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hurt, she {{controlled}} her feelings, under the impression, no doubt, that the explosion {{was part of}} the programme.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} there was a dead silence. In the {{background}} several of the maîtres d'hôtel had gathered obsequiously around. For some reason or other, every <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> looking at Norgate {{as though he were}} a criminal.|$|R
5000|$|Ashley Dominique of Geeked Out Nation gave a C+ rating to {{the episode}} saying: [...] "No <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{looking for the}} truth or working {{together}} to piece all the information they had on a clear picture about the travelers and Marcos' intentions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A man's back {{should be}} broad enough to bear all that for himself," [...] said Harry. [...] "I get ashamed of myself when I grumble, and yet <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> surly if one doesn't say what one's thinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{thinks of}} that girl," [...] {{he said to}} himself; [...] "she thinks of the Viola children; she thinks of me; of the wounded; of the miners; she always thinks of {{everybody}} who is poor and miserable! But what will she do if Charles gets {{the worst of it}} in this infernal scrimmage those confounded Avellanos have drawn him into? No <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thinking of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know I am not unsympathetic {{with your}} views, Lady Jane," [...] he said, a little awkwardly, [...] "but I don't mind admitting that if I {{had a big}} stake in the country I should be afraid of Tallente. No <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to pin him down to a {{definite}} programme and yet day by day his influence grows. The Labour Party is disintegrated. The best of all its factions are joining the Democrats. He is practically leader of the Opposition Party to-day and I don't see how {{they are going to}} stop his being Prime Minister whenever he chooses." ...|$|E
60|$|Swiftly but {{safely to}} the foot of the hill went John Barret (that was the youth's name), at {{ever-increasing}} speed, and without check; for no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moving about in the quiet hamlet, and the old English inn had apparently fallen asleep.|$|R
60|$|They {{visited the}} nest {{of the baby}} goldfinches, and found the Widow Chaffinch still caring for the orphans in her motherly way. The little <b>ones</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as hungry as ever, but the widow assured the lark-children that all five had just been fed.|$|R
60|$|The Compound crawled {{across the}} tracks {{on a long}} slant, groaning horribly at each switch, and moving like a cow in a snow-drift. There was a little pause along the yard after her tail-lights had disappeared; {{switches}} locked crisply, and every <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> waiting.|$|R
6000|$|Philadelphia.--An old place, full of Dutch women, in [...] "bellus top" [...] bonnets, selling vegetables, in long, open markets. Every <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{scrubbing}} {{their white}} steps. All the houses look like tidy jails, with their outside shutters. Several have crape on the door-handles, {{and many have}} flags flying from roof or balcony. Few men appear, and the women seem to do the business, which, perhaps, accounts for its being so well done. Pass fine buildings, but don't know what they are. Would like to stop and see my native city; for, having left it {{at the tender age}} of two, my recollections are not vivid.|$|E
60|$|Step by step we scale {{this mysterious}} ladder: the steps are actions; the new {{prospect}} is power. Every several result is threatened and judged by that which follows. Every <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> contradicted by the new; {{it is only}} limited by the new. The new statement is always hated by the old, and, to those dwelling in the old, comes like an abyss of scepticism. But the eye soon gets wonted to it, for the eye and it are effects of one cause; then its innocency and benefit appear, and presently, all its energy spent, it pales and dwindles before the revelation of the new hour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! Never judge men {{by their}} looks," [...] {{returned}} Bevan--"specially in the diggin's. They're all blackguards or fools, more or less. This <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one o' the fools. I've seed sitch critters before. They keep fillin' their little boxes wi' grass an' stuff; an' never makes any {{use of it}} that I could see. But every man to his taste. I'll be bound he's a good enough feller when ye come to know him, an' git over yer contempt for his idle ways. Very likely he draws, too--an' plays the flute; most o' these furriners do. Come now, Flinders, look alive wi' the grub." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What shall I do?" [...] the boy asked himself, {{and gazed}} hurriedly at the surroundings. To {{one side of}} the road were several nipa huts, to the other a long, {{rambling}} warehouse. The doorways of all the buildings stood open, and no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in sight.|$|R
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> around. He {{entered a}} street between {{two rows of}} houses, the hoofs of his two horses {{sounding}} loudly in the silence. He was {{in some kind of}} town. But there were no dogs or children. Everything was neat and silent. Like a model. An exhibit. It made him uncomfortable.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>are</b> {{two ways}} <b>to</b> assess measurement: only <b>one</b> way <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> listed ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Press Association have cabled to America, but no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to {{make out}} exactly who the fellow is. His letter to {{the captain of the}} steamer was from the {{chairman}} of the company, and his introduction to the manager of the London and North Western Railway Company was from the greatest railway man in the world. Mr. Hamilton Fynes must have been a person who had a pretty considerable pull over there. Curiously enough, though, only the name of the man was mentioned in them; nothing about his business, or what he was doing over on this side. He was simply alluded to as 'Mr. Hamilton Fynes--the gentleman bearing this communication.' I expect, after all, that you know more about him than any one." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Fielding {{cannot be}} kept in prison long. His noble English, his sonorous voice must be heard. There is {{somewhat}} inexpressibly heartening, to me, {{in the style of}} Fielding. <b>One</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried along, like a swimmer in a strong, clear stream, trusting one's self to every whirl and eddy, with a feeling of safety, of comfort, of delightful ease in the motion of the elastic water. He is a scholar, nay more, as Adams had his innocent vanity, Fielding has his innocent pedantry. He likes to quote Greek (fancy quoting Greek in a novel of to-day!) and to make the rogues of printers set it up correctly. He likes to air his ideas on Homer, to bring in a piece of Aristotle--not hackneyed--to show you that if he is writing about [...] "characters and situations so wretchedly low and dirty," [...] he is yet a student and a critic.|$|E
60|$|The {{door opens}} softly. Newte steals in. He fumbles {{his way across}} to the windows, draws the blinds. The morning sun streams in. He listens--no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stirring. He goes out, returns {{immediately}} with a butler's tray, containing all things necessary for a breakfast and the lighting of a fire. He places the tray on table, throws his coat over a chair, and is on his knees busy lighting the fire, when enter the Misses Wetherell, clad in dressing-gowns and caps: yet still they continue to look sweet. They also creep in, hand in hand. The crouching Newte is hidden by a hanging fire- screen. They creep forward till the coat hanging over the chair catches their eye. They are staring at it as Robinson Crusoe might at the footprint, when Newte rises suddenly and turns. The Misses Wetherell give a suppressed scream, and are preparing for flight.|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{crowd of}} such men around the land-office tents and many filings were made. Nearly every man had his little phial of gold to show. No one was loud, but every <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quietly {{confident}} and replied to my questions in a low voice, [...] "Well, you can safely say the country is all right." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{sought the}} barn. It was a low, {{rambling}} structure, with great wide doors. No <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> around, and I rushed in without ceremony. I was pretty fairly soaked, {{but as it}} was warm I did not mind the ducking. I shook out my hat and coat and then sat down to think matters over.|$|R
40|$|Eight {{patients}} with leptospirosis were studied with colloidal gold 1 9 8 Au. The radiocolloidal hepatic distribution was altered, presenting a non-homogeneous tiver concentration in seven cases, and {{a minute to}} moderate splenic visualization in five. Two patients presented doubtful splenic image, and <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> normal. Liver scanning with colloidal gold 1 9 8 Au <b>is</b> demonstra ted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a good liver function test...|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear of him," [...] {{returned}} the merchant. [...] "If he is visiting the hermit of Rakata, as you tell me, he'll be safe enough. Although {{something of a}} dare-devil, the hermit knows {{how to take care}} of himself. I'm afraid, however, that you'll not find it so easy to `look up' your son as you seem to think. Just glance round at these almost impenetrable forests. You don't know what part of the island he may be in just now; and you might as well look for a needle in a bundle of hay as look for him there. He is probably at the other end of Krakatoa--four or five miles off--on the South side of Rakata, where the hermit's cave is supposed to be, for no <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite sure as to its whereabouts. Besides, you'll have to stick by the excursionists if you wish to return to Batavia." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{the continual}} prayer and {{effort of the}} Christian {{minister}} everywhere, that God would deepen in his own heart the sense of sin, and create it {{in the mind of}} the heathen. And then the imperfect medium of a language very far from thoroughly known! It is by continual prayer, the intercession of Christ, the power of the Spirit (we well know) that the work must be carried on. How one does understand it! The darkness seems so thick, the present visible world so wholly engrosses the thoughts, and yet, you see, there are many signs of progress even here, in changed habits to some extent, in the case of our scholars, real grounds of hope for the future. <b>One</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing nothing, yet surely if no change be wrought, what right have we to expect it. It is not that I looked for results, but that I seek to be taught how to teach better. The Collect for the first Sunday after Epiphany is wonderful.|$|E
6000|$|Only Mr. C. R. W. Nevinson {{could do}} justice to the {{interior}} of a Tank. You see a hand gripping something; you see the eyes and forehead of an engineer's face; you perceive that an overall bluishness beyond the engine is the back of another man. [...] "Don't hold that," [...] says someone; [...] "it is too hot. Hold on to that." [...] The engines roar, so loudly that I doubt whether one could hear guns without; the floor begins to slope and slopes until <b>one</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at forty-five degrees or thereabouts; then the whole concern swings up and sways and slants the other way. You have crossed a bank. You heel sideways. Through the door which has been left open you see the little group of engineers, staff officers and naval men receding and falling away behind you. You straighten up and go up hill. You halt and begin to rotate. Through the open door, the green field, with its red walls, rows of worksheds and forests of chimneys in the background, begins a steady processional movement. The group of engineers and officers and naval men appears at {{the other side of the}} door and farther off. Then comes a sprint down hill. You descend and stretch your legs.|$|E
3000|$|Giorgi (2015) {{argues that}} a focused phrase <b>is</b> {{internal}} <b>to</b> the sentence and represented syntactically presumably in the left periphery, as proposed by Rizzi (1997). A CLLD on the contrary, is totally external, and is much more similar to a parenthetical construction.

60|$|We were {{in perfect}} {{darkness}} and no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stirring in the house, although the mat under our feet, {{in some way}} connected with an electric alarm bell, was giving shrill notice of our arrival. Then we heard swift feet approaching and a tall, hard-featured woman in a plain black gown, and holding a lamp high over her head, appeared before us.|$|R
60|$|These {{arrangements}} took us {{a couple}} of days or so. On the third we started, without seeing you, my friend, or any one else that I knew, since just at that time every <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> away from Pretoria. You, I remember, had by now become the Master of the High Court and were, they informed me at your office, absent on circuit.|$|R
