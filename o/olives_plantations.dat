40|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>plantation</b> systems {{occur in}} a wide variety {{throughout}} the Mediterranean, especially in sloping and mountainous areas. Recent drivers of change, including the widespread introduction of mechanisation, increased use of (chemical) inputs and (drip) irrigation have considerably added to this diversity. The various systems have very different resource use patterns and environmental and social performances. This article attempts to grasp these differences and to link systems characteristics to options for natural resources management in the spirit of contemporary agricultural policies that seek to promote a more sustainable agriculture. Cluster analysis was employed to classify 28 <b>olive</b> <b>plantation</b> systems distinguished by regional typologies developed for six study areas: Tras-os-Montes (Portugal), Cordoba and Granada/Jaen (both in Spain), Haffouz (Tunisia), Basilicata/Salerno (Italy) and West-Crete (Greece). Six types of <b>olive</b> <b>plantation</b> systems resulted: (a) very extensive, (b) traditional extensive, (c) semi-intensive low input, (d) semi-intensive high input, (b) intensive and (e) organic. Natural resources management options to address soil erosion, low biodiversity, wildfire risk and excessive water use are explored for each of these systems. In the discussion, it becomes evident that an important quality for a typology lies in its capacity to differentiate likely future development pathways. If options are known, policy-makers can make choices as to what the desired pathway is and what instruments to design to facilitate it...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{with the primary}} purpose of assessing the welfare gain to local residents resulting from olive trees. A secondary but important aim was to underline the multifunctional role of olive farming. In fact, we know that <b>olive</b> <b>plantation</b> has potentially socially benefits. In particular, it has potentially a lot of positive social effects in rural areas depending on plantation characteristics and farming practices. Therefore, the first section of this paper reviews the main features connected to the multifunctional role of olive farming. Multifunctional role of olive farming is well known in the EU, but it is still needed the institutional intervention in favour of farmers, due to the structural difficulties of olive production sector. Later sections concentrate on a survey carried out in order to estimate the economic value of the rural landscape, focusing in particular on olive trees in a hill region between Italy and Slovenia. From the conducted survey we gauged citizens’ WTP to introduce olive trees in the landscape. Survey data was collected by means of questionnaires. We applied the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) in order to assess the citizens’ Willingness To Pay (WTP) for specific rural landscape features. The paper ends with some conclusions about the positive results obtained in <b>olive</b> <b>plantation</b> valuation questions. <b>olive</b> <b>plantation,</b> multifunctionality, willingness to pay, rural landscape valuation, Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|R

40|$|This study {{adopts a}} {{two-fold}} methodological approach to assessing {{the suitability of}} <b>olive</b> <b>plantations</b> in mountainous areas for wildlife habitat restoration.

The case study is the <b>olive</b> <b>plantations</b> of Andalusia (Southern Spain). The results suggest that the edge of major agricultural areas (mostly olive groves), and areas adjacent to Natural Park with oaks would be most suitable for wildlife habitat restoration.

50|$|In October 2013 the {{bacterium}} {{was found to}} be infecting olive trees in the region of Apulia in southern Italy. The disease was causing a rapid decline in <b>olive</b> <b>plantations</b> and by April 2015 it was affecting the whole Province of Lecce and other zones of Apulia. The bacterium had never previously been confirmed in Europe. Almond and oleander plants in the region have also tested positive for the pathogen. The sub-species involved in Italy is Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca. This shows a marked preference for olive trees and warm conditions and is thought unlikely to spread into Northern Europe.|$|R
50|$|The North African provinces spanned across regions {{rich with}} <b>olive</b> <b>plantations</b> and potters' clay sources, {{which led to}} the early {{development}} of fine Ancient Roman pottery, especially African Red Slip terra sigillata tableware and clay oil lamp manufacture, as a crucial industry.

40|$|From autumn 2012 to autumn 2013 {{a survey}} {{comprising}} 70 olive orchards {{was carried out}} in an Irrigation Community of the central Guadalquivir Valley, (Andalucía, Southern Spain) with the objective of studying the influence of the irrigation dose on Verticillium wilt (Verticillium dahliae Kleb.) of olive (VWO). The 93. 1 % of the visited orchards were planted with susceptible cultivars to V. dahliae (‘Picual’ and ‘Hojiblanca’). Mean disease incidence (DI) of the orchards accounted for 14. 9 %. In almost all investigated plantations disease onset occurred after farmers had introduced irrigation. In the case that it was present, the introduction of the irrigation always encouraged VWO development, and DI was positively associated with the number of years of irrigation, showing a linear trend (P = 0. 006). VWO was significantly more severe in <b>olive</b> <b>plantations</b> irrigated with high irrigation doses. The 47. 1 % of <b>olive</b> <b>plantations</b> were irrigated with mean values of 2059. 9 (in 2012) and 1793. 4 (in 2013) m 3 /ha, and showed the highest DI (21. 42 %). Plantations watered with lesser doses (the 28. 6 %) with average values of 712. 5 (in 2012) and 741. 5 (in 2013) m 3 /ha showed a DI significantly lower, which accounted for 13. 3 %. Finally, dry-land olive orchards (24. 3 %) showed the lowest DI (4. 0 %). Research founded by a contract between the and The Spanish Interprofessional Olive Oil Association (UG 400544).
