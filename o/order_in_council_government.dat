5000|$|The 1970s {{witnessed}} new institutional developments, {{the most}} important being {{the creation of the}} fourth Alberta university, Athabasca University, in 1970 by an <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>council</b> of the <b>Government</b> of Alberta. It was to be a campus-based university, but given decreasing enrollments in university campuses afterwards, the institution followed the model of the British open university specializing in the delivery of distance education courses and programs. [...] In 1970, the Alberta government also established the Banff Centre for Continuing Education under the trustee of the University of Calgary.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 Oberlander {{was again}} {{stripped}} of his citizenship through an <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> of the <b>Government</b> of Canada. Oberlander appealed the 2012 order to the Federal Court of Canada, which the court rejected in 2015. Oberlander then appealed the 2015 decision to the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal. In 2016 the court accepted his appeal, setting aside the <b>government's</b> 2012 <b>Order</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council.</b> <b>In</b> July 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada denied the government's request for leave to appeal the decision. Consequently, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to deport Oberlander for trial, the government must first prove {{that he was a}} willing participant in death squad activities due to a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that guilt by association is not sufficient grounds to be considered a war criminal.|$|R
6000|$|Such {{seems to}} be the {{education}} and government appointed for man by the voluntatem Dei in rebus revelatum, and the education, therefore, which the man of science will accept and carry out. But the men of the Ancien Regime--in as far as it was a Regime at all--tried to be wiser than the Almighty. Why not? They were not the first, nor will be the last, by many who have made the same attempt. So this Council of State settled arbitrarily, not only taxes, and militia, and roads, but anything and everything. Its members meddled, with their whole hearts and minds. They tried to teach agriculture by schools and pamphlets and prizes; they sent out plans for every public work. A town could not establish an octroi, levy a rate, mortgage, sell, sue, farm, or administer their property, without an <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>council.</b> The <b>Government</b> <b>ordered</b> public rejoicings, saw to the firing of salutes, and illuminating of houses--in one case mentioned by M. de Tocqueville, they fined a member of the burgher guard for absenting himself from a Te Deum. All self-government was gone. A country parish was, says Turgot, nothing but [...] "an assemblage of cabins, and of inhabitants as passive as the cabins they dwelt in." [...] Without an order of council, the parish could not mend the steeple after a storm, or repair the parsonage gable. If they grumbled at the intendant, he threw some of the chief persons into prison, and made the parish pay the expenses of the horse patrol, which formed the arbitrary police of France. Everywhere was meddling. There were reports on statistics--circumstantial, inaccurate, and useless--as statistics are too often wont to be. Sometimes, when the people were starving, the Government sent down charitable donations to certain parishes, on condition that the inhabitants should raise a sum on their part. When the sum offered was sufficient, the Comptroller-General wrote on the margin, when he returned the report to the intendant, [...] "Good--express satisfaction." [...] If it was more than sufficient, he wrote, [...] "Good--express satisfaction and sensibility." [...] There is nothing new under the sun. In 1761, the Government, jealous enough of newspapers, determined to start one for itself, and for that purpose took under its tutelage the Gazette de France. So the public newsmongers were of course to be the provincial intendants, and their sub-newsmongers, of course, the sub-delegates.|$|R
40|$|Lancashire redefined popular {{politics}} {{and national identity}} in its own image. The perceived threat of invasion by Napoleon, together with the Irish Rebellion, sustained the evolution in extra-parliamentary politics that had begun {{in reaction to the}} American and French revolutions. The meanings and principles of 'radicalism,' 'loyalism' and 'Britain' continued to be debated and contested in 1798 - 1812. Elite loyalism became even more exclusive, developing into the Orange movement. Radicals remained silent until the Napoleonic invasion scares had faded and opportunities arose for renewed vocal criticisms of government foreign and economic policy from 1806. Conflicts re- emerged between radicals and loyalists in the middle classes and gentry which provided the training {{for a new generation of}} postwar radical leaders and the popularity of the free trade campaign. Inhabitants of Lancashire felt British in reaction to the French and Irish, but it was a Lancashire Britishness. Political identities and actions followed national patterns of events but were always marked with a regional stamp. This was in part because most political movements were held together by a shared 'sense of place' rather than vague notions of class-consciousness or shared class identity. A sense of place manifested itself in the regional organisation of strikes, petitions and the Orange institution. Furthermore, it could also entail a common bitter or defiant provincialism against the government or monarchy. In an atmosphere of anti-corruption and a growing desire for peace, this provincial frustration ironically brought professed loyalists closer to radicalism in campaigns against the <b>Orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>Council</b> and other <b>government</b> policies. Provincialism and other elements of regional identity ensured that any ideas of Britishness were tempered through local concerns and allegiances, but an identity with the nation that was not an acquiescent acceptance of national tropes and stereotypes. Lancashire Britishness was commercial, manufacturing, and above all, independent from homogenisation and the impositions of government. </p...|$|R
