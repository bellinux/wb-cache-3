The solution <b>of</b> <b>shortest</b> route was {{on the basis of}} genetic algorithm. The paper designed operators of crossover, mutation and selection. In addition, the specific example of dynamic random network route selection based on the proposed algorithm also verified the feasibility of the algorithm...|$|R
