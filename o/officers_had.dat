5|$|However as {{the army}} took shape, French {{officers}} were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, so that many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust. Crucially, {{some of these}} <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> little experience in working together as a unified force, so that support for other units was often not given.|$|E

5|$|While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented {{soldiers}} {{began to}} pose {{a danger to the}} young United States. Most of the army was then posted at Newburgh, New York. Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies, and they had not been paid in eight months. Furthermore, the Continental <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> been promised, in May 1778, after Valley Forge, a pension of half their pay when they were discharged. By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no power to tax to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers. In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. Alexander McDougall. The <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a lump-sum payment if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life. Congress rejected the proposal.|$|E

He turned to walk south along Royal Exchange Passage instead, where, minutes before he arrived, <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> clashed with up to 25 protesters. Riot police from the Met's TSG, accompanied by City of London police dog handlers, had arrived there from the cordon in Threadneedle Street to help their colleagues.|$|E

Themistokli Gërmenji came to Korçë from Pogradec, which was occupied by the armies of Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria. The French officers appointed a commission led by Gërmenji. The commission had fourteen members, seven Christians and seven Muslims. The members of this commission were: Rafail Adhami, Kostandin Nocka, Nikolla Vangjeli, Vasil Singjeli, Vasil Kondi, Llambro Mborja, Thimi Cale, Shaqir Shabani, Tefik Rushiti, Hysen Dishnica, Emin Rakipi, Qani Dishnica, Sali Babani and Haki Shemshedini.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{sometimes}} gruesome testimony {{it was generally}} believed the hearings were politically motivated and that individual excesses could largely be traced only to Lang and Dorcas Williams, both {{of whom had been}} acting under the orders of a Marine Corps officer who had since been committed to an insane asylum. Both of the accused gendarmerie <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> been indicted by U.S. Navy court-martial prior to the hearings. A separate inquiry conducted by the Haitian government concluded that, outside of 10 killings attributed to Lang and Williams, the gendarmerie's conduct of the war had been justifiable.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the park {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} vandalism, littering, and wildfires caused by off-roading, and Roxy Ann Road became nearly impassable {{because of lack of}} maintenance. Medford police <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> to devote much of their time to patrolling the mountain, made difficult by the park's remote location. To alleviate these problems, the city regraded Roxy Ann Road in 1998, and installed two gates near the park entrance two years later. By 2006, vandalism had decreased by 70 percent.|$|E

Twelve days later, the 2/48th Battalion left El Alamein and returned to Gaza in Palestine, where, later that month, Derrick attended a corps patrolling course.

All Waffen-SS applicants went through the rigorous vetting process reserved only for those with the higher ranks in the Wehrmacht.

As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's officer corps), as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.|$|E

By then, however, South Vietnamese units in I Corps had virtually disappeared, and their commanding <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> fled from their posts.|$|E
5|$|In the Boston Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} {{went on strike}} on September 9, 1919. They sought recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that police <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the {{police officers}}, particularly {{on the part of}} Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.|$|E

5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E
5|$|Most pre-war {{officers}} {{came from}} families with military connections, the gentry or the peerage; {{a public school}} education was almost essential. In 1913, about 2% of regular <b>officers</b> <b>had</b> been promoted from the ranks.
