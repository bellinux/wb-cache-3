5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as: eight β-lactam (ampicillin sodium, penicillin G procaine, cefalexin, ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine penicillin, benzylpenicillin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, Ceftriaxone sodium), three tetracycline (doxycycline hydrochloride, <b>oxytetracycline</b> dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) and two macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
5|$|Several {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} used successfully to treat S.iniae infection in fish. Enrofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, {{has been used to}} great effect in hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops× M.saxatilis), although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain. Amoxicillin, erythromycin, furazolidone, and <b>oxytetracycline</b> have also been used (the last with varying success, only in barramundi). Vaccination against S.iniae has been attempted with limited success as it only provides up to 6 months' immunity.|$|E
25|$|Their {{most common}} current use {{is in the}} {{treatment}} of moderately severe acne and rosacea (tetracycline, <b>oxytetracycline,</b> doxycycline or minocycline).|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole {{is thought}} to act through {{anti-inflammatory}} mechanisms, while azelaic acid {{is thought to}} decrease cathelicidin production. Oral antibiotics of the tetracycline class such as doxycycline and <b>oxytetracycline</b> are also commonly used and thought to reduce papulopustular lesions through anti-inflammatory actions rather than through their antibacterial capabilities.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, Harvard University {{professor}} R.B. Woodward {{determined the}} chemical {{structure of the}} related substance, <b>oxytetracycline</b> (Terramycin); the patent protection for its fermentation and production was also first issued in that year. Chemist Lloyd Conover, in a research team of eight scientists at Pfizer, collaborated with Woodward over a two-year period, leading to tetracycline's discovery.|$|E
25|$|The first {{member of}} the group to be {{discovered}} is chlortetracycline (Aureomycin) in the late 1940s by Benjamin Minge Duggar, a scientist employed by American Cyanamid - Lederle Laboratories, under the leadership of Yellapragada Subbarow, who derived the substance from a golden-colored, fungus-like, soil-dwelling bacterium named Streptomyces aureofaciens. <b>Oxytetracycline</b> (Terramycin) was discovered shortly afterwards by AC Finlay et al.; it came from a similar soil bacterium named Streptomyces rimosus. Robert Burns Woodward determined the structure of <b>oxytetracycline,</b> enabling Lloyd H. Conover to successfully produce tetracycline itself as a synthetic product. The development of many chemically altered antibiotics formed this group. In June 2005, tigecycline, the first member of a new subgroup of tetracyclines named glycylcyclines, was introduced to treat infections that are resistant to other antimicrobics including conventional tetracyclines. While tigecycline is the first tetracycline approved in over 20 years, other, newer versions of tetracyclines are currently in human clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Minocycline is {{also used}} for other skin infections such as MRSA as well as Lyme disease, as the one pill twice daily 100mg dosage is far easier for {{patients}} than the {{four times a day}} required with tetracycline or <b>oxytetracycline.</b> Its activity against Lyme disease is enhanced by its superior ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer {{was founded}} in 1849 by cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart in New York City as a {{manufacturer}} of fine chemicals. Its discovery of Terramycin (<b>oxytetracycline)</b> in 1950 {{put it on a}} path towards becoming a research-based pharmaceutical company. It has made numerous acquisitions, including Warner–Lambert in 2000, Pharmacia in 2003, and Wyeth in 2009 (the largest of the three at $68billion).|$|E
25|$|When ingested, it {{is usually}} {{recommended}} that the more water-soluble, short-acting tetracyclines (plain tetracycline, chlortetracycline, <b>Oxytetracycline,</b> demeclocycline and methacycline) be taken with a full glass of water, either two hours after eating or two hours before eating. This is partly because most tetracyclines bind with food and also easily with magnesium, aluminium, iron and calcium, which reduces their ability to be completely absorbed by the body. Dairy products, antacids and preparations containing iron should be avoided near the time of taking the drug. Partial exceptions to these rules occur for doxycycline and minocycline, which may be taken with food (though not iron, antacids, or calcium supplements). Minocycline can be taken with dairy products {{because it does not}} chelate calcium as readily, although dairy products do decrease absorption of minocycline slightly.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1940s, {{penicillin}} {{became very}} inexpensive. As a result, Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. Pfizer's discovery and commercialization of Terramycin (<b>oxytetracycline)</b> in 1950 changed {{the company from}} a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company. To augment its research in fermentation technology, Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focusing on in vitro synthesis. Pfizer also established an animal health division in 1959 with an [...] farm and research facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.|$|E
2500|$|European foulbrood {{is often}} {{considered}} a [...] "stress" [...] disease — dangerous {{only if the}} colony is already under stress for other reasons. An otherwise healthy colony can usually survive European foulbrood. [...] Chemical treatment with <b>oxytetracycline</b> hydrochloride may control an outbreak of the disease, but honey from treated colonies could have chemical residues from the treatment. [...] The [...] "Shook Swarm" [...] technique of bee husbandry can also effectively control the disease, with the advantage of avoiding the use of chemicals. [...] Prophylactic treatments are not recommended as they lead to resistant bacteria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxytetracycline</b> is {{especially}} valuable in treating nonspecific urethritis, Lyme disease, brucellosis, cholera, typhus, tularaemia. and infections caused by Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and Rickettsia. Doxycycline is now preferred to <b>oxytetracycline</b> {{for many of}} these indications because it has improved pharmacologic features.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxytetracycline</b> {{can also}} be used to correct {{breathing}} disorders in livestock. It is administered in a powder or through an intramuscular injection. American livestock producers apply <b>oxytetracycline</b> to livestock feed to prevent diseases and infections in cattle and poultry. The antibiotic is partially absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of the animal and the remaining is deposited in manure. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service studied the breakdown of <b>oxytetracycline</b> in manure depending on various environmental conditions. They found the breakdown slowed with increased saturation of the manure and concluded this was a result of decreased oxygen levels. http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100304.htm This research helps producers understand the effects of <b>oxytetracycline</b> in animal feed on the environment, bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oxytetracycline</b> {{works by}} {{interfering with the}} ability of {{bacteria}} to produce essential proteins. Without these proteins, the bacteria cannot grow, multiply and increase in numbers. <b>Oxytetracycline</b> therefore stops {{the spread of the}} infection and the remaining bacteria are killed by the immune system or eventually die.|$|E

50|$|It {{was first}} found near Pfizer {{laboratories}} in a soil sample yielding the soil actinomycete, Streptomyces rimosus by Finlay et al.

50|$|<b>Oxytetracycline,</b> {{like other}} tetracyclines, {{is used to}} treat many infections, both common and rare (see Tetracycline {{antibiotics}} group). Its better absorption profile makes it preferable to tetracycline for moderately severe acne at a dosage of 250-500 mg {{four times a day}} for usually six to eight weeks at a time, but alternatives should be sought if no improvement occurs by three months. Avoid milk, iron, zinc or indigestion remedies while taking <b>oxytetracycline.</b> Take before food or on an empty stomach. Always follow your doctors' instructions and instruction leaflet.|$|E
