40|$|In {{order to}} improve the quality of mail piece stacking, an {{engineering}} model of an <b>output</b> <b>module</b> has been developed and tested by DETECON and FHG-IML under the master agreement between DETECON and the United States Postal Service in an R and D - project. The origin of the technical approach for this <b>output</b> <b>module</b> was a concept for an Advanced Letter Sorter with a multilevel transporter, that required a horizontal output stacker. One <b>output</b> <b>module</b> has to reach up to four different levels of the transporter so that the vertical space required by the output stacker had to be minimized. Considering the heterogeneous composition of manual letter mail and its differing physical characteristics, a nearly form-locking transfer of mail pieces between transporter carriers and stack was favoured. As a consequence, the transmission had to be effected with minimal friction influences. This paper describes the functional principle, the main components of the <b>output</b> <b>module,</b> and the results and parame ters of several tests...|$|E
50|$|Fault {{tolerance}} in the Tricon {{is achieved}} {{by means of a}} Triple-Modular Redundant(TMR) architecture. The Tricon provides error-free, uninterrupted control in the presence of either hard failures of components, or transient faults from internal or external sources.The Tricon is designed with a fully triplicated architecture throughout, from the input modules through the Main Processors to the <b>output</b> <b>modules.</b> Every I/O module houses the circuitry for three independent legs.Each leg on the input modules reads the process data and passes thatinformation to its respective Main Processor. The three Main Processors communicate with each other using a proprietary high-speed bus system called the TriBus. Once per scan, the three MainProcessors synchronize and communicate with their two neighbors overthe TriBus. The Tricon votes digital input data, compares output data, and sends copies of analog input data to each Main Processor.The Main Processors execute the userwritten application and send outputs generated by the application to the <b>output</b> <b>modules.</b> In addition to voting the input data, the TriBus votes the output data. This is done on the <b>output</b> <b>modules</b> as close to the field as possible, in order to detect and compensate for any errors that could occur between the Tricon voting and the final output driven to the field.|$|R

5000|$|Synthetic {{morphology}} extends {{this idea}} by adding <b>output</b> <b>modules</b> that alter the shape or social behaviour of cells {{in response to}} the state of the artificial gene network. For example, instead of just making a fluorescent protein, a gene network may switch on an adhesion molecule so that cells stick to each other, or activate a motility system so that cells move. It has been argued that the formation of properly-shaped tissues by mammalian cells involves mainly a set of about ten basic cellular events (cell proliferation, cell death, cell adhesion, differential adhesion, cell de-adhesion, cell fusion, cell locomotion, chemotaxis, haptotaxis, cell wedging). Broadly similar lists exist for tissues of plants, fungi etc. In principle, therefore, a fairly small set of <b>output</b> <b>modules</b> might allow biotechnologists to 'program' cells to produce artificially-designed arrangements, shapes and eventually 'tissues'.|$|R

40|$|Phytochromes are a {{collection}} of dimeric photoreceptors that direct a diverse array of responses in plants and microorganisms through photoconversion between a red light-absorbing ground state Pr, and a far-red light-absorbing photoactivated state Pfr. Photoconversion from Pr to Pfr is initiated by a light-driven rotation within the covalently attached bilin, which then triggers a series of protein conformational changes in the binding pocket. These movements ultimately affect an appended <b>output</b> <b>module,</b> which often has reversible protein kinase activity. Propagation of the light signal from the bilin to the <b>output</b> <b>module</b> likely depends on the dimerization interface but its architecture and response to phototransformation remain unclear. Here, we used single particle cryoelectron microscopy to determine the quaternary arrangement of the phytochrome dimer as Pr, using the bacteriophytochrome (BphP) from Deinococcus radiodurans. Contrary to the long-standing view that the two monomers are held together solely via their C-terminal region, we provide unambiguous evidence that the N-terminal bilin-binding region of BphP also provides a dimerization interface with the C-terminal kinase domain appearing as a more flexible appendage. The BphP monomers dimerize in parallel with the polypeptides intimately twisting around {{each other in a}} right-handed fashion. Based on this electron microscopic picture, we propose that the light-driven conformational changes transmitted from the chromophore to the <b>output</b> <b>module</b> along the spine of this extensive dimer interface is the central feature underpinning phytochrome signaling...|$|E
