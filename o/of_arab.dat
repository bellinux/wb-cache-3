5000|$|Parts of Hollywood are {{regarded}} as using a disproportionate number <b>of</b> <b>Arabs</b> as villains and <b>of</b> depicting <b>Arabs</b> negatively and stereotypically.

25|$|The {{argument}} that Arab immigration somehow {{made up a}} large part <b>of</b> the Palestinian <b>Arab</b> population is thus statistically untenable.

5|$|The last tenet, '{{socialism}}', did {{not mean}} socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> socialism. Aflaq coined the word Arab socialism for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being {{under the rule of}} Muhammad. The point <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> socialism was not to answer questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.|$|E

5|$|Abu Nuwar {{spent much}} of his time in exile between Syria and Egypt {{organizing}} opposition to Hussein and the monarchy, all the while maintaining his innocence in the Zarqa incident. He returned to Jordan in 1964 after being pardoned by Hussein as part of the latter's broader reconciliation efforts with his exiled opposition. In 1971, Abu Nuwar was made ambassador to France and he was later appointed to the Senate of Jordan's parliament in 1989. He died from blood cancer at a London hospital at age 66, one year after the publication of his memoirs, A Time <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> Decline: Memoirs <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> Politics (1948–1964).|$|E

5|$|Marwan's 737 {{expedition}} was {{the climax}} of the Arab–Khazar wars, but its actual results were meagre. Although the Arab campaigns after Ardabil may indeed have discouraged the Khazars from further warfare, any recognition of Islam or <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> supremacy by the khagan was evidently conditional upon the presence <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> troops deep in Khazar territory, and such presence could not be sustained for long. Furthermore, the credibility of the conversion of the khagan to Islam is disputed: al-Baladhuri's account, which probably reflects closer the original sources, suggests that it was not the khagan but a minor lord who converted to Islam and was placed in charge of the Khazars at al-Lakz. The conversion of the khagan is also apparently contradicted by the fact that c. 740 the Khazar court embraced Judaism as its official faith, a decision which clearly owed a great deal to the determination of the Khazars to avoid assimilation by and emphasize their independence from the Christian Byzantine and the Muslim Arab empires.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} modern {{histories}} of the Arab nation {{in contrast to a}} history of an individual Arab country was composed by Darwaza in the late 1920s under the title Lessons <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> History: From Antiquity to Present Times. In the book, Darwaza begins by describing the origins of the Semitic peoples, the rise of Islam, the end <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> rule in the Middle East by Turkic groups, and the foreign rule over the Arabs by Western powers. The book was intended {{to be used as a}} textbook in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later Iraq, hence its simplified and direct language. Nonetheless, it played a pioneering role in the development of pan-Arabism.|$|E

5|$|The long Arab–Byzantine {{struggle}} left abiding traces on the island's subsequent history: although under Muslim rule, Sicilian culture {{quickly became}} Arabicized, the Christian {{communities in the}} central and eastern parts largely resisted islamization. The level <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> influence, as attested through surviving toponyms, also varied across the island depending {{on the length of}} resistance and the extent <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> settlement: there are many Arab-derived names in the western third (the medieval Val di Mazara), are more mixed in the southeastern third (Val di Noto), while Christian identities survived strongest in the northeastern third of the island (Val Demone), which was the last to fall, where Christian refugees from other parts of Sicily had assembled, and which furthermore remained in contact with Byzantine southern Italy.|$|E
5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal challenges to the enemy officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized effectively to slay as many enemy officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to enemy morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is perhaps the best example of this form of psychological warfare. Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics into something that could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish the enemy to death: he would bring his army in front of his enemies and wait until the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting the enemy units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E

Over the centuries these surviving Christian societies of former Byzantine Greeks in Arab realms evolved into Antiochian Greeks, Melchites or merged into the societies <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> Christians, existing to this day.|$|E
