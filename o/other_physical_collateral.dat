40|$|M. Com. (Financial Management) Abstract: The {{rural poor}} with no <b>physical</b> <b>collateral</b> {{typically}} have virtually {{no access to}} small business financing. The microfinance movement replaces <b>physical</b> <b>collateral</b> with social collateral {{as a means for}} rural poor persons to gain access to financing for their microbusinesses. Microfinance entails lending to self-formed groups of close-knit community members who are jointly liable for loans advanced to individual group members. Advantages include borrower screening by fellow group members, mutual assistance in micro-enterprises, monitoring repayment and imposing social sanctions to delinquent group members. Despite the use of group lending, Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) are still faced with the risk of default by borrowers and the absence of <b>physical</b> <b>collateral</b> means there is no recourse to borrower assets for repayment. Default on loans, which can be caused by characteristics of the lending groups themselves, has the undesirable effect of eroding the capital base of MFIs and threatening their continued existence. The main research problem is that MFIs are faced with borrower default that threaten their operational sustainability. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of group characteristics on the probability of borrower default. The characteristics of interest are: the age and gender of the borrower, group size, loan amount, instalment size, loan duration, loan cycle, location of group (rural or urban), business experience of the borrower, business savings, business assets, record of loan centre meeting attendance, family relations in a group and intra-group business risk correlation. The importance of this understanding will practically assist MFIs with insights regarding which factors to eliminate and which to enhance in the design of the groups to which they lend. The probit regression model was used on secondary data from a loan programme at a large South African MFI. The key findings of the study indicate that probability of default decreases with larger groups, more female borrowers in a group and larger borrower savings. We also found that probability of default increases with larger loan [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on group lending, {{which is considered}} a major force behind the successful operation of microcredit institutions. This research explores group-lending mechanisms and group-formation techniques which improve repayment performance and reduce group failures. Group-lending microcredit institutions lend to low-income groups who cannot offer collateral. By making a group of borrowers jointly responsible for loan repayments, the idea of social collateral has gained credence. The Grameen Model uses this {{as a substitute for}} <b>physical</b> <b>collateral.</b> An alternative group-lending model, Self-Help Group (SHG) requires members to save first to meet a certain threshold level of savings. This process helps to develop and strengthen bonds among members of the group while pooling their savings. These savings serve as partial <b>physical</b> <b>collateral</b> and provide an incentive to repay loans. In the first of the three long essays that form the body of this research, the distinctive features of both the Grameen Model and the SHG Model are compared through laboratory experiments to identify the mechanisms that can improve repayment performance. The results indicate that the joint impact of both social and partial <b>physical</b> <b>collateral</b> is of far more benefit than the individual impact of either. Using an experimental approach, the second essay explores the impact of social ties on group solidarity. Group solidarity is expressed in terms of meeting the threshold level of group contribution. The results indicate that social proximity among members enhances group contribution and, thus, may help in the voluntary provision of the public good. In the context of Self-Help Group lending, members need to save first and then seek access to loans from banks against these savings. We find that social ties {{make it easier for the}} group to reach the threshold level of savings and thus procure partial <b>physical</b> <b>collateral,</b> which in turn increases repayment performance. This result may have ramifications for group-lending institutions as well as for the provision of a public good that relies on group contributions. The existing literature shows that joint liability and self -selection of group members results in homogeneous group formation in terms of the risk characteristics of the borrower's project. In the third essay we develop a theoretical model to demonstrate the feasibility of heterogeneous group formation. We consider the impact of different forms of intra-group transfers on group formation and find that only a particular form of intra-group transfer, referred to as indirect joint liability and revenue sharing (IJLRS), results in heterogeneous group formation. This may serve as an informal intra-group insurance mechanism. Overall, this thesis increases our understanding of the group-lending strategies of microfinance institutions. The results obtained in this thesis can be used by policy makers and microfinance institutions. The ultimate aim is for microfinance institutions to be able to increase their outreach, in order to help more people get out of poverty...|$|R

Promises are pooled in either pass-through securities or collateralized loans obligations (CLO), allowing the existence of different seniority lev- els among tranches in the same CLO. In case of default, borrowers may also suffer extra-economic penalties, which are internalized into a structure of non-ordered preferences. In this context, we prove {{the existence of an}} equilibrium in that investors are not over-pessimistic about the payments of derivatives.

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{financing to}} the rural poor through formal financial services often fail to meet the credit requirements since the poor often lack <b>physical</b> <b>collateral</b> to secure the repayment of the loans. The failure in providing banking financial services to the poor has minimized their business opportunities, giving them no chance but borrowing money from local money markets with huge interest rates. Microfinance program {{is an effort to}} reduce poverty and improve life quality for the poor in rural areas. This program enables borrowers who do not have any <b>physical</b> <b>collateral</b> but still can borrow small loans in order to realize their business ideas. However, despite many positive achievements, microfinance still faces the challenge regarding default risks. The default in microfinance situation is when the borrowers are not able to fulfill their duties in repaying back the loans. The purpose of this thesis is using a qualitative case study to find out whether the combination of business education and microfinance institutions can reduce default risk and increase repayment rate. The findings of our investigation indicate that there is positive impact of business training on repayment rate in the case of India. We found that the microfinance institution, which offers business training to its clients, has higher repayment rate and less default than the one in which no business training is offered. In addition, we also found that the caste system in India has no effects on our target interview group’s business practices. However, we believe that in order to achieve the goal of poverty alleviation and provide sustainable financial services in the long run, microfinance institutions need to find additional innovations to manage the loans and reduce the default risk.

This process begins with potential clients self-selecting themselves into solidarity groups of four to six members. These solidarity groups are then organized into Village Banks that consist of four to twelve groups (or twenty to sixty clients). Being part of a self-selected solidarity group signifies that three to five other villagers trust the loan applicant to let him/her join their group. All loans are guaranteed by the respective group members. Loans are appraised and approved by an AMK Client Officer and the Village Bank President prior to disbursement. Each group nominates a group leader {{who is in charge}} of ensuring member attendance at meetings, troubleshooting, and liaising with the VBP, CO, and other members.
