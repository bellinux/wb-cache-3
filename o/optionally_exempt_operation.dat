The Authority shall inspect {{commercial}} land-based aquaculture systems {{facilities at}} least every six months, and open-water grow-out operations, floating aquaculture operations, remote setting operations and nursery systems at least annually. The Authority shall at a minimum: 1) inspect operator records to verify that appropriate permits {{are up to date}} and operational plans are being adhered to, and 2) determine if seed from restricted or prohibited waters are being cultured and if appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure such seed are purged for an appropriate period of time before harvest. Public Health Significance: The term “aquaculture systems ” is undefined. The Model Ordinance only requires the inspection of “floating aquaculture and land-based aquaculture facilities. ” Bottom culture aquaculture operations do not appear to require inspections at all. The Model Ordinance does not describe what an inspector should examine when inspecting aquaculture systems. For open water and floating aquaculture grow-out operations in open and conditionally approved waters, an annual inspection should be adequate to ensure that appropriate permits are in place and operational plans are being adhered to. Additional inspections do not ensure a higher level of public health protection. Land-based molluscan aquaculture includes hatcheries (<b>exempt),</b> larval-setting <b>operations</b> (that should also be exempt), and nursery systems for very small seed. Grow-out systems do not currently exist because pumping costs are prohibitive, however should economics change to make such systems affordable, these systems will be functionally similar to wet storage systems and will justify more extensive (twice annual) monitoring Cost Information (if available) : Since the current Model Ordinance does not describe what an inspection of an aquaculture system entails, {{it is difficult to determine}} the cost impact of this change...|$|R

Accordingly, the Scheduled District Act, 1874 ensured that such areas could be made <b>exempt</b> from the <b>operation</b> of certain acts which could prove detrimental to such areas. Thereafter Montague-Chelmsford Report (1918), which formed the basis of the Government of India Act 1919 concluded that the political reforms contemplated for the rest of India could not apply to these backward areas as “there was no material on which to establish political institutions”. The Simon Commission and the Government of India act 1935 were also based on the policy of relative non-interference in scheduled Areas in the context of severe deprivations and the massive land alienation and presence of informal and exploitative credit in such areas. The Fifth schedule of the constitution of free India was thus a culmination of the above Acts.|$|R

Using game theory we find that in most cases a user benefits form acting greedily and this decrease total system capacity. It is possible to deter a user from cheating by applying punishment to the user. This function should preferably be incorporated in the access network. We also study the case of networks competing in unlicensed spectrum and find that the most successful network is the one with lowest quality guarantees and with the most dense access network. In the case studied here the greedy behavior of the networks increases the spectrum utilization. We also evaluate a number of cases where two networks that cooperate in unlicensed spectrum. Isolation between the networks is the key factor to achieve better performance than splitting the spectrum. The evaluations are carried out using numerical experiments and game theory. Game theory ia a powerful tool for modelling coexistence problems in unlicensed spectrum, but the systems are too complex to allow a fully analytical treatment. QC 2010101...|$|R

50|$|A chaber's wife, and {{his child}} or servant, are considered, {{in respect to}} {{religious}} observances, as the chaber himself (Abodah Zarah 39a); therefore the admission of a candidate into the order embraces {{all the members of}} his family. Even after the chaber's death his family enjoy the confidence previously reposed in them, unless there be reason for impugning their fidelity. The same is the case when one of them joins the family of an am ha'aretz; {{as long as there is}} no reasonable suspicion to the contrary, it is presumed that the habits acquired under the influence of the observant head of the family will not be discarded, even under different circumstances. Similarly, the presumption of habit governs the case of members of the family of an am ha'aretz joining that of a chaber; they are not considered trustworthy unless they pledge themselves to live up to the rules of the chaburah. However, the child or servant of an am ha'aretz entering the house of a chaber for the purpose of study is <b>exempt</b> from the <b>operation</b> of that presumption as long as he remains under the chaber's direction. On the other hand, when the pupil is the son or servant of a chaber and the teacher is an am ha'aretz, the presumption is extended in the pupil's favor. Again, where a man is recognized as reliable while his wife is not—as when a chaber marries the widow or daughter of an am ha'aretz—chaberim may unhesitatingly buy of him articles of food, but must not eat at his board if it is presided over by his wife. If, on the contrary, the wife is reliable, being the widow or daughter of a chaber, while the husband is an am ha'aretz, chaberim may eat at his table, but must not buy from him (Tosefta, Demai ii. 14-18).|$|R
40|$|The {{trade of}} {{shipping}} is necessarily international in nature. Courts and international bodies often express {{the need to}} ensure international consistency in matters of maritime law. However, {{it has been an}} extremely difficult goal to achieve. Many countries have refused to be party to international conventions that seek to ensure comity. Some have enacted laws that reflect part but not all of those conventions, or seek to improve the protection offered by the conventions. The domestic law of each country also adds its own flavour to shipping law as recognised and applied by the courts in that jurisdiction. In 1974 Australia enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (TPA), heralding a new era in corporate and commercial law. However, its impact on maritime law on Australia has only been felt over the last 10 - 15 years. It is potentially relevant to many areas of maritime law, including carriage of goods by sea, cruise ships, and towage. This thesis explores the encroachment of the TPA on a number of different areas of shipping law, using the few case examples on offer and extrapolating the impact that the TPA may have. It also considers {{the extent to which the}} TPA is stymied by simple contractual agreements to litigate or arbitrate in a non Australian forum, despite the TPA's status as a mandatory statute within Australia.

6000|$|No {{improvement}} in {{the fortunes of the}} original anarchists through immigration to what was then called the New World would have made them good citizens. From centuries of secret war against particular forms of authority in their own countries they had inherited a bitter antagonism to all authority, even the most beneficent. In their new home they were worse than in their old. In the sunshine of opportunity the rank and sickly growth of their perverted natures became hardy, vigorous, bore fruit. They surrounded themselves with proselytes from the ranks of the idle, the vicious, the unsuccessful. They stimulated and organized discontent. Every one of them became a center of moral and political contagion. To those as yet unprepared to accept anarchy was offered the milder dogma of Socialism, and to those even weaker in the faith something vaguely called Reform. Each was initiated into that degree to which the induration of his conscience and the character of his discontent made him eligible, and in which he could be most serviceable, the body of the people still cheating themselves with the false sense of security begotten of the belief that they were somehow <b>exempt</b> from the <b>operation</b> of all agencies inimical to their national welfare and integrity. Human nature, they thought, was different in the West from what it was in the East: in the New World the old causes would not have the old effects: a republic had some inherent vitality of its own, entirely independent of any action intended to keep it alive. They felt that words and phrases had some talismanic power, and charmed themselves asleep by repeating [...] "liberty," [...] "all men equal before the law," [...] "dictates of conscience," [...] "free speech" [...] and all manner of such incantation to exorcise the spirits of the night. And when they could no longer close their eyes to the dangers environing them; when they saw at last that what they had mistaken for the magic power of their form of government and its assured security was really its radical weakness and subjective peril--they found their laws inadequate to repression of the enemy, the enemy too strong to permit the enactment of adequate laws. The belief that a malcontent armed with freedom of speech, a newspaper, a vote and a rifle is less dangerous than a malcontent with a still tongue in his head, empty hands and under police surveillance was abandoned, but all too late. From its fatuous dream the nation was awakened by the noise of arms, the shrieks of women and the red glare of burning cities.|$|R
