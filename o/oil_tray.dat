40|$|Drying {{process has}} been {{identified}} {{as one of the most}} important preprocessing techniques in cinnamon oil production industry. Drying at closed and controlled environment was selected as a solution to mitigate the drawbacks of conventional sun drying of cinnamon. The common drawbacks are long processing times, labor cost and the deterioration of the quality due to several factors such as dust, moisture and insects. Optimizing the drying operation can reduce the post harvesting losses. This research focuses on investigation of the drying behavior of cinnamon chips and the effect of drying on the yield and quality of cinnamon bark oil. Drying process was experimentally investigated using a tray dryer which provided convective drying with hot air. This dryer consisted of a stove, heat exchanging system and drying chamber and is driven by biomass. Hot air temperatures of 35 C, 40 C, 45 C and 50 C were selected while the air velocity was kept constant. The applicability of three commonly used mathematical models was evaluated by examining the best fit for drying at each tray of the dryer separately. The particle size of cinnamon chips available in the market was having a large range from less than 1 / 8 inches to greater than 6 inches. However about 29. 7 % of cinnamon chips were in the range of 1 inch to 2 inches. The moisture content of cinnamon chips available in the market was found to be within a range of 14. 12 % to 28. 56 % with mean and standard deviation of 19. 97 % and 4. 58 % respectively. The common practice in the industry is to keep the cinnamon chips under wet conditions before drying until a considerable amount is collected. This process seriously affects the oil yield as mould and fungi develops under wet conditions. The maximum number of days in storage under wet conditions without affecting the quality of cinnamon chips was found to be 3 days. The drying behavior of cinnamon chips in a tray dryer had well agreed with the existing drying models for thin layer drying. Considering the total drying time and the oil yield, drying temperature of 35 C was found to be the most suitable temperature for drying of cinnamon chips. Drying at temperatures above 35 C gave lower yield and the high volatile components had escaped during drying operation. Drying was not even within the tray dryer and results of the variation of moisture content at each tray clearly indicated the non-uniform drying behavior. Non-uniform drying had considerably reduced the yield which was significant when the drying temperature was maintained above 35 C.

As the lamp {{was intended for}} use with heavy, sooty oils as well, this vaporiser was constructed of a square frame of straight tubes. Each tube was closed with a screwed plug that could be removed for cleaning. For initial lighting, the vaporiser would be preheating by burning a little <b>oil</b> in a <b>tray</b> beneath the burner. The burners were mounted horizontally, although some models were produced with a flexible hose to the burner that allowed it to be rotated vertically.|$|R
40|$|By {{some recent}} estimates, mycotoxins affect {{as much as}} 25 % of the world’s food crops each year. These highly toxic, {{naturally}} occurring compounds are by products (metabolites) {{of the growth of}} fungi or moulds. Mycotoxins can result in significant economic loss for crop producers and broiler producers since it represent an ongoing risk to profitability. Factors that contribute to mycotoxin contamination of food and feed include environmental, socio-economic and food production. Environmental conditions especially high humidity and temperatures favour fungal proliferation resulting in contamination of food and feed. The resulting implications include immuno-suppression, impaired growth, various cancers and death depending on the type, period and amount of exposure. Mycotoxin concerns have grown during the last few decades because of their implications to human and animal health, productivity, economics of their management and trade. This has led to development of maximum tolerated limits for mycotoxins in various countries. This paper highlights the use of naturally derived aflatoxin inhibitors from Azadirachtin compound of neem <b>oil,</b> and <b>tray</b> drying in controlling moisture content to inhibit the aflatoxin contamination in pretreated soy based animal feed. High moisture content found in soy based animal feed increases the risk of fungal growth during storage. Neem extract has shown potential as an effective feed additive to minimize the growth of fungi and possibly reduce the risk of toxic effects from mycotoxin production. Preservation methods by means of tray drying have also shown positive results towards the control of fungal growth. </p...|$|R
40|$|Crude oil {{is a major}} natural {{resource}} and the mainstay of any country that have it in abundance; its sole disadvantage is its tendency of spilling to the environment. Kenaf {{has been found to}} be a good absorbent for physical clean-up and treatment of oil spillage both on land and water surfaces. Kenaf absorbs the oil thus making it soaked and the absorbed oil can however be recovered using appropriate technology. The aim of the research work is to design and construct an oil extractor to remove and recover the absorbed oil from kenaf bast and core. The functional parts of the machine are: barrel (80 mm diameter and 1000 mm length), worm shaft (minimum diameter 50 mm and maximum diameter 65 mm), gear reduction box (20 : 1), prime mover (7 hp, 1420 rpm), oil and cake outlet, hopper, conical restrictor, pulley and transmission belts. The worm shaft was tapered to build up pressure as it travels across the length of the barrel and it conveys, grinds, presses and squeezes oil out of kenaf into the oil outlet via the <b>oil</b> collection <b>tray.</b> The residual cake from where the oil was extracted is extruded out of the cake outlet in form of briquettes. The oil extractor machine was evaluated in compliance with Philippines Agricultural Engineering Standard PAES 230 and 231 : 2005 and the results showed a percent kenaf recovery of 60 %, extraction efficiency of 62. 2 %, throughput capacity of 36. 5 kg/hr and an extraction loss of 37. 8 %. The extraction efficiency varies with the moisture content of the soaked kenaf bast and core. The operation of the machine does not require any technical-know-how and the machine can be easily maintained as it has the tendency of self-lubricating the extraction chamber due to presence of oil in the input materials...|$|R
50|$|Reflux {{refers to}} {{the portion of the}} {{condensed}} overhead product that is returned to the tower. The reflux flowing downwards provides the cooling required for condensing the vapours flowing upwards. The reflux ratio, which is the ratio of the (internal) reflux to the overhead product, is conversely related to the theoretical number of stages required for efficient separation of the distillation products.Fractional distillation towers or columns are designed to achieve the required separation efficiently. The design of fractionation columns is normally made in two steps; a process design, followed by a mechanical design. The purpose of the process design is to calculate the number of required theoretical stages and stream flows including the reflux ratio, heat reflux and other heat duties. The purpose of the mechanical design, on the other hand, is to select the tower internals, column diameter and height. In most cases, the mechanical design of fractionation towers is not straightforward. For the efficient selection of tower internals and the accurate calculation of column height and diameter, many factors must be taken into account. Some of the factors involved in design calculations include feed load size and properties and the type of distillation column used. The two major types of distillation columns used are tray and packing columns. Packing columns are normally used for smaller towers and loads that are corrosive or temperature sensitive or for vacuum service where pressure drop is important. Tray columns, on the other hand, are used for larger columns with high liquid loads. They first appeared on the scene in the 1820s. In most <b>oil</b> refinery operations, <b>tray</b> columns are mainly used for the separation of petroleum fractions at different stages of oil refining.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Goulbourn Township Historical Society, the {{original}} bakery {{started in the}} late 1800s when Sam Wright came from Kemptville and opened a bakery business on Strachan Street. The article, which recounts the History of the Richmond Bakery was originally published in Richmond 150 a book published in 1968 for the 150th anniversary of the Village of Richmond {{and goes on to}} say that {{the original}} bakery was sold in 1900 to Sam Wright, who operated the business until 1926. In 1930, Harold Brown rented a bakeshop and opened the Richmond Bakery on McBean Street which had a wood-fired brick oven, a few utensils and a kerosene lamp for lighting because there was no electricity. All the water was hand pumped from a well and carried to the bakery. Bread sold for 3 cents a loaf to retailers, who in turn sold it for 5 cents and the baker usually worked 16 hours per day. To deliver the bread, Mr. Brown borrowed horses from the local farmers and fed the horses in return. Drivers had to feed the horses at 4 a.m. and usually didn’t finish deliveries until 7 p.m. covering 20-25 miles per day. After being discharged from the RCAF in 1945, Mr. Brown opened another bakery in Richmond on McBean Street. Although it had electricity and trucks to do the deliveries, water still had to be pumped by hand and carried to the bakery. In 1952, Mr. Brown moved the Richmond Bakery to the corner of McBean and Perth Streets and new equipment was purchased including, gas and <b>oil</b> ovens, revolving <b>trays</b> and a bread steamer. Water was finally pumped into the bakery with an electric pump. At the new location, Mr. Brown added pastries which became one of the attractions of the bakers. On Sundays, Ottawa residents would drive to Richmond to purchase the sweet treats. The Bakery’s motto has always been, “We bake everything we sell and we sell everything we bake.” ...|$|R
