The convent was patronized by Claudio of Savoy, who commissioned the convent just <b>outside</b> the Porta <b>di</b> San Giovanni in the city walls. In 1604, Bernardino II di Savoy commissioned enlargement of the church. It has three naves and two large chapels. On the left, the Chapel of the Rosary {{has a number of}} wooden paintings.

Ryo intervenes, but is easily incapacitated. Lan Di demands Iwao give him a mysterious stone artifact known as the dragon mirror. When he threatens to kill Ryo, Iwao tells him the mirror is buried under the cherry blossom tree <b>outside.</b> As Lan <b>Di's</b> men dig up the mirror, Lan Di mentions Zhao Sunming, whom Iwao allegedly killed in Mengcun, China. Lan Di delivers a finishing blow and Iwao dies in Ryo's arms.|$|R
5000|$|From 1879 to 1903, he {{collaborated with}} the {{ornamental}} painter Nicola Achilli (1858 - 1945) of Montegiorgio. Fontana completed the large terracotta lions <b>outside</b> the Collegiata <b>di</b> Santi Lorenzo and Biagio in Monte San Pietrangeli. Nicola also helped Fontana in designing and applying the faux marble decorations, and stucco decorations in the Cathedral designed by Luigi Poletti for Montalto Marche, [...] in the collegiate church of Santa Lucia in Montefiore dell'Aso, in the church of SS. Sacramento e Rosario of Grottazzolina, in the vast abbey of Campofilone, in the Basilica di San Nicola a Tolentino, and other churches in the Marche.|$|R
5000|$|Quarrels {{over the}} {{inheritance}} lingered. The rupture with Lorenzo il Magnifico {{came to a}} head in October 1484, when the strongman secured the erasure of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's name from the lists of persons eligible for election to the Florentine political institutions. As part of the settlement in 1485, which involved <b>outside</b> arbitration, Lorenzo <b>di</b> Pierfrancesco and his brother Giovanni il Popolano received the Medici family property of Villa Cafaggiolo in the Mugello region. Nonetheless, it was clear that Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco would have to shelve any public office or political ambitions during il Magnifico's rule.|$|R
40|$|DNA index (DI) {{determined}} by flow cytometry and karyotype {{determined by}} conventional methods were obtained on bone marrow samples from 43 haematologically normal subjects and 54 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Twenty one patients had a clonal karyotype abnormality but an additional five had a <b>DI</b> <b>outside</b> the normal range, showing evidence of aneuploidy {{that was not}} available from chromsome preparations. When patients were grouped into those with excess chromosomal material, those with diploid karyotypes, and those {{with a loss of}} chromosomal material, {{there was a significant difference}} among the mean DIs of each group, normal subjects being different from all patient groups. In these patients DI measurements were of value when carried out together with conventional chromsomal analysis in gaining the maximum amount of genetic information when a satisfactory karyotype might not be available or where failure of an abnormal cell population to proliferate might give an incomplete cytogenetic picture. The contribution of non-clonal chromsome loss to the DI is probably significant but has not been quantitated...|$|R
