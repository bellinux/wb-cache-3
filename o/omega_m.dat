40|$|We present {{constraints}} on cosmological parameters using number counts {{as a function}} of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the Planck SZ (PSZ) catalogue. The PSZ is selected through the signature of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, and the sub-sample used here has a signal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster and all but one with a redshift estimate. We discuss the completeness of the sample and our construction of a likelihood analysis. Using a relation between mass M and SZ signal Y calibrated to X-ray measurements, we derive {{constraints on}} the power spectrum amplitude sigma 8 and matter density parameter <b>Omega</b> <b>m</b> in a flat LambdaCDM model. We test the robustness of our estimates and find that possible biases in the Y-M relation and the halo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from the cluster sample. Assuming the X-ray determined mass to be biased low relative to the true mass by between zero and 30 %, motivated by comparison of the observed mass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we find that sigma 8 = 0. 75 ??? 0. 03, <b>Omega</b> <b>m</b> = 0. 29 ??? 0. 02, and sigma 8 (<b>Omega</b> <b>m</b> / 0. 27) 0. 3 = 0. 764 ??? 0. 025. The value of sigma 8 is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a value of 20 % (the central value from numerical simulations) we find sigma 8 (<b>Omega</b> <b>m</b> / 0. 27) 0. 3 = 0. 78 ??? 0. 01 and a tighter one-dimensional range sigma 8 = 0. 77 ??? 0. 02.

Alternatively, consistency with the primary CMB constraints can be achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scales relative to the LambdaCDM model, such as a component of massive neutrinos.

40|$|In {{areas where}} {{tectonics}} and weathering have hydrogeological significance, electrical methods {{can assist in}} mapping the subsurface. In this work, resistivity imaging was used to map fractures, faults and quartz veins emplaced in strongly weathered volcanic rocks. The aim was to map geological units related {{to the formation of}} groundwater systems in the Rio Artiguas basin, Nicaragua. Eight 2 D resistivity surveys selected from two sites with characteristic geological features are discussed in this article. The resistivity lines were carried out with a multi-electrode system together with different electrode geometries. The data inversion was done by applying the robust (L-i-norm) method and a finite element grid to accommodate the steep topography. The data interpretation included numerical modelling to assess the suitability of all used electrode arrays in relation to the expected geological settings. The results indicated a top high resistive layer consisting of colluviums with laterite (> 50 <b>Omega</b> <b>m),</b> underlain by conductive clay weathered layers (10 - 50 <b>Omega</b> <b>m).</b> Below the conductive layer less weathered or fresh rock can be found with higher values (50 - 600 <b>Omega</b> <b>m).</b> The quartz veins and dykes stand out as the highest resistive bodies (100 - 4000 <b>Omega</b> <b>m).</b> The results indicated an overall weathering thickness of 10 - 30 m or more. In conclusion, the extensive resistivity imaging surveys allowed delineation of geological structures and weathering layers throughout the study area. Furthermore, the vertical extension of weathering was examined at all locations. A finite element grid in the inversion prevented distortions arising from topography regardless of the steep slope observed at the survey locations.

With templated electrodeposition, small structures are electrodeposited using a template {{that is the}} inverse of the final desired shape. Dielectrophoresis {{was used for the}} alignment of the as-formed nanowires and nanotubes between prepatterned electrodes. For reproducible nanowire alignment, a universal set of dielectrophoresis parameters to align any arbitrary nanowire material was determined. The parameters include peak-to-peak potential and frequency, thickness of the silicon oxide layer, grounding of the silicon substrate, and nature of the solvent medium used. It involves applying a field with a frequency > 10 (5) Hz, an insulating silicon oxide layer with a thickness of 2. 5 mu m or more, grounding of the underlying silicon substrate, and the use of a solvent medium with a low dielectric constant. In our experiments, we obtained good results by using a peak-to-peak potential of 2. 1 V at a frequency of 1. 2 x 10 (5) Hz. Furthermore, an indirect alignment technique is proposed that prevents short circuiting of nanowires after contacting both electrodes.

The membrane capacitance and input resistance of coupled taste receptor cells were measured to monitor electrical coupling and the results compared with those calculated by a simple model of electrically coupled taste cells.

At 37 degrees C the mean (+/- S. D.) values for the potential and resistance were - 39 +/- 13 mV and 230 +/- 60 <b>M</b> <b>omega</b> (n = 60 eggs). The most negative potential recorded at room temperature was - 51 mV in a cell which had an input resistance of 620 <b>M</b> <b>omega.</b> At 37 degrees C six eggs out of sixty had potentials more negative than - 50 mV and three of these gave all-or-none action potentials in response to depolarizing current pulses. In a separate series of experiments with high resistance micro-electrodes (ca. 100 <b>M</b> <b>omega)</b> six eggs out of twenty-one had potentials more negative than - 50 mV and four of these were electrically excitable. Transient potential recordings during impalement indicated that the potential was more negative than - 30 mV but that the insertion of a micro-electrode produced a leak pathway with a resistance of about 10 <b>M</b> <b>omega,</b> substantially smaller than the steady-state estimates of the input resistance (see above).

The fabricated 140 nm gate length devices shows a low subthreshold swing of 79 mV/decade, which is attributed to the described low temperature gate-last process scheme...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a planar silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) gate power MOSFET (SG-MOSFET) with a 0. 3 mu m ultra-shallow {{heavily doped}} p-body region is presented. The ultra-shallow body {{provides}} a much reduced parasitic JFET resistance, {{resulting in a}} low specific on-resistance of 18 <b>m</b> <b>Omega.</b> mm(2) for a planar device. At the same time, no punch-through problem {{is caused by the}} ultra-shallow body, and the avalanche breakdown voltage of the device is 29. 5 V. The product of the on-resistance and gate charge of the ultra-shallow body SG-MOSFET is 43 <b>m</b> <b>Omega.</b> nC at V-GS = 4. 5 V. The non-optimized performance obtained for this structure is comparable to that of trench power MOSFETs fabricated using more advanced technologies...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{resistance}} (R(s)) of spray pyrolysed Tl 2 Ba 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 OX thick films on 1 inch diameter finely polished yttria-stabilised zirconia disks has been measured using a TE(011) mode end-wall-replacement cavity at 20 GHz and 77 K. R(s) values of 5. 3 <b>m</b> <b>Omega</b> and 1. 3 <b>m</b> <b>Omega</b> at 20 GHz and 10 GHz (scaled assuming an f(2) dependence) respectively were obtained. These results {{are the best}} recorded R(s) values to date for thick films of any superconductor at the same frequencies and at 77 and Transport critical current density (J(c)) measurements on the films exhibited values of > 3 x 10 (4) A/cm(2) at 77 K...|$|R
40|$|The paper reports {{results from}} the {{application}} of the many-electron, many-photon theory on the system 'H- 1 s(2) S- 1 state plus two fields of weak strengths, F- 1 and F- 2 '. The two fields have commensurate frequencies (a), 2 (0) and (omega, 3 omega), with omega ranging from 0. 011 au to 0. 028 au, field strengths from 5 x 10 (- 5) au to 1. 7 x 10 (- 3) au and a phase difference phi. It is possible to determine the regime where the dichromatic field is weak and to define and compute a corresponding 'interference generalized cross-section'. This cross-section is an intrinsic property of each state {{as a function of the}} pair (<b>omega,</b> <b>m</b> <b>omega),</b> <b>m</b> = 2, 3,.... Its knowledge is directly relevant to deciding on the degree of effectiveness of coherent quantum control. The calculations show that, with respect to 0, His more receptive to control if frequencies are low. The computed effects are large enough so as to be measurable...|$|E

Sintering of a mixture of copper particles and copper-based metal-organic-decomposition (MOD) ink gave a copper film with high packing density and low resistivity (9 x 10 (- 6) <b>Omega</b> <b>m).</b> This novel process may open a new strategy {{in the field of}} printed electronics...|$|E
40|$|Electrohydrodynamic {{printing}} of silver ink is demonstrated under an applied pulse voltage. Intermittent cone jets are deposited to form uniform dots {{with a regular}} spacing on glass slides while conductive patterns with continual tracks are derived from overlapping dots. After sintering at 250 degrees C for 20 min, the patterns have a lower resistivity of 3. 07 x 10 (- 8) <b>Omega.</b> <b>m</b> such that a practical application is available in microelectronic devices...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a {{physical vapor deposition}} process for preparing amorphous Cu:Tetracyanoquinodimethane (Cu:TCNQ) thin films. Samples made by this co-evaporation process exhibit a smooth surface in the scanning electron microscope. Spectroscopic studies confirmed {{the formation of a}} charge transfer (CT) complex with a degree of CT of 0. 68. Reproducible resistive switching is observed in a glass/NiCr/Al/Cu:TCNQ/Al sandwich structure. OFF/ON ratios of 10 to 10 (2) and impedance values between 100 k <b>Omega</b> and 10 <b>M</b> <b>Omega</b> have been measured. Switching voltages for the prepared samples with a film thickness of around 100 run are in the range of 4 +/- 2 V and are fairly symmetrical. The devices have a life time of more than 10 (4) switching cycles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{electronic}} changes caused by light-induced isomerization of a photochromic molecule between an open state (that absorbs in the UV to become closed) and a closed state (that absorbs in the visible to become open). Data obtained using a newly developed repetitive break junction method are interpreted in terms of single-molecule resistances of 526 +/- 90 <b>M</b> <b>Omega</b> in the open form and 4 +/- 1 <b>M</b> <b>Omega</b> in the closed form when the molecule is bound between two gold contacts via dithiol linkages. The corresponding ratio of open to closed resistance is {{in close agreement with}} the results of ab initio calculations, though the measured resistances are about half of the calculated values. Optical spectroscopy indicates that the photoisomerization occurs in both directions on small gold particles, evaporated thin gold films, and in the break junction experiments...|$|R
