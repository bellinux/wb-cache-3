50|$|Despite the {{socio-cultural}} {{effects of}} reproduction-art upon the <b>original</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> Benjamin said that “the uniqueness {{of a work}} of art is inseparable from its being embedded in the fabric of tradition”, which separates the <b>original</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> from the reproduction. He also discusses the ritualization of art-reproduction and the emancipation of “the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual.” That the social-value of the exhibition of art progressed from the private sphere to the public sphere of life; historically, works of art were for the private viewing and aesthetic enjoyment of the owner of the artefacts (usually High Art); contemporarily, works of art are exhibited in a public gallery, to provide the enjoyment of aesthetic pleasure to a greater number of people.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, in the {{television}} program Ways of Seeing (1972), John Berger drew from the themes of Walter Benjamin’s essay, and explained the contemporary representations of social-class and racial-caste {{in the production of}} art. That the modern means of artistic production and of artistic reproduction have destroyed the aesthetic, cultural, and political authority of art: “For the first time ever, images of art have become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free”, for lacking the aura of the <b>original</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b>|$|E
50|$|Artist’s Resale Right was {{introduced}} in the UK in February 2006 under Directive (European Union) 2001/84. It entitles artists and their beneficiaries to a royalty from the commercial resale of an <b>original</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> when the sale price reaches or exceeds the sterling equivalent of €1,000. ARR lasts for the lifetime of the creator and for 70 years after the creator’s death. The royalty is calculated on a sliding scale beginning at 4 per cent of the hammer price for the first €50,000.

50|$|In this way, a {{painting}} {{may represent a}} sculpture, and vice versa; a poem portray a picture; a sculpture depict a heroine of a novel; in fact, given the right circumstances, any art may describe any other art, especially if a rhetorical element, standing for the sentiments of the artist when she/he created her/his work, is present. For instance, the distorted faces in a crowd in {{a painting}} depicting an <b>original</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> a sullen countenance {{on the face of}} a sculpture representing a historical figure, or a film showing particularly dark aspects of neo-Gothic architecture, are all examples of ekphrasis.|$|E

30|$|Thus, {{this method}} is well adapted to study the {{temporal}} evolution of the stratigraphy in test specimens and offers an alternative to destructive sampling <b>of</b> <b>original</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> In a fashion {{very similar to that}} used with high magnification optical microscopes, the laminographic technique allows to obtain detailed morphological images at any depth in an (optically opaque) paint layer stack [31, 32]. CXL thus presents a non-invasive and non-destructive alternative to sampling and polishing where such fine structure needs to be preserved. The technique has a high potential in studying conservation problems on test specimens or <b>original</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> where the microstructure of carrier, ground or paint is of importance but sample removal is to be avoided.|$|R
