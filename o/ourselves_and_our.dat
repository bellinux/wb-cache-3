500|$|During {{the lead}} up to the War of 1812, Wodrow chaired an anti-war meeting in Hampshire County at which those {{assembled}} objected to a heedless rush to war with the British, which was in line with contemporary Federalist principles. According to historian Stuart L. Butler, Wodrow and the meeting's attendees felt that: to involve [...] in an expensive and uncertain war, for purposes not absolutely necessary, and entail taxes and misery on <b>ourselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> posterity, when we might enjoy the blessings of peace and plenty and a good price for our produce on terms as honorable at least as those for {{the last fifteen years}} past, would appear to them the extreme of folly, little short of madness. Wodrow and the committee believed that within two years of the war's beginning, it would become unpopular because of the need for increased taxation and prolonged military service. Wodrow and the committee stated, [...] "the nation would rise in its constitutional strength, and say to those who brought about such an unpropitious state of things, 'depart from ye wicked.'" ...|$|E
500|$|At {{a council}} at Kingston upon Thames in 838, Ecgberht and Æthelwulf granted {{land to the}} sees of Winchester and Canterbury {{in return for the}} promise of support for Æthelwulf's claim to the throne. The {{archbishop}} of Canterbury, Ceolnoth, also accepted Ecgberht and Æthelwulf as the lords and protectors of the monasteries under Ceolnoth's control. These agreements, along with a later charter in which Æthelwulf confirmed church privileges, suggest that the church had recognised that Wessex was a new political power that must be dealt with. Churchmen consecrated the king at coronation ceremonies, and helped to write the wills which specified the king's heir; their support had real value in establishing West Saxon control and a smooth succession for Ecgberht's line. Both the record of the Council of Kingston, and another charter of that year, include the identical phrasing: that a condition of the grant is that [...] "we <b>ourselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>our</b> heirs shall always hereafter have firm and unshakable friendships from Archbishop Ceolnoth and his congregation at Christ Church." ...|$|E
