5|$|Speaking on the {{evolving}} relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack {{believes that the}} season six introduction <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Olsen into Chloe's life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe would drop anything for Clark, but now that Chloe has other priorities, it makes Clark realize how valuable she is to him. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark's secret, as well as keeping {{the fact that she}} is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe's heart that Clark occupied for so long.|$|E
5|$|Clinton won the 1992 presidential {{election}} (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (0 electoral votes), who ran {{as an independent}} on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was {{a significant part of}} Clinton's success. Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress, the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Carter.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these and}} {{numerous}} other influences, however, Shelly Manne's style of drumming was always his ownpersonal, precise, clear, {{and at the same}} time multilayered, using a very broad range of colors. Manne was often experimental, and had participated in such musically exploratory groups of the early 1950s as those <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Giuffre and Teddy Charles. Yet his playing never became overly cerebral, and he never neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.|$|E
5|$|During Barnes' {{first full}} {{season in the}} first team Manchester City enjoyed a {{successful}} run in the FA Cup. As a top-flight team Manchester City entered the competition in the third round, facing Derby County. Barnes scored the opening goal in a 3–1 win, his first goal in professional football. A derby victory against Manchester United and a win against Luton Town followed, setting up a quarter-final against his boyhood heroes Birmingham City. Single goal victories against Birmingham and Sunderland gave City {{a place in the}} final, where they faced Newcastle United. However, hampered by the loss <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Meadows to injury after 18 minutes, City were beaten 3–1.|$|E
5|$|He adopted {{his crew}} cut hair style while {{serving in the}} United States Marine Corps. Carey has had {{refractive}} surgery to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him). However, while this was true for several years, on the May 17, 2006, episode <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Kimmel Live! he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals. As of 2007, Carey resides in Los Angeles and New York City.|$|E

Targeting the same audience, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs used Conan {{and his friends}} in two pamphlets: one to promote the ministry's mission, the other to introduce the 34th G8 summit held {{in the country in}} 2010. Several characters in the series featured in the sixth installment of the Anime, Heroes and Heroines commemorative stamp series issued by Japan Post in 2006. Aoyama and his creations are celebrated in his hometown Hokuei, Tottori; a museum with exhibits of his work is located there, and several bronze statues <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Kudo, Conan Edogawa, and Rachel Moore are installed in various locations throughout the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} round, Arsenal played the cup holders Chelsea at home. Throughout the tie, Arsenal's centre-back {{partnership}} of Oleh Luzhny and Igors Stepanovs struggled against the pace <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Floyd Hasselbaink, who equalised for Chelsea after Thierry Henry gave the home side the lead. Wiltord replaced Robert Pirès {{in the second}} half and scored twice to settle the match. In the sixth round, Arsenal enjoyed a comfortable win against Blackburn Rovers of the First Division, where Wiltord continued his run scoring in each round of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Quadrophenia was revived for a {{film version}} in 1979, {{directed}} by Franc Roddam. The film attempted to portray an accurate visual interpretation of Townshend's vision <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> and his surroundings, and included Phil Daniels as Jimmy and Sting as the Ace Face. Unlike the Tommy film, the music was largely relegated to the background, and was not performed by the cast as in a rock opera. The film soundtrack included three additional songs written by Townshend, which were Kenney Jones' first recordings as an official member of the Who. The film was a commercial and critical success, as it conveniently coincided with the mod revival movement of the late 1970s.|$|E

Nixon was a descendant of the early American settler, Thomas Cornell, who was also an ancestor of Ezra Cornell, the founder of Cornell University, as well as <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Carter and Bill Gates.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which {{involves}} the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike. The body of the union president is seen buried under a football field, a homage to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey's Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns' outfit in the flashback to his childhood is based on Buster Brown. Homer's imagination of a life of organized crime is based on Don Fanucci's first appearance in The Godfather Part II, accepting donuts rather than a necklace and an orange.|$|E
5|$|After Sim Snuka, the son <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Snuka, also {{expressed}} interest in joining the group, Orton made them qualify {{through a series of}} tests which Manu failed the first week. On the January 5 episode of Raw, Snuka and Rhodes won a tag team match against Cryme Tyme. Before the match, Orton informed them that they had to win the match in order {{to be part of the}} group. After the match, Orton explained that since Snuka did not pick up the pinfall, he was out of the group. The following week, Manu and Snuka informed Rhodes that they were intending to assault Orton and had brought someone to help them do so, giving Rhodes an ultimatum to choose a side. When Rhodes refused to side with them, Manu and Snuka brought out a returning Ted DiBiase to aid them, and tried to assault Rhodes and Orton. Instead DiBiase joined The Legacy, attacking Manu and Snuka, and forgiving Orton for attacking him.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{starting}} well {{upon returning}} to the First Division, Dick Campbell was sacked on 27 March 2007, following a succession of poor results. A caretaker management team <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Bone and Terry Butcher saw out the season before Ian McCall, a former player, was unveiled as manager. McCall's first season saw Thistle finish 6th in the First Division and embark on a successful Scottish Cup campaign, reaching the quarter-finals before being defeated by eventual winners Rangers after a 1–1 draw at Ibrox, Thistle lost the replay 2–0 at Firhill. League form further improved in season 2008–09 with Thistle exceeding expectations to finish 2nd in the First Division, behind St Johnstone. This season saw midfielder Gary Harkins win the Irn Bru Phenomenal Player of the Year and Jonathan Tuffey become the club's first full international for several years.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the sale}} <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Case, Kennedy began to become disillusioned with Liverpool, {{and was sent}} off twice {{in the space of}} a few weeks early in the 1981–82 season – the first red cards of his career. He made his final league {{appearance}} for the club on 5 December, when he scored in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. His final cup game for the club came eight days later, in a 3–0 defeat to Brazilian side Flamengo in the 1981 Intercontinental Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium. He was replaced in the team by Ronnie Whelan. Liverpool went on to win the league title after finishing four points ahead of second-place Ipswich Town, and Kennedy's 15 league appearances in the first half of the campaign were enough to earn him another league championship medal. Sunderland attempted to sign him on loan in January 1982, but were denied by Liverpool, and Kennedy could not agree personal terms with manager Alan Durban so was not signed by Sunderland on a permanent transfer.|$|E
5|$|Galvis {{was born}} in Punto Fijo, Falcón, Venezuela, and played Little League Baseball {{including}} the Little League World Series there before being discovered {{by one of the}} Phillies' scouts in the area. At age 16, he signed a contract with the Phillies despite not receiving much attention from scouts. He went on to spend the next several years in their minor league system, including a particularly lengthy stint with the Reading Phillies, the Phillies' Double-A (AA) affiliate. In 2012, he made his major league debut on opening day at second base, substituting for the injured Chase Utley. He became a fan favorite for his performance early in the season, especially on defense, until he sustained an injury, and subsequently was suspended 50 games after a positive test for performance-enhancing drugs. He missed the remainder of the season. Over {{the course of the next}} two seasons, he split time between the Lehigh Valley IronPigs – the Phillies' Triple-A affiliate – and the major league ball club, but struggled to establish himself offensively. Entering 2015, his future with the club was uncertain, though with the departure <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Rollins he was a candidate to be the team's starting shortstop.|$|E

5|$|In November 1949, {{following}} the death <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Dunne, Paddy Coad reluctantly accepted the position of player-manager having played with the club for almost eight years, in which time he had established himself {{as one of the}} best players in the League of Ireland. Coad opted for a radical youth policy and over the course of his first three years in charge, signed virtually the entire schoolboy international side to Rovers. He employed revolutionary training methods with extra emphasis on technical skill and possession which resulted in a fast, passing style of football that contributed significantly to the development of the game in Ireland. In 1954, the club won the League of Ireland for the first time in fifteen years, while Paddy Ambrose finished the season as the team's leading scorer. Led by players like Liam Tuohy and Coad himself, the team known as Coad's Colts proceeded to win two more League titles and two FAI Cups, concluding the golden era of Irish football as one of its most successful teams.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some Like It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E
5|$|Marge's absence is {{felt at home}} as Homer and {{the rest}} of the family struggles to cope without her. Without Marge, the house shortly becomes a {{complete}} wreck.

Instead they purchase one <b>of</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Carter. The townspeople are enraged by this, and riot. When Marge is released from jail, the townspeople welcome her back and apologize for suspecting her. They even unveil a statue for Marge, though it is just the Carter statue with Marge's hair added to it. The last scene shows Bart and Lisa playing on the statue, which has been converted into a tether ball post.|$|E
