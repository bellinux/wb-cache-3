5|$|In January 1898, Spain promised some {{concessions}} to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed. Public attention focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> and the consensus was that regardless of who set the bomb, Spain had lost control over Cuba. McKinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine whether the explosion was accidental. Negotiations with Spain continued as the court considered the evidence, but on March 20, {{the court ruled that}} the Maine was blown up by an underwater mine. As pressure for war mounted in Congress, McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence. Spain refused McKinley's proposals, and on April 11, McKinley turned the matter over to Congress. He did not ask for war, but Congress declared war anyway on April 20, with the addition of the Teller Amendment, which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba.|$|E

25|$|The event led to {{security}} and political repercussions in Russia; most notably, it {{contributed to a}} series of federal government reforms consolidating power in the Kremlin and strengthening of the powers of the President of Russia. As of 2016, aspects of the crisis in relation to the militants continue to be contentious: questions remain regarding how many terrorists were involved, the nature of their preparations and whether a section of the group had escaped. Questions about the Russian government's management of the crisis have also persisted, including allegations of disinformation and censorship in news media, whether the journalists who were present at Beslan were allowed to freely report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> the nature and content of negotiations with the terrorists, allocation of responsibility for the eventual outcome, and perceptions that excessive force was used.|$|E

25|$|On 24 August 2007 Niger's {{president}} Mamadou Tandja {{declared a}} state of alert in the Agadez Region, giving the security forces extra powers to fight the insurgency. This marks only the third such declaration {{in the history of the}} Republic. It was unclear by late September whether the violence had lessened in northern Niger as a result of negotiations with the MNJ, or whether new violence was simply being effectively suppressed. Organisations such as the Committee to Protect Journalists reported the arrest without trial of over 100 northerners in the wake of the declaration, including those who tried to lead a peace march in Agadez. In July, the only daily paper in Agadez was shut down by the government for publishing news of the rebellion, and Bamako based journalists have been similarly threatened. Domestic human rights groups claim there has been an effort to keep foreign journalists from reporting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> in Niger, and this could account for the seeming shift of rebel violence to Mali.|$|E
25|$|While {{popular with}} the electorate, Trudeau's promised minor reforms {{had little effect on}} the growing rate of inflation, and he {{struggled}} with conflicting advice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> In September 1975 the popular Finance Minister John Turner resigned over a perceived lack of support in countervailing measures. In October 1975, in an embarrassing about-face, Trudeau and new Finance Minister Donald Macdonald introduced wage and price controls by passing the Anti-Inflation Act. The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted a Supreme Court reference that only upheld the legislation as an emergency requiring Federal intervention under the British North America Act. During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with CTV, Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly neoliberal business leaders.|$|E
500|$|A {{shift in}} {{location}} in the sequel reflected {{some of the changes}} in the world since then: while the New York Stock Exchange and its trading floor had featured heavily in the first film, they are less prominent in the second. Instead, more time is spent at the Federal Reserve Building, reflecting its new position as a [...] "bulwark of the system" [...] according to Stone. The location provided a link to the contemporary crisis the film examines, since September 2008 it has been an important site for meeting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b>|$|E

500|$|Whitlam remains well {{remembered for}} the {{circumstances}} of his dismissal. It is a legacy he did little to efface; he wrote a 1979 book, The Truth of the Matter (the title is a play on that of Kerr's 1978 memoir, Matters for Judgment) and devoted part of his subsequent book, Abiding Interests, to {{the circumstances of}} his removal. According to journalist and author Paul Kelly, who penned two books <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> Whitlam [...] "achieved a paradoxical triumph: the shadow of the dismissal has obscured the sins of his government".|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, the British press {{remained}} {{quiet on}} the subject until Alfred Blunt, Bishop of Bradford, gave a speech to his diocesan conference on 1 December, which alluded to the King's need of divine grace: [...] "We hope that he is aware of his need. Some of us wish that he gave more positive signs of his awareness." [...] The press took this for the first public comment by a notable person <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> and it became front page news the following day. When asked about it later, however, the bishop claimed he had not heard of Simpson {{at the time he}} wrote the speech. Acting on the advice of Edward's staff, Simpson left Britain for the south of France two days later in an attempt to escape intense press attention. Both she and the King were devastated by the separation. At a tearful departure, the King told her, [...] "I shall never give you up." ...|$|E
500|$|Kerr rang Whitlam on Sunday 19 October, asking {{permission}} {{to consult with}} the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Garfield Barwick, concerning the crisis. Whitlam advised Kerr not to do so, noting that no Governor-General had consulted with a Chief Justice under similar circumstances since 1914, when Australia was at a much earlier stage of her constitutional development. On 21 October, Kerr phoned Whitlam regarding the Ellicott opinion, and asked, [...] "It's all bullshit, isn't it?". Whitlam agreed with Kerr's view. Kerr then requested that the Government provide him with a written legal opinion rebutting Ellicott's views. Kerr would receive no written advice from the Government until 6 November. Journalist and author Paul Kelly, who wrote two books <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> paints this delay as a major mistake by Whitlam, given Kerr's judicial background. Kerr also asked on 21 October for Whitlam's {{permission to}} interview Fraser, which the Prime Minister readily granted, {{and the two men}} met that night. Fraser told Kerr that the Opposition were determined to block supply. Fraser indicated that the Opposition's decision to defer the appropriation bills, rather than defeating them, was a tactical decision, since then the bills would remain in the control of the Senate and could be passed at any time. He stated that the Coalition agreed with the Ellicott opinion, and proposed to continue deferring supply while it awaited events. The media were not told of the substance of the conversation, and instead reported that Kerr had reprimanded Fraser for blocking supply, causing the Governor-General's office to issue a denial.|$|E
