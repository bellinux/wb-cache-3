500|$|In September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, {{who plays}} Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his {{character}} was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed {{due to the}} end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not [...] "want to reveal where [...] and why" [...] in this film. Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, [...] "You've got to kind <b>of</b> <b>choose</b> your roster [...] depending on what kind of fight you want to have." [...] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear {{at the very end of}} the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, [...] " [...] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [...] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just to put in a little extra filigree on our movie." [...] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross [...] "was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix." [...] Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.|$|E
2500|$|The 1976 {{publication}} <b>of</b> <b>Choose</b> Life: A Dialogue (in Japanese, Nijusseiki e no taiga) is {{the published}} record of dialogues and correspondences {{that began in}} 1971 between Ikeda and British historian Arnold J. Toynbee about the [...] "convergence of East and West" [...] on contemporary as well as perennial topics ranging from the human condition {{to the role of}} religion and the future of human civilization. Toynbee's 12-volume A Study of History had been translated into Japanese, which along with his lecture tours and periodical articles about social, moral and religious issues gained him popularity in Japan. To an expat's letter critical of Toynbee's association with Ikeda and Soka Gakkai, Toynbee wrote back: [...] "I agree with Soka Gakkai on religion as {{the most important thing in}} human life, and on opposition to militarism and war." [...] To another letter critical of Ikeda, Toynbee responded: [...] "Mr. Ikeda's personality is strong and dynamic and such characters are often controversial. My own feeling for Mr. Ikeda is one of great respect and sympathy." [...] As of 2012, the book had been translated and published in twenty-six languages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Template Attacks {{are widely}} {{accepted}} {{to be the}} most power-ful side-channel attacks from an information theoretic point of view. For classical Template Attacks, several papers suggested an accepted guide-line <b>of</b> <b>choosing</b> interesting points. The accepted guideline is that one should only choose one point as the interesting point per clock cycle. Up to now, many methods <b>of</b> <b>choosing</b> interesting points were intro-duced. However, it is still unclear that which method will lead to the best classification performance for Template Attacks. In this paper, we comprehensively compare the classification performance of Template At-tacks when using different known methods <b>of</b> <b>choosing</b> interesting points. Evaluation results show that CPA based method and SOST will lead to the best classification performance. Moreover, we find that some of the methods <b>of</b> <b>choosing</b> interesting points are essentially equivalent. In addi-tional, we give out a more reasonable proof about the accepted guideline <b>of</b> <b>choosing</b> interesting points for Template Attacks by presenting a new way of conducting Template Attacks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel account of why intertemporal {{decisions}} tend to display impatience: People {{pay more attention}} to the opportunity costs <b>of</b> <b>choosing</b> larger, later rewards than to the opportunity costs <b>of</b> <b>choosing</b> smaller, sooner ones. Eight studies show that when the opportunity costs <b>of</b> <b>choosing</b> smaller, sooner rewards are subtly highlighted, people become more patient, whereas highlighting the opportunity costs <b>of</b> <b>choosing</b> larger, later rewards has no effect. This pattern is robust to variations in the choice task, to the participant population, and is observed for both incentivized and hypothetical choices. We argue that people are naturally aware of the opportunity costs associated with delayed rewards, but pay less attention to those associated with taking smaller, sooner ones. We conclude by discussing implications for theory and policy...|$|R
