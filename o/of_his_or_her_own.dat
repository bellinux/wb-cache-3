5|$|The game {{is played}} by first {{introducing}} the central character. Three contestants are then introduced, each accompanied by three pieces of baggage: a small one, a medium one, and a large one, with each one containing a corresponding secret. The central contestant also has a piece of baggage <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> which is only revealed {{at the end of}} the show. During the show, three possible secrets about the central contestant are given, one of which is the actual secret contained in their baggage. These secrets can include bad habits, strange relationship preferences, issues with one's past, or strange hobbies. After the three other contestants are introduced, they each open the smallest piece of baggage, and explain the secrets they contain.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook, river forecast products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and dense fog. There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> sector. Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks, coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters.|$|E

25|$|Lyric poetry, {{in which}} the poet speaks <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> {{feelings}} {{in the first person}} and expresses a mood, was not especially common in the Restoration period. Poets expressed their points of view in other forms, usually public or formally disguised poetic forms such as odes, pastoral poetry, and ariel verse. One of the characteristics of the period is its devaluation of individual sentiment and psychology in favour of public utterance and philosophy. The sorts of lyric poetry found later in the Churchyard Poets would, in the Restoration, only exist as pastorals.|$|E
25|$|Stories tend to {{be based}} on experiential {{learning}}, but learning from an experience is not automatic. Often a person needs to attempt {{to tell the story of}} that experience before realizing its value. In this case, it is not only the listener who learns, but the teller who also becomes aware <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> unique experiences and background. This process of storytelling is empowering as the teller effectively conveys ideas and, with practice, is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment. Storytelling taps into existing knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of {{the medical}} considerations, Jehovah Witnesses {{advocate}} that physicians should uphold {{the right of a}} patient to choose what treatments they do or do not accept (though a Witness is subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion). Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects that a patient incurred out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> requests. However, the point of view that physicians must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France.|$|E
25|$|Land cards tap {{to produce}} mana {{that is used}} to cast spells and {{activate}} abilities. They cost no mana to play; however, a player may play no more than one land per turn, and only during the main phase <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> turn. There are six types of basic lands (Mountain, Plains, Forest, Island, Swamp, and Wastes), one for each color (plus Wastes for colorless). These lands can each be tapped to produce one mana of the appropriate color. Other lands are non-basic and may produce other combinations or amounts of mana, or may have other abilities. Lands are not spells and cannot be countered. Playing a land does not use the stack and therefore occurs immediately, with no way for any player to stop it. Players are allowed to have any number of basic lands in a deck, but nonbasic lands follow the usual restriction of four copies of any one card per deck.|$|E

The non-Jewish partner making this commitment became a [...] "ger toshav", or [...] "non-Jewish member of the Jewish people".|$|E

500|$|Social critics accuse governments, corporations, and {{the mass}} media of being {{involved}} in the manufacturing of a national consensus and, paradoxically, a culture of fear due to the potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power. The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of mind control—a broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions. These tactics are said to include everything from Manchurian candidate-style brainwashing of sleeper agents (Project MKULTRA, [...] "Project Monarch") to engineering psychological operations (water fluoridation, subliminal advertising, [...] "Silent Sound Spread Spectrum", MEDUSA) and parapsychological operations (Stargate Project) to influence the masses. The concept of wearing a tin foil hat for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists.|$|E
500|$|The Satanic Bible is a {{collection}} of essays, observations, and rituals published by Anton LaVey in 1969. It is the central religious text of LaVeyan Satanism, and is considered the foundation of its philosophy and dogma. It has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism. Though The Satanic Bible is not considered to be sacred scripture {{in the way that the}} Christian Bible is to Christianity, LaVeyan Satanists regard it as an authoritative text as it is a contemporary text that has attained for them scriptural status. It extols the virtues of exploring one's own nature and instincts. Believers have been described as [...] "atheistic Satanists" [...] because they believe that God is not an external entity, but rather something that each person creates as a projection <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> personality—a benevolent and stabilizing force in his or her life. There have been thirty printings of The Satanic Bible, through which it has sold over a million copies.|$|E
500|$|The Satanic Bible often {{uses the}} terms [...] "God" [...] and [...] "Satan" [...] interchangeably, except when {{referring}} to the concepts of these as viewed by other religions. LaVey also occasionally uses the term [...] "God" [...] to refer to other religions' views of God, and [...] "Satan" [...] or synonyms {{to refer to the}} idea of god as interpreted by LaVeyan Satanism, as when he writes, [...] "When all religious faith in lies has waned, it is because man has become closer to himself and farther from 'God'; closer to the 'Devil.'" [...] Throughout The Satanic Bible, the LaVeyan Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true [...] "self"—a projection <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> personality—not an external deity. Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism. Satan is also used {{as a metaphor for the}} ideas connected with the early Christian view of Satan or the serpent: wise, defiant, questioning, and free-thinking. LaVey discusses this extensively in The Book of Lucifer, explaining that the gods worshipped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of narcissism that would accompany self-worship.|$|E
