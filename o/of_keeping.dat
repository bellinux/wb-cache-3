As a result of the cycling, he has lost 25 pounds from his final playing weight of 240 pounds.|$|E

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means <b>of</b> <b>keeping</b> them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with the}} Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E

5|$|In the {{interests}} <b>of</b> <b>keeping</b> the bread kosher (Angel Bakeries carries the hechsher {{of both the}} Edah HaChareidis and the Orthodox Union), Angel's son Ovadia, a trained chemist, collaborated with others at the Angel's-owned Adumim Chemicals plant {{to develop a new}} formula for the emulsifiers that bind water and oil in the bread-making process. In those early days, emulsifiers were made with animal-based fats which were not kosher. Ovadia Angel and his team produced emulsifiers from hydrogenated fats, a vegetable-based source, and later sold this new knowledge to other companies.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} <b>of</b> <b>keeping</b> the strip exciting, {{it seemed that}} no season for Melchester Rovers could ever consist of mid-table obscurity. Almost every year, the club was either competing for the major honours {{at the top of}} the domestic and European game, or struggling against relegation to lower divisions. Often, such spells of good and bad fortune and form would directly succeed one another—a Rovers team that won the European Cup one year could find itself struggling to stay in Division One the next.|$|E

The dispute was initially tried at the Guildhall in London on 6March 1783, with the Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, overseeing the trial before a jury.

5|$|Luxembourg {{has been}} an {{independent}} grand duchy since 9 June 1815. Originally, Luxembourg was in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 16 March 1815 until 23 November 1890. While Wilhelmina succeeded Willem III in the Netherlands, this was not possible in Luxembourg due {{to the order of}} succession being based on Salic law at that time; he was succeeded instead by Adolphe. In a referendum held on 28 September 1919, 80.34 per cent voted in favor <b>of</b> <b>keeping</b> the monarchy. The current monarch is Henri.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the writing's mixed reception, critics were unanimous in acknowledging the power <b>of</b> Charles <b>Keeping's</b> illustrations. In an otherwise scathing review, Garner called them [...] "a singular vision of what Classical myth must have been. Two drawings especially [...] Cronos and Prometheus [...] are more terrible and beautiful than Goya." [...] Manning stated that Keeping's [...] "contributions are magnificent... From this book, it is <b>Keeping's</b> interpretation <b>of</b> the 'enormous violent energy' of the Greek myths that will be remembered." [...] The Spectator called the illustrations [...] "totems of potency"; Contemporary Review said the [...] "bold, forceful and imaginative illustrations" [...] added to the [...] "dramatic presentation of the myths." [...] Hughes saw the illustrations as [...] "relating the stories to the primitive roots of myth, {{rather than to the}} civilized commentators, taking the stories from scholarship and handing them back to imagination." [...] Writing on the occasion <b>of</b> <b>Keeping's</b> nomination for the 1974 Hans Christian Andersen Award, a reviewer in The Times singled out the illustrations for The God Beneath the Sea and its sequel The Golden Shadow as [...] "probably the most striking evidence <b>of</b> <b>Keeping's</b> forceful presence".|$|R

Predicted total heat flux is approximately 104–5 W/m2 at the planet's surface; for comparison the surface heat flux for Io is around 3 W/m2. This is similar to the radiative energy it receives from its parent star of about 40,000 W/m2.|$|E

Tom Crean was in more immediate charge as head dog-handler. Other crew included James, Hussey, Greenstreet, a carpenter Henry McNeish, and Clark (the biologist).

5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>keeping</b> the mouth clean {{and is a}} means of preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders.

Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E

In the same year, attempts by the Yugoslav government to disarm and conscript Kosovo Albanians were met by revolts. Pećanac was sent to Kosovo to form detachments made up of local Serbs to fight the rebels. This resulted in rebel attacks on Serb villages.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario 3D Land was {{designed}} {{to bridge the gap}} between 2D Mario games and 3D Mario games, and influenced by Miyamoto's philosophy <b>of</b> <b>keeping</b> the games fun in nature and making sure the player had the utmost opportunity to enjoy the experience of the game. A main concern during development was making a game that would appeal to fans of the 2D Super Mario games as well as the 3D games; levels were designed so that the player would not get lost, moving Mario in one general direction towards each level's goal.|$|E
