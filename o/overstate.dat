Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did <b>overstate</b> Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command did not come to expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to <b>overstate</b> the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E

As the first black-Native sculptor of either sex to achieve international recognition within a western sculptural tradition, Lewis was a symbolic and social anomaly within a dominantly white bourgeois and aristocratic community.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates how {{manipulating}} different earnings components {{will affect}} the likelihood of accounting-related shareholder litigation. Firms can manipulate earnings upward by accelerating revenue recognition, understating expenses, and <b>overstating</b> gains associated with special items. Firms can manipulate earnings downward by delaying revenue recognition, <b>overstating</b> expenses, and <b>overstating</b> losses associated with special items. This paper finds that firms accelerating revenue recognition or taking abnormal large losses through special items {{are more likely to}} be associated with accountingrelated shareholder litigation. Such association only exists in the post-PSLRA period...|$|R

25|$|Economist Bryan Caplan {{argues that}} many Austrians have not {{understood}} valid contributions of modern mainstream economics, {{causing them to}} <b>overstate</b> their differences with it. For example, Murray Rothbard stated that he objected {{to the use of}} cardinal utility in microeconomic theory. Caplan says that Rothbard did not understand the position he was attacking, because microeconomic theorists go to great pains to show that their results hold for any monotonic transformation of an ordinal utility function, and do not entail cardinal utility.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{question}} as to whether having children really is such a positive contribution to the world in an age when there are many concerns about overpopulation, pollution and depletion of non-renewable resources. Some critics counter that such analyses of having children may understate its potential benefits to society (e.g. a greater labor force, which may provide greater opportunity to solve social problems) and <b>overstate</b> the costs. That is, there is often a need for a non-zero birth rate.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{history of}} the court is {{commonly}} summarised by reference to the Chief Justice of the time. While it is a convenient way of breaking the {{history of the}} Court into periods, it tends to <b>overstate</b> the importance of the Chief Justice and ignores the influence and tenure of other members of the Court. For example, Isaacs J was the primary force in the Knox Court, while the time of his own appointment as Chief Justice saw the emergence of Dixon J as the new intellectual leader of the Court.|$|E

25|$|The metaphysical and cosmological {{significance}} of marriage within Islam – particularly within Sufism or Islamic mysticism – {{is difficult to}} <b>overstate.</b> The relationship and interplay {{between male and female}} is viewed as nothing less than that between heaven (represented by the husband) and earth (symbolised by the wife). Because of her beauty and virtue, the earth is eminently lovable: heaven marries her not simply out of duty, but for pleasure and joy. Marriage and sexual intercourse are not merely human phenomena, but the universal power of productivity found within every level of existence: sex within marriage is the supreme instance of witnessing God in the full splendour of His self-disclosure.|$|E
25|$|An oft-cited {{academic}} paper (Kaplan and Schoar, 2005) {{suggests that}} the net-of-fees returns to PE funds are roughly comparable to the S 500 (or even slightly under). This analysis may actually <b>overstate</b> the returns because it relies on voluntarily reported data and hence suffers from survivorship bias (i.e. funds that fail won't report data). One should also note that these returns are not risk-adjusted. A more recent paper (Harris, Jenkinson and Kaplan, 2012) found that average buyout fund returns in the U.S. have actually exceeded that of public markets. These findings were supported by earlier work, using a different data set (Robinson and Sensoy, 2011).|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} openly {{published}} {{information on the}} device shipments of desktop and laptop computers. Gartner publishes estimates, but the way the estimates are calculated is not openly published. Another source of market share of various operating systems is StatCounter basing its estimate on web use (although {{this may not be}} very accurate). Also, sales may <b>overstate</b> usage. Most computers are sold with a pre-installed operating system (OS); some users replace that OS with a different one due to personal preference, or install another OS alongside it and use both. Conversely, sales underestimate usage by not counting unauthorized copies. For example, in 2009, approximately 80% of software sold in China were due to copyright infringement. In 2007, the statistics from an automated update of IE7 for registered Windows computers differed with the observed web browser share, leading one writer to estimate that 25–35% of all Windows XP installations were illegal.|$|E

40|$|If {{official}} figures <b>overstated</b> {{the growth}} of banking output in the UK in the recent boom, {{does this mean that}} GDP growth was <b>overstated</b> too? The answer is no. It is truer to say that if banking output was <b>overstated</b> then the output of some other industry or industries must have been understated, leaving GDP relatively unaffected. The reason is that the Office for National Statistics measures the real growth of GDP primarily from the expenditure side. And from the expenditure side most of the problematic part of banking output drops out since it constitutes intermediate consumption not final expenditure. Consequently, the effect of any mis-measurement of banking output on GDP growth in the boom of 2000 - 2007 is likely to have been small: GDP growth might have been <b>overstated</b> by about 0. 1 % p. a...|$|R

25|$|Two Oaxacans, Benito Juarez and Porfirio Díaz were {{prominent}} {{players in}} the Reform War. It is difficult to <b>overstate</b> Juárez's meaning to the state. He was born on March 21, 1806 {{in the village of}} San Pablo Guelatao and was full blooded Zapotec. He began his career studying to be a priest then a lawyer. In 1847, Juarez became governor of Oaxaca, but still faced stern opposition from conservatives such as Lope San Germán. With the success of the Plan de Ayutla, Juarez became governor again, and worked to remove privileges and properties from the Church and landed classes. The Constitution of 1857, was ratified in Oaxaca city, and Juarez left the governor's position to become President of Mexico. He was president during one of Mexico's most turbulent times, fighting invading French forces and conservatives. As a liberal, he imposed many of the reforms which remain today including those in education and separation of church and state. He is also considered to be a legend and a symbol for the indigenous population of the state.|$|E
