50|$|The umu operon {{is useful}} {{as it is}} likely to be more {{involved}} in mutageneis than the other known SOS genes (Kato and Shinoura, 1977), and can be taken advantage of in the same way as the SOS Chromotest. Taking advantage of the <b>operon</b> <b>fusion</b> placing the lac operon (responsible for producing beta-galactosidase, a protein which degrades lactose) under the control of an SOS-related protein, a simple colorimetric assay for genotoxicity is possible. If a genotoxin is present, the resulting DNA damage will result in the production of beta-galactosidase instead of DNA repair as a result of the gene fusion. A lactose analog is added to the media which is degraded by the beta-galactosidase, producing a colored compound which can be measured quantitatively through spectrophotometry. The degree of color development is a direct measure of the amount of beta-galactosidase produce, which itself is directly related to the extent of DNA damage.|$|E

Thirteen anaerobically inducible and six aerobically inducible <b>operon</b> <b>fusions</b> were identified. Based on control by the oxrA and oxrB regulatory loci, the anti-lacZ fusions were grouped into three classes: class I loci were regulated by both oxr loci, class II genes were regulated by oxrA only, and class III loci were not affected by either regulatory locus. Several of the anti-lacZ fusions required growth in complex medium before they exhibited the inducible phenotype. While the expression {{of some of these}} loci was repressed when organisms were grown in nitrate, others were stimulated by nitrate. Fusions into the hyd and phs loci were identified among the isolated anti-lacZ fusions. Six oxygen-inducible (oxi) <b>operon</b> <b>fusions</b> were also identified. Two of the oxi loci mapped near oxygen-regulatory loci: oxiC near oxrA and oxiE near oxyR. However, neither fusion appeared to occur within the regulatory locus.

Strains with a fimD-lac <b>operon</b> <b>fusion,</b> in which lac, rather than fimD, expression {{is under the}} control of the fimD promoter, undergo Lac+ in equilibrium Lac- phase variation, instead. After positioning a lambda prophage adjacent to the <b>operon</b> <b>fusion,</b> we were able to isolate specialized lambda phage carrying both the fimD-lac fusion and the phase variation control region. Introduction of such phage into an Fim+ strain resulted in construction of a strain with a double, independently switching phenotype (Fim+ in equilibrium Fim- and Lac+ in equilibrium Lac-), demonstrating that the region controlling phase variation is contiguous with the fimD-lac <b>operon</b> <b>fusion</b> and is cis acting. When the specialized lambda phage was propagated on a delta lac delta fim strain, phase variation occurred within the plaques, confirming that the phase variation control region is carried on the specialized transducing phage. All lysogens acquired the Lac+ in equilibrium Lac- phenotype, except for two nonswitching Lac+ recombinants, which acquired Lac+ in equilibrium Lac- phase variation only by trans complementation with fim. Phase variation of type 1 fimbriae, therefore, appears to involve both a cis-active element, which is cloned on a specialized lambda phage, and a trans-active permissive factor, which is not present on the phage, but rather must be supplied by the recipient strain in the transduction...|$|E

Overproducing NusA (but not IF 2) from a multicopy plasmid reduces the level of beta-galactosidase from the fusions indicating repression of the operon. Introducing the lambda carrying the fusions into nusA mutant strains produces a higher level of beta-galactosidase-indicative of derepression of the operon. In particular, a larger form of the NusA protein which does not affect bacterial growth per se causes a derepression of the operon.

40|$|A recA-lacZ protein fusion was {{constructed}} in vivo by using bacteriophage Mu dII 301 (Ap lac). The fusion contained the promoter and first 47 codons of the recA mutant, as determined by DNA sequence analysis. The fusion was cloned and used to construct a recA-lacZ <b>operon</b> <b>fusion</b> at the same site within the recA gene. These fusions were introduced into the Escherichia coli chromosome at the lambda attachment site either as complete or cryptic lambda prophages. Synthesis of beta-galactosidase from these fusions was inducible by UV radiation. As the UV dose was increased, induction became slower and persisted {{for a longer period}} of time. At low doses of UV radiation, more beta-galactosidase was produced in a uvrA mutant than in a wild-type strain; however, at high doses, no induced synthesis of beta-galactosidase occurred in a uvrA mutant. recA+ strains carrying either the protein or <b>operon</b> <b>fusion</b> on a multicopy plasmid showed reduced survival after UV irradiation.

40|$|Three glucosyltransferases (GTFs), which {{catalyze}} {{the formation}} of water-insoluble adherent glucans, and fructosyltransferase (FTF), which synthesizes fructans, are believed {{to contribute to the}} pathogenic potential of Streptococcus mutans. Study of the regulation of expression of GTF and FTF has been difficult because of the complexity and number of exoenzymes produced by this bacterium. By using continuous chemostat culture to control environmental conditions, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) <b>operon</b> <b>fusions</b> were utilized to measure transcriptional activity of the ftf and gtfBC gene promoters. Expression of these <b>operon</b> <b>fusions</b> was differentially regulated in response to culture pH and growth rate and during transition states between growth domains. Furthermore, the addition of sucrose to steady-state cultures resulted in significant increases in CAT specific activities for both fusions. In a few cases, GTF and FTF enzyme specific activities did not parallel those of the corresponding CAT fusion activities; this lack of correspondence was likely due to posttranscriptional events controlling enzyme secretion and enzyme activity, {{as well as to the}} differential expression of dextranase(s) and fructan hydrolase by S. mutans. These results clearly demonstrate that the extracellular polymer synthesis machinery of S. mutans is regulated in a complex manner. The use of <b>operon</b> <b>fusions</b> in combination with chemostat culture is a viable approach to analyzing gene expression in S. mutans and will be helpful in defining the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of expression of virulence attributes under conditions that may more closely mimic those in dental plaque...|$|R

40|$|The gene ctxB {{encoding}} the {{cholera toxin}} B subunit was subcloned to design its production by Yersinia enterocolitica.

This gene encodes {{one of the major}} Yop proteins (YopH) secreted by bacteria incubated at 37 degrees C in a Ca(2 +) -deprived medium. In a first construction, an <b>operon</b> <b>fusion</b> was obtained between ctxB and yopH so that CT-B and a truncated YopH protein were produced. The recombinant CT-B from Y. enterocolitica was structurally and antigenically similar to CT-B produced by Vibrio cholerae. In another construction, the fusion gene obtained directed the production of YopH'/CT-B hybrid proteins that were secreted by Y. enterocolitica. In both cases, Y. enterocolitica directed the production of the recombinant proteins only when the bacteria were incubated in conditions of Yops production. When bacteria carrying the <b>operon</b> <b>fusion</b> were given orally to mice, a clear serum antibody response against CT-B was detected by ELISA.

A copy of the lktC gene was insertionally inactivated by using a nonpolar, promoterless cat cassette and then delivered into P. haemolytica on a shuttle vector. Plasmid incompatibility was used to detect clones where double recombination events had occurred at the chromosomal locus. The insertion in lktC did not affect expression of the downstream genes, and the mutant strain secreted an antigenic proleukotoxin that was neither leukotoxic nor hemolytic. Expression of the lktC gene in trans restored the wild-type phenotype, confirming that LktC is required for activation of the proleukotoxin to the mature leukotoxin. Construction of the lktC::cat <b>operon</b> <b>fusion</b> allowed us to quantitate leukotoxin promoter activity in P. haemolytica and to demonstrate that transcription was maximal during early logarithmic growth phase but was reduced following entry into late logarithmic phase.

Genetic evidence suggests that putA protein autogenously represses transcription of the putA and putP genes. In order to establish the molecular mechanism of put operon regulation we isolated regulatory mutations in the put control region. These mutants were selected using two phenotypes: (1) the ability to degrade a toxic proline analogue, dehydroproline, due to overexpression of putA enzyme activity, or (2) overexpression of lacZ from put::Mud <b>operon</b> <b>fusions.</b> The effect of each mutation on transcription in both directions was determined by measuring lacZ expression from putA and putP <b>operon</b> <b>fusions.</b> These regulatory mutations were cis-dominant when the putA protein was provided in trans, and they map in a region between the two genes.

40|$|The 90 -kb {{virulence}} plasmid of Salmonella typhimurium {{is necessary}} for invasion beyond the Peyer's patches to the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens of orally inoculated mice. Two Tn 5 insertions located {{on the left side}} of a previously identified 14 -kb virulence region (P. A. Gulig and R. Curtiss III, Infect. Immun. 58 : 3262 - 3271, 1988) and mapping 272 bp from each other exhibited opposite effects on splenic infection of mice after oral inoculation. spvR 23 ::Tn 5 decreased splenic infection by 1, 000 -fold, whereas a spv- 14 ::Tn 5 mutant outcompeted wild-type S. typhimurium for splenic infection by 27 -fold in mice fed mixtures of mutated and wild-type S. typhimurium. spvR 23 ::Tn 5 was complemented by a virulence plasmid subclone with an insert sequence encoding only an 891 -bp open reading frame specifying a 33, 000 -molecular-weight protein. The amino acid sequence of this open reading frame had significant homology to members of the LysR family of positive regulatory proteins; thus, the gene was named spvR (salmonella plasmid virulence). To examine the possible regulatory effects of spvR on other virulence genes, we constructed a lacZ <b>operon</b> <b>fusion</b> in a downstream virulence gene, spvB. When spvR subcloned behind the lac promoter was provided on a separate plasmid in trans to the spvB-lacZ <b>operon</b> <b>fusion,</b> transcription of spvB increased 15 -fold. spv- 14 ::Tn 5, which conferred a competitive advantage to S. typhimurium, increased the expression of a spvR-lacZ <b>operon</b> <b>fusion</b> in cis. spvR is therefore a positive regulator of spvB and an essential virulence gene of S. typhimurium. As opposed to having spvR subcloned behind the lac promoter, the wild-type spvR gene present on the virulence plasmid did not function to positively regulate spvB-lacZ in trans when salmonellae were grown to the log phase in L broth, suggesting that this regulatory system is activated in vivo during infection...|$|E

In sodA-lacZ protein fusions, induction of beta-galactosidase perfectly mimicked MnSOD induction (i. e., beta-galactosidase was not expressed in anaerobiosis and was induced by oxygen, redox-cycling compounds in aerobiosis, and iron chelators in anaerobiosis). In tac-sodA <b>operon</b> <b>fusions,</b> MnSOD induction was monitored only by the lactose operon inducer isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Various plasmids carrying part or all of the sodA regulatory and structural region inhibited aerobic beta-galactosidase induction in sodA-lacZ fusions. This included plasmids carrying only the transcription start and upstream region and also plasmids which did not contain this region and in which MnSOD was under foreign transcriptional control. The role of metal ions was also investigated. Addition of Mn(II) enhanced MnSOD activity but did not affect induction. The anaerobic expression of MnSOD from the oxygen-insensitive tac promoter was enhanced threefold by iron-chelating agents, implying a posttranscriptional or most likely a posttranslational modulation of enzyme activity via metal ions.

The hflA locus was cloned on an 18 -kilobase DNA fragment by selecting for plasmids that carry the neighboring purA gene. The boundaries of hflA were delimited by analysis of deletions and insertions constructed in vitro and by use of transposon Tn 1000. Maxicell analysis of the proteins encoded by the hflA-containing fragment shows that hflA consists {{of at least two}} nonoverlapping genes, hflC and hflK, encoding polypeptides of 37, 000 (C) and 46, 000 (K) daltons. We observe that insertions into one gene eliminate the corresponding polypeptide and greatly reduce synthesis of the other. We suggest that these two polypeptides (K and C) interact to form a multimeric complex and that free subunits are unstable. We have constructed two types of fusions between hflA and lacZ. One is an hflC-lacZ protein fusion constructed in vitro; the other is an hfl-lacZ <b>operon</b> <b>fusion</b> in which a Mu dX(Apr lac) has inserted into the hflK gene.

Expression of the nasF operon {{is controlled by}} general nitrogen regulation (Ntr) via the NtrC transcription activator and by pathway-specific nitrate and nitrite induction via the NasR transcription antiterminator. This paper reports our analysis of nasR gene expression. We constructed strains bearing single-copy Φ(nasR-lacZ) <b>operon</b> <b>fusions</b> within the chromosomal rhaBAD-rhaSR locus. The expression of ΔrhaBS::[Φ(nasR-lacZ) ] <b>operon</b> <b>fusions</b> was induced about 10 -fold during nitrogen-limited growth. Induction was reduced in both ntrC and rpoN null mutants, indicating that Ntr control of nasR gene expression requires the NtrC and ςN (ς 54) proteins. Sequence inspection of the nasR control region reveals an apparent ςN-dependent promoter but no apparent NtrC protein binding sites. Analysis of site-specific mutations coupled with primer extension analysis authenticated the ςN-dependent nasR promoter. Fusion constructs with only about 70 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the transcription initiation site exhibited patterns of β-galactosidase expression indistinguishable from Φ(nasR-lacZ) constructs with about 470 nt upstream. Expression was independent of the Nac protein, implying that NtrC is a direct activator of nasR transcription.
