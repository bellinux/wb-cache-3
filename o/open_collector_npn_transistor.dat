5000|$|Historically, {{designers}} {{frequently used}} the [...] "quasi-complementary" [...] configuration, {{which uses a}} Darlington push pair (i.e., two <b>NPN</b> <b>transistors)</b> and a Sziklai pull pair (i.e., one PNP and one <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor).</b> This configuration, which uses three <b>NPN</b> <b>transistors</b> and one PNP transistor, is advantageous because while the first transistors and the most common small signal transistors for decades were PNP Germanium devices, silicon PNP power transistors were slower to develop than and have historically been more expensive than their NPN counterparts. Alternately, if a germanium PNP device were used, it would have significantly different characteristics.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{is illustrated in}} Figure 3. The gate current makes an equivalent <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor</b> switch on, which in turn draws current {{from the base of}} an equivalent PNP transistor, turning it on also. Part of the gate current (dotted line) is lost through the ohmic path across the p-silicon, flowing directly into MT1 without passing through the <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor</b> base. In this case, the injection of holes in the p-silicon makes the stacked n, p and n layers beneath MT1 behave like a <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor,</b> which turns on due to the presence of a current in its base. This, in turn, causes the p, n and p layers over MT2 to behave like a PNP transistor, which turns on because its n-type base becomes forward-biased with respect to its emitter (MT2). Thus, the triggering scheme is the same as an SCR. The equivalent circuit is depicted in Figure 4.|$|R

5000|$|It {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} 1 that the source {{metallization}} connects both the N+ and P+ implantations, although the operating principle of the MOSFET only requires the source to be connected to the N+ zone. However, if it were, this would result in a floating P zone between the N-doped source and drain, which is equivalent to a <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor</b> with a non-connected base. Under certain conditions (under high drain current, when the on-state drain to source voltage is in the order of some volts), this parasitic <b>NPN</b> <b>transistor</b> would be triggered, making the MOSFET uncontrollable. The connection of the P implantation to the source metallization shorts the base of the parasitic transistor to its emitter (the source of the MOSFET) and thus prevents spurious latching.|$|R

40|$|Total dose {{damage in}} bipolar {{integrated}} circuits is investigated at low temperature, {{along with the}} temperature dependence of the electrical parameters of internal transistors. Bandgap narrowing causes the gain of <b>npn</b> <b>transistors</b> to decrease far more at low temperature compared to pnp transistors, due to the large difference in emitter doping concentration. When irradiations are done at temperatures of - 140 deg C, no damage occurs until devices are warmed to temperatures above - 50 deg C.
