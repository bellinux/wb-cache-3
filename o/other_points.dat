5|$|On {{the night}} of June 14, while the Lithuanian {{government}} was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border. They fired shots at a border post near Alytus and killed policeman Aleksas Barauskas. At <b>other</b> <b>points</b> the Soviets interrogated Lithuanian border guards and harassed civilians, hoping to provoke a retaliation that {{would serve as a}} rationale for a full-scale military attack.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} the origin is arbitrary: any <b>other</b> <b>point</b> may be chosen, as the {{representation}} is of an affine space. The origin merely represents a reference point, and is algebraically equivalent to any <b>other</b> <b>point.</b> Changing the origin corresponds to a rotation in the representation space.|$|R

5|$|At certain dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to {{the spirits of the}} deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. At <b>other</b> <b>points,</b> a vegan diet or full fast may be observed.|$|E
5|$|During {{service on}} the {{blockade}} at various <b>other</b> <b>points,</b> Albany arrived off {{the mouth of the}} Tabasco River by 13 June. As in the Tuxpan operation, members of her crew joined an inland expedition. The movement upriver began late in the first dog watch on 14 June. In two days, the American force ascended the river, disembarked the landing force, routed the defenders on the approaches to Tabasco, and captured the town. The Americans remained there until 22 July, when yellow fever and Mexican troops forced the evacuation of the town.|$|E

Asterisked (*) routes indicate that they run only during morning peak hours.|$|E
5|$|The Sex Party was a {{political}} party based in British Columbia, Canada. The party was guided by {{the philosophy of the}} sex-positive movement. Among <b>other</b> <b>points,</b> the party advocated for reform of sex education in schools so that sexual issues are taught more gradually over time and included a more comprehensive coverage of them. They advocated for the repeal of laws that promote antisexualism, such as prostitution laws and censorship. They also supported making Valentine's Day a statutory holiday and renaming Victoria Day to Eros Day.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a points classification. On each road stage the riders were awarded points for {{finishing}} in the top 10 places, with <b>other</b> <b>points</b> awarded for intermediate sprints. The rider with the most accumulated points {{was the leader of}} the classification and won the red jersey. The combativity classification was based solely on points won at the intermediate sprints; the leading rider won the green jersey. The final stage was a team classification: on each stage the times of the best three riders on each team were added up. The team with the lowest cumulative time over the seven stages won the team classification.|$|E

5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at <b>other</b> <b>points</b> in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius {{problem that is}} simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, circles and lines to <b>other</b> <b>points,</b> circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E
5|$|After Bernard Blake intercepted an AJ McCarron pass on Alabama's first {{possession}} of the second half, Jared Roberts kicked a 45-yard field goal on the drive that ensured that made the score 17–3. Roberts then scored the Rams' only <b>other</b> <b>points</b> on their next possession with his 31-yard field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Trey DePriest both forced and recovered a Garrett Grayson fumble. On the next play, Alabama scored on a 30-yard McCarron touchdown pass to DeAndrew White for a 24–6 lead. The Crimson Tide then made the final score 31–6 with a 15-yard Blake Sims touchdown pass to Chris Black. In the game, the Rams were led by former Crimson Tide offensive coordinator Jim McElwain and received $1.5 million {{to play the game}} at Bryant–Denny Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Among <b>other</b> <b>points,</b> the NATO group cited {{superior}} effectiveness (27 percent greater) for the 5.7×28mm against unprotected {{targets and}} equal effectiveness against protected targets. It also cited less sensitivity to extreme temperatures for the 5.7×28mm, and cited a greater potential risk of barrel erosion with the 4.6×30mm. In addition, the group {{pointed out that}} 5.7×28mm {{is close to the}} 5.56×45mm NATO by its design and manufacture process, allowing it to be manufactured on existing production lines. The group also noted that 5.7×28mm firearms had existed {{for a longer period of}} time than 4.6×30mm firearms, and that the 5.7×28mm FN Five-seven pistol was already in production at that time, while the 4.6×30mm Heckler & Koch UCP pistol was a new concept.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At <b>other</b> <b>points,</b> Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 on 15 May a German {{messenger}} reached The Hague, inviting Winkelman to Rijsoord for {{a meeting}} with von Küchler to negotiate the articles of a written capitulation document. Both quickly agreed on most conditions, Winkelman declaring to have surrendered army, naval and air forces. When von Küchler demanded that pilots still fighting for the allies should be treated as francs-tireurs—seen by the Germans as guerilla fighters outside the laws of war—Winkelman's refusal made it clear to the Germans that only the armed forces in the homeland, with the exception of Zealand, would capitulate, not the country itself. On <b>other</b> <b>points</b> a swift agreement was reached and the document was signed at 10:15.|$|E

5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be <b>other</b> <b>points</b> where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E
5|$|Further {{successful}} German airborne offensive {{operations were}} carried out in Luxembourg which seized five crossings and communication routes leading into central Belgium. The offensive, carried out by 125 volunteers of the 34th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} Wenner Hedderich, achieved their missions by flying to their objectives using Fieseler Fi 156 Störche. The cost was the loss of five aircraft and 30 dead. With the fort breached, the Belgian 4th and 7th Infantry Divisions were confronted by the prospect of fighting an enemy on relatively sound terrain (for armour operations). The 7th Division, with its 2nd and 18th Grenadier Regiments and 2nd Carabineers, struggled to hold their positions and contain the German infantry on the west bank. The Belgian tactical units engaged in several counterattacks. At one point, at Briegden, they succeeded in retaking the bridge and blowing it up. At the <b>other</b> <b>points,</b> Vroenhoven and Veldwezelt, the Germans had had time to establish strong bridgeheads and repulsed the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two <b>other</b> <b>points</b> {{for each of the}} three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all three lines (Figure6).|$|E
