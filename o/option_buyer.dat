40|$|This paper studies multi-unit {{ascending}} (English) auctions with a <b>buyer's</b> <b>option.</b> The <b>buyer's</b> <b>option</b> {{gives the}} winner of an auction the right to purchase any number of units at the winning price. We develop a theoretical model and derive the optimal strategies for the bidders. The model predicts various behavioral implications (e. g., the winner never exercises the option, the price declines…) that are tested using a unique data set on wine auctions held at the Paris-based auction house Drouot. We also analyze why the <b>buyer's</b> <b>option</b> is used. Estimating the model in a structural econometric way, and using counterfactual comparisons, {{we find that the}} <b>buyer's</b> <b>option</b> does not affect the seller's revenue (relative to a system where the units are auctioned sequentially without the option).

50|$|The {{buyer of}} a call option {{has the right}} to buy a {{specific}} number of shares from the call option seller at a strike price at an expiration date (European Option). Since a naked call seller does not have the stock in case the <b>option</b> <b>buyer</b> decides to exercise the option, the seller has to buy stock at the open market in order to deliver it at the strike price. Since the share price has no limit to how far it can rise, the naked call seller is exposed to unlimited risk.|$|E
5000|$|A naked put (also {{called an}} [...] {{uncovered}} put [...] ) is a put option contract where the option writer (i.e., the seller) {{does not hold}} the underlying position, {{in this case a}} short equity position, to cover the contract in case of assignment. The seller receives the premium cost of the put price, and hopes that the underlying equity or stock price stays the same or rises modestly, in which case the seller retains the premium. A put <b>option</b> <b>buyer</b> is hoping for a decrease in the price of the underlying equity, and upon exercise or expiration will collect cash representing the difference between the strike price of the option and the price of the underlying equity.|$|E
5000|$|Although the VIX {{is often}} called the [...] "fear index", a high VIX is not {{necessarily}} bearish for stocks. [...] Instead, the VIX {{is a measure of}} market perceived volatility in either direction, including to the upside. In practical terms, when investors anticipate large upside volatility, they are unwilling to sell upside call stock options unless they receive a large premium. <b>Option</b> <b>buyers</b> will be willing to pay such high premiums only if similarly anticipating a large upside move. The resulting aggregate of increases in upside stock option call prices raises the VIX just as does the aggregate growth in downside stock put option premiums that occurs when <b>option</b> <b>buyers</b> and sellers anticipate a likely sharp move to the downside. When the market is believed as likely to soar as to plummet, writing any option that will cost the writer {{in the event of a}} sudden large move in either direction may look equally risky.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe report {{results from}} an {{experiment}} on two-unit sequential auctions {{with and without}} a <b>buyer's</b> <b>option</b> (which allows {{the winner of the}} first auction to buy the second unit).

50|$|However, {{the cost}} to the <b>option</b> <b>buyer</b> of exercising the option is not zero. For instance, the buyer's broker may charge {{transaction}} fees to exercise the option to buy or sell the underlier. If these costs are greater than the amount the option is in the money, the owner of the option may rationally choose not to exercise. Thus, the option seller may end up with an unexpected position in the underlier and thus risk losing value if the underlier's price then moves adversely before the option seller can eliminate this position, perhaps not until the next trading day. The costs of exercise differ from trader to trader, and therefore the option seller {{may not be able to}} predict whether the options will be exercised or not.|$|E
50|$|Trader A ("A") has 500 {{shares of}} XYZ stock, valued at $10,000. A sells (writes) 5 call option {{contract}}s, bought by Investor B ("B") (in the US, 1 option contract covers 100 shares) for $1500. This premium of $1500 covers {{a certain amount}} of decrease in the price of XYZ stock (i.e. only after the stock value has declined by more than $1500 would the owner of the stock, A, lose money overall). Losses cannot be prevented, but merely reduced in a covered call position. If the stock price drops, it will not make sense for the <b>option</b> <b>buyer</b> ("B") to exercise the option at the higher strike price since the stock can now be purchased cheaper at the market price, and A, the seller (writer), will keep the money paid on the premium of the option. Thus, A's loss is reduced from a maximum of $10000 to - (premium), or $8500.|$|E

40|$|This article evaluates Tourinho's (1979) work {{as one of}} the {{earliest}} contributors to the real options literature. His model pioneered the application of risk neutrality to uncertain investments, but his originality of introducing an option-holding cost albeit to overcome the extraction paradox is rarely imitated. We claim that the combination of a convenience yield and an option-holding cost produces a more satisfying representation. Moreover, variations in the holding cost give rise to a host of investment decisions ranging from the standard real option solution for a zero-holding cost to a net present value solution for an infinite-holding cost. Not only does the holding cost mediate between these two poles, but it provides the option seller (usually a landowner or a government) with a policy instrument for influencing the extraction timing and thus the extraction profit of the <b>option</b> <b>buyer.</b> We derive the holding cost that optimizes the landowner's combined value of the option premium, holding costs and eventual royalties...|$|E

40|$|American {{options are}} studied {{in a general}} {{discrete}} market {{in the presence of}} proportional transaction costs, modelled as bid-ask spreads. Pricing algorithms and constructions of hedging strategies, stopping times and martingale representations are presented for short (seller’s) and long (buyer’s) positions in an American option with an arbitrary payoff. This general approach extends the special cases considered in the literature concerned primarily with computing the prices of American puts under transaction costs by relaxing any restrictions on the form of the payoff, the magnitude of the transaction costs or the discrete market model itself. The largely unexplored case of pricing, hedging and stopping for the American <b>option</b> <b>buyer</b> under transaction costs is also covered. The pricing algorithms are computationally efficient, growing only polynomially with the number of time steps in a recombinant tree model. The stopping times realising the ask (seller’s) and bid (buyer’s) option prices can differ from one another. The former is generally a so-called mixed (randomised) stopping time, whereas the latter is always a pure (ordinary) stopping time. ...|$|E

(ii) A new type of stock option for a company, where the company provides a guaranteed minimum as an added incentive in case the market appreciation of the stock is low, thereby making the option more attractive to the employee.

40|$|I am {{grateful}} to Peter Friz for carefully reading these notes, providing corrections and suggesting useful improvements. 11 Barrier Options Unlike previous sections where every problem presented came with a satis-factory solution, this section generally confines itself to presenting intuition for problems without providing convincing solutions. That’s because con-vincing solutions are thin on the ground. In fact, prices quoted for certain kinds of barrier option can vary so much between dealers that customers can sometimes cross the bid-offer (that is, buy on one dealer’s offer and sell on another dealer’s bid for a profit. So there is still plenty of scope for the ambitious modeler. Barrier options are important building blocks for structured products but their valuation can be highly model-dependent. Consequently {{much has been written}} on the subject notably by Taleb (1996), Wilmott (1998) and Carr and Chou (1997). By considering two limiting cases, we will see that barrier option values are not always so model-dependent. Developing intuition is therefore par-ticularly important not only to be able to estimate the value of a barrier option but also to know whether the output of a model should be trusted or not. As usual, we suppose that European options of all strikes and expira-tions are traded in the market and our objective is to price barrier options consistently with these European option prices. 11. 1 Definitions A knock-out option is an option which becomes worthless when a pre-specified “barrier ” level is reached. A live-out option is a special case of a knock-out option which is signifi-cantly in-the-money when it knocks out. A knock-in option is an option which can only be exercised if a barrier level is reached prior to exercise. Obviously, a knock-in option is just a portfolio of short a knock-out option and long a European. An amount of money paid to a barrier <b>option</b> <b>buyer</b> if the barrier is hit is termed a rebate. This rebate may be paid when the barrier is hit or at expiration...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) In {{this thesis}} we are {{concerned}} with valuing options on traded accounts using both continuous and discrete time models. An option on a traded account is a zero strike call on the balance of a trading account which consists of a position of size θ in a risky asset (which we refer to as a stock) and the remaining wealth in a risk-free account. The choice of trading positions throughout {{the life of the}} option are made by the buyer, subject to constraints specified in the contract at the time of purchase. The specification of these trading constraints gives rise to some of the more well known examples including passport options and vacation options. At maturity, the <b>option</b> <b>buyer</b> is entitled to any positive wealth accumulated in the trading account whilst any losses are covered by the option seller. First, we examine the problem of valuing these options in continuous time. A review of some existing methods is presented, including a complete derivation of the pricing formula for the passport option and the option on a traded account following the methods proposed by Hyer et al. (1997) and Shreve and Vecer (2000), though we often use different techniques to those authors. We also present an alternative derivation for the value of a passport option using our own methodology which we believe is simpler than those currently available. Secondly, we consider the valuation problem in a discrete time setting by looking at one specific discrete time model, the binomial tree. This is a new contribution to the literature as binomial models for these options have not been previously examined. Using this approach, the greatest difficulty is the determination of an optimal trading strategy which is required to price this class of option. We show that in general, binomial models and continuous time models {{do not have the same}} trading strategy, and in fact that the analytic determination of the trading strategy for an option on a traded account may in fact be impossible to obtain. We then turn to passport options, where we are able to derive an analytic optimal strategy which in this case is identical to that used in the continuous time models, thus the problem of valuing passport options is reduced to the same computational burdens as a binomial valuation without recombining branches. Lastly, we examine some numerical methods which could be used to value options on traded accounts with binomial models. Our problem is shown to be an NP-hard convex maximisation which we convert into both an l 1 -norm convex maximisation and an indefinite quadratic program. Whilst we present algorithms which are guaranteed to obtain the optimal solution, they are also known to be inefficient and thus inappropriate for any likely application beyond a few time steps. We conclude by summarising our results and give directions for future research in this area...|$|E
