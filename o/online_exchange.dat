40|$|In {{computer-mediated}} communication (CMC) environments, {{there is}} an extensive body of research which has looked at the nature of language learning of English as a foreign language (EFL) students within and beyond the classroom setting. However, most of this {{research has focused on}} the pattern of student-student interactions and extensively on the modality of synchronous CMC. The nature of instructor-student CMC interactions on online discussion forums remains unexplored in both L 2 and Saudi EFL learning contexts. This study investigates how Saudi EFL students perform their language and project their social presence when they interact with (as opposed to without) their instructor in online discussion forums. Throughout an entire academic semester in a prestigious university in Saudi Arabia, 49 Saudi EFL students interacted in student-student and instructor-student <b>online</b> <b>exchanges</b> to discuss argumentative topics in their educational discussion forums. The present study employed a mixed-methods research approach and data were collected from transcript of participants’ online interactions, questionnaires, and interviews. Students’ L 2 performance was examined using a textual analysis method to determine linguistic fluency, lexical density, linguistic accuracy, and grammatical complexity (Wolfe-Quintero, Inagaki, & Kim, 1998). To examine their social presence, the study applied a content analysis method by using the model of social presence in the framework of a community of inquiry (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000, 2001). The role of the instructor in instructor-student online interactions was examined qualitatively using a content analysis method by means of a template which was developed during the study. The study findings show that in student-student <b>online</b> <b>exchanges,</b> Saudi EFL students produced significantly higher rates of lexical density and social presence but lower rates of linguistic accuracy. Conversely, in instructor-student <b>online</b> <b>exchanges,</b> students produced significantly higher rates of linguistic accuracy but lower rates of lexical density and social presence. No significant differences were found in students’ fluency and grammatical complexity between the two phases of <b>online</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The instructors’ presence and scaffolding were found to influence Saudi students in instructor-student <b>online</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Students noticed their language errors, paid attention to linguistic accuracy, learnt new lexical and grammatical features, and engaged in reflective interactions. Furthermore, Saudi students were found to have positive perceptions towards instructor-student <b>online</b> <b>exchanges</b> and they valued their instructors’ online interactions as helpful for their L 2 development. The present study concluded that instructor-student <b>online</b> <b>exchanges</b> provided Saudi EFL students more opportunities to develop their language than student-student <b>online</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Finally, some implications for L 2 performance, social presence, {{and the role of the}} instructor in online discussion forums are discussed and recommendations for future research are presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{theoretical}} {{perspective on the}} nature of online learning. Taking a socio-cultural perspective, an argument is offered for the theorisation of peer to peer learning as a variety of ‘assisted performance’. Using this theoretical lens, a case study is then offered which uses this model to frame an analysis of the nature and occurrences of <b>online</b> <b>exchanges</b> between students, and with tutors. The case study looks at two years of online discussion in a Master’s programme in a United Kingdom university. The results suggest that looking for examples of assisted performance in the <b>online</b> <b>exchanges</b> can offer insights into the learning that can take place in online discussion and offers one way of recognising meaningful online interaction, and therefore point to ways of promoting such exchanges...|$|R

40|$|By {{examining}} an <b>online</b> computer <b>exchange,</b> we {{find that}} sellers who place higher nonbinding ask prices have higher outstanding offers and remain on the exchange longer, suggesting a willingness to hold out for higher offers. Additionally, higher ask prices deter buyers from making offers. The results are stronger in thinner market segments, suggesting that gains from waiting for a high price are greater when buyers' tastes are idiosyncratic. These relationships are consistent with models in which buyers engage in costly search and suggest that <b>online</b> <b>exchanges</b> may not eliminate the frictions related to bilateral transactions.
