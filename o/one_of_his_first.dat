5|$|During Pryer's {{tenure of}} being the first {{resident}} of Sandakan, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> tasks was to establish law and order. But since the local natives, although cowed by the guns of the British Navy, considered the British as transgressors in their land, they were hostile towards the authority of the British North Borneo Company. Hence, Pryer had to import his police from India and Singapore. His first contingent of police was made up of Indian Sikhs with a large body stature. The Indian police were probably from the Sepoy Company in India and were generally called 'Sipai' by the locals.|$|E
5|$|Lt Col Newman {{aboard the}} MGB {{need not have}} landed, but {{he was one of}} the first ashore. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> actions was to direct mortar fire onto a gun {{position}} on top of the submarine pens that was causing heavy casualties among the Commandos. He next directed machine-gun fire onto an armed trawler, which was forced to withdraw upriver. Newman organised a defence that succeeded in keeping the increasing numbers of German reinforcements at bay until the demolition parties had completed their tasks.|$|E

Yamasaki would later design New York's World Trade Center. Victor Steinbrueck and John Graham, Jr. designed the Space Needle.

5|$|The {{appointment}} of Colin Campbell as comptroller general in 1966 fostered substantial changes within Fremantle Prison itself. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> changes was {{to clear the}} classification committee's backlog of prisoners awaiting assessment. Campbell also established an officer training school, {{as well as an}} assessment centre to evaluate new prisoners. Work release and community service programs were also introduced, along with training programs, social workers and welfare officers. Within the midst of Campbell's reforms, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections in 1971, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department.|$|E
5|$|The {{issues of}} federalism, {{ethnicity}} {{in politics and}} state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed {{to a decline in}} support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government {{is one of the reasons}} that the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{resignation}} of SS commander Erhard Heiden in January 1929, Himmler assumed the position of Reichsführer-SS with Hitler's approval; he still carried out his duties at propaganda headquarters. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> responsibilities was to organise SS participants at the Nuremberg Rally that September. Over the next year, Himmler grew the SS from a force of about 290 men to about 3,000. By 1930 Himmler had persuaded Hitler to run the SS as a separate organisation, although it was officially still subordinate to the SA.|$|E

5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career between 1803 and 1804, {{in the office}} of Augustine Gascón, officiating as labour counselor for Indians. As a result, he confronted powerful people like the mayors of Cochabamba and Chayanta. He left the city after being threatened, and returned to Buenos Aires in 1805 with his wife Maria Guadalupe Cuenca and their newborn son. Once in the city, he became a reporter of the hearings of the Royal Audiencia, a local appeal court. The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the local council, hired him as an advisor as well. He defended Melchor Fernández, aggrieved by Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> cases. In another of his early disputes he backed the Cabildo in denying the appointment as an ensign of the young Bernardino Rivadavia.|$|E
5|$|In June2013, Iwata {{took the}} {{additional}} role of Nintendo of America's CEO. As <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> changes as CEO, Iwata {{decided that they}} would not hold large press conferences at E3, and instead have several smaller events, each aimed at a certain demographic. While traveling to Tokyo in late 2013, Iwata sketched an idea for a series of physical toys that could connect with Nintendo's games. This concept soon developed into the Amiibo line of figures which launched less than a year later. Amiibo proved to be a huge success, with more than 6million figurine sold by the end of 2014, roughly a month after launch. By March2016, combined sales of figures and cards—a product released in 2015—exceeded 64million units, proving financially beneficial across all Nintendo platforms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1910, Mao {{requested}} that his father permit him to attend the Dongshan Higher Primary School, which was located fifteen miles from Shaoshan; unlike the Shaoshan Primary School, this establishment taught modern subjects such as natural sciences. Yichang agreed to fund his son's tuition and dormitory space, and so the sixteen-year-old Mao set off to Dongshan with his older cousin, Wen Yunchang, who was also enrolled there. His two best friends at the school were Yunchang and Xiao Zizhang (also known as Xiao San), who would later join Mao in the communist movement and would become <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> biographers. However, he was bullied for being rural and unsophisticated by many of his classmates, who were typically the sons of wealthy landlords from Xiangxiang district. He nevertheless {{proved to be a}} successful student, gaining the respect of his teachers through hard work, an ability to compose essays in the classical style, and voracious reading. Here, he first learned about geography, and increased his knowledge of ancient Chinese history.|$|E

5|$|It is {{conceivable}} that Ímar received some form of support from Knútr's son and successor in Britain, Haraldr Knútsson, King of England (died 1040). The latter was certainly in power when Ímar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between Ímar and Haraldr could explain why the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later. Ímar's reign lasted about eight years, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> royal acts {{appears to have been}} the invasion of Rathlin Island within the year. The fact that he proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin.|$|E
5|$|It is {{only with}} the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the annals. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> {{significant}} acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor (King of Bohemia Charles IV) and his wife Elisabeth of Pomerania, on 20 January 1382. The marriage had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the Western Schism, Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years' War. Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories. Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> casesthe trial of William Moseby, {{a black man}} accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, {{the judge in the}} case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E
