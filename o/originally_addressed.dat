2500|$|The {{name change}} of the {{division}} from [...] "industrial psychology" [...] to [...] "industrial and organizational psychology" [...] reflected the shift {{in the work of}} industrial psychologists who had <b>originally</b> <b>addressed</b> work behavior from the individual perspective, examining performance and attitudes of individual workers. Their work became broader. Group behavior in the workplace became a worthy subject of study. The emphasis on [...] "organizational" [...] underlined the fact that when an individual joins an organization (e.g., the organization that hired him or her), he or she will be exposed to a common goal and a common set of operating procedures. In the 1970s in the UK, references to occupational psychology became more common than I/O psychology.|$|E

When her trial began a month later, Kawashima identified herself by her Chinese name, [...] "Jin Bihui", which eventually became the name court officials used. However, in accordance with her lawyers' strategy to deflect her charge of treason, she gradually began to emphasise a Japanese or Manchu banner identity. The court rejected the defence's bid to have her tried as a war criminal rather than as a domestic traitor, based on a combination of jus sanguinis and Kawashima's failure to formally renounce her citizenship through China's Department of Civil Affairs. Found guilty in 1948, she was executed by a pistol shot into the back of her head.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Direck {{had read}} {{a very great}} deal of all this {{expressed}} opiniativeness of Mr. Britling: he found it entertaining and stimulating stuff, and it was with genuine enthusiasm {{that he had come}} over to encounter the man himself. On his way across the Atlantic and during the intervening days, he had rehearsed this meeting in varying keys, but always on the supposition that Mr. Britling was a large, quiet, thoughtful sort of man, a man who would, as it were, sit in attentive rows like a public meeting and listen. So Mr. Direck had prepared quite a number of pleasant and attractive openings, and now he felt was the moment for some one of these various simple, memorable utterances. But in none of these forecasts had he reckoned with either the spontaneous activities of Mr. Britling or with the station-master of Matching's Easy. Oblivious of any conversational necessities between Mr. Direck and Mr. Britling, this official now took charge of Mr. Direck's grip-sack, and, falling into line with the two gentlemen as they walked towards the exit gate, resumed what was evidently an interrupted discourse upon sweet peas, <b>originally</b> <b>addressed</b> to Mr. Britling.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{excepted}} {{the following}} Poems from those, which I had determined to omit. Some intelligent friends particularly requested it, observing, that what most delighted me when I was [...] "young in writing poetry, would probably best please {{those who are}} young in reading poetry: and a man must learn to be pleased with a subject, before he can yield that attention to it, which is requisite in order to acquire a just taste." [...] I however was fully convinced, that he, who gives to the press what he does not thoroughly approve in his own closet, commits an act of disrespect, both against himself and his fellow-citizens. The request and the reasoning would not, therefore, have influenced me, had they not been assisted by other motives. The first in order of these verses, which I have thus endeavoured to reprieve from immediate oblivion, was <b>originally</b> <b>addressed</b> [...] "To the Author of Poems published anonymously, at Bristol." [...] A second edition of these poems has lately appeared with the Author's name prefixed; and I could not refuse myself the gratification of seeing {{the name of that}} man among my poems, without whose kindness they would probably have remained unpublished; and to whom I know myself greatly and variously obliged, as a Poet, a Man and a Christian.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Upon {{reading the}} third volume of Pope's Miscellanies, I found five lines which I thought excellent; and {{happening}} to praise them, a gentleman produced a modern comedy (the Rival Modes) published last year, {{where were the}} same verses to a tittle. These gentlemen are undoubtedly the first plagiaries that pretend to make a reputation by stealing from a man's works in his own life-time, {{and out of a}} public print.'[157] Let us join to this what is written by the author of the Rival Modes, the said Mr James Moore Smith, in a letter to our author himself, who had informed him, a month before that play was acted, Jan. 27, 1726-7, that 'these verses, which he had before given him leave to insert in it, would be known for his, some copies being got abroad. He desires, nevertheless, that since the lines had been read in his comedy to several, Mr P. would not deprive it of them,' &c. Surely if we add the testimonies of the Lord Bolingbroke, of the lady to whom the said verses were <b>originally</b> <b>addressed,</b> of Hugh Bethel, Esq., and others, who knew them as our author's, long before the said gentleman composed his play, it is hoped the ingenuous that affect not error will rectify their opinion by the suffrage of so honourable personages.|$|E

60|$|A {{building}} which {{recorded the}} Bible history {{by means of}} a series of sculptural pictures, would be perfectly useless to a person unacquainted with the Bible beforehand; on the other hand, the text of the Old and New Testaments might be written on its walls, and yet the building be a very inconvenient kind of book, not so useful {{as if it had been}} adorned with intelligible and vivid sculpture. So, again, the power of exciting emotion must vary or vanish, as the spectator becomes thoughtless or cold; and the building may be often blamed for what is the fault of its critic, or endowed with a charm which is of its spectator's creation. It is not, therefore, possible to make expressional character any fair criterion of excellence in buildings, until we can fully place ourselves in the position of those to whom their expression was <b>originally</b> <b>addressed,</b> and until we are certain that we understand every symbol, and are capable of being touched by every association which its builders employed as letters of their language. I shall continually endeavor to put the reader into such sympathetic temper, when I ask for his judgment of a building; and in every work I may bring before him I shall point out, as far as I am able, whatever is peculiar in its expression; nay, I must even depend on such peculiarities for much of my best evidence respecting the character of the builders. But I cannot legalize the judgment for which I plead, nor insist upon it if it be refused. I can neither force the reader to feel this architectural rhetoric, nor compel him to confess that the rhetoric is powerful, if it have produced no impression on his own mind.|$|E
6000|$|I do {{not think}} the date of {{composition}} can be so early as 1794. What may be called internal, or structural, evidence is against it. Wordsworth never could have written these two poems till after his settlement at Dove Cottage. Besides, in 1794, he could have no knowledge of a possible [...] "nest in a green dale, a harbour and a hold"; while at that time his sister had certainly no [...] "cottage home." [...] I believe they were written after he took up his residence at Town-end (the date being uncertain); and that they refer to his sister, and not to his wife. It has been suggested by Mr. Ernest Coleridge (see 'The Athenæum', Oct. 21, 1893) that they refer to Mary Hutchinson: but {{there is no evidence of}} Wordsworth taking long country walks with her before their marriage, or that she was [...] "nymph-like," [...] "fleet and strong," [...] that she loved to [...] "roam the moorland," [...] "in weather rough and bleak," [...] or that she [...] "hunted waterfalls." [...] The reference to his sister is confirmed by the omission of the delightful second stanza of the poem in the last edition revised by the poet, that of 1849, when she was a confirmed invalid at Rydal Mount. Those [...] "smiles to earth unknown," [...] had then ceased for ever. The reason why Wordsworth erased so delightful and wonderful a stanza, is to me only explicable on the supposition, that it was his sister he referred to, she who had accompanied him in former days, in so many of his [...] "long walks in the country." [...] His wife never did this; she had not the physical strength to do it; and, if she had been the person referred to, Wordsworth would hardly, in 1845, have erased such a description of her, as occurs in the stanza written in 1802, when she was still so vigorous. Besides, Mary Wordsworth was in no sense [...] "a Child of Nature," [...] as Dorothy was: while the testimony of the Wordsworth household is explicit, that it was to his sister, and not to his wife, that the poet referred. I find no difficulty in the allusion made in the second poem to Dorothy being yet possibly a [...] "Wife and Friend"; nor to the fact that it was <b>originally</b> <b>addressed</b> [...] "To a beautiful Young Lady." [...] Neither Dorothy nor Mary Wordsworth were physically [...] "beautiful," [...] according to our highest standards; although the poet addressed the latter as [...] "a Phantom of delight," [...] and as [...] "a lovely apparition." [...] It is quite true that it was Mary Wordsworth's old age that was [...] "serene and bright," [...] while Dorothy's was the very reverse; but the poet's anticipation of the future was written when his sister was young, and was by far the stronger of the two.--Ed.|$|E
