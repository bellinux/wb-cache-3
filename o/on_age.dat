5|$|Some sources {{state that}} in {{contrast}} to the glans penis, the clitoral glans lacks smooth muscle within its fibrovascular cap and is thus differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs; additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent <b>on</b> <b>age</b> and estrogenization.

5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended <b>on</b> <b>age</b> and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E

5|$|On-Loan {{cards are}} issued for usage in day-to-day functions, {{primarily}} for fare payment in transport systems.

If an owner loses a card, only the stored value and the deposit of the card are lost. On-Loan Octopus cards may be purchased at all MTR stations, the KMB Customer Service Centre, New World First Ferry (NWFF) Octopus Service Centres, and the New World First Bus (NWFB) Customer Service Centre. A student on-loan Octopus Card was initially issued, but was discontinued in 2005.|$|E

50|$|In 1971, a White House Conference <b>on</b> <b>Aging</b> {{found that}} the {{education}} and training of health professionals in older adults was urgently warranted (Storandt, 1982).

5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both <b>on</b> <b>age</b> and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

40|$|International {{calls and}} {{frameworks}} for policies <b>on</b> <b>ageing</b> in sub-Saharan African countries, encapsulated in the UN Madrid Plan of Action <b>on</b> <b>Ageing</b> (2002) and the African Union Policy Framework and Plan of Action <b>on</b> <b>Ageing</b> (2003), {{have resulted in}} little concrete policy action. The lack of progress calls for critical reflection {{on the status of}} policy debates and arguments <b>on</b> <b>ageing</b> in the sub-region. In a context of acute development challenges and resource constraints, the paper links the impasse in policy action to a fundamental lack of clarity about how rationales and approaches for policy <b>on</b> <b>ageing</b> relate to core national development agendas. It then explicates four steps required to elucidate these connections, namely: (a) A full appreciation of key aspects of mainstream development agendas; (b) identification of ambiguities in calls for policy on ageing; (c) pinpointing of key perspectives, arguments and queries for redressing the ambiguities; and (d) addressing ensuing information needs. We argue that advocacy and research <b>on</b> <b>ageing</b> in sub-Saharan Africa need to consider the framework proposed in the paper urgently, in order to advance policy and debate <b>on</b> <b>ageing</b> in the region...|$|R
