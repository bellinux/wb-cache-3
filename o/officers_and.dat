5|$|In 1897, {{the year}} Tirpitz {{came to his}} {{position}} as State Secretary of the Navy Office, the Imperial Navy consisted {{of a total of}} around 26,000 officers, petty <b>officers,</b> <b>and</b> enlisted men of various ranks, branches, and positions. By the outbreak of war in 1914, this had increased significantly to about 80,000 officers, petty <b>officers,</b> <b>and</b> men. Capital ships were typically commanded by a Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) or Korvettenkapitän (corvette captain). Each of these ships typically had a total crew in excess of 1,000 <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> men; the light cruisers that screened for the fleet had crew sizes between 300 and 550. The fleet torpedo boats had crews of about 80 to 100 <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> men, though some later classes approached 200.|$|E

5|$|The German navy {{regarded}} the ships as poor sea boats, with severe rolling, and {{a tendency to}} take on water. The ships had a very small turning radius, however, and were quick to answer commands from the helm. Their standard complement consisted of 32 <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 285 enlisted men, and while serving as a division flagship, this could be augmented by an additional seven <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> thirty-four sailors. After their reconstruction in the 1890s, the ships' crews were significantly increased, to 33 <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 344 enlisted men, and later to 35 <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 401 enlisted men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one launch, one pinnace, two cutters, one yawl, and one dinghy.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} now numbered fourteen <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 290 other ranks, {{which was}} to be reduced to nine <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 163 men, the rest being among the first batch to be evacuated on 18 December. The remainder were divided in three groups. The first group, of three <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> ninety men, left the front for the embarkation beach at 17:30 the next day. They were followed by the second smaller group of three <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> forty-two men at 21:35. The last group, three <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> thirty-one men, had to cover for the whole regiment, keeping up a steady rate of fire and moving their one Maxim-gun around the position to support the deception that all defences were fully manned. This last group was also divided into three parts, the first of which left at 01:45 on 20 December. They were followed by the next group who waited ten minutes before withdrawing. The last small group of men left at 02:05, and reached the beach, without incident, at 03:30. The regiment sailed again to Lemnos, and on 22 December to Egypt, arriving at Alexandria on 26 December, and eventually returned to their old camp at Zeitoun.|$|E
5|$|The ships had a {{standard}} crew of 38 <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 726 enlisted men. Scharnhorst, as the squadron flagship, had a larger crew, including an additional 14 <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 62 men. Gneisenau, when {{serving as the}} squadron second command flagship, had an extra staff of 3 <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 25 men. The ships carried a number of smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two launches, one pinnace, two cutters, three yawls, and one dinghy.|$|E

5|$|An Army report {{released}} in 2001 blamed {{the breakdown of}} the 65th on the following factors: a shortage of <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> noncommissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.|$|E

Of the original contingent who had landed in May only twenty-four men were still with the regiment. On 10 November reinforcements increased the regiment's total to nine <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> 363 other ranks, and they returned to Gallipoli, reaching the front line at Hill 60 on 27 November. Lack of manpower meant they could not fully man their trenches, so a system was adopted where six men manned a post, with only two on duty during the day. At night all men were awake and also patrolled between posts and into no man's land.|$|E
