40|$|At {{different}} {{locations in the}} Caribbean cruise jetties have been damaged during hurricanes. The specific cause of the damage is unknown. In this research {{the role of the}} dynamic behaviour of a jetty investigated. This research has the goal to elaborate circumstances under which the dynamic behaviour of the <b>open</b> <b>piled</b> jetty on Sint Maarten significantly enlarges the amplitude of vibration, when being subjected to wave loading. This is investigated by simulating the water surface and corresponding wave loading in the time domain and computing the dynamic response for the first jetty of Sint Maarten for different wave climates. Wave loading on the jetty deck and the piles are included in three directions. For the wave loading on the deck (slamming/wave-in-deck loading) a new formulation is derived in this research, {{in order to get a}} formulation which is dependent of time and location which is essential for a dynamic analysis. This new formulation is based on results of physical model tests performed for the situation of Sint Maarten. The dynamic analysis is performed by modal analysis in the time domain, without including non-linear interaction between the travelling waves and jetty structure. The response of the structure to the wave loading is analysed using the variance spectrum of the displacement, dynamic amplification factor and displacement signal. From the results it can be concluded that the dynamic behaviour of the jetty of Sint Maarten significantly enlarges the amplitude of vibration in horizontal direction for the investigated wave spectra. In vertical direction the maximum displacement decreases due to the dynamic behaviour. For further research verification of the dynamic behaviour of an <b>open</b> <b>piled</b> jetty and improvement of the wave-in-deck pressure are recommended.

30|$|RHA is {{the residue}} of {{completely}} incinerated rice husk under proper conditions. Rice husk, the outer covering part of rice kernel, is an agricultural waste from the milling process of paddy. Rice husk is abundant {{in many parts of}} the world, especially in rice cultivating countries, like Vietnam. Each ton of paddy rice can produce approximately 200  kg of rice husk, which on combustion produces about 40  kg of ash (Bui 2001). According to the’’Rice market monitor’’ report [FAO (2012)], the global rice paddy production in 2011 was about 723 million tons (in which the Vietnam paddy production was about 42 million tons) that results in approximately 145 million tons of rice husks. Rice husk from paddy rice mills is disposed directly into the environment or sometimes is dumped or burnt in <b>open</b> <b>piles</b> on the fields. This results in serious environmental pollution, especially after it is disintegrated under wet conditions.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the biowaste management issues across {{rural areas of}} Romania {{in the context of}} poor waste management infrastructure in the last decade (2003 - 2012). Biowaste is the main fraction of municipal waste, thus a proper management is a key challenge in order to sustain a bioeconomy in the near future. The amount of biowaste generated and uncollected by waste operators is generally uncontrolled disposed if not recovered through home composting. The paper points out the role of home composting in diverting the biowaste from wild dumps and landfills for the regions covered or not by waste collection services. Home composting and the biowaste losses are further assessed based on several scenarios (worse-case, pessimistic, realistic, optimistic) where the net loads of greenhouse gasses (GHG) are calculated at national and regional levels. The transition of home composting techniques, from <b>open</b> <b>piles</b> to plastic bins with respect to standard guidelines will improve the home composting performance in terms of compost quality and net GHG’s savings, supporting a bio-based economy which will lead towards a sustainable rural development.

Methane contributes 20 % annually to increases in global warming, and is explosive at concentrations of 5 - 15 % in air. Landfills contribute 15 % to total methane emissions.

40|$|Issue: Odor {{control is}} one of the most {{significant}} problems facing composting facilities because it is critical to the long-term approval and acceptance of the facility by the public. Odors are emitted from the surfaces of <b>open</b> <b>piles,</b> windrows, curing piles, storage piles, and stockpiles of organic materials. Odorous compounds of concern include ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans, alkyl sulfides and terpenes. These compounds are formed during aerobic or anaerobic decomposition. Biofiltration is an air pollution control technology that uses a solid media to absorb and adsorb compounds in the air stream and retains them for subsequent biological oxidation. Biofilters are used mainly for the treatment of odors and VOC compounds. The trend has been toward the use of more organic materials, like soils, composts, wood mulch, or processed wood wastes to improve performance by increasing removal rates. Biofilters have been recognized by several states as Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for the treatment of VOCs and odor. Best Practice: Moisture laden air from composting facilities is usually pumped from the facility and may be treated in an odor scrubbing biofilter. A biofilter consists of a series of perforated pipes laid in a bed of gravel and covered with an organic media. As the air stream flows up through the media, the odorous compounds are removed by a combination of physical, chemical and biological processes. However...|$|R

40|$|The {{technologies}} for {{the conversion of}} biomass for electricity production are direct combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis. As shown in Figure 1, direct combustion involves the oxidation of biomass with excess air, producing hot flue gases which in turn produce steam in the heat exchange sections of boilers. The steam is used to generate electricity in a Rankine cycle; usually, only electricity is produced in a condensing steam cycle, while electricity and steam are cogenerated in an extracting steam cycle. Today's biomass-fired steam cycle plants typically use single-pass steam turbines. However, in the past decade, efficiencies and more complex design features, characteristic previously of only large scale steam turbine generators (> 200 MW), have been transferred to smaller capacity units. Today’s biomass designs include reheat and regenerative steam cycles as well as supercritical steam turbines. The two common boiler configurations used for steam generation with biomass are stationary- and traveling-grate combustors (stokers) and atmospheric fluid-bed combustors. Figure 1. Direct-fired biomass electricity generating system schematic. All biomass combustion systems require feedstock storage and handling systems.

The impacts on project economy of the Clean Development Mechanism, rice husk ash sales and cogeneration of heat are also investigated.
