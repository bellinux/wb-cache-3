5|$|The {{national}} emblem of Belarus, which replaced the historic Pahonia {{arms in a}} 1995 referendum, features a ribbon in the colours of the national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the coat of arms of Belarus, although this is incorrect {{due to the lack of}} several heraldic elements. The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Belorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with the biggest change being a replacement of the hammer and sickle with an <b>outline</b> <b>map</b> of Belarus. Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used in Macedonia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the region of Transnistria.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{district}} council worked with King's College to establish plots {{of land for}} development around Ruislip and Ruislip Manor. A town planning competition was held, won by A & J Soutar, town planners from Wandsworth, who sought to create a symmetrical design spreading across Ruislip parish. Many {{of the woods and}} historic sites including Manor Farm were to be demolished and cleared as part of the plan, making way for a projected total of 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents. Only the church in Ruislip, St. Martin's, would have been spared. An <b>outline</b> <b>map</b> was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A local board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911, which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full planning scheme to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914.|$|E
5|$|Manor Farm and Park Wood {{were nearly}} {{demolished}} {{in the early}} 1900s {{to make way for}} a new development planned in partnership with King's College and the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. A town planning competition was won by A & J Soutar from Wandsworth, who suggested a symmetrical design across the parish which would have seen a total of 7,642 new homes built. St. Martin's church would have been the only example of historical architecture left in Ruislip. An <b>outline</b> <b>map</b> of the new development proposal was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A Local Board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911 which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full planning scheme to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914. Three roads with residential housing, Manor Way, Windmill Way and Park Way were completed before the outbreak of the First World War when all construction work was halted. It was not resumed until 1919, though the plan was substantially scaled back as work slowed throughout the next decade.|$|E

2500|$|Reuben Mattus {{invented the}} [...] "Häagen-Dazs" [...] name {{supposedly}} {{as a tribute}} to Denmark's exemplary treatment of its Jews during the Second World War, and included an <b>outline</b> <b>map</b> of Denmark on early labels. [...] Mattus claimed the name was [...] "Danish-sounding," [...] although it is not Danish, which has neither an umlaut ä (rather, the ligature æ is the corresponding counterpart) nor a digraph zs, nor did the name have any meaning in any language before its creation. (The surname Haagen, without an umlaut, does exist in Denmark.) Mattus felt that Denmark was known for its dairy products and had a positive image in the United States. His daughter Doris Hurley reported in the 1999 PBS documentary An Ice Cream Show that her father {{sat at the kitchen table}} for hours saying nonsensical words until he came up with a combination he liked. The reason he chose this method was so that the name would be unique and original.|$|E
2500|$|Lapérouse sailed between 10–30 August {{all the way}} {{south to}} the Spanish Las Californias Province, present-day California. He {{reportedly}} observed the only historical eruption of Mount Shasta on 7 September 1786, although this account is disputed. He stopped at the Presidio of San Francisco long enough to create an <b>outline</b> <b>map</b> of the Bay Area, Plan du port de St. François, situé sur la côte de la Californie septentrionale ("Map of the port of San Francisco, situated {{on the coast of}} Northern California"), which was reproduced as Map 33 in L. Aubert's 1797 Atlas du voyage de La Pérouse. He arrived in Monterey Bay and at the Presidio of Monterey on 14 September 1786. [...] He examined the Spanish settlements, ranchos, and missions. He made critical notes on the missionary treatment of the California indigenous peoples with the Indian Reductions at the Franciscan run missions. France and Spain were on friendly terms at this time. Lapérouse was the first non-Spanish visitor to California since Drake in 1579 , and the first to come to California after the founding of Spanish missions and presidios (military forts).|$|E
2500|$|A 3-cent stamp {{was issued}} on July 13, 1937, {{to commemorate the}} 150th anniversary of the Northwest Territory {{as defined by the}} Ordinance of 1787. The Territory {{consisted}} of lands north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River ceded by eastern states. The Ordinance established the Territory, banned slavery, and specified that land must be purchased from the Indians and offered for sale by the United States. It also made provision for temporary and permanent governments and eventual statehood of included regions based on population. The stamp shows a map of the Territory which is flanked by Manasseh Cutler who drafted the ordinance, and Rufus Putnam, superintendent of territorial settlement. The 150th anniversary of establishment of the Mississippi Territory was celebrated by a 3-cent stamp on April 7, 1948. The vignette shows an <b>outline</b> <b>map</b> of the region of today’s Mississippi and Alabama. The present Mississippi is shown in a darker tone. The map is divided into three sections with dates 1798, 1804, and 1812, showing the growth of the Territory. Over the map is the original seal of the Territory on which the second double [...] "s" [...] of Mississippi is written as a single [...] "s." [...] The portrait is of Winthrop Sargent, first governor of Mississippi Territory.|$|E

60|$|Physical Features of Formosa.--The {{island of}} Formosa is {{nearly half the}} size of Ireland, being 220 miles long, and from twenty to eighty miles wide. It is traversed down its centre by a fine {{mountain}} range, which reaches an altitude of about 8,000 feet in the south and 12,000 feet in the northern half of the island, and whose higher slopes and valleys are everywhere clothed with magnificent forests. It is crossed by the line of the Tropic of Cancer a little south of its centre; and this position, combined with its lofty mountains, gives it an unusual variety of tropical and temperate climates. These circumstances are all highly favourable to the preservation and development of animal life, and from what we already know of its productions, it seems probable that few, if any islands of approximately the same size and equally removed from a continent will be found to equal it in the number and variety of their higher animals. The <b>outline</b> <b>map</b> (at page 392) shows that Formosa is connected with the mainland by a submerged bank, the hundred-fathom line including it along with Hainan to the south-west and Japan on the north-east; while the line of two-hundred fathoms includes also the Madjico-Sima and Loo-Choo Islands, and may, perhaps, mark out approximately the last great extension of the Asiatic continent, the submergence of which isolated these islands from the mainland.|$|E
