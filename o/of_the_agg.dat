40|$|A {{protein that}} binds to a {{synthetic}} oligonucleotide of (CCT) 12 has been purified from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells by a (CCT) 12 affinity chromatography. The protein (p 70) has an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa, as assayed by Southwestern analysis. A competition experiment revealed that p 70 binds to (CCT) 12, (CCCT) 8 and (CCTCCCT) 6, {{but not to}} (CTT) 12, (CT) 16 and (CCTGCCT) 6, suggesting that p 70 has a sequence-specificity. <b>The</b> complementary (<b>AGG)</b> 12 and <b>the</b> double stranded DNA did not show the binding. It is also confirmed by S 1 nuclease analysis that the (AGG:CCT) 12 duplex takes a single-stranded conformation in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protein.

40|$|AGA and AGG codons for {{arginine}} are {{the least}} used codons in Escherichia coli, which are encoded by a rare tRNA, {{the product of the}} dnaY gene. We examined the positions of arginine residues encoded by AGA/AGG codons in 678 E. coli proteins. It was found that AGA/AGG codons appear much more frequently within the first 25 codons. This tendency becomes more significant in those proteins containing only one AGA or AGG codon. Other minor codons such as CUA, UCA, AGU, ACA, GGA, CCC and AUA are also found to be preferentially used within the first 25 codons. The effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AGG</b> codon on gene expression were examined by inserting one to five AGG codons after the 10 th codon from the initiation codon of the lacZ gene. The production of beta-galactosidase decreased as more AGG codons were inserted. With five AGG codons, the production of beta-galactosidase (Gal-AGG 5) completely ceased after a mid-log phase of cell growth. After 22 hr induction of the lacZ gene, the overall production of Gal-AGG 5 was 11 % of the control production (no insertion of arginine codons). When five CGU codons, the major arginine codon were inserted instead of AGG, the production of beta-galactosidase (Gal-CGU 5) continued even after stationary phase and the overall production was 66 % of the control. The negative effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AGG</b> codons on the Gal-AGG 5 production was found to be dependent upon the distance between the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AGG</b> codons and the initiation codon. As the distance was increased by inserting extra sequences between the two codons, the production of Gal-AGG 5 increased almost linearly up to 8 fold. From these results, we propose that the position of the minor codons in an mRNA {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of gene expression possibly by modulating the stability of the initiation complex for protein synthesis...|$|E

Analysis of the sequence of the plasmid-borne agg- 3 gene cluster encoding AAF-III showed this cluster to be {{closely related to the}} agg and aaf operons and to the afa operons carried by diffusely adherent pathogenic E. coli. We investigated the adhesion properties of a collection of 25 EAEC strains isolated from HIV-infected patients presenting with persistent diarrhea.

40|$|The {{genetic code}} {{provides}} the translation table necessary {{to transform the}} information contained in DNA into the language of proteins. In this table, a correspondence between each codon and each amino acid is established: tRNA is the main adaptor that links the two. Although the genetic code is nearly universal, several variants of this code have been described {{in a wide range of}} nuclear and organellar systems, especially in metazoan mitochondria. These variants are generally found by searching for conserved positions that consistently code for a specific alternative amino acid in a new species. We have devised an accurate computational method to automate these comparisons, and have tested it with 626 metazoan mitochondrial genomes. Our results indicate that several arthropods have a new genetic code and translate the codon AGG as lysine instead of serine (as in the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code) or arginine (as in the standard genetic code). We have investigated the evolution of the genetic code in the arthropods and found several events of parallel evolution in which the AGG codon was reassigned between serine and lysine. Our analyses also revealed correlated evolution between the arthropod genetic codes and the tRNA-Lys/-Ser, which show specific point mutations at the anticodons.

40|$|Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) organisms {{belong to}} a {{diarrhea}}genic pathotype known to cause diarrhea and can be characterized by distinct aggregative adherence (AA) in a stacked-brick pattern to cultured epithelial cells. In this study, we in-vestigated 118 EAEC strains isolated from the stools of Danish adults with traveler’s diarrhea. We evaluated {{the presence of the}} aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAFs) by a multiplex PCR, targeting the four known major subunit variants as well as their usher-encoding genes. Almost one-half (49 / 118) of the clinical isolates did not possess any known AAF major fimbrial subunit, despite the presence of other AggR-related loci. Further investigation revealed the presence of an AAF-related gene encoding a yet-uncharacterized adhesin, termed agg 5 A. The sequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agg</b> 5 DCBA gene cluster shared fimbrial accessory genes (usher, chaperone, and minor pilin subunit genes) with AAF/III, as well as the signal peptide present in the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agg</b> 3 A gene. The complete agg 5 DCBA gene cluster from a clinical isolate, EAEC strain C 338 - 14, with the typical stacked-brick binding pat-tern was cloned, and deletion of the cluster was performed.

40|$|A {{variant of}} the {{invertebrate}} mitochondrial genetic code was previously identified in arthropods (Abascal et al. 2006 a, PLoS Biol 4 :e 127) in which, instead of translating the AGG codon as serine, as in other invertebrates, some arthropods translate AGG as lysine. Here, we revisit {{the evolution of the}} genetic code in arthropods taking into account that (1) the number of arthropod mitochondrial genomes sequenced has triplicated since the original findings were published; (2) the phylogeny of arthropods has been recently resolved with confidence for many groups; and (3) sophisticated probabilistic methods can be applied to analyze the evolution of the genetic code in arthropod mitochondria. According to our analyses, evolutionary shifts in the genetic code have been more common than previously inferred, with many taxonomic groups displaying two alternative codes. Ancestral character-state reconstruction using probabilistic methods confirmed that the arthropod ancestor most likely translated AGG as lysine. Point mutations at tRNA-Lys and tRNA-Ser correlated with the meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AGG</b> codon. In addition, we identified three variables (GC content, number of AGG codons, and taxonomic information) that best explain the use of each of the two alternative genetic codes. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} polymorphisms of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene in susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis (AS), {{and their relationship to}} clinical features and radiographic severity. Methods. This study included 157 patients with AS and 140 healthy unrelated controls. Polymorphisms of the VEGF gene were analysed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) –restriction fragment length polymorphism assay and amplification refractory mutation system–PCR. Haplotypes were reconstructed using the Bayesian algorithm. Radiographic severity was assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiological Index (BASRI). Results. The genotype frequencies of the polymorphisms were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The distributions of genotypes and alleles did not differ between AS patients and controls. Among the six haplotypes reconstructed based on the tight linkage disequilibrium at positions 2578, 1154 and 634 (pairwise linkage disequilibrium coefficient, r ^ 0. 361 – 0. 706), no haplotype was associated with susceptibility to AS. Clinical features were analysed for the four haplotypes (CGC, CGG, AAG, AGG) which were prevalent. In carriers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AGG</b> haplotype, the frequency of cervical spine involvement was significantly higher (P ^ 0. 002, Pcorr ^ 0. 036) and that of patients showing a BASRI score 6 ̀ was also higher (P ^ 0. 025, Pcorr ^ 0. 45). Conclusions. This study demonstrates that polymorphisms of the VEGF gene may contribute to disease severity in AS. KEY WORDS: Vascular endothelial growth factor, Ankylosing spondylitis, Polymorphism.

40|$|Exotic Rubus taxa in Australia {{have been}} revised {{following}} consultation with European and North American experts in Rubus, allied with studies {{of variation in}} patterns of DNA restriction fragments and morphology. Many of these taxa have names that are applied {{for the first time}} in Australia (prefaced with a †). <b>The</b> major focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work was the Rubus fruticosus L. aggregate and taxa of this aggregate covered here are R. anglocandicans A. Newton, R. cissburiensis W. C. Barton & Ridd., †R. echinatus Lindl., †R. erythrops Edees & A. Newton, R. laciniatus Willd., R. leightonii Lees ex Leight. †R. leucostachys Schleich. ex Sm., †R. phaeocarpus W. C. R. Watson, R. polyanthemus Lindeb., †R. riddelsdellii Rilstone, †R. rubritinctus W. C. R. Watson, R. ulmifolius Schott (including R. ulmifolius var. ulmifolius and †R. ulmifolius var. anoplothyrsus Sudre), and R. vestitus Weihe, along with two undescribed taxa, Rubus sp. Scott Creek (D. E. Symon 16504) and Rubus sp. Tasmania (J. R. Hosking 1551). Other naturalised taxa are R. alceifolius Poir., R. ellipticus Sm., R. idaeus L., †R. laudatus A. Berger, †R. loganobaccus L. H. Bailey, †R. philadelphicus Blanch., R. roribaccus (L. H. Bailey) Rydb. and R. rugosus Sm. Patterns of morphological and molecular variation among individuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> R. fruticosus <b>agg.</b> in Australia were examined. In phenetic analyses based on examination of 137 herbarium specimens and 27 morphological characters, taxa showed varying degrees of separation. Some taxa, for example R. anglocandicans and <b>the</b> two varieties <b>of</b> R. ulmifolius, formed distinct groups in these analyses whereas there was considerable overlap among individuals of other species. Fifty M 13 /HaeIII DNA-banding patterns (phenotypes) were identified among 198 collections from <b>the</b> R. fruticosus <b>agg.</b> across Australia. Thirty-five DNA phenotypes were correlated with 15 taxa <b>of</b> <b>the</b> R. fruticosus agg.; the remaining 15 DNA types correlated poorly or were determined with only a moderate level of confidence. R. anglocandicans, R. echinatus, R. leightonii, R. leucostachys, R. sp. Tasmania, R. ulmifolius and R. vestitus had two or more DNA phenotypes whereas only one DNA phenotype was observed for the remaining eight taxa. Taxa that were more distinct with respect to their DNA phenotypes also tended to be more distinct with respect to morphology based on a Mantel matrix correlation test. Within taxa that were difficult to tell apart morphologically, those sharing the same DNA phenotype were considered members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same Rubus taxon. These results are discussed in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evolution and ecology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> R. fruticosus <b>agg.</b> in Australia and in relation to <b>the</b> incomplete taxonomy <b>of</b> Rubus in Europe and North America...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The support-enumeration method (SEM) for {{computation}} of Nash equilibrium {{has been}} shown to achieve state-of-the-art empirical performance on normal-form games. Action-graph games (AGGs) are exponentially smaller than the normal form on many important classes of games. We show how SEM can be extended to <b>the</b> <b>AGG</b> representation, yielding an exponential improvement in worst-case runtime. Empirically, we demonstrate that our AGG-optimized SEM algorithm substantially outperforms the original SEM, and also outperforms state-of-the-art AGG-optimized algorithms on most problem distributions. ...|$|R
