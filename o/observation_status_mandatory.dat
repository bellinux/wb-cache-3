40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} practices {{related to}} observation care {{and to examine}} the current models of pediatric observation medicine in US children's hospitals. DESIGN: We utilized 2 web‐based surveys to examine observation care in the 42 hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database. We obtained information regarding the designation of <b>observation</b> <b>status,</b> including the criteria used to admit patients into observation. From hospitals reporting the use of <b>observation</b> <b>status,</b> we requested specific details relating to the structures of observation care and the processes of care for observation patients following emergency department treatment. RESULTS: A total of 37 hospitals responded to Survey 1, and 20 hospitals responded to Survey 2. Designated observation units were present in only 12 of 31 (39 %) hospitals that report observation patient data to the Pediatric Health Information System. <b>Observation</b> <b>status</b> was variably {{defined in terms of}} duration of treatment and prespecified criteria. Observation periods were limited to < 48 hours in 24 of 31 (77 %) hospitals. Hospitals reported that various standards were used by different payers to determine <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> reimbursement. <b>Observation</b> care was delivered in a variety of settings. Most hospitals indicated that there were no differences in the clinical care delivered to virtual <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> patients when compared with other inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Observation is a variably applied patient status, defined differently by individual hospitals. Consistency in the designation of patients under <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> among hospitals and payers may be necessary to compare quality outcomes and costs, as well as optimize models of pediatric observation care.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: Accumulating {{evidence}} has shown {{increasing use of}} observation stays for patients presenting to emergency departments and requiring diagnostic evaluation or time-limited treatment plans, but critics suggest that this expansion arises from hospitals' concerns to maximize revenue and shifts costs to patients. Perspectives of physicians making decisions to admit, observe, or discharge have been absent from the debate. We examine the views of emergency physicians in the United States and England on observation stays, and what influences their decisions to use observation services. METHODS: We undertook in-depth, qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of physicians in 3 hospitals across the 2 countries and analyzed these using an approach based on the constant-comparison method. Limitations include the number of sites, whose characteristics are not generalizable to all institutions, and the reliance on self-reported interview accounts. RESULTS: Physicians used <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> for the specific presentations {{for which it is}} well evidenced but acknowledged administrative and financial considerations in their decisionmaking. They also highlighted an important role for observation not described in the literature: as a "safe space," relatively immune from the administrative gaze, where diagnostic uncertainties, sociomedical problems, and medicolegal challenges could be contained. CONCLUSION: <b>Observation</b> <b>status</b> increases the options available to admitting physicians {{in a way that they}} valued for its potential benefits to patient safety and quality of care, but some of these have been neglected in the literature to date.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inpatient {{administrative}} datasets often exclude observation stays, as {{observation is}} considered to be outpatient care. The extent to which this status is applied to pediatric hospitalizations is not known. OBJECTIVE: To characterize trends in <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> code utilization and 1 ‐day stays among children admitted from the emergency department (ED), and to compare patient characteristics and outcomes associated with observation versus inpatient stays. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal analysis of the 2004 – 2009 Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS). SETTING: Sixteen US freestanding children's hospitals contributing outpatient and inpatient data to PHIS. PATIENTS: Admissions to <b>observation</b> or inpatient <b>status</b> following ED care in study hospitals. MEASUREMENTS: Proportions of observation and 1 ‐day stays among all admissions from the ED were calculated each year. Top ranking discharge diagnoses and outcomes of observation were determined. Patient characteristics, discharge diagnoses, and return visits were compared for observation and 1 ‐day stays. RESULTS: The proportion of short‐stays (including both observation and 1 ‐day stays) increased from 37 % to 41 % between 2004 and 2009. Since 2007, observation stays have outnumbered 1 ‐day stays. In 2009, more than half of admissions from the ED for 6 of the top 10 ranking discharge diagnoses were short‐stays. Fewer than 25 % of observation stays converted to inpatient status. Return visits and readmissions following observation were no more frequent than following 1 ‐day stays. CONCLUSIONS: Children admitted under <b>observation</b> <b>status</b> make up a substantial proportion of acute care hospitalizations. Analyses of inpatient administrative databases that exclude observation stays likely result in an underestimation of hospital resource utilization for children.

40|$|United States {{healthcare}} is at {{a turning}} point, high cost for low value {{is no longer}} satisfactory. As a result, new methods of care are being sought. One such method {{is the idea of}} placing a patient in <b>observation</b> <b>status,</b> a place where the patient is still an outpatient but may spend nights in the hospital. The use of this new method is known to have significant and possibly unexpected financial impact on the patient while the provider is simultaneously reacting to reduce costs associated with having this outpatient occupy space for days. At a time when issues such as this are complicated enough, value based payments debut to couple reimbursements for hospitals to patient satisfaction. This essay looks at the <b>observation</b> patient <b>status</b> as a new vehicle for the provision of healthcare while seeking to build understanding for the relevance of the patient experience surrounding the observation patient service line. A pilot which highlights the very real problems hospitals are facing is presented in the essay. This pilot, in addition to a literature review, discuss the need for payers and providers to establish a desire for constant improvement while not underestimating the impacts associated, including the danger of upsetting patients during the renovation. Providers and payers are key determinants of public health; as such patient satisfaction and the mode of the provision of healthcare are essential considerations when seeking to achieve the healthy state...|$|R

The hidden statuses are decided by the node number when traversing the DOM tree top-down. The transition probability decides how to allocate the characteristic weight from a parent node to a child node, which is initialized in a equi-probability mode.

In order to reveal the species distributions during spring and autumn migration periods temporally, distribution maps were prepared using observation data based on 15 days intervals. The 15 days intervaled distributions of R. riparia, H. rustica and D. urbicum revealed that these species showed latitudinal differences. However, {{the difference was not}} clear for C. daurica and P. rupestris because of incomplete data and because P. rupestris winters along Mediterranean coasts.
