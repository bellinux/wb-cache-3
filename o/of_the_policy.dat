A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E

5|$|During his {{eighteen}} years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev's only major foreign policy innovation was détente. While sharing some similarities with Soviet policies pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev's adoption of détente significantly differed from Khrushchev's precedent in two ways. The first {{was that it}} was more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on arms control, crisis prevention, East–West trade, European security and human rights. The second part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> was based on the importance of equalising the military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union. Defence spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev's death in 1982, 15% of GNP was spent on the military.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Brooklyn Preparatory, a Jesuit school, on {{a scholarship}} and graduated as class valedictorian in 1946.

Those years at Georgetown were probably {{the best years of}} my life, Blatty said in 2015. Until then, I’d never had a home. While studying for his master's degree at George Washington University, Blatty took menial jobs. Initially unable to find a job in teaching, he worked as a vacuum cleaner door-to-door salesman, a beer truck driver, and as a United Airlines ticket agent. He earned his master's in English literature from the George Washington University in 1954. He then enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he ultimately became head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Policy</b> Branch of the USAF Psychological Warfare Division.|$|E

To combat the NLF and {{to shore up the}} government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies.

5|$|Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel, {{a regular}} {{officer who had}} {{commanded}} the 1st Light Horse Brigade upon its formation in 1914 and later the ANZAC Mounted Division, became the first Australian to command a corps, when he took command of the Desert Mounted Corps in 1917. Birdwood was later given command of the Australian Corps on its formation in November 1917. Another Australian, Monash, took over command of the corps on 31 May 1918. Despite being promoted to command the British Fifth Army, Birdwood retained command of the AIF. By this time {{four of the five}} divisional commanders were Australian officers. The vast majority of brigade commands were also held by Australian officers. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> of appointing officers exclusively from enlisted personnel that was later adopted in the AIF, by 1918 the majority of company and battalion commanders had risen from the ranks. A number of British staff officers were attached to the headquarters of the Australian Corps, and its predecessors, due to a shortage of suitably trained Australian officers.|$|E

He did become aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> later on, as he and other Wehrmacht generals received reports on the activities of the Einsatzgruppen, the Schutzstaffel (SS) death squads tasked with following the army into Poland to kill intellectuals and other civilians. These squads were also assigned to round up Jews and others for relocation to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps. Manstein later faced three charges of war crimes relating to Jewish and civilian deaths in the sectors under his control, and the mistreatment and deaths of prisoners of war.|$|E
40|$|Part 3 : SecurityInternational audienceBy {{embracing}} {{cloud computing}} enterprises {{are able to}} boost their agility and productivity whilst realising significant cost savings. However, due to security and privacy concerns, many enterprises are reluctant to migrate their data and operations to the cloud. One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise access control policies that infuse suitable security controls into cloud services. Nevertheless, the complexity inherent in such <b>policies,</b> stemming from <b>the</b> dynamic nature <b>of</b> cloud environments, calls for a framework that provides assurances with respect to <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>policies.</b> In this respect, this work proposes a class <b>of</b> constraints, <b>the</b> so-called well-formedness constraints, that provide such assurances by empowering stakeholders to harness <b>the</b> attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>policies.</b> Both <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> and <b>the</b> constraints are expressed ontologically hence enabling automated reasoning about <b>the</b> abidance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> with <b>the</b> constraints...|$|R

Finally on October 27, 1950, officials took a vote that allowed the Texas college to include black players in games at the El Paso location.

5|$|The book {{discusses}} related legal {{practices of}} countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany. Israel {{was the first}} country to publicly acknowledge the practice—in November 2000. The author connects this policy initiative with Israel's ongoing conflict with Palestinian militants. Melzer argues that this policy was controversial—the issue came before the Israeli Supreme Court, where the matter was not decided for almost five years. The court's judgment was issued on 14 December 2006, but neither forbade nor endorsed the practice. Melzer asserts that it left multiple important legal conundra unresolved. Its significance was that it dealt not with a single incident, but rather with the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> itself and set forth conditions for examining the legality of future episodes.|$|E
