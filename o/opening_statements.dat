5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with <b>opening</b> <b>statements</b> or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E

Wally attempts {{to make light of}} the situation by proclaiming it an example of Krayoxx's side effects. Karros moves for a mistrial and the motion is granted, leading to the need to pick a new jury and the judge imposes a fine on the already financially strained Finley & Figg. Wally stands in for Oscar as lead attorney while a new jury is seated and for the first day of testimony. The next day, the recovering alcoholic Figg is nowhere to be found although an empty pint bottle of Smirnoff Vodka is.|$|E
5|$|<b>Opening</b> <b>statements</b> in McVeigh's {{trial began}} on April 24, 1997. The United States was {{represented}} {{by a team of}} prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E

50|$|Generally, the {{prosecution}} {{in a criminal}} case and plaintiff in a civil case is the first to offer an <b>opening</b> <b>statement,</b> and defendants go second.

Charles J. Cooper made an opening statement for the defendants, saying that marriage had been universally limited to opposite-sex couples. The plaintiffs then testified about their personal experiences as gay Americans, and the reasons why they wished to marry.|$|E

[...] Morton highlighted how unlikely it was that Canning could so profoundly fool her supporters and countered the prosecution's complaint about Canning's description of the loft. [...] The third attorney, George Nares, concentrated on the societal problems of prosecuting Canning for perjury, implying that other victims of crime {{would be less likely}} to pursue their assailants, for fear of being prosecuted themselves.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's opening claimed no {{personal}} prestige for himselfâ€”but nevertheless placed {{him as the}} spokesman for silver. According to Bensel, the self-deprecation helped disarm the delegates.

Bryan then recounted {{the history of the}} silver movement; the audience, which had loudly demonstrated its approval of his <b>opening</b> <b>statements,</b> quieted. Throughout the speech, Bryan had the delegates {{in the palm of his}} hand; they cheered on cue. The Nebraskan later described the audience as like a trained choir. As he concluded his historical recitation, he reminded the silver delegates that they had come to crown their victory, [...] "not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment already rendered by the plain people of this country".|$|E

Further, the only proven criminal acts took place outside the RICO act's five-year statute of limitations; without evidence that the [...] "criminal enterprise" [...] was still active in this timeframe the jury returned a special verdict clearing Massino and Vitale of these charges as well.|$|E
