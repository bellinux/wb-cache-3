5|$|The Jurchens were a Tungusic-speaking {{group of}} semi-agrarian tribes inhabiting areas <b>of</b> <b>northeast</b> Asia {{that are now}} part <b>of</b> <b>Northeast</b> China. Many of the Jurchen tribes were vassals of the Liao dynasty (907–1125), an empire ruled by the nomadic Khitans that {{included}} most of modern Mongolia, a portion of North China, Northeast China, northern Korea, {{and parts of the}} Russian Far East. To the south of the Liao lay the Han Chinese Song Empire (960–1276). The Song and Liao were at peace, but since a military defeat to the Liao in 1005, the Song paid its northern neighbor an annual indemnity of 200,000 bolts of silk and 100,000 ounces of silver.|$|E
5|$|A major restructure <b>of</b> <b>Northeast</b> Seattle service {{occurred}} in 2002 {{to accommodate the}} new Sound Transit Express route 522 from Seattle to Woodinville via the State Route 522 corridor. As part of the restructure, route 307 was eliminated and replaced by route 522 as well as increased service on route 41, which was extended to Lake City and given service 7 days a week with frequencies as high as 15 minutes at midday on weekdays.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on fossil}} and {{biological}} evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs, and more specifically, they {{are members of}} Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids, among others. As scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the Liaoning Province <b>of</b> <b>northeast</b> China, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.|$|E
5|$|During the 2014 {{election}} campaign, the BJP {{sought to}} identify itself with political leaders {{known to have}} opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Ram Manohar Lohia. The campaign also saw the use of rhetoric based on Hindutva, however, by BJP leaders in certain states. Communal tensions were played upon especially in Uttar Pradesh and the states <b>of</b> <b>Northeast</b> India. A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code {{was a part of}} the BJP's election manifesto.|$|E
5|$|Khmer dialects, {{although}} mutually intelligible, {{are sometimes}} quite marked. Notable variations {{are found in}} speakers from Phnom Penh (Cambodia's capital city), the rural Battambang area, the areas <b>of</b> <b>Northeast</b> Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as Surin province, the Cardamom Mountains, and southern Vietnam. The dialects form a continuum running roughly north to south. Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a Khmer Krom speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native of Sisaket Province in Thailand.|$|E

5|$|O'Malley {{initially}} supported Bell's candidacy. Bell urged O'Malley {{to endorse}} him, and offered him {{the job of}} city solicitor {{in exchange for his}} support. However, O'Malley began to distance himself from Bell, not appearing at Bell's campaign announcement, due to disagreements on several bills debated at the City Council. Bell's supporters attempted to convince O'Malley to run for City Council President, but O'Malley announced his decision to run for mayor in June, becoming the first major candidate in the race who was Caucasian. He began the campaign largely unknown outside <b>of</b> <b>Northeast</b> Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|Shamanism was the {{dominant}} {{religion of the}} Jurchen people <b>of</b> <b>northeast</b> Asia and of their descendants, the Manchu people. As early as the Jin dynasty (1111–1234), the Jurchens conducted shamanic ceremonies at shrines called tangse. There were two kinds of shamans: those who entered in a trance and let themselves be possessed by the spirits, and those who conducted regular sacrifices to heaven, to a clan's ancestors, or to the clan's protective spirits.|$|E

5|$|Beryl made {{landfall}} in a {{sparsely populated}} region <b>of</b> <b>northeast</b> Mexico, so no official reports of tropical storm force winds were recorded. Moisture from Beryl brought 0.8 in (20.1mm) {{of rain in}} Corpus Christi, Texas and 0.5in (13.7mm) in Brownsville, Texas in a 48-hour period between August 14 and August 16. The highest winds from these stations {{were no more than}} 28mph (46km/h). Cloud cover and rainfall resulted with cool high temperatures in southern Texas. Brownsville had a high temperature of 84˚F (28.9˚C) on August 15. This broke the record for the coolest maximum temperature in Brownsville for August 15; the previous record was 85˚F (29.4˚C) set in 1881.|$|E
5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled their homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast <b>of</b> <b>northeast</b> Mexico.|$|E

5|$|M-66 was {{extended}} southerly from Assyria through Battle Creek to the Indiana state line replacing sections of M-78 in 1965. The US127 freeway was completed from Mason north to Lansing in 1966, adding the US127 designation along the I-496/M-78 freeway. The next year, M-78's freeway {{was extended}} eastward to I-75/US10/US23 in Flint. The US127/M-78 freeway was extended north of I-496 in 1969, and a discontinuous section of M-78 freeway east of Flint was completed {{around the same}} time frame. In 1970, the I-496 freeway was completed and the Bus. M-78 designation was removed through Lansing. In 1972, the highway was rerouted to run east of Bellevue to Olivet instead <b>of</b> <b>northeast</b> to Charlotte. The next year, all of M-78 northeast of Olivet was removed when I-69 between Charlotte and I-96 southwest of Lansing was completed; this truncation produced the modern routing of M-78 in the state.|$|E
5|$|MD 410 {{continues}} east between Hyattsville to {{the south}} and the town of University Park to the north; {{the south side of the}} six-lane divided highway becomes flanked by the town of Riverdale Park ahead of its intersection with US 1 (Baltimore Avenue). The highway fully enters Riverdale Park east of US 1, where it reduces to four lanes and crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision, which carries MARC's Camden Line. The Camden Line is accessed by the Riverdale railroad station within the Riverdale Park Historic District {{to the south}}, which contains the Riversdale Mansion. A tributary <b>of</b> <b>Northeast</b> Branch Anacostia River briefly runs within the median of the highway shortly before the highway crosses over Northeast Branch. MD 410 intersects MD 201 (Kenilworth Avenue) and leaves the town of Riverdale Park. The highway continues as Riverdale Road, a four-lane road with center turn lane, through the unincorporated area of East Riverdale on its way to a diamond interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295).|$|E
5|$|Modern {{historians have}} taken new {{approaches}} to analyzing both traditional and modern Ethiopian historiography. For instance, Donald Crummey (1941–2013) investigated instances in Ethiopian historiography dealing with class, ethnicity, and gender. He also criticized earlier approaches made by Sylvia Pankhurst (1882–1960) and Richard Pankhurst (1927–2017), who focused primarily on the Ethiopian ruling class while ignoring marginalized peoples and minority groups in Ethiopian historical works. Following the 1974 Ethiopian Revolution and overthrow of the Solomonic dynasty with the deposition of Haile Selassie, the historical materialism of Marxist historiography came to dominate the academic landscape and understanding <b>of</b> <b>Northeast</b> African history. In her 2001 article Women in Ethiopian History: A Bibliographic Review, Belete Bizuneh remarks {{that the impact of}} social history on African historiography in the 20th century generated an unprecedented focus on the roles of women and gender in historical societies, but that Ethiopian historiography seems to have fallen outside the orbit of these historiographic trends.|$|E
