40|$|Tractors {{of today}} come {{equipped}} with a CAN-system. A CAN-system sends information from sensors to electronic control units who process the signals. The sensors measure several interesting parameters such as force, pressure and speed for various components of the tractor. This thesis discuss a force sensor which {{is placed in the}} pivot of the tractors three <b>point</b> <b>linkage,</b> the sensor measure the horizontal reaction force from the load that the tractor is exposed to. Signals from this sensor can be used to measure the force from any implement that the tractor is exposed to during an operation. The results from this thesis can be used for research purposes, for example, to compare implements from different manufacturer or to optimize the implement settings during an operation. However, there is a problem that this thesis aimed to solve by developing a method which can be put into practice. When a constant force from an implement is acting on the three <b>point</b> <b>linkage,</b> the reaction force in the pivot of the three <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> (where the force sensor is attached) is going to vary depending on the angel of the lower lift arm. It is not uncommon that the angel of the lower lift arm is varying, because different implement and soil require different settings on the linkage. This means that the force which is measured by the sensor may vary in size even though the actual force does not vary. To solve this problem, theoretical calculations have been performed and equations to describe the variation of the reaction force depending on the geometry have been created. The theory has also been verified by a finite element analysis and a practical verification test. The conclusions from these three parts correspond to each other. Theoretically that means by knowing the horizontal reaction force (measured by the force sensor) and the angles of the geometry on the three <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> (can be measured with a position sensor) you can calculate the force an implement influence the tractor with. However, there is a problem which prevents this method from being completely reliable. It is only working when the impact force is completely parallel to the horizontal plane. Since many implements are being pulled to the soil (plow, cultivator, etc.) in practice there are also vertical forces affecting the tractor. This is no problem to solve in theory, but in practice this method does not compensate for the vertical force. This vertical force should be examined more carefully before the method can be used reliably in full scale...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Software tools {{have been}} {{developed}} at the U. S. Geological Survey’s EROS Data Center to extract topographic structure and to delineate watersheds and overland flow paths from digital elevation models. The tools are special purpose FORTRAN programs interfaced with general-purpose raster and vector spatial analysis and relational data base management packages. The first phase of analysis is a conditioning phase that generates three data sets: the original DEM with depressions filled, a data set indicating the flow direction for each cell, and a flow accumulation data set in which each cell receives a value equal {{to the number of}} cells that drain to it. The original DEM and these three derivative data sets can then be processed {{in a variety of ways}} to optionally delineate drainage networks, overland paths, watersheds for user-specified locations, sub-watersheds for the major tributaries of a drainage network, or pour <b>point</b> <b>linkages</b> between watersheds. The computer-generated drainage lines and watershed polygons and the pour <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> information can be transferred to vector-based geographic information systems for further analysis. Comparisons between these computer generated features and their manually delineated counterparts generally show close agreement, indicating that these software tools will save analyst time spent in manual interpretation and digitizing...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of setup of three <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> on {{energetic}} and performance parameters of tractor aggregate. For this purpose were made two series of measurements. The first series was realized with the tractor NewHolland T 7050 aggregate with 5 -furrow reversible plough plough KUHN HUARD VM 150 5 NS. Data such as engine load, engine revolution, diesel fuel consumption, diesel fuel temperature, were got from CAN Bus network during the measurement. Then were measured following parameters total time of ploughing, dephth of ploughing, time of turning and swath of the tractor aggregate. The specific consumption of diesel fuel and the efficiency of the aggregate were calculated using the aforementioned parameters. The second series of measurements was realized with the tractor Zetor Proxima Plus 115 aggregate with four-furrow plough Kverneland 150 B. During the measurement the data such theoretical and actual speed of the tractor and force in the top link of three point hitch were recorded in the computer. Then were measured following parameters such as main time of ploughing, dephth of ploughing and swath of the tractor aggregate. By the first and second tractor aggregate were approved linear dependence of slip, performance and fuel consumption on the force in top link of three <b>point</b> <b>linkage...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} agro-waste disposal is {{a traditional}} and oldest method of waste disposal in which agriculture wastes are dumped {{as it is to}} degrade in a particular place for decomposing. As the wastes are dumped as such, it takes more time to degrade and it causes environmental pollution. The waste shredder machine aims to reduce the agro waste and convert it into useful nourishing fertilizer. It decreases the man work making the farm neat and clean. Also it reduces the heap amount of pollution, disease causing agro-wastes and produces a better fertilizer with vermin compost. The waste shredder machine is an attachment as like a ploughing attachment. In the shredder attachment input power and rigid support is provided by a KAMCO Tera-trac 4 W tractor by means of PTO (power take off) shaft and three <b>point</b> <b>linkage.</b> PTO shaft of the tractor acts as a basic power input and the three <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> provide a rigid support to the machine. Various kinds of blades are used for chipping and powdering operations like sawing blades, rotatory blades, and triangular shape blades. The blades are mounted on the shaft. The power is transmitted to another shaft by means of pulley and belt. For designing waste shredder machine, Creo parametric 1. 0 software is used...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} if a family in France, which manifests an autosomal dominant macular dystrophy, has North Carolina macular dystrophy (MCDR 1) and to determine its possible molecular genetic relationship with the original North Carolina family. Methods: A family from Northern France with a macular dystrophy underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations and were ascertained for genetic studies. Blood collection and examinations were performed on 38 individuals. Fundus photographs with a hand held KOWA camera were obtained on affected subjects. DNA was extracted and genotyping performed using new microsatellite genetic markers, which have recently {{been found in the}} MCDR 1 (North Carolina macular dystrophy) region. Standard two- <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> and haplotype analysis was performed. Results: Eleven individuals were found with the clinical manifestations of North Carolina macular dystrophy. Two- <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> analysis generated a maximum peak LOD score of 4. 5 with a recombination of 0 % between D 6 S 1717 and the macular dystrophy locus in the French family. The haplotype associated with the disease is, however, {{different from that of the}} original North Carolina family. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the macular dystrophy gene in this French family maps to the same region as that of North Carolina macular dystrophy (MCDR 1) locus but that independent mutations are involved. The disease in the French family is clinically and genetically similar to North Carolina macular dystrophy. Therefore MCDR 1 occurs i...|$|R
