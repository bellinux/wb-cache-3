25|$|Following the {{independence}} of Indonesia, Jakarta trams was still operated by the private company BVM. In the early 1950s, Jakarta tramways stretched across Jakarta from Pasar Ikan in the north to Jatinegara in the south. Trams (or Trem in Indonesian) were very popular because of its low cost. Many native passengers felt that as an independent nation, {{they are no longer}} required to pay fares, so many decided to skip paying their fares. Trams are always overflow with people so the conductors could not check the passengers on board. Many people decided to hold onto the tram instead <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>in.</b> Very often people go in and out through the windows instead. There was also a rise in labor unrest as increasingly confident workers sought better conditions. Greater competition from buses was also an issue. All of these caused huge impact on \BVM's finances.|$|E

500|$|The writing staff {{often used}} their {{individual}} life experiences for inspirations {{to come up}} with the storylines of the series' episodes.

Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life". The end of the episode, in which Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself". The idea for the episode [...] "The Secret Box" [...] also came from one of Drymon's childhood experiences. Hillenburg explained, [...] "Drymon had a secret box [...] and started telling us about it.

All the crystals for the show were provided by Swarovski; a team of 20 couturiers worked to complete the looks, which were embellished with more than 500,000 crystals from Swarovski Elements in four weeks. Beyoncé wore shoes by Stuart Weitzman. The dancers were dressed in Dolce & Gabbana and David Koma clothes. The band wore Alexander Vauthier clothes while The Mamas wore pin-up girl clothing. Some clothes for the show were also designed by Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles. Beyoncé also worked with David Koma who designed a panelled bodysuit with lace detailing. Koma described his collaboration during an interview with Vogue, saying, [...] "I absolutely love to work with Beyoncé and her team and I'm very happy that she is back...

2500|$|In the {{following}} weeks, Murphy became enveloped with the incident {{and wrote a}} radio documentary called Object in the Woods, featuring his experiences and interviews he had conducted that night. Shortly before the documentary would have aired, he received an unexpected visit at the station from two men in black suits identifying themselves as government officials. They requested {{to speak with him}} in a back room behind closed doors. The meeting lasted about 30 minutes. A WHJB employee, Linda Foschia, recalled the men confiscated some of Murphy's audio tapes from that night, and that no one knows what happened to the remaining photographs. A week after the visit, an agitated Murphy aired a censored version of the documentary, which he claimed in its introduction had to be edited due to some interviewees requesting their statements be removed from the broadcast in fear <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> trouble with the police and Army. The new version contained nothing revealing, and did not mention an object at all.

2500|$|In 1902, the {{flagship}} store moved uptown to Herald Square at 34th Street and Broadway, so far {{north of the}} other main dry goods emporia {{that it had to}} offer a steam wagonette to transport customers from 14th Street to 34th Street. Although the Herald Square store initially consisted of just one building, it expanded through new construction, eventually occupying almost the entire block bounded by Seventh Avenue on the west, Broadway on the east, 34th Street on the south and 35th Street on the north, {{with the exception of a}} small pre-existing building on the corner of 35th Street and Seventh Avenue and another on the corner of 34th Street and Broadway.

2500|$|Ted Dexter {{missed the}} first match against South Australian and as the main draw in the MCC side he had {{to play in the}} return, even though this meant missing the Victoria game. Johnny Moyes had a {{solution}} - two Dexters! He won the toss and batted on the flat wicket at the Adelaide Oval, still roped into a 75-yard circle. Peter Parfitt was a makeshift opener again as Geoff Pullar was recovering from a groin strain and was bowled for 2 and the 19-year-old Ian Chappell dropped David Sheppard in the slips before he had scored. Dexter hit three scorching boundaries before Chappell caught him off a full-blooded cut off Gary Sobers. As the England captain stalked off [...] he turned to Chappell and said [...] "You have a habit <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> the way, young man". The MCC were now 39/2, but Cowdrey came in and made the highest score of his career. On Christmas Eve (his birthday) he made 307 to beat Frank Woolley's 305 not out against Tasmania in 1911-12 as the highest score by a tourist in Australia. It was the first triple century made in Australia since Don Bradman made 357 and 369 and Jack Badcock 325 in 1935-36. Cowdrey added 103 runs with Sheppard (81), 98 with Ken Barrington then stroked 344 runs with fellow stylist Tom Graveney (122 not out), he hit 4 sixes and 29 fours and when he was out after 389 minutes Dexter declared the innings closed on 586/5. The South Australian captain Les Favell was always a cheery soul and he set about matching this huge total with some brilliant batting. Favell made 120 of the first 165 runs and John Lill (55), Gary Sobers (89), Ian McLachlan (62) and Neil Dansie (64) amassed 425/6, but Ian Chappell was run out by Ken Barrington for 2 and the last four wickets fell for 25 runs. Dexter turned to his spinners during the long innings and Fred Titmus (3/88), David Allen (2/54) and Ken Barrington (3/56) bowled 60 overs between them. Favell's century was the first by a South Australian batsman against the MCC for 16 years and the 128 run partnership between Sobers and McLachlan was a state record against the MCC for the fourth-wicket, beating the 126 made by George Giffen and John Reedman back in 1894-95. David Larter was hit for 0/113 off 22 overs, which pretty much finished his chances of playing in the Test series. South Australia's 450 ended an hour short of stumps, but Peter Parfitt was caught for 7 behind off Gordon Brooks and Gary Sobers bowled David Sheppard for 5. Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey appealed for light, which was refused and took the MCC to 22/2 when bad light finally stopped play at 25 minutes to six. Cowdrey was out for 2 first thing next morning and Dexter (37) smashed a six onto the roof of the stands, the biggest hit anyone could remember at the Adelaide Oval. Barrington made 52 not out and Dexter declared on 167/6, leaving the hosts 304 to win in 140 minutes. Favell took up the challenge, but was out for 3, soon followed by Lill for 2. It rained during the afternoon and the game was a certain draw, but Sobers hit 75 not out in 63 minutes with 12 fours before the game was given up with South Australia 113/4.|$|E
