25|$|With the {{way that}} {{everything}} is being done, with people like Trent Reznor and Radiohead, it was very inspiring to us that when you're doing things <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> {{you can do whatever}} you want. Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and have the freedom to release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do until we were on Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{original}} {{members of the group}} attended the Escuela Elemental and the Escuela Secundaria of the University of Puerto Rico, an institution noted for its progressive and experimental teaching approaches. Vocalist/bassist Willy Rodriguez commented, [...] "It is a school in which you are allowed to decide a few things <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own,</b> you have free time between classes [...] you can do your own things, {{and there is a lot}} of musical culture in the school. It tends to allow you to explore your artistic interests... There was always an air of liberation, of thinking <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> I think that influenced a lot in what we do today musically and ideologically." [...] Group members Boris Bilbraut, Willy Rodríguez, Eliut González, Juan Costa, and Ivan Gutiérres began jamming together in 1996, bonding over a shared interest in reggae music, particularly Bob Marley. [...] These rehearsal sessions took place in El Hoyo, a neighborhood in the San Juan metropolitan area.|$|E

500|$|I use micro-beats, {{a lot of}} whispery vocals, which I think sound amazing when they're {{downloaded}} {{because of}} the secrecy of the medium. The only acoustic instruments I would use would be those that sound good after they've been downloaded, so the harp, the music box, celeste and clavichord. They're plucky sounds.

500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] is {{a feminist}} call-to-arms, {{complete}} with muscular brass playing and soulful voice. Here Madonna is the anti-materialism girl, exhorting her female audiences to respect themselves. That means having {{a man who}} loves your head and your heart. If he doesn't treat you right (and here's the revolutionary rhetoric) you're better off <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> Like a female preacher, Madonna emphasizes each word of the chorus, invoking God {{and the power of}} orgasm. In parts Cosmo-woman, girl-talk, and swinging dance track, it presages the deliciously declarative stance of [...] "Vogue" [...] and shows Madonna moving from introspective to survivalist mode.|$|E

[...] He went on to say that [...] "it’d be nice, in a perfect world, just to be judged <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> merits", whilst hitting back at those who gave Powderfinger the [...] "sixties" [...] tag by saying that [...] "people that say that aren’t really listening, I think".|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} December 6, 2010, in Los Angeles. The working title was Fiona's Tale.

Sony Entertainment spokesman Steve Elzer explained, [...] "here is a comfort level in producing a project of this size and scope <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> backlot ... Basing the film on the lot also {{makes it easier for}} producers to interact with Sony's in-house visual effects team, and gives the studios greater control of quality and security." ...|$|E
500|$|The final rehearsal, or {{the first}} {{for some of the}} participants, was {{combined}} with the concert soundcheck, at Madison Square Garden, late on 31 July. Both Dylan and Clapton finally appeared at the soundcheck that night. Even then, Clapton was {{in the early stages of}} heroin withdrawal – only a cameraman supplying him with some methadone would result in the English guitarist taking the stage the following day, after his young girlfriend had been unsuccessful in purchasing uncut heroin for him on the street. To Harrison's frustration, Dylan was having severe doubts about performing in such a big-event atmosphere and still would not commit to playing. [...] "Look, it's not my scene, either," [...] Harrison countered. [...] "At least you've played <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> in front of a crowd before. I've never done that." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} novel at the awards {{ceremony}} in Piccadilly, London, Miller {{stated that he}} [...] "had no special sense of this one being the one" [...] and mentioned that [...] "it's a strange journey, you spend {{three years in a}} room <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> and then this: a little unsettling but deeply pleasurable"; [...] "It's a very happy occasion". Chair of the judging, editor of the Evening Standard newspaper Geordie Greig, said that the panel were basing their decision partially on the durability and memorability of the work, stating [...] "we were looking for quality". Speaking of the novel itself, Greig called it [...] "a rich and evocative historical novel which engrosses with its vivid portrait of pre-revolutionary France", stating [...] "The qualities of Pure stood out for its memorable gothic tale of morality and mortality." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dear Future Husband" [...] is a doo-wop song, and lyrically {{comprises}} a list {{of factors}} Trainor's love interests {{should be aware of}} before proposing to her. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone dubbed the song [...] "a YA dream that's no pastel-colored fantasy," [...] and opined, [...] " [...] imagines marriage as contract between equals who work and don't cook". The melody in [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] was likened to American singer Dion's [...] "Runaround Sue" [...] (1961), and sonically the song comprises a series of slick production slap-beats, a rock-inspired drum track, zippy piano and ebullient brass instrumentation. The EP's final track, [...] "Close Your Eyes" [...] is a modern slow dance ballad about ignoring negativity and loving yourself <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> terms. Backed by an acoustic guitar, Trainor solicits a nuanced, soulful, fluttery vocal performance afront pitch-shifted background vocals on the track.|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{the lyrics of}} [...] "Express Yourself" [...] make it a simple love song, with Madonna exhorting the women in her {{audience}} not to go for second-best, to express their feelings and get their men to express theirs. Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, described them as a [...] "feminist call-to-arms", with Madonna dismissing the satin sheets and gold baubles of material pleasures. As she said in the interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "the lyrics are my way of saying if it doesn't work, then you're better off <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>own.</b> Quite possibly there were some personal feelings mixed in the lyrics as well." [...] Subtexts are employed throughout the song, especially in the line [...] "What {{you need is a}} big strong hand, to lift you to your higher ground", where the [...] "big strong hand" [...] is implied as one's own hand, and not the typical male helping hand.|$|E
