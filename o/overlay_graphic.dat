40|$|The Dough Rule, in Turkish Land Law terminology, is a {{technical}} approach to readjust land resources in urban and agricultural areas. The Regulation on the 18 th Article of the Land and Building Development Law defines the procedures of land readjustment. The procedure is as follows: First obtain cadastral land resources and ownership records and then <b>overlay</b> <b>graphic</b> information {{on top of}} zoning plans, later allocate the land resources to the relevant owners after proportional deduction for public uses, such as schools, roads, and parks. In many cases, in the allocation process, relevant parties compete for higher-value urban lots, and the resulting allocation scheme is taken to court. In this study, the primary goal is to develop techniques to handle the difficulties in land readjustment and reallocation practices in Turkey. The developed techniques contain three authentic features: The first feature is the original mathematical models based on operation research techniques. In this feature, there are two Linear Programing (LP) and one Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models reallocating cadastral parcel areas into standard high quality urban subdivision lot(s) after proportional deduction of public land uses from all landowners under {{the frame of the}} Regulation on the 18 th Article. The second feature is the evaluation criteria which are developed to present superiority of the optimization models over the existing expert based subjective practices in land reallocation. Those criteria are defined in the form of equations utilizing the allocation results (objective and subjective). The third feature is the graphical presentation of allocation results in a system of rays from cadastral parcel centroids to urban subdivision lot centroids. This provides a succinct way of visual comparison among alternative allocation results. Over a case study area, first, the optimization techniques are applied, then, the obtained results are evaluated via the evaluation criteria, and later visually presented by the ray based allocation/transfer diagrams. Finally superiority of the developed techniques are discussed for further sophistications...|$|E

40|$|Video see-through Augmented Reality adds {{computer}} graphics {{to the real}} world in real time by <b>overlaying</b> <b>graphics</b> onto a live video feed. To achieve a realistic integration of the virtual and real imagery, the rendered images should have a similar appearance and quality to those produced by the video camera. This paper describes a compositing method which models the artifacts produced by a small low-cost camera, and adds these effects to an ideal pinhole image produced by conventional rendering methods. We attempt to model and simulate each step of the imaging process, including distortions, chromatic aberrations, blur, Bayer masking, noise, sharpening, and color-space compression, all while requiring only an RGBA image and an estimate of camera velocity as inputs...|$|R

Selected building contained additional data: e.g., interior shots, historical images, menus of restaurants, video interviews of city officials, etc., allowing the user to take a virtual tour through those buildings.|$|R
40|$|Augmented {{reality is}} a term used to {{describe}} systems in which computer-generated information is superimposed {{on top of the}} real world; for example, {{through the use of a}} see-through head-mounted display. A human user of such a system could still see and interact with the real world, but have valuable additional information, such as descriptions of important features or instructions for performing physical tasks, superimposed on the world. For example, the computer could identify objects and <b>overlay</b> them with <b>graphic</b> outlines, labels, and schematics. The graphics are registered to the real-world objects and appear to be painted onto those objects. Augmented reality systems can be used to make productivity aids for tasks such as inspection, manufacturing, and navigation. One of the most critical requirements for augmented reality is to recognize and locate real-world objects with respect to the persons head. Accurate registration is necessary in order to <b>overlay</b> <b>graphics</b> accurately on top of the real-world objects. At the Colorado School of Mines, we have developed a prototype augmented reality system that uses head-mounted cameras and computer vision techniques to accurately register the head to the scene. The current system locates and tracks a set of preplaced passive fiducial targets placed on the real-world objects. The system computes the pose of the objects and displays <b>graphics</b> <b>overlays</b> using a see-through head-mounted display. This paper describes the architecture of the system and outlines the computer vision techniques used.

50|$|Secure redacting is a {{far more}} {{complicated}} problem with computer files. Word processing formats may save a revision history of the edited text that still contains the redacted text. In some file formats, unused portions of memory are saved that may still contain fragments of previous versions of the text. Where text is redacted, in Portable Document Format (PDF) or word processor formats, by overlaying graphical elements (usually black rectangles) over text, the original text remains in the file and can be uncovered by simply deleting the <b>overlaying</b> <b>graphics.</b> Effective redaction of electronic documents requires the removal of all relevant text or image data from the document file. This either requires a very detailed understanding of the internal operation of the document processing software and file formats used, which most computer users lack, or software tools designed for sanitizing electronic documents (see external links below).|$|R
