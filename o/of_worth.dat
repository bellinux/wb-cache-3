5|$|Postwar {{redevelopment}} and anti-Victorianism {{resulted in}} the loss of dozens of Victorian buildings like New Street station and the old Central Library, often replaced by brutalist architecture. Sir Herbert Manzoni, City Engineer and Surveyor of Birmingham from 1935 until 1963, believed conservation of old buildings was sentimental and that the city did not have any <b>of</b> <b>worth</b> anyway. In inner-city areas too, much Victorian housing was demolished and redeveloped. Existing communities were relocated to tower block estates like Castle Vale.|$|E
5|$|Worth was {{originally}} a village {{with its own}} civil parish, lying just beyond {{the eastern edge of}} the Crawley urban area and borough boundary; but development of the Pound Hill and Maidenbower neighbourhoods has filled in the gaps, and the borough boundary has been extended to include the whole of the village. The civil parish <b>of</b> <b>Worth</b> remains, albeit reduced in size, as part of the Mid Sussex district.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} {{that she was not}} going to be a success on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house <b>of</b> <b>Worth,</b> where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, just big enough to suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
50|$|Goring-by-Sea is a {{neighbourhood}} of the Borough <b>of</b> <b>Worthing</b> in West Sussex, England, about 2 mi west <b>of</b> <b>Worthing</b> town centre. Since 1929 Goring {{has been}} part of the Borough <b>of</b> <b>Worthing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 20th century saw {{a continual}} {{expansion}} of the town, as it expanded to include local villages.

5|$|The coast path then reaches St Alban's Head, just to {{the south}} of the village <b>of</b> <b>Worth</b> Matravers. Between St Alban's Head and the resort of Swanage is Durlston Country Park nature reserve. North of Swanage is the chalk Ballard Down, the eastern tip of which has been eroded to form Old Harry Rocks– a series of stacks, arches and caves jutting into the sea between Swanage Bay and Studland Bay. This {{headland}} marks the end of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. Behind Studland beach, an extensive system of sand dunes have formed a psammosere, stretching for miles across the Studland peninsula. The peninsula forms one shore of Poole Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world. Part of Studland beach is the National Trust's only official naturist beach. The South West Coast Path ends at South Haven Point, where there is a commemorative marker. The Sandbanks Ferry links this to the Sandbanks area of Poole on {{the eastern edge of the}} harbour.|$|E
5|$|Through this period, Rowe finally {{concluded}} that Dundee was unsuitable {{for any of}} the researchers, and decided to move again. This time he selected Worth Matravers on the southern coast, where all of the radar teams could once again work together. Due to confused timing and better planning {{on the part of the}} AI team, they arrived at Worth Matravers from St Athan before the long convoy from Dundee could make its way south. This caused a traffic jam that further upset Rowe. Nevertheless, everything was set up by the end of May 1940, with the AI team working primarily from huts south <b>of</b> <b>Worth</b> Matravers, and carrying out installations at a nearby airfield. With this move the entire group became the Ministry of Aircraft Production Research Establishment (MAPRE), only to be renamed again as the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in November 1940.|$|E

25|$|In the {{development}} of the self-concept, he saw conditional and unconditional positive regard as key. Those raised in an environment of unconditional positive regard have the opportunity to fully actualize themselves.

25|$|Cleland also {{engaged in}} an {{idiosyncratic}} effort to prove that Celtic languages were the Edenic tongue from which all other languages were derived. He was himself of Scottish extraction and was fluent in multiple languages, but his philological works were nearly devoid <b>of</b> <b>worth.</b> He attempted to show that Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were all derived from Celtic roots. He pursued this endeavour through three books.|$|E
25|$|In 1553 Michael Servetus {{published}} {{yet another}} religious work with further anti-trinitarian views.

God, insisted Servetus, condemns no one who does not condemn himself through thought, word or deed. This work also includes the first published description of the pulmonary circulation.|$|E

50|$|Following the Norman conquest, William de Braose {{gave the}} manor <b>of</b> <b>Worthing</b> (then known as Ordinges) to Robert le Sauvage, whose {{descendants}} held Worthing for around 200 years. Worthing is first {{mentioned in the}} Domesday Book as two separate hamlets, Ordinges and Mordinges, when it had a population of just 22. By 1218 the Ordinges had become known as Wurddingg.The county of Sussex was divided into administrative divisions known as 'rapes'. The manor <b>of</b> <b>Worthing,</b> in common {{with most of the}} modern borough <b>of</b> <b>Worthing,</b> was part <b>of</b> the rape of Bramber. In the 13th century, the manor <b>of</b> <b>Worthing</b> was owned by Margaret de Gaddesden, a descendant of Robert le Sauvage. Margaret de Gaddesden later left her husband, John de Camoys, to live with Sir William Paynel, who she later married. It is likely that as a consequence of leaving her first husband for another man she then gave the manor <b>of</b> <b>Worthing</b> to Easebourne Priory near Midhurst, while in 1332 Sir William gave the nearby manor of Cokeham to Hardham Priory near Pulborough. By giving away their property to the church it is likely that Margaret and Sir William were acting in fear of their souls as the medieval church taught damnation was likely.|$|R
25|$|Although {{its founder}} was gone, the House <b>of</b> <b>Worth</b> was now an {{established}} entity; its most successful years were those flanking 1900. During this span of time, women were ordering 20–30 gowns at a time. By 1897, clients could order a garment by phone, by mail, or by visiting one of Worth's branch stores in London, Cannes, or Biarritz. Worth displayed garments at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, {{as it had}} at earlier great exhibitions. The company's annual turnover was placed at around five million francs {{at the turn of}} the century.|$|E
25|$|The fashion {{house had}} begun with 50 staff, but swelled {{over time to}} over 1,200 staff. This was work that {{required}} painstaking attention to detail, finesse and craftsmanship – a Worth bodice might have up to 17 pieces of material to ensure the perfect fit to its wearer. Seamstresses would be assigned to different workshops where they specialized in, for instance, making sleeves, stitching hems or skirt making. Most of the sewing <b>of</b> <b>Worth</b> garments was by hand, although {{the advent of the}} early sewing machine meant some main seams could be stitched by mechanical means.|$|E
25|$|The Second Empire boomed, {{alongside}} Worth’s brand, until 1870, {{when the}} Prussians invaded France. Worth closed his {{business for a}} year; {{he was able to}} reopen a year later, but wartime meant he had difficulty finding clientele, staying in business with lines of new maternity, mourning, and sportswear. During the siege of Paris, he turned his salon into a military hospital. At this stage, the partnership with Bobergh was dissolved – with the Swede returning to his home country. In common with other fashion designers, the House <b>of</b> <b>Worth</b> was affected by the financial downturn of the 1880s. Charles Frederick Worth found alternative sources of revenue in British and American customers and also turned his attention to encouraging the struggling French silk industry.|$|E
