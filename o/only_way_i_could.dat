Recently the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get control over the pain was by sitting in bed, pulling a chair close, and pressing my larynx {{against the back of the}} chair. That was very uncomfortable: But it was discomfort I was deliberately creating.|$|E
500|$|In early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist Dave Navarro {{and were}} on the verge of {{breaking}} up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, Californication, released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which affected the band's recording style during the album. Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favorite.|$|E
2500|$|Flea {{also had}} plans to record a solo album. He asked Chili Peppers manager Lindy Goetz to help him promote the record and his future solo career. Flea {{eventually}} abandoned the idea in favor of offering his bass services to other artists. He performed on over forty records from 1995 to 1998, ranging from Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill to former Minutemen bassist Mike Watt's debut solo album Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. He also worked with Tori Amos and Michael Stipe on a track for the soundtrack to the 1995 Johnny Depp film Don Juan DeMarco. Navarro was fired from the Chili Peppers in 1998, and Flea questioned {{whether or not the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers would stay together: [...] "...the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> imagine carrying on is if we got John [...] back in the band." [...] Frusciante had completed drug rehabilitation in 1997 after a severe addiction to heroin and crack cocaine left him on the brink of death. Flea visited Frusciante in early 1998, inviting him back to the Chili Peppers; an emotional Frusciante readily accepted.|$|E

2500|$|After Navarro's {{departure}} {{in early}} 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were on the}} verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. That was when I knew that this was the real deal, that the magic was about to happen again. Suddenly we could all hear, we could all listen, and instead of being caught up in our finite little balls of bullshit, we could all become players in that great universal orchestra again." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And you beat up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me!" [...] he begged. [...] "I am not blaming you, {{no one but}} my miserable self. I was not {{man enough}} to stand disappointment. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> live! live without----" [...] Isabel's eyes forbade him to finish. But he persisted. [...] "The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go on with life was to forget through forms, ceremonies, and flattery. When I began {{to work for the}} cathedral I had new hope. In reality I was less a priest than before. Yet I was more of a man, thank God! I {{intended}} to do my part like an honest architect. I wished to give my Church something worth while." ...|$|E
60|$|Somewhere {{within that}} massive pile was Dejah Thoris. Above me <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see windows. There, possibly, lay the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> by which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> reach her.

5000|$|Lynn {{joined the}} Cambridge Union {{in his first}} year at the University of Cambridge because he thought that he might like to enter politics. [...] "All of the main debaters there, aged twenty, were the most pompous, self-satisfied, self-important bunch of clowns that I've ever clapped eyes on. They were all {{behaving}} as if they were on the government front bench, and twenty years later they all were: Michael Howard; John Selwyn Gummer; Kenneth Clarke. I thought at that point that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever contribute to politics is making fun of the politicians." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{no little}} danger {{in making the}} attempt, because I might thus arouse {{suspicion}} {{in the mind of}} the sentry, or be seen by an officer who would insist on knowing why I was there; but it was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> by which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have speech with Darius, if indeed he was a prisoner, and I determined to take the chances.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} I {{am going to}} her," [...] Tavernake answered, [...] "and I have no idea in the world what will happen--whether I shall believe her or not. I can see {{what you think of}} me," [...] he went on, {{becoming}} a little more himself as the stress of unaccustomed speech passed him by. [...] "I will tell you something that will show you that I realize a good deal. I know the difference between Beatrice and Elizabeth. Less than a week ago, I asked Beatrice to marry me. It was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> kill the fever." ...|$|E

'I had to {{give them}} to the fox,' replied the magpie in a quivering voice; 'he has been here {{twice in the last}} week, and wanted to cut down my tree for the purpose of making snow-shoes out of it, and the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> buy him off was by giving him two of my young ones.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Of {{course there}} was nothing the matter with me, but I was very ill. I couldn't work, sleep, eat, or bowl. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get any sympathy was to go without shaving for four days. Even then {{somebody}} would say: [...] "Old man, you look as hardy as a pine knot. Been up for a jaunt in the Maine woods, eh?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Yang {{summarized}} his tournament strategy: [...] "I study my opponents very carefully, {{and when}} I sensed something, when I sensed some weakness, I took a chance. Even if I had nothing, I decided to raise, reraise, push all-in {{or make a}} call....The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> win this tournament was by being aggressive {{from the very beginning}} and that’s exactly what I did. And thank God I was also able to pick up some good cards at the same time." [...] Once Yang was guaranteed a share of the prize money, he pledged to donate 10% of his winnings to three charities (the Make-a-Wish Foundation, Feed The Children, and the Ronald McDonald House), as well as his alma mater, Loma Linda University.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will tell}} you one thing. They are {{not very good at}} forgiving. There was <b>only</b> one <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> deal with Nikasti in New York, and it was a brutal <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> have seen him twice since. He wouldn't look me in the eyes. I know what that means. He hates me. In a sense I don't believe he would allow that to {{interfere}} in any way with his mission. In another sense it would. The Allies, above all things, have need of Japan. We want Japan and America to be friends. We don't want Germany butting in between the two. Baron Yung is a very clever man, but he is even more impenetrable than his countrymen generally are. Our people here admit that they find it difficult to progress with him very far. They believe that secretly he is in sympathy with Nikasti's reports-- but you don't know about those, I suppose?" ...|$|R
60|$|As I sat {{and listened}} to Mr. Crowder, his story seemed equally {{wonderful}} to me, whether it were a plain statement of facts or the relation of an insane dream. It was not a wild tale, uttered in the enthusiastic excitement of a disordered mind; {{but it was a}} series of reminiscences, told quietly and calmly, here a little, there a little, without chronological order, each one touched upon as it happened to suggest itself. From wondering I found myself every now and then believing: but whenever I realized the folly in which I was indulging myself, I shook off my credulity and endeavored to listen with interest, but without judgment, for in this <b>way</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> most thoroughly enjoy the strange narrative; but my lapses into unconscious belief were frequent.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now I must {{be going}} again; but Justinia has made me promise,--promise, mind you, most solemnly, that I would have you back to dinner to-night,--by force if necessary. It was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make my peace with her; so you must not leave me in the lurch." [...] Of course, Fanny {{said that she would}} go and dine at Framley Court.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I won't," [...] {{she said}} simply. [...] "You see I'm doing a 'half-retreat'; and I stay with Sister Seraphina in her room; {{and she always}} sleeps two hours after the Angelus; and I got out without anybody knowing me, in her clothes. I see what it is," [...] she said, {{suddenly}} bending a reproachful glance upon him, [...] "you don't like me in them. I know they're just horrid; {{but it was the}} <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get out." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus from {{question}} to question I {{got the whole}} story. I fancy it was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> that night have stood by him. Outwardly {{at least he was}} himself again; the first sign of it was the return of that incongruous trick he had of drawing both his hands down his face--and it had its meaning now, with that slight shudder of the frame and the passionate anguish of these hands uncovering a hungry immovable face, the wide pupils of the intent, silent, fascinating eyes.|$|E
5000|$|In his autobiography, Renoir {{claimed that}} the great success of The Crime of Monsieur Lange in France led to his {{becoming}} strongly associated with the political left wing, so that the Communist Party asked him to make propaganda films denouncing fascism, a request with which Renoir was happy to comply, stating, [...] "I believed that every honest man owed it to himself to resist Nazism. I am a filmmaker, {{and this is the}} <b>only</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> play a part in the battle." [...] The films of the mid-1930s, starting with The Crime of Monsieur Lange, along with his writings for various newspapers, put Renoir in personal danger when Germany began hostilities with France, and friends in America, particularly the filmmaker Robert Flaherty, urged him to obtain a visa to the United States from the consulate in Nice. He decided to do so after he was visited by Nazis who attempted to recruit him into making films for the [...] "New France".|$|R
60|$|Had I {{attempted}} to write you {{an account of}} the whole of the adventurous career of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden, it would, in itself, have filled a bulky volume, to the exclusion of all other matter; and a youth, who fought at Narva, would have been a middle-aged man at the death of that warlike monarch, before the walls of Frederickshall. I have, therefore, been obliged to confine myself to {{the first three years of}} his reign, in which he crushed the army of Russia at Narva, and laid the then powerful republic of Poland prostrate at his feet. In this <b>way,</b> <b>only,</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> obtain space for the private adventures and doings of Charlie Carstairs, the hero of the story. The details of the wars of Charles the Twelfth were taken from the military history, written at his command by his chamberlain, Adlerfeld; from a similar narrative by a Scotch gentleman in his service; and from Voltaire's history. The latter is responsible for the statement that the trade of Poland was almost entirely in the hands of Scotch, French, and Jewish merchants, the Poles themselves being sharply divided into the two categories of nobles and peasants.|$|R
6000|$|... "To confess repentance," [...] he said slowly, [...] "would be {{to confess}} to a monstrous crime. Don't you see that? Oh, monsieur, have {{patience}} with me; let me explain myself a little. You say that I am in part responsible for something of all this that has happened. My exhortations {{of the people at}} Rennes and twice afterwards at Nantes are said to have had their share in what followed there. It may be so. It would be beyond my power positively to deny it. Revolution followed and bloodshed. More may yet come. To repent implies a recognition that I have done wrong. How shall I say that I have done wrong, and thus take a share of the responsibility for all that blood upon my soul? I will be quite frank with you to show you how far, indeed, I am from repentance. What I did, I actually did against all my convictions at the time. Because there was no justice in France to move against the murderer of Philippe de Vilmorin, I moved in the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> imagined <b>could</b> make the evil done recoil upon the hand that did it, and those other hands that had the power but not the spirit to punish. Since then I have come to see that I was wrong, and that Philippe de Vilmorin and those who thought with him were in the right.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet!" [...] Mr. Bundercombe said, {{a little}} grimly. [...] "From now onward {{you will be}} able to {{understand}} certain things. Miss Blanche informed me that to-day she had an invitation to go into the country. It was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> discover the day in which they were planning to bring off the coup. If I had been an occasional visitor she might have risked my coming and finding her away. Since, however, I presented myself every morning at eleven o'clock she was forced to tell me. You understand as much as that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} of nothing else all the night, Mr. Henderson. I put myself in Julian's position, {{and it seemed to}} me that, hearing a gun fired so close at hand, even if he did not hear a cry, Julian knowing how often the man had been threatened, might at once have run to the spot, and might have behaved just as Faulkner says he did. All that seemed to me simple enough; Julian's absence was the only difficulty, and the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> possibly account for it, was that he had followed the murderer." ...|$|E
60|$|The Australian specialists {{agreed that}} the malady was non-parasitic, and that, therefore, it must be nervous. It did not mend, and it was {{impossible}} for me to continue the voyage. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have continued it would have been by being lashed in my bunk, for in my helpless condition, unable to clutch with my hands, I could not have moved about on a small rolling boat. Also, I said to myself that while there were many boats and many voyages, I had but one pair of hands and one set of toe-nails. Still further, I reasoned that in my own climate of California I had always maintained a stable nervous equilibrium. So back I came.|$|E

60|$|I was {{now going}} at {{what seemed like}} a speed of ninety or a hundred miles an hour, with the wind rushing in between my teeth like water over a mill-dam, and I felt sure that if I kept on going down that hill I should soon be {{whirling}} through space like a comet. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of to save myself was to turn into some level place where the thing would stop, but not a crossroad did I pass; but presently I saw a little house standing back from the road, which seemed to hump itself a little at that place so as to be nearly level, and {{over the edge of the}} hump it dipped so suddenly that I could not see the rest of the road at all.|$|E
60|$|But {{that night}} wasn't wasted. I had my {{pedometer}} on my leg. Twichell and I {{were in a}} pedometer match. Twichell had longer legs than I. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> keep up was to wear my pedometer to bed. I always walk in my sleep, and on this occasion I gained sixteen miles on him. After all, I never found that sock. I never have seen it from that day to this. But that adventure taught {{me what it is}} to be blind. That was one of the most serious occasions of my whole life, yet I never can speak of it without somebody thinking it isn't serious. You try it and see how serious it is to be as the blind are and I was that night.|$|E
