5|$|In this way, {{detached}} objects differ substantially {{from most}} other known TNOs, which form a loosely defined set of populations {{that have been}} perturbed to varying degrees onto their current orbit by gravitational encounters with the giant planets, predominantly Neptune. Detached objects have larger perihelia than these other TNO populations, including the <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> orbital resonance with Neptune, such as Pluto, the classical Kuiper belt <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> non-resonant orbits such as Makemake, and the scattered disk objects like Eris.|$|E
5000|$|The {{empty set}} is the unique initial <b>object</b> <b>in</b> Set, the {{category}} of sets.

5|$|As of 2008, {{only five}} <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System (Ceres, Eris, and the KBOs Pluto, Makemake and Haumea) {{are listed as}} dwarf planets by the IAU. 90482 Orcus, 28978 Ixion and many other Kuiper-belt objects are {{large enough to be}} in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium; most of them will probably qualify when more is known about them.|$|E
25|$|Rhemes, dicisigns, and arguments.

5000|$|An object has local {{state and}} behavior. An <b>object</b> <b>in</b> this sense {{is both a}} subject and an <b>object</b> <b>in</b> the sense used in the access control literature.|$|R
50|$|Equivalently, a {{universal}} cone to F is {{a universal}} morphism from &Delta; to F (thought of as an <b>object</b> <b>in</b> CJ), or a terminal <b>object</b> <b>in</b> (&Delta; &darr; F).|$|R
5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess {{emission of}} infrared radiation, Vega {{appears to have}} a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust {{is likely to be the}} result of collisions between <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars which display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.|$|E
5|$|By 1807, further {{investigation}} revealed two new <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> the region: Juno and Vesta. The burning of Lilienthal in the Napoleonic wars, where {{the main body}} of work had been done, brought this first period of discovery to a close.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new method for {{deforming}} an <b>object</b> <b>in</b> a static real scene, which interacts with animated synthetic characters. Unlike the existing method- making a new synthetic object {{to substitute for}} the interacting <b>object</b> <b>in</b> the real scene, we directly deform the <b>object</b> <b>in</b> image space using an image-warping technique with assistance from a simplified 3 D sub-model. The deformed image sequence is processed further using the Expression Ratio Image (ERI) technique to apply the illumination changes generated by the deformation. Using this method, we can maintain the photo-realistic rendering quality of the scene efficiently by preserving {{the appearance of the}} <b>object</b> <b>in</b> the real scene as it is. ...|$|R
