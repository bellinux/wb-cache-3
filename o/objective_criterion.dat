2500|$|Bloom and Stein {{wrote that}} Ruse's ethical {{arguments}} were interesting {{and that his}} discussion of the various theories of homosexuality was clear, intelligent, and innovative. However, they criticized Ruse for failing to acknowledge that {{it is a mistake to}} focus only on the origins of homosexuality. They also argued that Ruse, rather than try to evaluate various views of homosexuality, relied upon an implicit understanding of the subject. They criticized Ruse's discussion of social constructionism, writing that Ruse considered only the most extreme form and quickly dismissed it, and found Ruse to be guilty of inconsistency, noting that while Ruse at one stage suggested that there [...] "is no <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> for being gay" [...] he often disregarded that view. They found Ruse's discussion of bisexuality to be unsatisfactory and inaccurate. They also criticized Ruse's treatment of sociobiology, arguing that he failed to recognized the shortcomings of sociobiological theories, including their failure to explain bisexuality. They criticized the amount of space Ruse devoted to discussing psychoanalytic theories, arguing that their lack of empirical support meant that the attention was undeserved. Bloom and Stein concluded that Ruse's work is far from a definitive discussion of its subject and is [...] "best viewed as a first attempt at addressing a range of deep and complex issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, the ECJ then {{ruled in}} the Puccini case (or La Bohème case) that the {{non-discrimination}} clause was even applicable to nationals of EU member countries {{who had died}} before the EU came into existence, and it also explicitly reiterated that the comparison of terms {{was a violation of}} said non-discrimination rule. This case was about a performance of the opera La Bohème by Puccini by a state-owned theatre in Wiesbaden in the German state of Hesse in the seasons 1993/94 and 1994/95. Under the German laws of the time, the rule of the shorter term applied to foreign works and the opera was thus in the public domain in Germany since the end of 1980, when its 56-year Italian copyright term had run out. (Puccini had died on November 29, 1924.) Domestic works at the same time enjoyed a copyright term of 70 years after the authors death in Germany. A publisher of musical works claimed to hold the rights to Puccini's works in Germany, and took the state of Hesse to court, based on the non-discrimination clause, which he claimed prescribed a copyright term of 70 years in Germany also for foreign works. The Federal Court of Justice of Germany had doubts about whether the non-discrimination clause could be applied to authors deceased before the EU existed and referred the question to the ECJ, who fully confirmed the plaintiff's reading. The court flatly rejected the interpretation brought forth by the state of Hesse that the comparison of terms was based on the country of origin of a work, not on the nationality of an author, and thus was an <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> and not discrimination of the grounds of nationality. The court concluded that ...|$|E

Historical colonization of Ukraine is one reason that creates confusion about national identity to this day. Many citizens of Ukraine have adopted the Ukrainian national identity in the past 20 years.

50|$|It is {{well known}} in {{elementary}} geometry that certain geometrical constructions are simpler than certain others. But in many case {{it turns out that the}} apparent simplicity of a construction does not consist in the practical execution of the construction, but in the brevity of the statement of what has to be done. Can then any <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> be laid down by which an estimate may be formed of the relative simplicity of several different constructions for attaining the same end? Lemoine developed the ideas of geometrography to answer this question.|$|E
50|$|A utility {{function}} {{is considered to}} be measurable, if the strength of preference or intensity of liking of a good or service is determined with precision by the use of some objective criteria. For example, suppose that eating an apple gives to a person exactly half the pleasure of that of eating an orange. This would be a measurable utility if and only if the test employed for its direct measurement is based on an <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> that could let any external observer repeat the results accurately. One hypothetical way to achieve this would be by the use of an hedonometer, which was the instrument suggested by Edgeworth to be capable of registering the height of pleasure experienced by people, diverging according to a law of errors.|$|E

5000|$|As an <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> for socialism, {{production}} for use {{can be used}} to evaluate the socialistic content of the composition of former and existing economic systems. For example, an economic system that is dominated by nationalized firms organized around the production of profit - whether this profit is retained by the firm or paid to the government as a dividend payment - would be a state capitalist economy. In such a system, the organizational structure of the firm remains similar to a private-sector firm; non-financial costs are externalized because profitability is the criterion for production, so {{that the majority of the}} economy remains essentially capitalist despite the formal title of [...] "public ownership". This has led many socialists to categorize the current Chinese economic system as a capitalist or state-capitalist economy.|$|E
50|$|Kingship, and its polity (kerajaan), was a {{prominent}} pillar of Malayness {{in the area around}} the Strait of Melaka. Islam was another pillar because it provided kingship with some of its core values. The commercial diaspora constituted a group of people outside the Strait of Melaka area—Borneo, Makassar and Java—who defined their Malayness primarily in terms of language and customs,which were the third and fourth accepted pillars of Malayness, respectively. While Islam was an <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> to define the kingship and his subjects (Muslim and non-Muslims), anyone who claimed to embrace Islam could be counted as Malay. Non-Muslims and non-Malays could be labelled as Malays as long as they spoke and wrote Malay and followed a Malay way of life, or if they Masuk Melayu —meaning, don certain clothes, follow certain culinary practices, and {{become an integral part of}} the Malay-speaking trading network. The Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch used the labels 'Malay' and 'Malayness' in this way.|$|E
5000|$|Hitherto, sociologists {{had found}} it {{difficult}} to distinguish the important and the unimportant in the complex network of social phenomena (that is the root of subjectivism in sociology) and had been unable to discover any <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> for such a demarcation. Materialism provided an absolutely <b>objective</b> <b>criterion</b> by singling out [...] "production relations" [...] as the structure of society, and by making it possible to apply to these relations that general scientific criterion of recurrence whose applicability to sociology the subjectivists denied. So long as they confined themselves to ideological social relations (i.e., such as, before taking shape, pass through mans consciousness) - we are, of course, referring all the time to the consciousness of social relations and no others - they could not observe recurrence and regularity in the social phenomena of the various countries, and their science was at best only a description of these phenomena, a collection of raw material. The analysis of material social relations (i.e., of those that take shape without passing through mans consciousness: when exchanging products men enter into production relations without even realising that there is a social relation of production here)—the analysis of material social relations at once made it possible to observe recurrence and regularity and to generalise the systems of the various countries in the single fundamental concept: social formation. It was this generalisation alone that made it possible to proceed from the description of social phenomena (and their evaluation from the standpoint of an ideal) to their strictly scientific analysis, which isolates, let us say by way of example, that which distinguishes one capitalist country from another and investigates that which is common to all of them... Then, however, Marx, who had expressed this hypothesis in the forties, set out to study the factual (nota bene) material. He took one of the social-economic formations—the system of commodity production—and {{on the basis of a}} vast mass of data (which he studied for not less than twenty five years) gave a most detailed analysis of the laws governing the functioning of this formation and its development." ...|$|E
