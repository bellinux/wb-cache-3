Current research involves using primates as the recipients of organs from pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce the primates' immune response against the pig tissue.

5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task {{shifting}} strategies to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task shifting, {{which has been}} successful in many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Another form of task shifting involves training health-oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|E

25|$|In 1881, 60,000 to 100,000 {{indigenous}} {{people lived in}} North Boreno. The people on the coast were mainly Muslims, with the aborigines mostly located inland.

Therefore, in a further institutional shift, in 1973 three new organizations were created, {{each by its own}} law: The Amman Water and Sewer Authority (AWSA), the Drinking Water Supply Corporation (DWSC) in charge of water supply in the areas outside the capital, and the Jordan Valley Commission (JVC). In the meantime, Jordan’s population had grown to 1.5 million because of natural growth and the influx of Palestinian refugees in 1967. The growing capital ran out of water and its supply became intermittent. In order to <b>overcome</b> <b>the</b> <b>shortage,</b> the Cabinet approved two projects in 1977: The first was the construction of a carrier from Deiralla in the Jordan Valley to pump drinking water to Amman, and the second was the construction of a carrier from the Azraq oasis east of the capital.
