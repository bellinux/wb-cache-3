40|$|Trabajo presentado en el Moscow Forum PROTIST 2016, celebrado en Moscú del 6 al 10 de junio de 2016. Capsaspora owczarzaki {{is one of}} {{only two}} known members of Filasterea – a group of protists closely related to animals. Due to its phylogenetic position, complex life cycle, and wide gene repertoire, it has become an {{important}} non-model organism in evolutionary studies, especially on the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> C. owczarzaki was isolated from several strains of freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata. However, it remains unclear whether it is an obligate symbiont or it can have a free-living lifestyle. In order to answer this question, we tested the interaction of C. owczarzaki with bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes), with other unicellular eukaryotes (Dyctiostelium discoideum and Acanthamoeba castellani), and with B. glabrata embryonic (BGE) cells. The interactions were observed and documented by microscopy. In addition, we followed the growth of C. owczarzaki in the presence of these organisms. We found that C. owczarzaki is able to grow on a diet consisting only of bacteria. Furthermore, it efficiently kills and consumes Dictyostelium discoideum and BGE cells, and ingests material from live Acathamoeba castellanii. We performed RNAseq of C. owczarzaki fed by the organisms mentioned before and found distinct expression profiles for each food type. Our results strongly suggest that C. owczarzaki is not an obligate snail symbiont, but rather an opportunistic predatory organism able to feed on a variety of food types. This research increases the knowledge on the diversity of lifestyles among unicellular holozoans, and has implications on our understanding of the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> N...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} to multicellularity that launched {{the evolution of}} animals from protozoa marks {{one of the most}} pivotal, and poorly understood, events in life's history. Advances in phylogenetics and comparative genomics, and particularly the study of choanoflagellates, are yielding new insights into the biology of the unicellular progenitors of animals. Signaling and adhesion gene families critical for animal development (including receptor tyrosine kinases and cadherins) evolved in protozoa before the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> Innovations in transcriptional regulation and expansions of certain gene families may have allowed the integration of cell behavior during the earliest experiments with multicellularity. The protozoan perspective on animal origins promises to provide a valuable window into the distant past and into the cellular bases of animal development...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of animals from a unicellular ancestor involvedmany innovations. Choanoflagellates, unicellular and colonial protozoa {{closely related to}} Metazoa, provide a potential window into early animal evolution. We have found that choanoflagellates express representatives of {{a surprising number of}} cell sig-naling and adhesion protein families that have not previously been isolated from nonmetazoans, including cadherins, C-type lectins, several tyrosine ki-nases, and tyrosine kinase signaling pathway components. Choanoflagellates have a complex and dynamic tyrosine phosphoprotein profile, and cell prolif-eration is selectively affected by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The expression in choanoflagellates of proteins involved in cell interactions in Metazoa demon-strates that these proteins evolved before the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> and were later co-opted for development. A central question in animal evolution is how multicellular animals evolved from a protozoan ancestor. One approach to animal origins is t...|$|E
