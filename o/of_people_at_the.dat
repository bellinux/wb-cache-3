5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
5|$|A damaged {{electric}} {{tower in}} Kenedy County resulted in power outages for thousands <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{height of the}} storm, an estimated 64,000people were without power in south Texas. Portions of Texas State Highway Loop 281 were submerged in floodwaters, leaving $50,000 (1999USD) in damage. Damage in Corpus Christi were estimated at $100,000 (1999USD). In Duval County, 200 homes were damaged by flooding and large areas of agricultural land were flooded. Damage in the county amounted to roughly $2million (1999USD). Five other F0 tornadoes touched down in the state. Damage to homes and businesses in Corpus Christi was estimated up to $500,000 (1999USD); agricultural damage reached $1million and another $500,000 (1999USD) was reported in losses. Slick roads from Bret's heavy rains caused the collision of a truck and a tractor, killing four people. Damage amounted to $15million (1999USD) throughout southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|In Haiti, about 630,000 {{people were}} still living in tents across areas devastated by the January 2010 {{earthquake}} prior to Emily's arrival. Due {{to the lack of}} sturdy structure to ride out a storm, fears arose over how they would fare with a tropical cyclone passing through the country. Emergency officials in the country set aside 22 large buses to evacuate thousands <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> risk of flooding. Additionally, residents were urged to conserve food and safeguard their belongings. The United Nations placed 11,500 troops in the country on standby to assist in recovery efforts should they be necessitated. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also put emergency teams on standby to deliver food support in addition to the 125,000 people already assisted. In advance of the storm, authorities closed all airports and landing sites in country.|$|E

She clarified that she did not base her performance on other characters from horror stories. Surprised by the amount of history incorporated into Salem, she commented that show creators Adam Simon and Brannon Braga relied on [...] "anecdotal evidence <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time" [...] when writing storylines for her character {{and the rest of the}} cast. Lawless characterized Ingrid as a [...] "serious piece of work" [...] and the [...] "soul of violence" [...] even though she also possesses [...] "her charms and her wits and her elegance and her generosity".|$|E
500|$|After {{the arrest}} in Toronto, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a file on Hendrix, which grew to seven pages, {{including}} {{documents related to}} his previous arrests for stealing cars {{at the age of}} 19. Yorke and Fong-Torres wrote, [...] "The populace of Toronto are a very conservative lot, and tend to look with suspicion upon anybody who looks and dresses a little different from themselves. Hendrix looks a lot different." [...] Lawrence commented: [...] "The prevailing political attitude in Canada regarding Hendrix was 'We have to make an example of this fuzzy-haired black weirdo'." [...] Shapiro and Glebbeek asserted their suspicion regarding the presence of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), who did not typically make arrests at the airport. They also speculated that Canadian authorities had anticipated a public spectacle, intentionally searching the Hendrix entourage in plain view <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport.|$|E

Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face, as if he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E

500|$|... m. Drastic {{cuts were}} {{implemented}} in progressive taxation and public spending, including on welfare. Income and wealth were massively redistributed toward {{a small number}} <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top {{at the price of}} impoverishment of a large number at the bottom. The unemployment had reached an all-time high of 20% by the end of 2003, just before the European Union membership came to the rescue. As a result of high unemployment, it took at least a decade for the average real pay to reach the level from before 1989 and joining the Union triggered the greatest peacetime wave of permanent economic migration out of the country. The reforms undertaken by the Polish elites were of an overwhelmingly economic character. Their socially detrimental consequences included the lasting political polarization over the practically limited range of choices: economic liberalism lacking any communal concerns on the one hand, and the conservative, patriarchal and parochial backwaters of Polish nationalism on the other.|$|E
500|$|Bridges left Brackley in {{the summer}} and signed for Northern Premier League side King's Lynn Town in May 2014. On {{securing}} the signing of Bridges for the season, manager Gary Setchell stated [...] "I’m probably very, very fortunate I’ve stumbled across Bridgo when he’s got a lot going on outside of football, business wise". Whilst out injured, and having already obtained his UEFA 'B' coaching badge, Bridges was made first-team coach at the club in February 2015. He combined the role alongside continuing to play in the first-team. King's Lynn were moved into the Southern Premier League for the 201516 campaign and Bridges continued to feature regularly in the Linnets midfield during the campaign, making 39 appearances in all competitions. Bridges retired from playing in May 2016 to [...] "concentrate on his successful business ventures and spend time with his family". On his retirement, manager Setchell said “David will be missed by a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> football club but I totally understand his decision to call it a day on his fantastic playing career and pursue his business interests and spend more time with his young family.” ...|$|E
500|$|Everyday {{reality in}} Caligari is {{dominated}} by tyrannical aspects. Authorities sit atop high perches above the people they deal with and hold offices out of sight {{at the end of}} long, forbidding stairways. Most of the film's characters are caricatures who fit neatly into prescribed social roles, such as the outraged citizens chasing a public enemy, the authoritarian police who are deferential to their superiors, the oft-harassed bureaucratic town clerk, and the asylum attendants who act like stereotypical [...] "little men in white suits". Only Dr. Caligari and Cesare are atypical of social roles, [...] instead serving as, in Barlow's words, [...] "abstractions of social fears, the incarnations of demonic forces of a nightmarish world the bourgeoisie was afraid to acknowledge, where self-assertion is pushed to willful and arbitrary power over others". Kracauer wrote the film demonstrates a contrast between the rigid control, represented by such characters as Dr. Caligari and the town clerk, and chaos, represented by the crowds <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fair and the seemingly never-ending spinning of the merry-go-rounds. He said the film leaves no room for middle ground between these two extremes, and that viewers are forced to embrace either insanity or authoritarian rigidity, leaving little space for human freedom. Kracauer writes: [...] "Caligari exposes the soul wavering between tyranny and chaos, and facing a desperate situation: any escape from tyranny seems to throw it into a state of utter confusion".|$|E
