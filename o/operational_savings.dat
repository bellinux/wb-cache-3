40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of a {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) system utilizing two power generation units operating simultaneously under differing operational strategies (D-CHP) on the basis of <b>operational</b> cost <b>savings.</b> A cost optimization metric, based on the facility monthly power-to-heat ratio (PHR), is presented in this paper. The PHR is defined as the ratio between the facility electric load and thermal load. Previous work in this field has suggested that D-CHP system performance may be improved by limiting operation of the system to months in which the PHR is relatively low. The focus {{of this paper is to}} illustrate how the facility PHR parameter could be used to establish the potential of a D-CHP system to reduce operational cost with respect to traditional CHP systems and conventional systems with separate heating and power. This paper analyzes the relationship between the PHR and the <b>operational</b> cost <b>savings</b> of eight different benchmark buildings. Achieving <b>operational</b> cost <b>savings</b> through optimal operation based on monthly PHR for these building types can enhance the implementation potential of D-CHP and CHP systems. Results indicate that the PHR parameter can be used to predict the potential for a D-CHP system to reduce the operational cost...|$|R

The merger, however, quickly turned disastrous as efforts to consolidate operations, which were placed on an ambitious timetable, led to major problems. Computer system glitches led to lost customer deposits and bounced checks. Branch closures led to long lines at the remaining branches. There was also a culture clash between the two banks and their customers. Wells Fargo had {{been at the forefront of}} high-tech banking, emphasizing ATMs and online banking, as well as the small-staffed supermarket branches, at the expense of traditional branch banking. By contrast, First Interstate had emphasized personalized relationship banking, and its customers were used to dealing with tellers and bankers not machines. This led to a mass exodus of First Interstate management talent and to the alienation of numerous customers, many of whom took their banking business elsewhere.|$|E

5000|$|... 1. Efficiency funds provide {{capital to}} energy and/or water {{efficiency}} measures. Their goals are to reduce resources and save money. Project ideas are initiated and managed by staff from Facilities, Energy Management and/or Finance Departments. Efficiency funds tend to require a relatively short payback period and are typically not used to engage the broader campus community.2. Innovation and engagement funds explicitly seek community engagement in project proposals. The projects it funds may have short paybacks, long paybacks, or no payback requirements. Innovation funds often provide loans that require repayment for projects {{that will result in}} <b>operational</b> <b>savings,</b> and they use these returns to subsidize grants for projects that will not result in cost savings. Innovation funds are generally administered by a committee and often include significant student participation and/or oversight.3. Hybrid funds target resource reduction and cost saving, but also consider community engagement and outreach goals. The majority of funds follow this model. They finance efficiency projects in addition to a wider range of initiatives such as renewable energy development, solid waste diversion, and reducing use of materials like paper or synthetic lawn chemicals. Hybrid funds often seek to engage and/or educate the campus community in sustainability efforts. A broad set of campus stakeholder groups tend to provide oversight to hybrid funds while they are administered by facilities or sustainability staff.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a linear program (LP) -based {{algorithm}} to schedule battery storage co-located with residential solar photovoltaics (PV), when excess generation is compensated via net metering. While the objective of this LP-based approach is to maximize the <b>operational</b> <b>savings</b> that accrue to customers, an undesirable consequence to the utility is reverse power flow during the peak pricing period. We show in this paper {{that it is possible to}} balance the objective of the utility in limiting reverse power flow, with the customer objective of increasing <b>operational</b> <b>savings,</b> in the context of net metering. To balance the specified utility and customer objectives we employ a quadratic program (QP) -based algorithm, which explicitly penalizes reverse power flow. To complete our assessment of net metering, both the LP-based and QP-based scheduling algorithms are applied to measured load and generation data from 145 residential customers located in an Australian distribution network. The results of this case study confirm the absence of reverse power flow when all customers employ a QP-based battery schedule, with the majority of customers exhibiting <b>operational</b> <b>savings...</b>|$|E
