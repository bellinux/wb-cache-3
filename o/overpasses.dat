5|$|All the {{original}} World War II era <b>overpasses</b> dating {{back in the}} 1940s and 1950s built between Whitby and Oshawa will gradually be replaced with new <b>overpasses</b> as part of modern highway safety standards and to allow highway widening sometime in the future.|$|E
5|$|The freeway {{was built}} in phases with the {{frontage}} roads constructed first followed by the main lanes. The <b>overpasses</b> for Wiseman Boulevard, Westover Hills Boulevard and Military Drive between I-410 and Loop1604 were completed over the main lanes of SH151 in 1987. In 1988, the I-410 <b>overpasses</b> over the SH151 frontage roads were completed, as was the interchange with US90 at the eastern terminus. Also completed in 1988 were the frontage road bridges over Leon and Slick Ranch Creek, which enabled traffic to travel the entire corridor from Loop1604 to US90 {{by way of the}} frontage roads. The main lane <b>overpasses</b> at FM1957 (Potranco Road) and Ingram Road were completed in 1997. The <b>overpasses</b> at Pinn Road and Enrique M. Barrera Parkway were completed in 1998, and completed at Callaghan Road in 2000. Construction of the freeway was completed in 2004.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Reinforced {{concrete}} continuous box-girder <b>overpass</b> is {{a common}} structure form, Wangzhuang <b>overpass</b> is example, this paper adopts universal finite element calculation software to carry out finite element simulation analysis for reinforced concrete continuous box-girder <b>overpass.</b> Considering the influence of <b>overpass</b> structure weight and driveway load, the distribution law of <b>overpass</b> stress and displacement were researched. Analysis results show that, load’s short-term effect combination has great influence on <b>overpass</b> structure, driveway slanting load’s influence on <b>overpass</b> structure’s stress and deformation can not be ignored. Project summary Wangzhuang <b>overpass</b> is north extension engineering of Shangqiu to Zhoukou highway, the engineering’s southern borders with Shangqiu to zhoukou highway and Lianyungang to Korgas highway, north borders with Shangqiu to Heze section of Jinan to Guangzhou highway, the engineering constitutes transportation hub of Shangqiu highway. The main function of Wangzhuang <b>overpass</b> is vehicle traffic, overall length of <b>overpass</b> is 44. 12 m, upper structure of <b>overpass</b> adopts cast-in-situ prestressed reinforced concrete continuous box-girder, the size of box-girder is 2 × 20 m. Bottom structure of <b>overpass</b> adopts thin wall pilla, abutment adopts pillar type structure...|$|R

5|$|On April 14, 2015, PennDOT {{began work}} to rebuild seven {{existing}} <b>overpasses</b> on the Vine Street Expressway portion of I-676. The project, which will cost $64.8 million, {{is to be}} completed in fall 2019.|$|E

5|$|This {{contract}} {{was completed in}} 1993, after which budgetary restraints prevented the awarding of further contracts. As a result, aside from the interchange at Highway417 and some <b>overpasses,</b> construction activity on Highway416 came to a standstill for two years.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, {{construction}} {{began on}} the east–west expressway in 1991 under a 50/50 cost-sharing agreement while the City of Hamilton attempted to sue the provincial government for the reinstatement of funding for the north–south portion. In April 1992, work began on <b>overpasses</b> at Upper Paradise Road and Upper Sherman Avenue.|$|E
5|$|It {{features}} six <b>overpasses</b> and {{a single}} interchange, at First Avenue. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held on September7, 1981 to officially open the new route, which bypassed the former Highway3 alignment along Talbot Street and the short concurrency with Highway4 (Sunset Drive). The bypass cost C$16.5 million to construct, and features a two-lane roadway with allotted space {{on the north side}} for a second two-lane roadway.|$|E
5|$|Like the Philadelphia {{extension}}, {{the western}} extension required {{the building of}} long bridges, including those that cross the Beaver River and the Allegheny River. The <b>overpasses</b> along the road consisted of steel girder bridges and through plate girder bridges. Unlike the other segments, the concrete arch bridge was not used for <b>overpasses,</b> although {{it was used to}} carry the turnpike over other roads. On August 7, 1950, the roadway opened between the Irwin and Pittsburgh interchanges. Ohio Governor Frank Lausche led a dedication ceremony on November 26, 1951. The extension opened to the Gateway toll plaza near the Ohio border on December 26, 1951. At the time, the highway ended in a cornfield. Traffic followed a temporary ramp onto local rural roads until the connecting Ohio Turnpike could be built. On December 1, 1954, the Ohio Turnpike opened.|$|E

The total project cost is estimated at $180–200million {{and is expected to}} be completed by 2016.|$|E
5|$|Another {{commonly}} held misconception is that highway <b>overpasses</b> provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew {{and several other}} people take shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by. However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass. Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway <b>overpasses</b> were directly struck by tornadoes, and {{at each of the}} three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, the MTO {{began an}} {{environmental}} assessment {{into a new}} alignment for the northern connection with the Queensway. It was approved in mid-1987, with Cedarview Drive chosen as the ideal alignment for the new freeway. The MTO set out to design a four-lane route to connect the Queensway with Highway16 New, including a three-level free-flow interchange. A contract for construction of this interchange was awarded in late 1989 and construction began in 1990. During the 1991 construction season, contracts were awarded to construct several <b>overpasses</b> along the new route.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 2016, it was {{announced}} that the segment between Highway 407 and Stouffville Road would be widened from six to eight lanes, and that an HOV lane would be added in each direction. The project will also add a carpool lot at Major Mackenzie Drive, upgrade <b>overpasses</b> at Highway 7 and 16th Avenue, and replace the Rouge River overpass. The project will start in 2017 and is expected to be completed in 2021.|$|E
5|$|Since 1989, {{the only}} major {{modifications}} that have occurred on the belt route have consisted of the rebuilding of the southern I-15 interchange in 2001, widening from six to eight lanes from 4700 South in Taylorsville to I-15 in Murray in 2004, {{and the addition of}} an interchange at Legacy Parkway in 2008.

5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway, {{passing through}} Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for {{wildlife}} due to vehicle traffic {{and as an}} impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife <b>overpasses,</b> have been constructed {{at a number of}} points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{expressway}} {{portion of}} M-63 is {{a relic of}} a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph–Benton Harbor area. The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000–2002, with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001, {{and one of the}} two grade-separated interchanges, at Klock Road, demolished and downgraded to an at-grade intersection in 2002.
