5|$|In 2001, Toronto City Councillor Paul Sutherland {{proposed}} to add two toll lanes {{in each direction}} along the parkway, from Highway401 to Eglinton Avenue.

When these transfers were completed the following year, M-3 was severed into two discontinuous segments by the Campus Martius changes, and the southern segment between Clark and Griswold streets was added to an extended M-85.|$|E
5|$|Because of its ongoing {{structural}} weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed {{replacing the}} Albert Bridge {{with a more}} conventional design. A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in the withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposal,</b> but serious concerns about {{the integrity of the}} bridge continued. In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the mornings and southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.|$|E

5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposal.</b> On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
5|$|Following {{that the}} Allied {{offensive}} continued {{for the next}} four months, right up {{until the end of the}} war. During the Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at Lihons, Etinehem, Proyart, Chuignes, and Mont St Quentin, before taking part in their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at Montbrehain. Australian casualties during these battles were very high and coupled with the drying up of reinforcements from Australia, the rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> to introduce conscription and the granting of home leave to men who been serving since 1914 meant that by the end of the war the AIF was severely stretched to the limit. Consequently, during the height of the offensive it was decided to disband three battalions—the 36th, 47th and 52nd—in order to reinforce other units.|$|E

Nothing came <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposal,</b> as the Western Allies refused to consider the offer. In June 1944 Eichmann was involved in negotiations with Rudolf Kasztner that resulted in the rescue of 1,684 people, who were sent by train to safety in Switzerland in exchange for three suitcases full of diamonds, gold, cash, and securities.|$|E

5|$|Peter Law, {{the former}} Assembly Member (AM) for Blaenau Gwent, had {{been calling for}} {{passenger}} services between Ebbw Vale and Newport to resume on the line since the 1980s, {{while he was still}} a councillor. An initial feasibility study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> was carried out for Blaenau Gwent council by infrastructure project management company Capita Symonds in 1998. Stations at Ebbw Vale, Cwm, Aberbeeg, Abercarn, Risca and Maesglas were suggested, and the plans included running some trains to Cardiff Central via a new station at Celtic Lakes on the South Wales Main Line. Law made fighting for the line's re-opening one of his major election promises during the National Assembly for Wales election campaign in 1999. A plaque at Ebbw Vale Parkway commemorates Law, who died in 2006, and his work to re-open the line. It was unveiled by Jocelyn Davies AM on 10 December 2007, four days before the Ebbw Valley Railway's planned official re-opening.|$|E
5|$|Risks to {{internal}} security: According to Czech Ministry of Interior, the main danger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proposal</b> rested in massive transfer of now legal firearms into illegality, {{with up to}} hundreds of thousands of legal firearms entering black market. While the original Commission proposal would affect 40,000 – 50,000 firearms legally possessed by Czech citizens, Dutch EU Council Presidency proposal of 4 April 2016 would affect some 400,000 legally owned firearms, i.e. making half of all Czech legally owned firearms illegal with large proportion of gun owners likely refusing to surrender their firearms. The proposal as such is in direct contradiction with Ministry’s long-term objective of lowering of number of illegal firearms and of conducting effective supervision of firearm owners.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF's {{area command}} {{structure}} was revised in 1942, following {{the outbreak of}} the Pacific War: Northern Area was split into North-Eastern Area and North-Western Area, and a new command covering New South Wales and southern Queensland, Eastern Area, was created, making a total of five commands. In October 1943, the Air Board proposed carving a new Central Area Command out of Eastern Area, which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore ripe for subdivision. This Central Area Command would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern Queensland. The War Cabinet deferred its decision on the proposal. The concept was raised again in August 1944, and this time the new Central Area Command was to control maintenance units, as well as training and operations, in southern Queensland.
