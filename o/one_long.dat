5|$|Growing {{and wearing}} long hair was common {{among women in}} the Western world until World War <b>One.</b> <b>Long</b> female hair never ceased in western culture, though it was rare during the 1920s and 1930s, and was {{frequent}} especially around 1970 and 1985.|$|E
5|$|Holland Arms' {{functionality}} {{as a staff}} {{station was}} only useful for the Red Wharf Bay branch, but a signalman was still required for all Amlwch services. In about 1925, LMS introduced a switching-out system that could turn the Gaerwen-Holland Arms and Holland Arms-Llangefni sections into <b>one</b> <b>long</b> section. This was of particular advantage in early mornings and evenings, when the only services were on the Amlwch line.|$|E

5|$|Rockefeller, aged 86, penned the {{following}} words {{to sum up}} his life:I was early taught to {{work as well as}} play,My life has been <b>one</b> <b>long,</b> happy holiday;Full of work and full of play—I dropped the worry on the way—And God was good to me everyday.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was also}} quiet after lunch, and after <b>one</b> <b>long</b> period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, {{eliciting}} {{a round of}} ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E

5|$|Boston College punter Johnny Ayres kicked fourpunts a {{total of}} 159yards, {{including}} <b>one</b> <b>long</b> kick that traveled 55yards and set the mark for the third-longest punt in ACC Championship Game history. Kicker Steve Aponavicius successfully kicked a 37-yard field goal {{early in the second}} quarter. but after his secondkick was blocked, Boston College head coach Jeff Jagodzinski seemed reluctant to try long field goals and instead sent in the offense to attempt to convert the fourth down. Out of four tries, only one fourth down was converted into a first down.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence was shorter {{than the one before}} it by exactly one frame. The scene where Bart writes his confession was done as <b>one</b> <b>long</b> take to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode was the best of several attempts.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{throughout}} April 2009. Before it began, production designer Anthony Ainsworth partly reconstructed the Grid set {{to give it}} more of a concrete, underground bunker, feel. Though more television series in the UK are adopting high-definition cameras, the Spooks producers decided to continue using hand held standard-definition ones, which were more compact and flexible; the producers felt that using high-definition cameras would sacrifice the filming style of the series. For instance, a hand held camera would allow the crew to film <b>one</b> <b>long</b> take following cast members through tight spaces, like an average London flat. High-definition cameras would lose that ability.|$|E

5|$|No Doubt became {{frustrated}} {{at the lack}} of progress they were making with Interscope, who were proving unreliable in their support of the band. Instead, they built their own studio in their garage on Beacon Avenue in Anaheim, California Although the band had knowledge that they didn't want any songs to be released in an Interscope-distributed album, they recorded The Beacon Street Collection in their studio and Clear Lake Audio in <b>one</b> <b>long</b> weekend. Their independence shocked their company representative, Tony Ferguson, who had assumed they were recording a third single.|$|E
5|$|The animal has a {{karyotype}} of 46 chromosomes, with a {{total of}} 50 major arms on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes). The X chromosome is submetacentric (with one arm slightly longer than the other) and the Y chromosome is small and acrocentric (with one very short and <b>one</b> <b>long</b> arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E
5|$|When a mouse {{or other}} prey is spotted, the kite drops silently onto it, feet-first with wings raised high; {{sometimes}} in <b>one</b> <b>long</b> drop to ground level, {{more often in}} two or more stages, with hovering pauses at intermediate heights. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. Prey can either be eaten in flight or carried back to a perch. Birds will have a favoured feeding perch, beneath which accumulate piles of pellets or castings.|$|E

5|$|Wisconsin {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the Pacific Fleet from her commissioning to 1903; during this period, she made <b>one</b> <b>long</b> distance cruise to American Samoa in late 1901. In 1903, she {{was transferred to the}} Asiatic Fleet, where she {{served as the}} Northern Squadron flagship. She returned to the United States in late 1906, where she was overhauled extensively. In July 1908, she joined the Great White Fleet for the second leg of its cruise around the world, which lasted until February 1909. The ship remained in service with the Atlantic Fleet until early 1910, when she was reduced to reserve status.|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least <b>one</b> <b>long</b> polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E
5|$|After <b>one</b> <b>long</b> run in The Heiress, Richardson {{appeared}} in another, RCSherriff's Home at Seven, in 1950. He played an amnesiac bank clerk who fears {{he may have}} committed murder. He later recreated the part in a radio broadcast, and in a film version, which was his sole venture into direction for the screen. Once he had played himself into a role in a long run, Richardson felt able to work during the daytime in films, and made two others in the early 1950s beside the film of the Sherriff piece: Outcast of the Islands, directed by Carol Reed, and David Lean's The Sound Barrier, released in 1951 and 1952 respectively. For the latter he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. With his characteristic liking for switching between modern roles and the classics, his next stage part was Colonel Vershinin in Three Sisters in 1951. He headed a strong cast, with Renée Asherson, Margaret Leighton and Celia Johnson as the sisters, but reviewers found the production weakly directed, and some felt that Richardson failed to disguise his positive personality when playing the ineffectual Vershinin. He did not attempt Chekhov again {{for more than a}} quarter of a century.|$|E

5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years. The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck, but this feature is not well-developed in the female. <b>One</b> <b>long</b> white stripe runs along the back, with 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears. Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu's. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in <b>one</b> <b>long</b> line across the page. Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in this manuscript, whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in <b>one</b> <b>long</b> shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E
