40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe research on the development of a simplified version of the European <b>ozone</b> <b>model</b> using fuzzy rule generation methodology. The <b>ozone</b> <b>model</b> is used to predict tropospheric (at the ground level) ozone concentration. The simplified <b>ozone</b> <b>model</b> illustrates source-receptor relationships between ozone precursor emissions (NOx and VOCs) and ozone concentration in the troposphere, taking into account meteorological conditions. This <b>ozone</b> <b>model</b> was developed by the Cooperative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of Long-Range Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP). The EMEP model provides a detailed prediction of ozone concentration at every grid in Europe by taking into account physical and chemical mechanisms. However, the model is too complicated for nonspecialists, such as policymakers trying to set emission reduction levels that result in ozone concentrations below given limits. Therefore, there is a need for a simplified <b>ozone</b> <b>model</b> that can be verified by the EMEP model and that can be used for analyzing policy options. One approach is to use the fuzzy rule generation methodology. In this approach, the simplified model consists of a number of fuzzy rules. Fuzzy rules have a fuzzy proposition in the conditional statement and a linear regression model in the conclusion. The rules describe a complete nonlinear system by using several linear models and membership functions. The development of such fuzzy rules is called fuzzy modeling. The membership functions of conditional variables are determined by the subset of data which is obtained by a clustering method. The degree of confidence of a rule is determined by the grade of the membership functions for input values. The role of fuzzy logic is to integrate fuzzy rules smoothly. In this paper, a basic scenario, which predicts no reduction of ozone precursor emissions, is used to determine fuzzy rules, subsequent scenarios are derived from the basic scenario, which includes information on source-receptor relationships. Simplified models of three grids have been developed to show the effectiveness of this approach. This methodology can be used to develop models of all grids...|$|E

Air quality models are often used by policy makers as tools {{for the development of}} ozone mitigation strategies. However, the <b>modeled</b> <b>ozone</b> production is often not or not enough evaluated in many <b>ozone</b> <b>modelling</b> studies. The focus of this work is to evaluate the <b>modeled</b> <b>ozone</b> production in Europe indirectly, {{with the use of the}} ozone–temperature correlation for the summer of 2010 and to analyze its sensitivity to precursor emissions and meteorology by using the regional air quality model, CAMx. The results show that the model significantly underestimates the observed high afternoon surface ozone mixing ratios (≥  60  ppb) by 10 – 20  ppb and overestimates the lower ones (emissions by a factor of 2, and (iii) a combination of the first two scenarios. For southern and central (except the Benelux area) Europe, doubling NO x emissions seems to be the most efficient scenario to reduce the underestimation of the observed high ozone mixing ratios without significant degradation of the model performance for the lower ozone mixing ratios. The model performance for ozone–temperature correlation is also better when NO x emissions are doubled. In the Benelux area, however, the third scenario (where both NO x and VOC emissions are increased) leads to a better model performance. The impact of meteorology was examined with two sensitivity tests: (i) increased surface temperature by 4  °C, and (ii) reduced wind speed by 50  %. Both scenarios lead to a consistent increase in all surface ozone mixing ratios, thus improving the model performance for the high ozone values but significantly degrading it for the low ozone values. Overall, the <b>modeled</b> <b>ozone</b> is predicted to be more sensitive to its precursor emissions (especially NO x) and therefore their uncertainties, which seem to be responsible for the model underestimation of the observed high ozone mixing ratios and ozone production...|$|R
