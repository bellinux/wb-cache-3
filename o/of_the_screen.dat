5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters on the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and the enemies on the left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
40|$|During the 1999 -crushing season, the Malelane Mill {{installed}} vibratory <b>screens</b> after <b>the</b> quadruple effect evaporator. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> was {{to separate}} out any residual scale originating from <b>the</b> chemical cleaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evaporator vessels. This strategy was adopted after attempts to improve <b>the</b> flush out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evaporator vessels after chemical cleaning proved ineffective in removing all the scale. The underlying motivation behind <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> was to remove evaporator scale from the raw sugar that was destined for packaging, and which therefore compromised brown sugar quality. This short paper covers {{at the history}} behind <b>the</b> installation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> station, <b>the</b> sizing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> and <b>the</b> problems associated with tearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screens,</b> carryover <b>of</b> syrup and blinding. <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> in removing evaporator scale and methods <b>of</b> cleaning <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time across the screen, and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is added to a row at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> whenever a duck is hit. Games continue until a time limit, set by the machine operator, is reached.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974. In the game, two players each control paddles {{on either side}} of a volleyball net, with a ball dropped from the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The players bounce the ball {{back and forth across the}} net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> with the trajectory of the ball dependent on where it strikes the paddle. The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points, depending on the game settings.|$|E

5|$|Space Invaders is a {{two-dimensional}} fixed shooter {{game in which}} the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally {{back and forth across}} the screen as they advance toward the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.|$|E

A radar is displayed in the bottom left corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> which shows the location of various objects including friendly units, enemies, weapon pick ups or mission objectives. The current weapon equipped is always displayed in the bottom right corner, with the ammunition count.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>the</b> {{performance}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> unit {{in a paper}} plant using Genetic Algorithm. <b>The</b> <b>screening</b> unit in <b>the</b> paper plant has four main subsystems. These subsystems are arranged in series and parallel configurations. Considering exponential distribution for the probable failures and repairs, <b>the</b> mathematical formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem is done by Markov birth-death process. Using probabilistic approach, the differential equations are developed. These equations are then solved using normalizing conditions to determine the steady state availability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> unit. <b>The</b> performance behavior <b>of</b> each subsystem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> unit has also been analyzed using Genetic Algorithm. So, <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present paper will be highly useful to the plant management for <b>the</b> timely execution <b>of</b> proper maintenance decisions and hence to enhance the system performance...|$|R
