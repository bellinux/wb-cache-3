5|$|Ambulance {{services}} that have historical origins {{such as the}} Order of St John, the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and Malteser International often use the Maltese cross to identify their ambulances. This is especially important {{in countries such as}} Australia, where St. John Ambulance operate one state and one territory ambulance service, and all of Australia's other ambulance services use variations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> Maltese cross.|$|E
40|$|Antibodies that {{detect a}} {{spectrum}} of A antigenic specificities have been demonstrated in human anti-A sera. Some sera contain antibodies that detect a specificity common to human <b>A</b> <b>red</b> cells and buccal cells, sheep R, r and i <b>red</b> cells, pig <b>A</b> <b>red</b> cells as well as guinea-pig kidney cells. Antibodies reacting with the <b>A</b> determinant <b>on</b> pig <b>A</b> <b>red</b> cells may be absent from some sera. Another antibody detects an antigenic specificity present <b>on</b> human <b>A</b> <b>red</b> cells and buccal cells, pig A and sheep R red cells, and perhaps also on guinea-pig kidney, but absent from sheep r or i red cells. Other antibodies detect an A antigen present only <b>on</b> human <b>A</b> <b>red</b> cells...|$|R

5|$|At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, {{one of the}} party's founders and {{a member}} of the occult Thule Society. Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and {{introducing}} him to a wide range of Munich society. To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP). Hitler designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white circle <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> background.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{there was}} a break in {{tradition}} when the Echo title-piece appeared reversed out in white <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> background, instead of the more familiar red or black lettering. The new title-piece was designed to give a greater impact to the colourful front page. It {{was the first in}} a series of changes which included dropping Sunderland from the title in 1990, the paper simply becoming The Echo. This change was reversed in 1997, with a return to the name Sunderland Echo.|$|E

5|$|The 36th Engineer Brigade was {{originally}} constituted on 1 October 1933 as the 36th Engineer Regiment and activated on 1 June 1941 at Plattsburgh Barracks, New York. During World War II the 36th Engineer Regiment consisted of nine combat engineer companies trained for amphibious assault and support operations. Because of this training, the unit’s distinctive insignia was designed with a seahorse <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> and white shield.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church on}} {{this site was}} built in Saxon times, as the Port of Bristol first began. In medieval times, St. Mary Redcliffe, sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> cliff above the River Avon, was a sign to seafarers, who would pray in it at their departure, and give thanks there upon their return. The church was built and beautified by Bristol's wealthy merchants, who paid to have masses sung for their souls and {{many of whom are}} commemorated there.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{version of}} the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps. While the crest {{consisted}} of a single colour only {{for most of the}} time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre and FC Bayern München is written in white <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Red {{made his}} first {{appearance}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Reds</b> uniform as <b>a</b> sleeve patch in 1955. The patch featured Mr. Red's head, clad in an old-fashioned white pillbox baseball cap with red stripes. The following season, 1956, saw the Reds adopt sleeveless jerseys, and Mr. Red was eliminated from the home uniform. He {{was moved to the}} left breast of the road uniform, and remained there for one season before being eliminated entirely.|$|R

5|$|The seven castles are {{traditionally}} considered {{a symbol of}} the Portuguese victories over their Moorish enemies, under Afonso III, who supposedly captured seven enemy fortresses {{in the course of his}} conquest of the Algarve, concluded in 1249. However, this explanation is weakly founded since this king did not have seven castles on his banner, but an unspecified number. Some reconstructions display about sixteen castles; this number changed to twelve in 1385, to seven in 1485 and to eleven in 1495; it then changed back to seven, in 1578, this time definitively. An hypothesis about the origin of the castles <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> bordure lies in the family ties of Afonso III with Castile (both his mother and second wife were Castilian), whose arms consisted of a golden castle <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> field.|$|E
5|$|The shirts worn by {{players of}} Ipswich Town did not sport a crest until the mid-1960s, when they adopted a design {{featuring}} a gold lion rampant guardant <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> {{background on the}} left half and three gold ramparts on a blue background on the right half. In 1972, the crest was redesigned {{as the result of}} a competition, won by the Treasurer of the Supporters Club, John Gammage. Each element of the new design was intended to represent the region.|$|E

On April 15, 2008, a CD/DVD format, with a black background on the cover was released, which included music videos for the 12tracks recorded on Para Siempre, directed by Benjamin Hidalgo. A karaoke version of the album, with a yellow background, was released in April 2008.|$|E

5|$|William the Conqueror, {{the first}} Norman king of England, had {{a coat of}} arms with two lions. Richard the Lionheart used such a coat of arms with two lions <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> field (Loomis 1938, 47), from which the three lions of the coat of arms of England derive. However, {{there is no proof}} that William's arms were not {{attributed}} to William after his death (Boutell, 18).|$|E
5|$|A naval ensign {{has been}} used by Lithuania {{starting}} in 1992. The ensign has a white background charged with a blue cross, with the national flag in the canton. The width of each cross is 1/7th of the total width of the ensign, with the ratio being 1:2. Historically, this flag was used as the ensign of the Kaunas Yacht Club, but with a different ratio of 2:3. The naval jack consists of a white field, charged with a blue anchor covered by the naval badge of Lithuania. The badge consists of the Columns of Gediminas in yellow <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> disc. A masthead pennant have been adopted by the Lithuanian Navy to use on their ships.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather shako was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur Busby with a red cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki tunic and breeches, with a red stripe down the seam and a red lanyard worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> baize backing, a practice that continued through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E
5|$|Gotland, {{as a free}} {{republic}} loosely {{associated with}} the Swedish crown, had already borne a ram with a banner (Agnus Dei) as a well-known city seal by 1280. Although the island belonged to Denmark at the time, its arms were present at Gustav Vasa's funeral procession in 1560; the arms of Gotland disappeared from the Swedish rolls in 1570 but returned with the transfer of Gotland to Sweden in 1645. The coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon: Azure, a ram statant argent armed Or, bearing on a cross-staff of the same a banner Gules bordered and with five tails of the third. The county was granted the same coat of arms in 1936. The municipality, created in 1971, uses the same arms <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>red</b> field, influenced by the arms of Visby.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, {{the twin}} villages of Gahar and Gadafa in Wadi Hirran, where Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was in command, were gas bombed, {{killing at least}} seventy-five. The Red Cross was alerted and on June 2, it issued a {{statement}} in Geneva expressing concern. The Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Berne made a statement, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Red</b> Cross report, that the gas was {{likely to have been}} halogenous derivatives – phosgene, mustard gas, lewisite, chlorine or cyanogen bromide. The gas attacks stopped for three weeks after the Six-Day War of June, but resumed on July, against all parts of royalist Yemen. Casualty estimates vary, and an assumption, considered conservative, is that the mustard and phosgene-filled aerial bombs caused approximately 1,500 fatalities and 1,500 injuries.|$|E
