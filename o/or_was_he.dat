25|$|Still, {{the picture}} seemed unclear to leaders {{farther from the}} fighting.

In 1805 or 1806, the Fulani leaders at Guringa {{assembled}} a delegation to visit Usman and find out. Adama's pious reputation and familiarity with Hausaland made him a natural fit for the mission.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} whether Balaputra was {{expelled}} from Central Java because of succession dispute with Pikatan, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> already ruled in Suvarnadvipa (Sumatra). Either ways, it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and enthroned in Srivijayan capital of Palembang. Historians argued that this was because Balaputra's mother — Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira was the princess of Srivijaya, this rendered Balaputra as the heir of Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in Nalanda inscription dated 860.|$|E
25|$|The government's case {{included}} {{the testimony of}} two men, Frank Jones and Joseph Spagnoli, both facing felony charges originating from the same Secret Service office that Bolden was employed and who were facing upcoming trials before the same Chicago court. The case against Jones and 10 of Jones's con-conspirators was dismissed after the Bolden conviction. The copy of the secret government file on the Spagnoli counterfeiting operation that Bolden allegedly put up for sale was never recovered, last being seen in the Chicago offices of the Secret Service, disappearing before charges were brought against Bolden. Bolden was not accused of receiving <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> ever found to be in possession of any illicit funds from the accused felons who testified against him.|$|E

2500|$|The {{belief in}} the divinity of Jesus leads to the question: [...] "was Jesus {{a man to be}} born of a woman <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> God born of a woman?" [...] A wide range of {{hypotheses}} and beliefs regarding the nature of the nativity of Jesus were presented in the first four centuries of Christianity. Some of the debates involved the title Theotokos (God bearer) for the Virgin Mary and began to illustrate the impact of Mariology on Christology. Some of these viewpoints were eventually declared as heresies, others led to schisms and the formation of new branches of the Church.|$|E

2500|$|Rahane {{made his}} first Test ton at Basin Reserve, Wellington, New Zealand on 15 February 2014 against New Zealand. India was in a {{difficult}} position when Rahane came to the crease at 156 for five {{and by the time he}} departed with 118 India were in a match-winning position ruined by Brendon McCullum's famous triple-century. [...] "He had a mountain of first-class runs backing him, of course, but did he have what goes around by the queer name of X-factor? Did he have that extra edge in his game and personality that separates top-class international players from the rest? Was he merely humble, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> unable to assert himself, unable to absorb real pressure? After his first two Test tours to South Africa and New Zealand, we can safely conclude it must be the former. Underneath that seemingly soft exterior lurks a solid Test batsman, and he was on display at the Basin Reserve", ESPN Cricinfo wrote in their analysis.|$|E
2500|$|These defeats {{culminated in}} an attack on Dublin itself in 849. The Viking {{settlement}} was plundered and probably destroyed – at least temporarily – by Máel Sechnaill, who was now High King of Ireland, and Tigernach mac Fócartai. A fleet of 140 longships arrived in Dublin in the same year. The expedition was led by [...] "adherents of {{the king of the}} foreigners" [...] and their objective was [...] "to exact obedience from the foreigners who were in Ireland before them". It was also recorded that [...] "afterwards they caused confusion in the whole country". It is possible that this fleet was sent by the King of Laithlind in an attempt to regain lost ground – <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> perhaps hoping to profit from the discomfiture of rival Scandinavians? The following year, we are told, the Norsemen formed an alliance with Cináed mac Conaing, the King of Cianachta North Brega, and plundered the territories of Máel Sechnaill and Tigernach and destroyed Tigernach's crannóg in Lagore. If this attack was in retaliation for the sacking of Dublin the previous year, it suggests that the fleet of 849 was indeed sent by the King of Laithlind.|$|E
2500|$|During {{these years}} Croatia was {{elevated}} {{to the status}} of a kingdom. It is generally said that Duke Tomislav was crowned king in 925, but this is not certain since it is not known when and where was he crowned, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> crowned at all. However, Tomislav was the first Croatian ruler whom the Papal chancellery honoured with the title king. Tomislav is mentioned as a king in two preserved documents published in the Historia Salonitana and by the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, where Tomislav's rule was specified at 13 years. In a note preceding the text of the Council conclusions in Split in 925 it is written that Tomislav is the king [...] "in the province of the Croats and in the Dalmatian regions" [...] (in prouintia Croatorum et Dalmatiarum finibus Tamisclao rege). In the 12th canon of the Council conclusions in 925 the ruler of the Croats is called [...] "king" [...] (rex et proceres Chroatorum), while in a letter sent by the Pope John X Tomislav is named [...] "King of the Croats" [...] (Tamisclao, regi Crouatorum). Although there are no inscriptions of Tomislav to confirm the title, later inscriptions and charters confirm that his 10th century successors called themselves [...] "kings".|$|E
