50|$|In its {{original}} sense in South Asia, punkah typically describes a handheld fan {{made from a}} single frond of palmyra palm or a woven square of bamboo strips, rattan or <b>other</b> <b>plant</b> <b>fibre,</b> that can be rotated or fanned.

50|$|The {{moriche oriole}} is a bird closely {{associated}} with moriche palms (Mauritia flexuosa), and it {{is found in the}} forests, swamps or savannah where that tree occurs.

50|$|The {{breeding}} {{system of}} the Raggiana bird-of-paradise is polygamy. Males congregate in leks (display arenas for visiting females). Leks can be 30-100 meters in diameter. Within the lek there {{is a group of}} tall slender trees on which males compete for prominent perches and defend them from rivals. On these perches males do a display which involves clapping wings and shaking the head. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure composed of leaves and leaf pieces, stems, ferns and <b>other</b> <b>plant</b> <b>fibres.</b> It is lined with horsehair-like material and is situated 2-11 m above the ground on tree branches. The position of the nest may be higher in areas where humans disturb the nest. The female usually lays a clutch of one to two (usually two) pinkish buff eggs. The incubation period has been recorded as 18 days in the wild and 20 days in captivity. As in all polygamous birds-of-paradise, the female alone assumes all incubation duties.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} remedial actions taken against a contaminated humidification system, after an outbreak of humidifier disease in a nylon carpet yam plant. Methods: Two and 6 years after modification, a follow-up investigation of a strati tied (age, smoking habits) sample of exposed (n = 75) and non-exposed (n = 56) workers was carried out. Outcome-parameters were. respiratory symptoms, spirometry, skin tests and serology with various humidifier fungi. In addition, the yearly incidence of work-disability because of chronic respiratory disease during the years before, and 11 years after the modification was compared. Results: At follow-up, exposed workers, who remained at the same workplace no longer had significantly more frequent chronic respiratory symptoms. The prevalence of positive serology was still higher (P < 0. 05) in exposed workers after 2 years, but at the 6 year follow-up investigation, the difference was no longer significant. Prevalence of positive skin tests after 2 years no longer differed {{from that of the}} non-exposed workers. Slopes (ml/years) of the graphs of forced vital capacity (FVC) and one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) during the 6 year follow-up after the first investigation did not differ between exposed and nonexposed workers, both before and after adjustment for age, smoking habits and results of skin tests and serology before modification. Before modification, exposed workers with a positive late skill test had a lower FVC than non-exposed workers. After 6 years of follow-up their FVC was still lower, but the difference was no longer significant. There were no indications of selective loss to follow-up. After remedial actions no new cases of humidifier disease occurred. Moreover, the yearly incidence of work-disability in this plant because of chronic respiratory disease, decreased from 1. 30 % to 0. 27 % compared with a decrease from 0. 30 % to 0. 12 % in <b>other</b> synthetic <b>fibre</b> <b>plants.</b> Conclusion: Follow-up investigation of exposure-effects demonstrated the effectiveness of remedial actions takes against a contaminated humidification system...|$|R
40|$|The {{falling weight}} impact {{properties}} of composites obtained by introducing 16 wt% of phormium tenax fibres extracted with two different methods i. e., either manually or by paddocking and scutching {{and in both}} cases chemically treated with a 1 % solution of sodium hydroxide, have been investigated. The effect of the two extraction methods on fibre characteristics is compared by the tensile properties of the fibres and the flexural properties, fracture modes and hysteresis cycles parameters (impact energy partition, linear stiffness and normalised penetration energy) of final laminates. Laminates obtained using paddocked and scutched fibres are clearly superior to those manufactured using the manually extracted fibres: {{this is due to}} the more effective fibre impregnation in the former case than in the latter, which results in an improved dissipation of energy during the damping phase of the impact event. It is noteworthy, however, that the low volume of fibres introduced in the laminate with the manufacturing method adopted does not allow obtaining properties comparable with <b>other</b> semi-structural <b>plant</b> <b>fibre</b> composites, such as e. g., hemp fibre reinforced laminates...|$|R

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>fibres</b> have {{a unique}} set of {{properties}} ranging from being stiff and brittle, such as hemp and flax, to more ductile, such as coir, c ombining these properties with their cost and availability makes them attractive alternative reinforcements for the production of greener composites. This article reviews the tensile properties of various <b>plant</b> <b>fibre</b> or <b>plant</b> based natural <b>fibre</b> - reinforced polymer s reported in the literature. We critically discuss the use of <b>plant</b> <b>fibres</b> as reinforcement for the production of bio - based, renewable or green polymer composites, showing t he evolution of the properties of <b>plant</b> <b>fibre</b> composites. The reported tensile properties of <b>plant</b> <b>fibre</b> - reinforced polymer composites are compared against various renewable and n on - renewable engineering/commodity polymers as well as the tensile properties of commercially available randomly oriented glass fibre - reinforced polymers (GFRP). G reen composites containing random short <b>plant</b> <b>fibres</b> do have similar properties to randomly oriented GFRP at a lower overall part weight. U nidirectional <b>plant</b> <b>fibre</b> - reinf orced polymers offer better performance than randomly oriented GFRP and could have the potential to be adapted in applications requiring even higher mechanical performance, especially in areas where the use of costly synthetic fibres might be less attracti ve. Furthermore, <b>plant</b> <b>fibres</b> can also be regarded as effective fillers to replace more expensive polymer s and improve the green credential s of final composite parts.
