The Spanish then attempted to elect Benedetto Odescalchi, but d'Ailly declared {{that no one would}} be allowed to be elected unless they owed loyalty to Louis XIV. The Spanish soon sent word that their cardinals were free to vote for anyone. The letter was brought by courier and announced that Mariana of Austria had not actually excluded Vidoni nor any member of the college.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu Weekly {{found the}} story enjoyable, though noted {{that those who}} had played Destiny would get more {{enjoyment}} out of it, and praised the voice acting. They also found the gameplay and pacing enjoyable, positively noting the option to auto-battle. The game ranked as the 89th all-time favorite game in a 2006 Famitsu readers poll. Japanese website Game Impress Watch found the story impressive, citing its use of time travel and the continued use of Destinys world and lore. The gameplay, mini-games and customization options was also generally praised, with the reviewer recommending the title to players of the series. RPGFan's Woojin Lee was also positive, praising the gameplay despite the very high encounter rate, and was pleased that an auto-battle option was included. <b>One</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> received a more mixed response was the game's music, {{with the exception of}} the opening song. In a preview for IGN, David Smith was generally positive about the game. While he disliked the art style and its low-tech look compared to its hardware, he found the gameplay enjoyable and the opening parts of the story fairly relatable. He ended by hoping that Namco would put the effort into localizing the title.|$|E

5|$|Laurie Mains had {{returned}} from South Africa to coach Otago in the 2001 NPC, and after Peter Sloane moved to the Blues, Mains was appointed the Highlanders coach for 2002. Their season started with a narrow 3028 loss to the Crusaders at Jade Stadium, after leading 2827 at <b>one</b> <b>point.</b> <b>That</b> year the Highlanders also achieved a win over all four South African teams; a Grand Slam {{that they had not}} achieved since 1998. The closest of those four victories was a 2120 win over the Stormers in Cape Town. They also defeated the Brumbies 2518 in Canberra, The Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was also introduced that season to be contested between the Highlanders and Blues. Gordon Hunter had coached both teams before dying from cancer in 2001. Highland prop said of the game against the Blues “While I’m sure Gordy was popular in Auckland during his time coaching up there, as he’d seemed to be everywhere he went, the trophy meant a huge amount to us and we were determined to be the first winners to honour his memory”. The match was played at Eden Park, and the Highlanders were ahead 153 at half time, and eventually won 2013. Their last home match of the season was against the Reds at Carisbrook. The Highlanders’ 4026 win meant that they had gone three seasons undefeated at Carisbrook. With their eight victories from the regular season, the Highlanders finished fourth and played the Crusaders in Christchurch in their semi-final. The Crusaders won 3423 although Jeff Wilson did score a try in his last match for the franchise.|$|E

In the original, she is just a monsterish half-breed named Myohyang; discarded by family because of what she was. She {{plays a key role in}} the story as one of the main 'bad guys'. She teams up with Yuri (Ryang's psycho-ex) to plot to take down Fanta and Ryang, though she comments to Yuri at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> she somewhat likes Fanta, but has to do what her 'mastuh' wants done.

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the French had a {{major problem}} with was the concept of sanctuary. As long as the revolutionaries who are {{fighting}} a guerilla war have a sanctuary, {{in which they can}} hide out, recoup after losses, and store supplies, it is almost impossible for any foreign enemy to ever destroy them. In the early 1950s, southern China was used as a sanctuary by Viet Minh guerrillas. Several hit and run ambushes were successfully operated against French Union convoys along the neighboring Route Coloniale 4 (RC 4), which was a major supply way in Tonkin (northern Vietnam). One of the most famous attacks of this kind was the battle of Cao Bằng.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the book}} was {{published}} anonymously, speculation on the authorship naturally began {{as soon as it}} was released. Many people were suspected, including, Charles Darwin ("I ought to be much flattered & unflattered"), the geologist Charles Lyell, the phrenologist George Combe, as well as many of the people whose work the book often cited. Early on, Sir Richard Vyvyan, the Tory leader of the parliamentary opposition to the Reform Bill, was a popular suspect. Vyvyan held interests in natural philosophy, phrenology, and Lamarckian evolution. Only three years earlier he had privately printed his own evolutionary cosmology, a copy of which he sent to the English anatomist Richard Owen. The latter likely explains the discrepancy between Owen's critical letter to William Whewell on the Vestiges and his flattering letter to the author, whom he probably thought to be Vyvyan. It was even suggested at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Prince Albert might have secretly written it. Adam Sedgwick, as well as others, initially thought that the work was likely written by a woman, either Harriet Martineau or the Countess Ada Lovelace. A feminine authorship was thought to explain all of the book's scientific failings.|$|E

500|$|There {{is another}} {{instance}} where an historical source mentions {{a man who}} could refer to either Ragnall or Rǫgnvaldr. The early thirteenth-century Bǫglunga sǫgur indicates at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> men of two Norwegian factions decided to launch a raiding expedition into the Isles. One particular version of the sagas states that Rǫgnvaldr (styled [...] "King of Mann and the Isles") and Guðrøðr (styled [...] "King on Mann") had not paid their taxes due to the Norwegian kings. In consequence, the saga records that the Isles were ravaged until the two travelled to Norway and reconciled themselves with Ingi Bárðarson, King of Norway (died 1217), whereupon the two took their lands from Ingi as a lén or fief.|$|E
500|$|Following word of its debut, {{interest}} in the machine grew across Europe. Kempelen, however, {{was more interested in}} his other projects and avoided exhibiting the Turk, often lying about the machine's repair status to prospective challengers. Von Windisch wrote at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Kempelen [...] "refused the entreaties of his friends, and a crowd of curious persons from all countries, the satisfaction of seeing this far-famed machine". In the decade following its debut at Schönbrunn Palace the Turk only played one opponent, Sir Robert Murray Keith, a Scottish noble, and Kempelen went as far as dismantling the Turk entirely following the match. Kempelen was quoted as referring to the invention as a [...] "mere [...] ", as he was not pleased with its popularity and would rather continue work on steam engines and machines that replicated human speech.|$|E

He was probably referring to John Dennis, licensed victualler of Littleport. He outlined the three capital offences that would be presented, namely burglary, robbery from the person and stealing in a dwelling house. He defined burglary as breaking into a house at night with intent, robbery from the person as extortion by violence or threat thereof, and stealing in a dwelling house as an actual act of stealing, not just the threat. He reminded the jury that when offences are carried out by a mob, it is the whole mob that is guilty, not just the person doing the deed. He closed: The court adjourned until the following day.|$|E

500|$|Both {{newspapers}} {{went into}} gradual decline under their new proprietors. James Gordon Bennett, Jr.—"a swaggering, precociously dissolute lout who rarely stifled an impulse"—had a mercurial reign. He launched the New York Telegram, an evening paper, {{in the late}} 1860s and kept the Herald the most comprehensive source of news among the city's newspapers. [...] Bennett also bankrolled Henry Morton Stanley's trek through Africa to find David Livingstone, and scooped the competition on the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Bennett ruled his paper with a heavy hand, telling his executives at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> he was the [...] "only reader of this paper": [...] "I am {{the only one to}} be pleased. [...] If I want it turned upside down, it must be turned upside down. [...] I want one feature article a day. If I say the feature is black beetles, black beetles it's going to be." [...] In 1874, the Herald ran the infamous New York Zoo hoax, where {{the front page of the}} newspaper was devoted entirely to fabricated story of animals getting loose at the Central Park Zoo.|$|E
500|$|The {{universe}} of Howl's Moving Castle {{is depicted as}} not having clear-cut villains and heroes; instead, the characters are complex, and even those that are initially portrayed in a negative light, such as Howl, are shown as capable of change. Matt Kimmich has stated, however, that the simplistic message {{of the film is}} that [...] "war is bad." [...] A scene where Sophie is standing in a beautiful field of flowers is interrupted by a war machine, [...] "a finger accusing empire as the destroyer of peace." [...] This portrayal is in strong contrast to other Miyazaki films like Princess Mononoke, which criticizes military conflict in a more nuanced manner. Andrew Osmond stated that [...] "Howl's pure-hearted anti-war stance is presented as nihilism with no alternative as he fights forces from each side and becomes the worst terror of all," [...] {{in the form of the}} monstrous bird. By transforming into the bird, Howl risks losing his own humanity; Calcifer comments at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> he will soon not be able to return to human form. In contrast, Ashitaka in Princess Mononoke fights the demonic sickness with which he is afflicted, and tries to negotiate a peace between the two sides. Osmond states that both films also point out the limits of masculinity, as exemplified by Howl and Ashitaka.|$|E
500|$|Every {{couple of}} weeks, Lasseter {{and his team}} would put {{together}} their latest set of storyboards or footage to show Disney. In early screen tests, Pixar impressed Disney with the technical innovation but convincing Disney of the plot was more difficult. At each presentation by Pixar, Katzenberg would tear much of it up, giving out detailed comments and notes. Katzenberg's big push was to add more edginess to the two main characters. Disney wanted the film to appeal to both children and adults, and asked for adult references {{to be added to}} the film. After many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and other Disney executives, the general consensus was that Woody had been stripped of almost all charm. Tom Hanks, while recording the dialogue for the story reels, exclaimed at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the character was a jerk. Lasseter and his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen, so they brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives on November 19, 1993, an event they later dubbed [...] "The Black Friday Incident." [...] The results were disastrous, and Schneider, who was never particularly enamored of Katzenberg's idea of having outsiders make animation for Disney, declared it a mess and ordered that production be stopped immediately. Katzenberg asked colleague Thomas Schumacher why the reels were bad. Schumacher replied bluntly: [...] "Because it's not their movie anymore, it's completely not the movie that John set out to make." ...|$|E

500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going to}} make the ending so surprising you had to believe at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E
