According to Bell, [...] "The way the shows usually work out, Mulder is the one to figure out who the bad guys are. So I went into the story meeting with the idea of having Mulder being wrong. Because Mulder believes so strong it's the <b>other</b> <b>guy,</b> it helped hide the true identity of the bad guy from the audience." ...|$|E

The reason should be obvious. On television, I'm allowed to be myself; in pictures, I was always some <b>other</b> <b>guy.</b> I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo."

[...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E

St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, [...] "I needed {{to get a sense of}} who Todd was first, and that has to happen organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't care what the <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> did.

500|$|Homer sees a {{commercial}} for [...] "The Bout to Knock the <b>Other</b> <b>Guy</b> Out!", a much-anticipated boxing match in which Drederick Tatum will fight for the World Heavyweight Championship. Homer decides to have a party and invites all of his friends {{to come over and}} watch the fight. Lisa tries to boycott the party, so this results in Homer making her stay outside on the lawn. Homer’s conscience eventually bothers him, more in the form of his daughter's distress than a moral objection to stealing cable due to a hallucination that he goes to prison for stealing cable. He finally gives in to Lisa's protests, begrudgingly choosing not to watch the last minutes of the fight, and Marge and Maggie join them as well. Bart refuses to give in, but Homer drags him outside by force. The family sits the fight out and when everyone has left, Homer hesitantly cuts his cable hook-up while ignoring Bart's objection, but he accidentally ends up cutting the power to the whole neighborhood.|$|E

Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not showing you attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|The main talking {{point after}} the race was Hamilton's {{assertion}} {{that he would have}} preferred to go on a different strategy compared to his teammate to have a chance of passing him, an option denied by his team. Hamilton lobbied for his team to allow the drivers to take more risks, while his team principal, Toto Wolff, insisted that the team, not the drivers, were at liberty to make calls about strategy. Opinions on the matter were divided in the following days. [...] world champion Damon Hill shared Hamilton's frustration, saying: [...] "I have some sympathy with what Lewis was saying, the drivers should be allowed to call the shots - and if he wants to try something different and basically zag when the <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> is zigging." [...] Daniel Johnson, writing for The Daily Telegraph, concurred: [...] "It was not just Hamilton's failure to win the Brazilian Grand Prix, following home an obdurate Nico Rosberg; it was the manner of it, lacking the killer move while obeying a Mercedes strategy which rendered the drivers more robots than racers." [...] Meanwhile, the Daily Mails Jonathan McEvoy agreed with Mercedes' call, saying that it was [...] "a no-brainer for Mercedes to keep their drivers comfortably first and second by the safest means".|$|E
500|$|Kenneth {{revealing}} that {{his real name}} is [...] "Dick Whitman" [...] is {{a reference to the}} main character Don Draper of Mad Men (played by Jon Hamm, who had a recurring role on 30 Rock earlier in the season). [...] "Earn this", spoken by Kenneth as Jenna has poisoned him again, references the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan when actor Tom Hanks says the same words to actor Matt Damon's title character. When she is told that Kenneth has gone into a severe allergic shock and needs to have his hands cut off, Jenna apologizes to him for what she has done, telling him [...] "I'm just a girl sitting in front of a boy she poisoned so this <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> would go to town on her", which Jenna misquotes from actress Julia Roberts' character from the romantic comedy Notting Hill (1999). After Kenneth drinks his strawberry water, as he risked his life so that Jenna can meet the paramedic again, Jenna says to Kenneth [...] "You magnificent sonofabitch!", a line quoted by actor George C. Scott in the American biographical war film Patton (1970). Kenneth blows white smoke out while referencing bringing back something from [...] "the other side" [...] (death) echoes the same look when actor Haley Joel Osment remarked [...] "I see dead people" [...] in the movie The Sixth Sense (1999).|$|E

500|$|Ron Swanson {{was created}} by Parks and Recreation creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, {{although}} Nick Offerman himself had some input into the character's creation. Offerman said in July 2012 that [...] "NBC really resisted giving me this part. It took five months for me from the time Mike Schur and Greg Daniels said {{they wanted me to}} play this part. NBC insisted on auditioning every <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> in the country, and then they finally acquiesced." [...] The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur encountered in Burbank while researching for the show, who favored as little government interference as possible and admitted, [...] "I don't really believe in the mission of my job [...] [...] [...] I'm aware of the irony." [...] Ron is also partially inspired by political appointees of President George W. Bush who were perceived to be opposed to the branch of government they were overseeing. Ron's signature mustache {{was one of the first}} ideas conceived for the character. Offerman said the deadpan style of humor he uses for Ron Swanson was cultivated during his youth, when he was an altar boy: [...] "I would read things with the utmost sincerity, and my cousin would be cracking up because he knew I was full of shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain {{joined a}} squad which {{featured}} Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor and Hall-of-Fame guard Jerry West, along with backup center Mel Counts, forwards Keith Erickson and Tom Hawkins and talented 5'11" [...] guard Johnny Egan. The {{lack of a}} second guard next to West (and thus, the lack of speed and quickness) concerned coach Butch Van Breda Kolff; after losing Clark and Gail Goodrich, who joined the Phoenix Suns after the 1968 expansion draft, he said: [...] "Egan gets murdered on defense because of his [...] size...but if I don't play him, we look {{like a bunch of}} trucks." [...] In addition, Cherry observed that Chamberlain was neither a natural leader nor a loyal follower, which made him difficult to fit in. While he was on cordial terms with Jerry West, he often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor; regarding Baylor, he later explained: [...] "We were good friends, but... black culture... you never let the <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> one-up you." [...] The greatest problem was his tense relationship with Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff: pejoratively calling the new recruit [...] "The Load", he later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics. In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as [...] "the dumbest and worst coach ever". Laker Keith Erickson observed that [...] "Butch catered to Elgin and Jerry...and that is not {{a good way to get}} on Wilt's side...that relationship was doomed from the start." ...|$|E

[...] In 2010, Game Informer included her among the palette swap characters not wanted by {{them in the future}} Mortal Kombat games, later describing her in the 2011 game as being [...] "as creepy as ever." [...] When American radio host Howard Stern mocked a Mortal Kombat fan who admitted that he masturbates to Mileena, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer called the latter [...] "insane" [...] as [...] "onanism and Mileena should not mix." [...] Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe wrote that [...] "as for the date theme , frankly we can’t really see the appeal – she’s not a patch on Sheeva, after all." [...] GameDaily praised the [...] "superb fashion sense" [...] of Soulcaliburs Taki by contrasting her with Mileena. Writing about [...] "outdated and cringe-worthy representations of women in video games" [...] in 2012, MMGN's Nathan Misa stated: [...] "Look, I like Lara Croft's booty shorts or Mileena's two...deadly sais as much as every <b>other</b> <b>guy,</b> but why not have more than virtual polygons to ogle at?" [...] Discussing what she perceived as video games' popular misconceptions about women, Sarah Ditum wrote in PlayStation Official Magazine that same year: [...] "Relax—we don’t really bite.

500|$|Moon {{displayed}} what {{he described}} as a humble and self-deprecating manner during the World Series of Poker, repeatedly acknowledging his lack of poker experience throughout the tournament, and often attributing his success to luck and a high number of strong cards, rather than talent. Moon adopted a phrase, [...] "If I win, I win. If I lose, I lose," [...] which reflected his casual approach to the game. Moon also said one of his philosophies was, [...] "Make the <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> pay to see the cards", a strategy attributed to many re-raises Moon made during the 2009 World Series of Poker despite weak hands. Moon had almost no experience in heads-up poker, which some commentators said factored into his loss against Cada in the final hours of the 2009 World Series. Many fans and commentators praised his working stiff style, with some dubbing him [...] "Darvin Gump", a reference to the underdog protagonist of the 1994 drama film, Forrest Gump. Moon has also been nicknamed the [...] "Luddite Logger" [...] because of his distaste for anything technological, including credit cards and online poker. Moon refused to sign a sponsorship deal with an Internet poker company during the 2009 tournament because {{he said he did not}} want to answer to anybody. Moon wore a New Orleans Saints hat throughout the tournament because, [...] "I like cheering for the underdog." [...] Moon was invited to guest at the Saints games for their entire playoff run in 2010, and watched them win Super Bowl XLIV against the Indianapolis Colts in Miami.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything else. We even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one <b>other</b> <b>guy,</b> and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, [...] "Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool." [...] Fortunately, it went my way." ...|$|E
