Computer and Video Games (CVG) published both text and video based walkthroughs <b>of</b> <b>video</b> games on their website and official YouTube channel until their closure by Future in February of 2015 in asset consolidation between various Future brands.

50|$|A content {{analysis}} done <b>of</b> children's <b>videos</b> and books found that 72% <b>of</b> <b>videos</b> and 7.5% <b>of</b> books placed emphasis on physical attractiveness.

Examples include Cinderella, where the prince invites maidens {{to the ball}} to select a bride and Beauty and the Beast, where the Beast {{falls in love with}} Belle purely based upon her physical appearance. In 72% <b>of</b> <b>videos</b> and 10% <b>of</b> books characters with thin bodies have desirable traits. In 84% <b>of</b> <b>videos</b> and 10% <b>of</b> books female physical attractiveness is associated with kindness, sociability, and happiness. While 60% <b>of</b> <b>videos</b> portray female thinness, only 32% show male muscularity.

40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} problem <b>of</b> {{specific}} <b>video</b> event retrieval. Given a query <b>video</b> <b>of</b> a specific event, e. g., a concert of Madonna, {{the goal is to}} retrieve other <b>videos</b> <b>of</b> the same event that temporally overlap with the query. Our approach encodes the frame descriptors <b>of</b> a <b>video</b> to jointly represent their appearance and temporal order. It exploits the properties of circulant matrices to efficiently compare the videos in the frequency domain. This offers a significant gain in complexity and accurately localizes the matching parts <b>of</b> <b>videos.</b> The descriptors can be compressed in the frequency domain with a product quantizer adapted to complex numbers. In this case, video retrieval is performed without decompressing the descriptors. We also consider the temporal alignment of a set <b>of</b> <b>videos.</b> We exploit the matching confidence and an estimate of the temporal offset computed for all pairs <b>of</b> <b>videos</b> by our retrieval approach. Our robust algorithm aligns the videos on a global timeline by maximizing the set of temporally consistent matches. The global temporal alignment enables synchronous playback <b>of</b> the <b>videos</b> <b>of</b> a given scene...|$|R
