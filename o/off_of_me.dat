500|$|After his wife's death, PedroI {{realized}} how miserably he had treated her, and {{his relationship with}} Domitila began to crumble. Maria Leopoldina, unlike his mistress, was popular, honest and loved him without expecting anything in return. The Emperor greatly missed her, and even his obsession with Domitila failed to overcome his sense of loss and regret. One day Domitila found him weeping {{on the floor and}} embracing a portrait of his deceased wife, whose sad-looking ghost PedroI claimed to have seen. Later on, the Emperor left the bed he shared with Domitila and shouted: [...] "Get <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>me!</b> I know I live an unworthy life of a sovereign. The thought of the Empress does not leave me." [...] He did not forget his children, orphaned of their mother, and was observed {{on more than one occasion}} holding his son, the young Pedro, in his arms and saying: [...] "Poor boy, you are the most unhappy prince in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2017, Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka Addams {{alleged that}} she was sexually {{assaulted}} by the band's bassist Twiggy Ramirez in their shared apartment while the pair were a couple in the mid-90s. She wrote on Facebook: [...] "He forced me on {{to the floor with}} his hand around my neck. I said NO. I said it so loud enough, that my friend Pete came rushing in from the other room to get him <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> But I had been raped. I had been raped by somebody I thought I loved." [...] Manson responded: [...] "I knew Jessicka and Twiggy had a romantic relationship many years ago and I considered and still consider Jessicka to be a friend. I knew nothing about these allegations until very recently and am saddened by Jessicka's obvious distress." [...] Soon after, Manson announced on Twitter that Twiggy had been fired from the band. Several days later, Twiggy said in a statement: [...] "I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain, I apologize and truly regret it." ...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} over a century since the {{maternal}} side of my family has resided in the natal land of our cultural heritage and religious proclivities ‚Äì Punjab, India, where Sikhism was established. As an American I continue this extension of our roots from their source. Through the process of shifting location, cultural confluence, and passing time {{the experiences of the}} women in each successive generation of my family have altered significantly through our diasporic existence. However, even in the aftermath of colonization and immigration, the enduring responsibility of women is reliant upon their relation to family. This ideology is imbued through the words of the Sikh holy text, the Guru Granth Sahib, as well as broader Indian cultural norms regarding gender roles. Implicit in the religious tradition of locating family in female members lies the practice of making women emblematic of cultural survival. Thus, within their role of sustaining physical life women also sustain culture. This becomes increasingly important when culture is extracted from its source. Despite dispersion across the world, the women in my family have continued to fulfill the responsibility of the safekeeping of culture and traditions. My series of three portraits, Daughter, Wife, Mother, illustrates the primary familial ties that determine an Indian woman‚Äôs identity throughout her life, and evokes the duty of cultural preservation that is associated with each of them. These oil paintings are based <b>off</b> <b>of</b> photos <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> my mother, and my grandmother from our family archive. Daughter, Wife, Mother lacks any indications of time period or specific location, thus asserting that this gendered life journey has persisted throughout my family‚Äôs diaspora...|$|R

60|$|Miss Watson {{she kept}} pecking at me, {{and it got}} {{tiresome}} and lonesome. By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went {{up to my room}} with a piece of candle, {{and put it on the}} table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes <b>off</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider.|$|E
