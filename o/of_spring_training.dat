After four weeks, Koufax gave Drysdale the go-ahead to negotiate new deals for both of them. Koufax ended up getting $125,000 and Drysdale $110,000 ($ today). They rejoined the team in the last week <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants in 2004, Sánchez quickly {{worked his way through}} the Giants' minor league system. In 2006, he was called up to the major leagues and was used mostly in a long relief role. In 2007, he made the team out <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> and was again used mostly in long relief, though he spent part of his season in the minors.

5|$|Alston's Dodgers {{teams of}} the 1960s {{benefited from the}} strong {{pitching}} by Drysdale and Koufax. In 1966, both players held out <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> and demanded three-year contracts each worth $500,000, which was more money than anyone was making in baseball at the time. The players were eventually signed for lesser amounts. Drysdale struggled that year, but Koufax won 27 games. The Dodgers went to the 1966 World Series but were defeated in four games. Koufax retired after the season {{on the advice of}} doctors who examined his sore arm. Drysdale retired three years later. Both men had pitched their entire major league careers for Alston.|$|E

5|$|Before Mota {{ever played}} for the Red Sox, however, he was traded again to the Cleveland Indians. He {{struggled}} in his time with the Indians in 2006 and was designated for assignment by them in August. The New York Mets acquired him, and Mota improved mightily upon joining them. Following the season, he became a free agent, but he again signed with the Mets. After struggling in 2007, he {{was traded to the}} Milwaukee Brewers. He got off to a poor start with Milwaukee in 2008 but improved in the second half. Following the season, Mota became a free agent and signed with the Dodgers again. He had his best year since 2004 and became a free agent again after the season. For {{the first time in his}} career, in 2010 he signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. After making the team out <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training,</b> Mota won his first career World Series despite struggling at times during the season. Following the season, he signed another minor league contract with the Giants and made the team out <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> again. During the 2012 season, Mota became one of three players in league history to fail a drug test twice when it was shown he tested positive for Clenbuterol, a performance-enhancing drug.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2004 season began, the Houston Astros signed Andy Pettitte {{to boost}} their {{starting}} rotation. As a result, Robertson found himself battling with Tim Redding, Jared Fernandez, Carlos Hernández and Brandon Duckworth for the final spot in the rotation. After Roger Clemens was signed as well, the Astros decided before spring training began that Robertson would pitch out of the bullpen for the season. By the end <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training,</b> Robertson failed to crack the bullpen, and was to be demoted to the Zephyrs. On March 31, just before the season started, the Astros traded Robertson to the Cleveland Indians for Luke Scott and Willy Taveras.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2007 season, Sánchez {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} best {{prospect}} in the Giants' organization (behind only Tim Lincecum) by Baseball America. Sánchez made the Giants' roster out <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b> He struggled in his first fourteen games, however, and was sent down to Fresno on May 21 when Russ Ortiz came off the disabled list. Sánchez returned to the majors on June 6 when, coincidentally, Ortiz got hurt again. On June 13, {{he picked up his}} first major league hit (an RBI double) in a 7–4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 4, he was placed on the disabled list with a strained rib cage, but he was reactivated on July 18.|$|E

5|$|On December 4, 2014, Ishikawa and the Giants {{agreed to}} a one-year, $1.1 million {{contract}} for 2015. He started the 2015 season {{on the disabled list}} due to a back injury suffered near the end <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b> At the conclusion of his rehab assignment, he was designated for assignment by the Giants and removed from the 40-man roster. Ishikawa subsequently cleared waivers and was sent to the Sacramento River Cats. On June 24, 2015, Ishikawa was called back up to the Giants {{to take the place of}} the injured Nori Aoki. He was designated for assignment again on July 3.|$|E
5|$|After being demoted back to Buffalo, the Indians traded Robertson on August 3 to the Montreal Expos for Pierre-Luc Marceau. He {{pitched in}} seven {{games for the}} Edmonton Trappers to end the season, {{finishing}} with a 1–3 record and a 5.73 ERA. He was on the Expos' 40-man roster for September, but did not play a game for them, and in October he {{was removed from the}} roster. In November, the Cincinnati Reds signed him to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. During spring training in 2005, Robertson competed with Aaron Harang, Brandon Claussen, Luke Hudson, and Josh Hancock for two spots in the Reds' rotation. At the end <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training,</b> he was assigned to the Reds' minor league squad, the Louisville Bats. Robertson spent the season there, pitching in 28 games, 18 of them starts, and ended the year with a 5–11 record and a 5.46 ERA. After the season ended, Robertson was released, becoming a free agent.|$|E
5|$|Groth {{was looking}} {{to stay in the}} major league in 1948. He spent spring {{training}} on the Indians' roster, and originally made a great impression on the team. However, he was one of seven Indians stricken with dysentery in early April, causing him to miss some time. By the end <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training,</b> Groth was optioned to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, the Indians' AAA-class minor league affiliate. He spent the season with the Orioles, and his pitching performances included a 13–0 victory over the Newark Bears, as well as a 1–0 victory where Groth limited the Bears to three hits. Groth finished the season with Baltimore having amassed 29 pitching appearances, 27 of them starts, a 12–12 record and a 4.48 ERA, while also pitching in two games for the Dallas Eagles. After Baltimore's season ended, he was promoted to the Indians' roster, and pitched in one game for the Indians that season.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Uribe {{signed with}} the Giants and was again used as utility player. He spent most of 2010 as the Giants' shortstop, hit a career-high 24 home runs, and had several key hits in the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Following that season, he signed a three-year {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The next two years were plagued by injuries and poor hitting, but he regained his starting role at third base and made strong contributions to the team in 2013 and 2014. Uribe {{was traded to the}} Braves in late May of the 2015 season and again to the Mets in July of the 2015 season. Before the start <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> in 2016, he signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians.

5|$|Ishikawa {{grew up in}} Washington State. He {{was drafted}} in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft by the San Francisco Giants out of high school. He made his Major League debut with the Giants in 2006, {{but it was not}} until 2009 that he made it to the major leagues full-time. He started 2009 as the Giants' first baseman but failed to produce offensively and was {{replaced}} part of the season by Ryan Garko. However, on defense he was third in the National League (NL) in fielding percentage. In 2010, he served as a pinch-hitter and defensive replacement for the Giants and won a World Series ring as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Ishikawa was designated for assignment at the end <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> in 2011 and spent the entire season in the minor leagues.|$|E
5|$|Sandoval {{made the}} Giants' Opening Day roster out <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> in 2009 as the Giants' {{starting}} third baseman and backup catcher. He {{served as a}} personal catcher for Zito {{at the beginning of}} the year. On May 12, Sandoval hit his first walk-off home run against Joe Beimel to beat the Washington Nationals 97. Following an elbow injury to Sandoval in May, the Giants called up Eli Whiteside to serve as the backup catcher on May 24; since then, Sandoval has not been used at all as a catcher. After 73 games played, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler wrote that Sandoval had made the most impressive transition from the Giants farm system since 1986 when Will Clark and Robby Thompson were rookies.|$|E

5|$|Sánchez was {{arbitration}} {{eligible to}} begin 2010, but he avoided arbitration by signing {{a one-year contract}} with the Giants. He was named the fourth starter out <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> this time. Sánchez began started strong in 2010, as he was 7–6 by the All-Star break. Because of injuries to the Giants' left-handed relief pitchers, Sánchez made his only relief appearance of the year on July 30 in a 6–5 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. On August 3, Sánchez tied Juan Marichal's record when he struck out seven straight batters in a 10–0 win over the Colorado Rockies. Two months later, {{on the last day}} of the season, Sánchez started against the San Diego Padres. Sánchez pitched five shutout innings, scored the first run after hitting a triple in the third inning, and was the winning pitcher in a 3–0 win. The win sent the Giants to the playoffs for the first time since 2003.|$|E
5|$|As the 2003 season began, Robertson was {{competing}} alongside Brad Lidge, Kirk Saarloos, and Pete Munro for {{the final}} spot in the Astros' starting rotation. He pitched the entire month <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training,</b> and when the season began he was granted the final spot in the rotation. Robertson made his season debut on April 3, and allowed eight earned runs in 4⅓ innings, losing the match against the Colorado Rockies 10–5. He got his first career victory on April 10, allowing two hits in seven innings in a 4–2 victory against the Cincinnati Reds. He struggled in his next three starts, {{and by the end}} of April Robertson had a 1–3 record and an ERA of 7.99, which caused manager Jimy Williams to consider moving him back to the bullpen. After a May 2 matchup against the Atlanta Braves further increased his ERA, Robertson was demoted to the minor leagues, but only played with the Zephyrs for one game before being placed back on the major league roster ten days later.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Mota {{made the}} Expos out <b>of</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> {{for the first}} time in his career. On May 12, he had a 1.59 ERA through his first 20 games of the year. However, eight earned runs allowed over his next six games raised his ERA to 4.00. Afterwards, though, he had a 2.08 ERA over his next 12 games. On June 17, he was the winning pitcher when he threw a {{scoreless}} inning in a 4–1 victory over Toronto. In his next game, on June 19, he was the losing pitcher when he gave up three runs (only one run was earned) without recording an out in a 4–1 loss to the New York Mets. However, after that 12-game stretch, he gave up five earned runs over his next four games to bring his ERA up to 4.29. On July 13, he was placed on the disabled list {{for the first time}} in his career with right shoulder tendinitis. Mota returned at the beginning of September, but he had a 10.57 ERA and two losses in his final 11 games of the year. He finished the season with a 1–3 record and a 5.26 ERA in 53 games.|$|E
