Pressing flashing buttons, multiple large screens stand in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> and correspond to her choice of button selected. The first images shown on the screens feature Aguilera as Catwoman, a futuristic blue haired character, and a 1960s influenced hippie before focusing on the 60's inspired character. The blond character is shown to be holding an old fashioned handheld video camera filming scenes of high rise buildings, all the while showing shots of Aguilera editing the on screen projection. The blond hippie inspired character is then seen in a second setting, riding a bicycle through a grassy field at times performing dance movements to the song and lip-synching.|$|E

The results obtained are summarized as : 1) The children felt <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desks</b> at plus two level in Japanese Industrial Standard just good. This state means the difference between <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>desks</b> and seat surfaces is six centimeters higher than a proper size.

This state means the difference between <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>desks</b> and seat surfaces is three centimeters lower than a proper size. 2) <b>The</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desks</b> at plus two level in JIS and height <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> same second size were good evaluations from the consciousness investigation, such as like and dislike, pleasantness and unpleasantness, tired feeling, and easiness of group activity.

2500|$|The second {{modification}} {{was done}} to raise the desk by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. [...] The first time a base was made for the Resolute Desk was during the John F.

Kennedy Jr. playing under the Resolute Desk. In January 1977, President Carter requested the desk {{be sent back to}} the White House from the Smithsonian Institution. [...] Photos from Januaryâ€“February 1977 show the Resolute Desk being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show the desk being used without a base. President Reagan requested that the desk be raised higher since he was hitting his legs {{on the top of the}} knee hole.

2500|$|Issues arose after Santorum was {{defeated}} for re-election to the Senate in 2006, and Senator Craig Thomas began his {{tenure at the}} candy desk. Wyoming, the state he was representing, has no members of the National Confectioners Association, and therefore no candymakers large enough to donate hundreds of dollars of candy to fill the desk. Senate ethics rules [...] "forbid members accepting gifts worth $100 or more a year from a single source," [...] which can become a problem if {{a large amount of}} candy is consumed from the desk each year. An exception to this rule allows larger gifts of objects created or produced in the state the senator is from, as long as the items are primarily not used by the senator and his staff. This is so senators can [...] "offer visitors home-grown snacks, such as Florida orange juice or Georgia peanuts." [...] When asked about Thomas being in charge of the candy desk, Susan Smith, a representative from the National Confectioners Association, stated, [...] "We're happy to provide candy if there are [...] members...It would be difficult for us to do now." [...] These issues were worked around by asking many small, local, Wyoming confectionery businesses and chocolatiers to give small amounts of candy that were rotated in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E
