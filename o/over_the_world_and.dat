5|$|Il ritorno is {{the first}} of three {{full-length}} works which Monteverdi wrote for the burgeoning Venetian opera industry during the last five years of his life. After its initial successful run in Venice the opera was performed in Bologna before returning to Venice for the 1640–41 season. Thereafter, except for a possible performance at the Imperial court in Vienna late in the 17th century, there were no further revivals until the 20th century. The music became known in modern times through the 19th-century discovery of an incomplete manuscript score which in many respects is inconsistent with the surviving versions of the libretto. After its publication in 1922 the score's authenticity was widely questioned, and performances of the opera remained rare during the next 30years. By the 1950s the work was generally accepted as Monteverdi's, and after revivals in Vienna and Glyndebourne in the early 1970s it became increasingly popular. It has since been performed in opera houses all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> has been recorded many times.|$|E

Wenger had creditable experience in UEFA club competitions; at Monaco he reached {{the final of the}} Cup Winners' Cup in 1992, losing 2–0 to Werder Bremen and took the club into the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1993–94. Wenger wanted Arsenal {{to become one of the}} biggest clubs in Europe, emphasising on buying talent from all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> patience shown by the club's board and supporters. His first involvement in a European match for Arsenal was against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 26 September 1996 in the UEFA Cup; Arsenal lost 6–4 on aggregate. Having watched the game from the stands in the first half, he assumed control in the second, suggesting the formation should accommodate four defenders instead of five.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, {{following}} years of rising tension, the French Republic that {{had emerged from}} the French Revolution declared war on the Kingdom of Great Britain. For the Royal Navy {{one of the most}} immediate concerns was to contain the French Atlantic Fleet based in the massively fortified harbour at Brest in Brittany. This port was ideally positioned to disrupt the merchant shipping convoys that passed through the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay en route to Britain from all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> it was therefore imperative that the French fleet was not permitted to put to sea without being challenged. For the French, Brest was a vital port for the receipt of grain supplies from the Americas and so French fleets regularly sailed on missions to escort these convoys into the harbour and to disrupt British convoys entering the English Channel.|$|E

5|$|Mahler {{had been}} {{convinced}} {{from the start}} of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W. Adorno, Robert Simpson and Jonathan Carr found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler's other symphonies. Conversely, it has also been compared—by Deryck Cooke—to Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No.9 as a defining human statement for its century.|$|E

The money was given out as loans to Israeli businesspeople in the United States, who were later extorted to give up their businesses if they did not pay up. Meir Abergil, described as the person in charge of finances, collected the money that was exacted and later laundered and invested it. Gabi Ben Harosh of the “Jerusalem Gang” who was arrested in Los Angeles in 2004, ran the lending bank in the United States and updated Meir and Itzhak Abergil on its balance. Sasson Barashi of Jerusalem and Hai Vaknin of Los Angeles identified borrowers and businesses and also saw to the collection of the money.
