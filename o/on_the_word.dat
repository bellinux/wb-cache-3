5|$|In {{line with}} the hadith's {{prohibition}} against creating images of sentient living beings, which is particularly strictly observed with respect to God and Muhammad, Islamic religious art is focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word.</b> Muslims generally avoid depictions of Muhammad, and mosques are decorated with calligraphy and Quranic inscriptions or geometrical designs, not images or sculptures. Today, the interdiction against images of Muhammad– designed to prevent worship of Muhammad, rather than God– is much more strictly observed in Sunni Islam (85%–90% of Muslims) and Ahmadiyya Islam (1%) than among Shias (10%–15%). While both Sunnis and Shias have created images of Muhammad in the past, Islamic depictions of Muhammad are rare. They have, until recently, mostly been limited to the private and elite medium of the miniature, and since about 1500 most depictions show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation that rejected Papal authority and {{many aspects of}} Catholic theology and practice. It created a predominately Calvinist national church, known as the kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook, severely reducing the powers of bishops, although not initially abolishing them. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy and would be important in establishing and funding schools. There was also a shift from emphasis on ritual to one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> making the Bible, {{and the ability to}} read the Bible, fundamental to Scottish religion.|$|E
5|$|Percy {{lost control}} of his men, and British {{soldiers}} began to commit atrocities to repay for the supposed scalping at the North Bridge and for their own casualties {{at the hands of}} a distant, often unseen enemy. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of Pitcairn and other wounded officers from Smith's command, Percy had learned that the Minutemen were using stone walls, trees and buildings in these more thickly settled towns closer to Boston to hide behind and shoot at the column. He ordered the flank companies to clear the colonial militiamen out of such places.|$|E

25|$|The hyphens {{and lack}} of {{projection}} lines indicate prosodic dependencies. A hyphen that appears on {{the left of the}} clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> immediately to its left (He'll, There's), whereas a hyphen that appears {{on the right side of}} the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> that appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (He'll, There's) or on its head (would've). At other times, it can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (Florida's).|$|E

25|$|The Court of Appeal {{noted that}} the word shall is a {{mandatory}} verb, and {{that the key to}} the questions lay with that word rather than the word election in Article 49(1). The Court held that the High Court's textual emphasis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> election had actually substantially modified the meaning of Article 49. This would lead to the less definitive construction that a vacancy may be filled and, if so, it shall be filled by election.|$|E

25|$|A Phanariote, Hangerli claimed {{heritage}} {{from the}} Byzantine {{family of the}} Palaiologos. He was married to Doamna Roxana, who survived his death. According to one account, the surname Hangerli (Hanjeri) {{had been assigned to}} one of his ancestors by Sultan Mehmed IV, after allegedly saving his life by curing him of a potentially fatal illness. The name was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> handjer, which was indicative of closeness to the Sultan's person. The Hangerlis were related to other high-ranking Greek families, including the Ypsilantis and the Mourousis.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the name of Byzantion, more {{commonly}} known by the later Latin Byzantium, are not entirely clear, though some suggest it is of Thraco-Illyrian origin. The founding myth of the city has it told that the settlement was named after the leader of the Megarian colonists, Byzas. The later Byzantines of Constantinople themselves would maintain that the city was named in honour of two men, Byzas and Antes, though this was more likely just a play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Byzantion.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} about the possible developments {{in the arena of}} the Web as a corpus. The development of using the web as a data source for word sense disambiguation was brought forward in The EU MEANING project in 2002. It used the assumption that within a domain, words often have a single meaning, and that domains are identifiable on the Web. This was further explored by using Web technology to gather manual word sense annotations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> Expert Web site.|$|E

25|$|Within context, {{some of the}} {{banknotes}} have figurative meanings {{with the}} 100-krone note {{sometimes referred to as}} a hund (dog) shortening the word hundrede (a hundred). The 500-krone note can be referred to as a plovmand (ploughman) because previous circulations of the note featured a picture of a man with a plough and the 1000-krone note, too, can be referred to as a tudse (toad) taken from a wordplay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> tusinde meaning a thousand. The 1000-krone note may also be referred to as an egern (squirrel) because of previous circulations of the note featuring a squirrel.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Guazzini {{initiated}} a calendar called Dieux du Stade, i.e. The Gods of Stade (Français), a play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> stade which also means stadium. In French, The Gods of the Stadium {{is a metaphor}} for athletes in general, especially those who perform in athletics. It includes black-and-white pictures of the team's players, naked, adopting postures of athletes of the classical Greco-Roman athletes and hiding their private parts. A new one has been made every year since, with guest stars on several occasions, such as Frédéric Michalak and Olivier Magne in 2003. Profits partly go to charities. A DVD covering the making of the calendar has been released each year since the 2004 edition. All have been extremely successful with women and the gay community.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{experimental}} methods used to conduct cued recall, the study-test method and the anticipation method. In the study-test method participants study a list of word pairs presented individually. Immediately after or after a time delay, participants are tested in the study phase of the experiment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> pairs just previously studied. One word of each pair is presented in a random order and the participant is asked to recall the item with which it was originally paired. The participant can be tested for either forward recall, Ai {{is presented as a}} cue for Bi, or backward recall, Bi is presented as a cue for Ai. In the anticipation method, participants are shown Ai and are asked to anticipate the word paired with it, Bi. If the participant cannot recall the word, the answer is revealed. During an experiment using the anticipation method, the list of words is repeated until a certain percentage of Bi words are recalled.|$|E
