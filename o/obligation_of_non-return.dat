40|$|This paper {{studies the}} loss of human capital that {{emigration}} generates {{in the country of}} origin. To that end I estimate the human capital distribution of emigrants had they not migrated. Unlike previous studies, I take into account the selection of migrants in terms of unobserved characteristics that affect their productivity. Wages in Mexico of those migrants who come back home after being abroad for some time will be crucial to learn something about the selection <b>of</b> <b>non-returning</b> migrants in terms of unobserved productivity. To test whether returning migrants' wages contain any useful information, I follow two steps. First, I use the model of Borjas and Bratsberg (1986) to show that, regardless of the cause for coming back, the distribution <b>of</b> abilities <b>of</b> <b>non-returning</b> migrants is more similar to the distribution of temporary migrants than to that of non-migrants. Moreover, I test some implications of the model in the data. Second, I show that returning migrants' wages reflect their pre-emigration productivity and are not affected by possible human capital gains derived from the decision to emigrate. Taking into account all this evidence, I use returning migrants' wages in Mexico upon return to estimate the distribution of human capital <b>of</b> <b>non-returning</b> migrants had they not migrated. I show that emigrants come form the middle part of the distribution of human capital in the origin country. I find evidence that taking unobserved human capital factors into account is relevant for the dispersion of the estimated distribution as well as for each of its quantiles. Moreover, it does not greatly affect the aggregate mean of human capital. emigration, human capital, productivity...|$|R

The study uses a descriptive framework to establish the validity of several proposed models <b>of</b> <b>non-return.</b> The results are based on an internet survey of Turkish professionals abroad. Correspondence analysis is {{used to examine the}} relationship between return intentions and various factors that may affect this intention. The results emphasize the importance <b>of</b> student <b>non-return</b> versus traditional brain and appear to complement the various theories <b>of</b> student <b>non-return.</b> The respondents appear to come from relatively well-to-do families with highly educated parents. Many have earned their degrees from universities that have foreign language instruction. The recent economic crises in Turkey have negatively affected return intentions. We verify that return intentions are indeed linked closely with initial return plans, and that this relationship weakens with stay duration. Specialized study and work experience in the host country also all appear to contribute to explaining the incidence <b>of</b> <b>non-return.</b> Return intentions are weaker for those working in an academic environment. These results lead to important policy implications, some of which include the training of individuals for academic positions at domestic institutions, supporting study abroad for shorter periods and improving academic facilities in Turkey 9 ̆ 2 s newly established universities. The government may support public and private R&D centers to increase the employability of returnees, but also to improve the quality of the higher education system in order to both reduce the need for education abroad and to increase the attractiveness of universities as prospective employment places for those acquiring education and experience abroad...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to present}} {{research}} {{findings on the}} return intentions of Turkish professionals residing abroad, where the targeted group comprises individuals working at a full-time job abroad who possess at least a tertiary level degree. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses a descriptive framework to establish the validity of several proposed models <b>of</b> <b>non-return.</b> The results are based on an internet survey of Turkish professionals conducted by the authors {{during the first half}} of 2002. A combination of internet search and referral sampling methods is used to collect the data. Correspondence analysis is used to examine the relationship between return intentions and various factors that may affect this intention. Findings – The results emphasize the importance <b>of</b> student <b>non-return</b> versus traditional brain and appear to complement the various theories <b>of</b> student <b>non-return.</b> Many Turkish professionals working abroad are non-returning post-graduate students rather than holders of higher degrees obtained in Turkey who subsequently moved. The respondents appear to come from relatively well-to-do families with highly educated parents. Many have earned their degrees from universities that have foreign language instruction. The recent economic crises in Turkey have negatively affected return intentions. It is verified that return intentions are indeed linked closely with initial return plans, and that this relationship weakens with stay duration. Specialized study and work experience in the host country also all appear to contribute to explaining the incidence <b>of</b> <b>non-return.</b> Return intentions are weaker for those working in an academic environment. Originality/value – The study is the first of its kind for Turkey and other developing countries in terms of the number of responses received and the kind of information collected. Implications are valuable for Turkish and other developing country planners. Expatriates, Higher education, Immigration, Skilled workers, Turkey...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain. Following on from these remarks I will adumbrate an alternative account of the relation which grounds (enforceable) <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice...|$|R
40|$|Notions of {{cosmopolitan}} {{and environmental}} citizenship {{have emerged in}} response to concerns about environmental sustainability and global inequality. But {{even if there are}} <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global or environmental citizenship. Through identifying a core concept of citizenship, I suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice, even when they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice which it identifies as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> ecological citizenship, and that other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objectio...|$|R
