The UNLV portion of this project will be a three-year, three-phase project employing a principal investigator (as well as the UNLV TRP RACE Project Director), a graduate student, and an undergraduate student to support computational and experimental research at the ISU and the Texas universities, to integrate the UNLV Transmutation Research Project with this accelerator driven transmutation research, and to further develop UNLV’s computational infrastructure for reactor physics research. During this quarter we concentrated on coordinating an expansion of RACE into an international project, focusing on high-power experiments using Texas TRIGA reactors with thermal feedback, which will impact the level of subcriticality, start-up and shut-down ADS reactor operations, and measurements of subcriticality. This {{will prove to be}} an extremely challenging expansion of the RACE Project...|$|R

M. E. undergraduate students Ryan LeCounte, Brice Howard, and Timothy Beller continued a two-semester senior design project to design, construct, and test a new high-power, uranium containing water-cooled target for Texas RACE. They have dubbed the target the Cooled Electron Target [...] Optimized for Neutron Production, or CETON. During the second semester, after analyzing and constructing a prototype of a compact version of CETON, they determined that a design change was needed. The new design includes a tungsten electron-photon converter, an aluminum cooling shroud, and a cavity for inserting an aluminum-clad natural uranium photon-neutron converter. They sized the cavity for natural uranium rods being transferred from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to Idaho State University. They also acquired and installed the FLUENT® CFD code, then used it to begin analysis of cooling of the high-power target. The students then completed the final design of the high-power target and initiated purchasing and fabrication of components...|$|R
