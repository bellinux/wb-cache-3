40|$|The {{evolution}} <b>of</b> the <b>magnetic</b> helicity tensor for a nonzero mean {{magnetic field}} and for large magnetic Reynolds numbers in an anisotropic turbulence is studied. It is {{shown that the}} isotropic and anisotropic parts <b>of</b> the <b>magnetic</b> helicity tensor have different characteristic times of evolution. The time of variation of the isotropic part <b>of</b> the <b>magnetic</b> helicity tensor is {{much larger than the}} correlation time of the turbulent velocity field.

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} <b>of</b> advanced <b>magnetic</b> {{materials such}} as magnetic sen-sors, recording heads, and magneto-mechanic devices requires a precise understand-ing <b>of</b> the <b>magnetic</b> behavior. As the size <b>of</b> the <b>magnetic</b> components approach the nanometer regime, detailed predictions <b>of</b> the <b>magnetic</b> properties becomes possible using micromagnetic simulations. Micromagnetics combines Maxwell’s equations for the magnetic field with an equation of motion describing the time evolution of the magnetization. The local arrangement <b>of</b> the <b>magnetic</b> moments follows from the complex interaction between intrinsic magnetic properties such as the magnetocrys-talline anisotropy and the physical/chemical microstructure of the material. This paper reviews the basic numerical methods used in finite element micromagnetic simulations and presents numerical examples in the field <b>of</b> soft <b>magnetic</b> sensor elements, polycrystalline thin film elements, and magnetic nanowires. ...|$|R
