"I {{am not in}} a {{position}} to corroborate Mr Lyons' account of being corrected, prompted and advised by Garda officers and his description of learning from them about the details of the admissions they were seeking. However Mr Lyons' account to me in <b>our</b> <b>interview</b> supported and was consistent with the earlier impressions I had gained from reading the case papers. In my earlier report I noted that the materials then available to me raised questions about whether the details of Mr Lyons' final admissions could have derived from the content of questions put to him during the day, rather than his knowledge and memory, and about whether he was unusually suggestible. Following my interview with Dean Lyons and his parents, these concerns are substantially strengthened and I now think that it is very likely that his detailed admissions were unreliable." ...|$|E
500|$|Agnew was {{involved}} in a minor controversy regarding an appearance by Lily Allen on Test Match Special in 2009. The Daily Telegraph reported that [...] "the cricket-loving Allen struck up an instant rapport with Agnew, and the BBC received largely positive feedback for the 30-minute interview", but Will Buckley, writing for The Observer, described Agnew's [...] "amorous ambitions" [...] as [...] "positioned... firmly on the pervy side of things". Agnew was furious, noting he [...] "gave... Will Buckley 24hrs to apologise for calling me a pervert, and he has declined... As you can imagine, I have taken being called a pervert quite badly." [...] Allen herself supported Agnew: [...] " [...] really think this Will Buckley guy should apologise to... he was nothing but kind and gentlemanly to me during <b>our</b> <b>interview.</b> I don't know 1 person that agrees with The Observer on this one." [...] Buckley eventually apologised.|$|E

However they expressed concerns that sometimes their device will be seized and searched. Similar reports emerged during <b>our</b> <b>interviews</b> of journalists in Zambia as well [73].

2500|$|After {{the death}} of Edward VII, Grand Duke Michael, pushed by his wife, {{tried in vain to}} obtain an English title for her. In 1912, George V wrote to Nicholas II about [...] "that good fool Michael, who I am sure bores you with as many grievances as he does me." [...] Nicholas had written to George to tell him that Grand Duke Michael had asked his {{permission}} for his wife to accept a British title and that he had given consent, subject of course to George’s agreement. In his reply George pointed out [...] "I have not the power to grant a title in England to a foreign subject and still more impossible {{in the case of a}} Russian Grand Duke." [...] Gloomily accepting that the grand duke would be turning up to make a formal request for his wife’s title, George added that [...] "I do not look forward to <b>our</b> <b>interview</b> with any pleasure, as I fear I have no alternative but to refuse his request”.|$|E
