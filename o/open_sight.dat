[...] One caution yet is needful to be told, [...] To guide your choice; this wife must not be old:[11] [...] 100 [...] There goes a saying, and 'twas shrewdly said, [...] Old fish at table, but young flesh in bed.

[...] As subtle clerks by many schools are made, [...] Twice married dames are mistresses o' th' trade: [...] 110 [...] But young and tender virgins ruled with ease, [...] We form like wax, and mould them as we please.

[...] 130 [...] Think not my virtue lost, though time has shed [...] These rev'rend honours on my hoary head: [...] Thus trees are crowned with blossoms white as snow, [...] The vital sap then rising from below.[14] [...] Old as I am, my lusty limbs appear [...] 135 [...] Like winter greens, that flourish all the year.

[...] Th' assuming wit, who deems himself so wise, [...] As his mistaken patron to advise, [...] Let Tirm not dare to vent his dang'rous thought, [...] A noble fool was never in a fault.[16] [...] 165 [...] This, sir, affects not you, whose ev'ry word [...] Is weighed with judgment, and befits a lord: [...] Your will is mine; and is, I will maintain, [...] Pleasing to God, and should be so to man; [...] At least your courage all the world must praise, [...] 170 [...] Who dare to wed in your declining days. [...] Indulge the vigour of your mounting blood, [...] And let grey fools be indolently good, [...] Who, past all pleasure, damn the joys of sense, [...] With rev'rend dulness and grave impotence.[17] [...] 175 [...] Justin, who silent sat, and heard the man, [...] Thus, with a philosophic frown, began: [...] A heathen author,[18] of the first degree, [...] Who, though not faith, had sense as well as we, [...] Bids us be certain our concerns to trust [...] 180 [...] To those of gen'rous principles, and just. [...] The venture's greater, I'll presume to say, [...] To give your person, than your goods away: [...] And therefore, sir, as you regard your rest, [...] First learn your lady's qualities at least: [...] 185 [...] Whether she's chaste or rampant, proud or civil; [...] Meek as a saint, or haughty as the devil; [...] Whether an easy, fond, familiar fool, [...] Or such a wit as no man e'er can rule.[19] [...] 'Tis true, perfection none must hope to find [...] 190 [...] In all this world, much less in woman-kind; [...] But if her virtues prove the larger share, [...] Bless the kind fates, and think your fortune rare. [...] Ah, gentle sir, take warning of a friend, [...] Who knows too well the state you thus commend; [...] 195 [...] And spite of all its praises must declare, [...] All he can find is bondage, cost, and care. [...] Heav'n knows, I shed full many a private tear, [...] And sigh in silence, lest the world should hear: [...] While all my friends applaud my blissful life, [...] 200 [...] And swear no mortal's happier in a wife; [...] Demure and chaste as any vestal nun, [...] The meekest creature that beholds the sun! [...] But, by th' immortal powers, I feel the pain, [...] And he that smarts has reason to complain. [...] 205 [...] Do what you list, for me; you must be sage, [...] And cautious sure; for wisdom is in age: [...] But at these years to venture on the fair![20] [...] By him, who made the ocean, earth, and air, [...] To please a wife, when her occasions call, [...] 210 [...] Would busy the most vig'rous of us all.

[...] I say, quoth he, by heav'n the man's to blame, [...] To slander wives, and wedlock's holy name. [...] At this the council rose, without delay; [...] Each, in his own opinion, went his way; [...] 225 [...] With full consent, that, all disputes appeased, [...] The knight should marry, when and where he pleased. [...] Who now but January exults with joy? [...] The charms of wedlock all his soul employ: [...] Each nymph by turns his wav'ring mind possessed, [...] 230 [...] And reigned the short-lived tyrant of his breast; [...] Whilst fancy pictured ev'ry lively part, [...] And each bright image wandered o'er his heart. [...] Thus, in some public forum fixed on high, [...] A mirror shows the figures moving by; [...] 235 [...] Still one by one, in swift succession, pass [...] The gliding shadows o'er the polished glass. [...] This lady's charms the nicest could not blame, [...] But vile suspicions had aspersed her fame; [...] That was with sense, but not with virtue, blest: [...] 240 [...] And one had grace, that wanted all the rest. [...] Thus doubting long what nymph he should obey, [...] He fixed at last upon the youthful May. [...] Her faults he knew not, love is always blind, [...] But ev'ry charm revolved within his mind: [...] 245 [...] Her tender age, her form divinely fair, [...] Her easy motion, her attractive air, [...] Her sweet behaviour, her enchanting face, [...] Her moving softness, and majestic grace.[22] [...] Much in his prudence did our knight rejoice, [...] 250 [...] And thought no mortal could dispute his choice:[23] [...] Once more in haste he summoned ev'ry friend, [...] And told them all, their pains were at an end.[24] [...] Heav'n, that (said he) inspired me first to wed, [...] Provides a consort worthy of my bed: [...] 255 [...] Let none oppose th' election, since on this [...] Depends my quiet, and my future bliss.[25] [...] A dame there is, the darling of my eyes, [...] Young, beauteous, artless, innocent, and wise; [...] Chaste, though not rich; and though not nobly born, [...] 260 [...] Of honest parents, and may serve my turn.[26] [...] Her will I wed, if gracious heav'n so please; [...] To pass my age in sanctity and ease; [...] And thank the pow'rs, I may possess alone [...] The lovely prize, and share my bliss with none! [...] 265 [...] If you, my friends, this virgin can procure, [...] My joys are full, my happiness is sure. [...] One only doubt remains: Full oft, I've heard, [...] By casuists grave, and deep divines averred; [...] That 'tis too much for human race to know [...] 270 [...] The bliss of heav'n above, and earth below. [...] Now should the nuptial pleasures prove so great, [...] To match the blessings of the future state, [...] Those endless joys were ill exchanged for these; [...] Then clear this doubt, and set my mind at ease.[27] [...] 275 [...] This Justin heard, nor could his spleen controul, [...] Touched to the quick, and tickled at the soul. [...] Sir knight, he cried, if this be all your dread, [...] Heav'n put it past your doubt, whene'er you wed; [...] And to my fervent prayers so far consent, [...] 280 [...] That ere the rites are o'er, you may repent! [...] Good heav'n, no doubt, the nuptial state approves, [...] Since it chastises still what best it loves. [...] Then be not, sir, abandoned to despair; [...] } [...] Seek, and perhaps you'll find among the fair, } [...] 285 [...] One, that may do your business to a hair; [...] } [...] Not ev'n in wish, your happiness delay, [...] But prove the scourge to lash you on your way: [...] Then to the skies your mounting soul shall go, [...] Swift as an arrow soaring from the bow! [...] 290 [...] Provided still, you moderate your joy, [...] Nor in your pleasures all your might employ; [...] Let reason's rule your strong desires abate, [...] Nor please too lavishly your gentle mate. [...] Old wives there are, of judgment most acute, [...] 295 [...] Who solve these questions beyond all dispute; [...] Consult with those, and be of better cheer; [...] Marry, do penance, and dismiss your fear. [...] So said, they rose, no more the work delayed;[28] [...] The match was offered, the proposals made [...] 300 [...] The parents, you may think, would soon comply; [...] The old have int'rest ever in their eye. [...] Nor was it hard to move the lady's mind; [...] When fortune favours, still the fair are kind.[29] [...] I pass each previous settlement and deed, [...] 305 [...] Too long for me to write, or you to read; [...] Nor will with quaint impertinence display [...] The pomp, the pageantry, the proud array.[30] [...] The time approached, to church the parties went, [...] At once with carnal and devout intent:[31] [...] 310 [...] Forth came the priest, and bade th' obedient wife [...] Like Sarah or Rebecca lead her life: [...] Then prayed the pow'rs the fruitful bed to bless, [...] And made all sure enough with holiness. [...] And now the palace-gates are opened wide, [...] } [...] 315 [...] The guests appear in order, side by side, [...] } [...] And placed in state, the bridegroom and the bride.[32] } [...] The breathing flute's soft notes are heard around, [...] And the shrill trumpets mix their silver sound; [...] The vaulted roofs with echoing music ring, [...] 320 [...] These touch the vocal stops, and those the trembling string. [...] Not thus Amphion tuned the warbling lyre, [...] Nor Joab the sounding clarion could inspire, [...] Nor fierce Theodomas,[33] whose sprightly strain [...] Could swell the soul to rage, and fire the martial train. [...] 325 [...] Bacchus himself, the nuptial feast to grace, [...] (So poets sing) was present on the place: [...] And lovely Venus, goddess of delight, [...] } [...] Shook high her flaming torch in <b>open</b> <b>sight,</b> [...] } [...] And danced around, and smiled on ev'ry knight: } [...] 330 [...] Pleased her best servant would his courage try, [...] No less in wedlock, than in liberty. [...] Full many an age old Hymen had not spied [...] So kind a bridegroom, or so bright a bride. [...] Ye bards! renowned among the tuneful throng [...] 335 [...] For gentle lays, and joyous nuptial song, [...] Think not your softest numbers can display [...] The matchless glories of this blissful day; [...] The joys are such, as far transcend your rage, [...] When tender youth has wedded stooping age. [...] 340 [...] The beauteous dame sate smiling at the board, [...] And darted am'rous glances at her lord. [...] Not Hester's self, whose charms the Hebrews sing, [...] E'er looked so lovely on her Persian king: [...] Bright as the rising sun, in summer's day, [...] 345 [...] And fresh and blooming as the month of May! [...] The joyful knight surveyed her by his side, [...] Nor envied Paris with his Spartan bride; [...] Still as his mind revolved with vast delight [...] Th' entrancing raptures of th' approaching night, [...] 350 [...] Restless he sate, invoking ev'ry pow'r [...] To speed his bliss, and haste the happy hour. [...] Mean time the vig'rous dancers beat the ground, [...] And songs were sung, and flowing bowls went round. [...] With od'rous spices they perfumed the place, [...] 355 [...] And mirth and pleasure shone in ev'ry face. [...] Damian alone, of all the menial train, [...] Sad in the midst of triumphs, sighed for pain; [...] Damian alone, the knight's obsequious squire, [...] Consumed at heart, and fed a secret fire. [...] 360 [...] His lovely mistress all his soul possest, [...] He looked, he languished, and could take no rest: [...] His task performed, he sadly went his way, [...] Fell on his bed, and loathed the light of day. [...] There let him lie; till his relenting dame [...] 365 [...] Weep in her turn, and waste in equal flame. [...] The weary sun, as learned poets write, [...] Forsook th' horizon, and rolled down the light; [...] While glitt'ring stars his absent beams supply, [...] And night's dark mantle overspread the sky. [...] 370 [...] Then rose the guests; and as the time required, [...] Each paid his thanks, and decently retired. [...] The foe once gone, our knight prepared t' undress, [...] So keen he was, and eager to possess: [...] But first thought fit th' assistance to receive, [...] 375 [...] Which grave physicians scruple not to give; [...] Satyrion near, with hot eringos stood, [...] Cantharides, to fire the lazy blood, [...] Whose use old bards describe in luscious rhymes, [...] And critics learn'd explain to modern times. [...] 380 [...] By this the sheets were spread, the bride undressed, [...] The room was sprinkled, and the bed was blessed.[34] [...] What next ensued beseems not me to say;[35] [...] 'Tis sung, he laboured till the dawning day, [...] Then briskly sprung from bed, with heart so light, } [...] 385 [...] As all were nothing he had done by night; [...] } [...] And sipped his cordial as he sat upright. [...] } [...] He kissed his balmy spouse with wanton play, [...] And feebly sung a lusty roundelay;[36] [...] Then on the couch his weary limbs he cast; [...] 390 [...] For ev'ry labour must have rest at last. [...] But anxious cares the pensive squire oppressed, [...] Sleep fled his eyes, and peace forsook his breast; [...] The raging flames that in his bosom dwell, [...] He wanted art to hide, and means to tell. [...] 395 [...] Yet hoping time th' occasion might betray, [...] Composed a sonnet to the lovely May; [...] Which writ and folded with the nicest art, [...] He wrapped in silk, and laid upon his heart. [...] When now the fourth revolving day was run, [...] 400 [...] ('Twas June, and Cancer had received the sun) [...] Forth from her chamber came the beauteous bride, [...] The good old knight moved slowly by her side. [...] High mass was sung; they feasted in the hall;[37] [...] The servants round stood ready at their call. [...] 405 [...] The squire alone was absent from the board, [...] And much his sickness grieved his worthy lord, [...] Who prayed his spouse, attended with her train, [...] To visit Damian, and divert his pain.[38] [...] Th' obliging dames obeyed with one consent; [...] 410 [...] They left the hall, and to his lodging went. [...] The female tribe surround him as he lay, [...] And close beside him sat the gentle May: [...] Where, as she tried his pulse, he softly drew [...] A heaving sigh,[39] and cast a mournful view! [...] 415 [...] Then gave his bill, and bribed the pow'rs divine, [...] With secret vows, to favour his design.[40] [...] Who studies now but discontented May? [...] On her soft couch uneasily she lay: [...] The lumpish husband snored away the night, [...] 420 [...] Till coughs awaked him near the morning light. [...] What then he did, I'll not presume to tell, [...] Nor if she thought herself in heav'n or hell: [...] Honest and dull in nuptial bed they lay, [...] Till the bell tolled, and all arose to pray. [...] 425 [...] Were it by forceful destiny decreed, [...] Or did from chance, or nature's power proceed; [...] Or that some star, with aspect kind to love, [...] Shed its selectest influence from above; [...] Whatever was the cause, the tender dame [...] 430 [...] Felt the first motions of an infant flame; [...] Received th' impressions of the love-sick squire, [...] And wasted in the soft infectious fire. [...] Ye fair, draw near, let May's example move [...] Your gentle minds to pity those who love! [...] 435 [...] Had some fierce tyrant in her stead been found, [...] The poor adorer sure had hanged, or drowned: [...] But she, your sex's mirrour, free from pride, [...] Was much too meek to prove a homicide.[41] [...] But to my tale: Some sages[42] have defined [...] 440 [...] Pleasure the sov'reign bliss of human-kind: [...] Our knight (who studied much, we may suppose) [...] Derived his high philosophy from those; [...] For, like a prince, he bore the vast expense [...] Of lavish pomp, and proud magnificence: [...] 445 [...] His house was stately, his retinue gay, [...] Large was his train, and gorgeous his array. [...] His spacious garden made to yield to none, [...] Was compassed round with walls of solid stone; [...] Priapus could not half describe the grace [...] 450 [...] (Though god of gardens) of this charming place: [...] A place to tire the rambling wits of France [...] In long descriptions, and exceed romance: [...] Enough to shame the gentlest bard that sings [...] Of painted meadows, and of purling springs.[43] [...] 455 [...] Full in the centre of the flow'ry ground, [...] } [...] A crystal fountain spread its streams around, [...] } [...] The fruitful banks with verdant laurels crowned: } [...] About this spring, if ancient fame say true, [...] The dapper elves their moonlight sports pursue: [...] 460 [...] Their pigmy king, and little fairy queen,[44] [...] In circling dances gambolled on the green, [...] While tuneful sprites a merry concert made, [...] And airy music warbled through the shade. [...] Hither the noble knight would oft repair, [...] 465 [...] (His scene of pleasure, and peculiar care) [...] For this he held it dear, and always bore [...] The silver key that locked the garden door. [...] To this sweet place in summer's sultry heat, [...] He used from noise and bus'ness to retreat; [...] 470 [...] And here in dalliance spend the live-long day, [...] Solus cum sola, with his sprightly May. [...] For whate'er work was undischarged a-bed, [...] The duteous knight in this fair garden sped. [...] [45]But ah! what mortal lives of bliss secure, [...] 475 [...] How short a space our worldly joys endure! [...] O Fortune, fair, like all thy treach'rous kind, [...] But faithless still, and way'ring as the wind! [...] O painted monster, formed mankind to cheat, [...] With pleasing poison, and with soft deceit! [...] 480 [...] This rich, this am'rous, venerable knight, [...] Amidst his ease, his solace, and delight, [...] Struck blind by thee, resigns his days to grief, [...] And calls on death, the wretch's last relief.[46] [...] The rage of jealousy then seized his mind, [...] 485 [...] For much he feared the faith of woman-kind.[47] [...] His wife, not suffered from his side to stray, [...] } [...] Was captive kept, he watched her night and day, } [...] Abridged her pleasures, and confined her sway. [...] } [...] Full oft in tears did hapless May complain, [...] 490 [...] And sighed full oft; but sighed and wept in vain; [...] She looked on Damian with a lover's eye; [...] For oh, 'twas fixed, she must possess or die! [...] Nor less impatience vexed her am'rous squire, [...] Wild with delay, and burning with desire. [...] 495 [...] Watched as she was, yet could he not refrain [...] By secret writing to disclose his pain; [...] The dame by signs revealed her kind intent, [...] Till both were conscious what each other meant. [...] Ah, gentle knight, what would thy eyes avail, [...] 500 [...] Though they could see as far as ships can sail? [...] 'Tis better, sure, when blind, deceived to be, [...] Than be deluded when a man can see![48] [...] Argus himself, so cautious and so wise, [...] Was over-watched, for all his hundred eyes: [...] 505 [...] So many an honest husband may, 'tis known, [...] Who, wisely, never thinks the case his own. [...] The dame at last, by diligence and care, [...] Procured the key her knight was wont to bear; [...] She took the wards in wax before the fire, [...] 510 [...] And gave th' impression to the trusty squire. [...] By means of this, some wonder shall appear, [...] Which, in due place and season, you may hear. [...] Well sung sweet Ovid, in the days of yore, [...] What sleight is that, which love will not explore? [...] 515 [...] And Pyramus and Thisbe plainly show [...] The feats true lovers, when they list, can do: [...] Though watched and captive, yet in spite of all, [...] They found the art of kissing[49] through a wall. [...] But now no longer from our tale to stray; [...] } [...] 520 [...] It happed that once upon a summer's day, [...] } [...] Our rev'rend knight was urged to am'rous play: [...] } [...] He raised his spouse ere matin-bell was rung, [...] And thus his morning canticle he sung. [...] Awake, my love, disclose thy radiant eyes; [...] 525 [...] Arise, my wife, my beauteous lady, rise! [...] Hear how the doves with pensive notes complain, [...] And in soft murmurs tell the trees their pain:[50] [...] The winter's past; the clouds and tempests fly; [...] The sun adorns the fields, and brightens all the sky. [...] 530 [...] Fair without spot, whose ev'ry charming part [...] My bosom wounds, and captivates my heart; [...] Come, and in mutual pleasures let's engage, [...] Joy of my life, and comfort of my age. [...] This heard, to Damian straight a sign she made, [...] 535 [...] To haste before; the gentle squire obeyed: [...] Secret and undescried he took his way, [...] And, ambushed close, behind an arbour lay, [...] It was not long ere January came, [...] And, hand in hand with him his lovely dame; [...] 540 [...] Blind as he was, not doubting all was sure, [...] He turned the key, and made the gate secure. [...] Here let us walk, he said, observed by none, [...] Conscious of pleasures to the world unknown: [...] So may my soul have joy, as thou my wife [...] 545 [...] Art far the dearest solace of my life; [...] And rather would I chuse, by heav'n above, [...] To die this instant, than to lose thy love.[51] [...] Reflect what truth was in my passion shown, [...] } [...] When, unendowed, I took thee for my own, [...] } [...] 550 [...] And sought no treasure but thy heart alone. [...] } [...] Old as I am, and now deprived of sight, [...] } [...] Whilst thou art faithful to thy own true knight, } [...] Nor age, nor blindness, rob me of delight. [...] } [...] Each other loss with patience I can bear, [...] 555 [...] The loss of thee is what I only fear. [...] Consider then, my lady and my wife, [...] The solid comforts of a virtuous life. [...] As first, the love of Christ himself you gain; [...] Next, your own honour undefiled maintain; [...] 560 [...] And lastly, that which sure your mind must move,[52] [...] My whole estate shall gratify your love: [...] Make your own terms, and ere to-morrow's sun [...] Displays his light, by heav'n it shall be done. [...] I seal the contract with a holy kiss, [...] 565 [...] And will perform, by this--my dear, and this.[53] [...] Have comfort, spouse, nor think thy lord unkind; [...] 'Tis love, not jealousy, that fires my mind. [...] For when thy charms my sober thoughts engage, [...] And joined to them my own unequal age,[54] [...] 570 [...] From thy dear side I have no pow'r to part, [...] Such secret transports warm my melting heart. [...] For who that once possessed those heav'nly charms, [...] Could live one moment absent from thy arms? [...] He ceased, and May with modest grace replied; [...] 575 [...] (Weak was her voice, as while she spoke she cried;) [...] Heav'n knows (with that a tender sigh she drew) [...] I have a soul to save as well as you; [...] And, what no less you to my charge commend, [...] My dearest honour, will to death defend. [...] 580 [...] To you in holy church I gave my hand, [...] And joined my heart in wedlock's sacred band: [...] Yet, after this, if you distrust my care, [...] Then hear, my lord, and witness what I swear: [...] First may the yawning earth her bosom rend, [...] 585 [...] And let me hence to hell alive descend;[55] [...] Or die the death I dread no less than hell, [...] Sewed in a sack, and plunged into a well,[56] [...] Ere I my fame by one lewd act disgrace, [...] Or once renounce the honour of my race. [...] 590 [...] For know, sir knight, of gentle blood I came, [...] I loath a whore, and startle at the name. [...] But jealous men on their own crimes reflect, [...] And learn from thence their ladies to suspect: [...] Else why these needless cautions, sir, to me? [...] 595 [...] These doubts and fears of female constancy! [...] This chime still rings in ev'ry lady's ear, [...] The only strain a wife must hope to hear. [...] Thus while she spoke, a sidelong glance she cast [...] Where Damian, kneeling, worshipped as she passed:[57] [...] 600 [...] She saw him watch the motions of her eye, [...] And singled out a pear-tree planted nigh:[58] [...] 'Twas charged with fruit that made a goodly show, [...] And hung with dangling pears was ev'ry bough. [...] Thither th' obsequious squire addressed his pace, [...] 605 [...] And climbing, in the summit took his place; [...] The knight and lady walked beneath in view, [...] Where let us leave them, and our tale pursue. [...] 'Twas now the season when the glorious sun [...] His heav'nly progress through the Twins had run; [...] 610 [...] And Jove, exalted, his mild influence yields, [...] To glad the glebe, and paint the flow'ry fields: [...] Clear was the day, and Phoebus rising bright, [...] Had streaked the azure firmament with light; [...] He pierced the glitt'ring clouds with golden streams, [...] 615 [...] And warmed the womb of earth with genial beams. [...] It so befel, in that fair morning tide, [...] } [...] The fairies sported on the garden side, [...] } [...] And in the midst their monarch and his bride. } [...] So featly tripped the light-foot ladies round, [...] } [...] 620 [...] The knights so nimbly o'er the green-sward bound, [...] } [...] That scarce they bent the flow'rs, or touched the ground.[59] } [...] The dances ended, all the fairy train [...] For pinks and daisies searched the flow'ry plain; [...] While on a bank reclined of rising green, [...] 625 [...] Thus, with a frown, the king bespoke his queen: [...] 'Tis too apparent, argue what you can, [...] The treachery you women use to man: [...] A thousand authors have this truth made out, [...] And sad experience leaves no room for doubt. [...] 630 [...] Heav'n rest thy spirit, noble Solomon, [...] A wiser monarch never saw the sun: [...] All wealth, all honours, the supreme degree [...] Of earthly bliss, was well bestowed on thee! [...] For sagely hast thou said: Of all mankind, [...] 635 [...] One only just, and righteous, hope to find: [...] But should'st thou search the spacious world around, [...] Yet one good woman is not to be found. [...] Thus says the king who knew your wickedness; [...] The son of Sirach[60] testifies no less. [...] 640 [...] So may some wildfire on your bodies fall, [...] Or some devouring plague consume you all; [...] As well you view the lecher in the tree, [...] And well this honourable knight you see: [...] But since he's blind and old (a helpless case) [...] 645 [...] His squire shall cuckold him before your face. [...] Now by my own dread majesty I swear, [...] And by this awful sceptre which I bear, [...] No impious wretch shall 'scape unpunished long, [...] That in my presence offers such a wrong. [...] 650 [...] I will this instant undeceive the knight, [...] And, in the very act, restore his sight: [...] And set the strumpet here in open view, [...] } [...] A warning to these ladies,[61] and to you, [...] } [...] And all the faithless sex, for ever to be true. [...] } [...] 655 [...] And will you so, replied the queen, indeed? } [...] Now, by my mother's soul it is decreed, [...] } [...] She shall not want an answer at her need. [...] } [...] For her, and for her daughters, I'll engage, [...] And all the sex in each succeeding age; [...] 660 [...] Art shall be theirs to varnish an offence, [...] And fortify their crimes with confidence. [...] Nay, were they taken in a strict embrace, [...] Seen with both eyes, and pinioned on the place; [...] All they shall need is to protest and swear, [...] 665 [...] Breathe a soft sigh, and drop a tender tear;[62] [...] Till their wise husbands, gulled by arts like these, [...] Grow gentle, tractable, and tame as geese. [...] What though this sland'rous Jew, this Solomon, [...] Called women fools, and knew full many a one; [...] 670 [...] The wiser wits of later times declare, [...] How constant, chaste, and virtuous women are: [...] Witness the martyrs, who resigned their breath, [...] Serene in torments, unconcerned in death;[63] [...] And witness next what Roman authors tell, [...] 675 [...] How Arria, Portia, and Lucretia fell. [...] But since the sacred leaves to all are free, [...] And men interpret texts, why should not we? [...] By this no more was meant, than to have shown, [...] } [...] That sov'reign goodness dwells in him alone [...] } [...] 680 [...] Who only Is, and is but only One.[64] [...] } [...] But grant the worst; shall women then be weighed [...] By ev'ry word that Solomon has said? [...] What though this king (as ancient story boasts) [...] Built a fair temple to the Lord of Hosts; [...] 685 [...] He ceased at last his Maker to adore, [...] And did as much for idol gods, or more. [...] Beware what lavish praises you confer [...] On a rank lecher and idolater; [...] Whose reign indulgent God, says Holy Writ, [...] 690 [...] Did but for David's righteous sake permit; [...] David, the monarch after heav'n's own mind, [...] Who loved our sex, and honoured all our kind. [...] Well, I'm a woman, and as such must speak; [...] Silence would swell me, and my heart would break. [...] 695 [...] Know then, I scorn your dull authorities, [...] Your idle wits, and all their learned lies. [...] By heav'n, those authors are our sex's foes, [...] Whom, in our right, I must and will oppose. [...] Nay, quoth the king, dear madam, be not wroth: [...] 700 [...] I yield it up; but since I gave my oath, [...] That this much injured knight again should see, [...] It must be done--I am a king, said he, [...] And one whose faith has ever sacred been. [...] And so has mine, she said, I am a queen: [...] 705 [...] Her answer she shall have, I undertake; [...] And thus an end of all dispute I make. [...] Try when you list; and you shall find, my lord, [...] It is not in our sex to break our word.[65] [...] We leave them here in this heroic strain, [...] 710 [...] And to the knight our story turns again; [...] Who in the garden, with his lovely May, [...] Sung merrier than the cuckoo or the jay: [...] This was his song; [...] "Oh kind and constant be, [...] Constant and kind I'll ever prove to thee." [...] 715 [...] Thus singing as he went, at last he drew [...] By easy steps, to where the pear-tree grew: [...] The longing dame looked up, and spied her love, [...] Full fairly perched among the boughs above. [...] She stopped, and sighing: Oh, good gods, she cried, [...] 720 [...] What pangs, what sudden shoots distend my side? [...] Oh for that tempting fruit, so fresh, so green; [...] Help, for the love of heav'n's immortal queen; [...] Help, dearest lord, and save at once the life [...] Of thy poor infant, and thy longing wife![66] [...] 725 [...] Sore sighed the knight to hear his lady's cry, [...] But could not climb, and had no servant nigh: [...] Old as he was, and void of eye-sight too, [...] What could, alas! a helpless husband do? [...] And must I languish then, she said, and die, [...] 730 [...] Yet view the lovely fruit before my eye? [...] At least, kind sir, for charity's sweet sake, [...] Vouchsafe the trunk between your arms to take; [...] Then from your back I might ascend the tree; [...] Do you but stoop, and leave the rest to me. [...] 735 [...] With all my soul, he thus replied again, [...] I'd spend my dearest blood to ease thy pain. [...] With that, his back against the trunk he bent, [...] She seized a twig, and up the tree she went. [...] Now prove your patience, gentle ladies all! [...] 740 [...] Nor let on me your heavy anger fall: [...] 'Tis truth I tell, though not in phrase refined, [...] Though blunt my tale, yet honest is my mind. [...] What feats the lady in the tree might do, [...] I pass as gambols never known to you; [...] 745 [...] But sure it was a merrier fit, she swore, [...] Than in her life she ever felt before. [...] In that nice moment, lo! the wond'ring knight [...] Looked out, and stood restored to sudden sight. [...] Straight on the tree his eager eyes he bent, [...] 750 [...] As one whose thoughts were on his spouse intent; [...] But when he saw his bosom-wife so dressed, [...] His rage was such as cannot be expressed: [...] Not frantic mothers when their infants die, [...] With louder clamours rend the vaulted sky: [...] 755 [...] He cried, he roared, he stormed, he tore his hair; [...] Death! hell! and furies! what dost thou do there! [...] What ails my lord? the trembling dame replied; [...] I thought your patience had been better tried; [...] Is this your love, ungrateful, and unkind, [...] 760 [...] This my reward for having cured the blind? [...] Why was I taught to make my husband see, [...] By struggling with a man upon a tree? [...] Did I for this the pow'r of magic prove? [...] Unhappy wife, whose crime was too much love! [...] 765 [...] If this be struggling, by this holy light, [...] 'Tis struggling with a vengeance, quoth the knight; [...] So heav'n preserve the sight it has restored, [...] As with these eyes I plainly saw thee whored; [...] Whored by my slave--perfidious wretch! may hell [...] 770 [...] As surely seize thee, as I saw too well. [...] Guard me, good angels! cried the gentle May, [...] Pray heav'n this magic work the proper way! [...] Alas, my love! 'tis certain, could you see, [...] You ne'er had used these killing words to me: [...] 775 [...] So help me, fates, as 'tis no perfect sight, [...] But some faint glimm'ring of a doubtful light. [...] What I have said, quoth he, I must maintain, [...] For by th' immortal pow'rs it seemed too plain. [...] By all those pow'rs, some frenzy seized your mind, } [...] 780 [...] Replied the dame, are these the thanks I find? [...] } [...] Wretch that I am, that e'er I was so kind! [...] } [...] She said; a rising sigh expressed her woe, [...] The ready tears apace began to flow, [...] And as they fell she wiped from either eye [...] 785 [...] The drops; for women, when they list, can cry. [...] The knight was touched; and in his looks appeared [...] Signs of remorse, while thus his spouse he cheered: [...] Madam, 'tis past, and my short anger o'er! [...] Come down, and vex your tender heart no more; [...] 790 [...] Excuse me, dear, if aught amiss was said, [...] For, on my soul, amends shall soon be made: [...] Let my repentance your forgiveness draw, [...] By heav'n, I swore but what I thought I saw. [...] Ah, my loved lord! 'twas much unkind, she cried, [...] 795 [...] On bare suspicion thus to treat your bride. [...] But till your sight's established, for awhile, [...] Imperfect objects may your sense beguile. [...] Thus when from sleep we first our eyes display, } [...] The balls are wounded with the piercing ray, [...] } [...] 800 [...] And dusky vapours rise, and intercept the day: } [...] So just recov'ring from the shades of night, [...] } [...] Your swimming eyes are drunk with sudden light, [...] } [...] Strange phantoms dance around, and skim before your sight. } [...] Then, sir, be cautious, nor too rashly deem; [...] 805 [...] Heav'n knows how seldom things are what they seem! [...] Consult your reason, and you soon shall find [...] 'Twas you were jealous, not your wife unkind: [...] Jove ne'er spoke oracle more true than this, [...] None judge so wrong as those who think amiss. [...] 810 [...] With that she leaped into her lord's embrace [...] With well-dissembled virtue in her face. [...] He hugged her close, and kissed her o'er and o'er, [...] Disturbed with doubts and jealousies no more: [...] Both, pleased and blessed, renewed their mutual vows, [...] 815 [...] A fruitful wife and a believing spouse.
