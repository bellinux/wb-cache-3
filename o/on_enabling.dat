2500|$|Data Redirection: Also {{known as}} data virtualization, this virtualizes the {{registry}} and {{certain parts of}} the file system for applications running in the protected user context if User Account Control is turned <b>on,</b> <b>enabling</b> legacy applications to run in non-administrator accounts. It automatically creates private copies of files that an application can use when it does not have permission to access the original files. This facilitates stronger file security and helps applications not written with the least user access principle in mind to run under stronger restrictions. Registry virtualization isolates write operations that have a global impact to a per-user location. Reads and writes in the HKLM\Software section of the Registry by user-mode applications while running as a standard user, as well as to folders such as [...] "Program Files", are [...] "redirected" [...] to the user's profile. The process of reading and writing on the profile data and not on the application-intended location is completely transparent to the application.|$|E
