500|$|Will Smith {{signed on}} to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like [...] "Gladiator [...] Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [...] always felt like it had those {{possibilities}} to me." [...] The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that [...] "when you're on your own, {{it is kind of}} hard to find conflict." [...] The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, [...] "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? <b>Or</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?" [...] He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000).|$|E

2500|$|The {{theory of}} supposition. Supposition theory {{deals with the}} way that predicates (e.g., 'man') range over a domain of {{individuals}} (e.g., all men). [...] In the proposition 'every man is an animal', does the term 'man' range over or 'supposit for' men existing just in the present, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> range include past and future men? Can a term supposit for a non-existing individual? [...] Some medievalists have argued that this idea is a precursor of modern first-order logic. [...] "The theory of supposition with the associated theories of copulatio (sign-capacity of adjectival terms), ampliatio (widening of referential domain), and distributio constitute {{one of the most}} original achievements of Western medieval logic".|$|E
2500|$|... "Jabberwocky" [...] {{has been}} {{translated}} into numerous languages, as the novel has {{been translated into}} 65 languages. The translation might be difficult because the poem holds to English syntax {{and many of the}} principal words of the poem are invented. Translators have generally dealt with them by creating equivalent words of their own. Often these are similar in spelling or sound to Carroll's while respecting the morphology of the language they are being translated into. In Frank L. Warrin's French translation, [...] "'Twas brillig" [...] becomes [...] "Il brilgue". In instances like this, both the original and the invented words echo actual words of Carroll's lexicon, but not necessarily ones with similar meanings. Translators have invented words which draw on root words with meanings similar to the English roots used by Carroll. Douglas Hofstadter noted in his essay [...] "Translations of Jabberwocky", the word 'slithy', for example, echoes the English 'slimy', 'slither', 'slippery', 'lithe' and 'sly'. A French translation that uses 'lubricilleux' for 'slithy', evokes French words like 'lubrifier' (to lubricate) to give an impression of a meaning similar to that of Carroll's word. In his exploration of the translation challenge, Hofstadter asks [...] "what if a word does exist, but it is very intellectual-sounding and Latinate ('lubricilleux'), rather than earthy and Anglo-Saxon ('slithy')? Perhaps 'huilasse' would be better than 'lubricilleux'? <b>Or</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> Latin origin of the word 'lubricilleux' not make itself felt to a speaker of French in the way that it would if it were an English word ('lubricilious', perhaps)? [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|The early 20th century Oxford {{professor}} Samuel Rolles Driver {{taught that}} [...] sets out the fundamental truth of Israel's religion, the uniqueness and unity of God, and the fundamental duty founded upon it of the devotion to God of the Israelite's entire being. Reading [...] Driver asked {{in what sense}} the word [...] "One" [...] is to be understood: Does it express the Unity of God, declaring that God is in God's essence indivisible, and cannot — like Ba'al and Ashtoret, for instance, who are often spoken of in the plural — assume different phases or attributes, as presiding over different localities, or different departments of nature, and cannot further be united syncretistically with other deities; but is only known under the one character by which God has revealed God’s Self to Israel? <b>Or</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "One" [...] denote the Uniqueness of God, representing God in a unique sense, as the God with whom no other god can be compared, as the only Deity to whom the true attributes of the Godhead really belong? Driver taught that the second interpretation gives the higher and fuller meaning to the term, and forms also a more adequate basis for the practical duty inculcated in [...] for a God, who was not unique might not necessarily be a worthy object of human love. Driver taught that the first interpretation, however, is not excluded by the second, for the unity of God is almost a necessary corollary of God's Uniqueness. Driver concluded that [...] is thus a great declaration of Monotheism in the sense both {{that there is only}} one God, and also that the God who exists is truly One. Driver taught that the truth is one which in its full significance was only gradually brought home to the Israelites and was hardly explicitly enunciated much before the age of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah. Driver read verses like [...] ( [...] in the KJV), and [...] to imply that God is superior to [...] "other gods" [...] or that [...] "other gods" [...] cannot be compared to God, but not to deny the real existence of [...] "other gods." [...] Driver argued that it was only gradually seen distinctly, and taught explicitly, not only that God is unique among [...] "other gods," [...] but that [...] "other gods" [...] have no real existence whatever beside God.|$|E
