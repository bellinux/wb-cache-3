The types of anaesthesia applied were general (two patients) and epidural analgesia plus sedation, with local infiltration and intercostal nerve blocks (15 patients).

25|$|The J.M. Smucker Company, American {{manufacturer}} of Crisco (the original partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening), in 2004 released a new formulation made from solid saturated palm oil cut with soybean oil and sunflower oil.

As of 24 January 2007, Smucker claims that all Crisco shortening products in the US have been reformulated to contain less than one gram <b>of</b> trans <b>fat</b> <b>per</b> serving while keeping saturated fat content less than butter.
