The types of anaesthesia applied were general (two patients) and epidural analgesia plus sedation, with local infiltration and intercostal nerve blocks (15 patients).

25|$|The J.M. Smucker Company, American {{manufacturer}} of Crisco (the original partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening), in 2004 released a new formulation made from solid saturated palm oil cut with soybean oil and sunflower oil.

As of 24 January 2007, Smucker claims that all Crisco shortening products in the US have been reformulated to contain less than one gram <b>of</b> trans <b>fat</b> <b>per</b> serving while keeping saturated fat content less than butter.

50|$|Kodo millet is a nutritious {{grain and}} a good {{substitute}} to rice or wheat. The grain is composed of 11% of protein, providing 9 grams/100 g consumed.

50|$|This {{cheese is}} a non-baked cheese with {{compressed}} paste, made from cow's milk, mainly of Holstein and Montbéliarde and sometimes Salers. It has a cylindrical shape, is about 20 to 24 cm wide, {{and is about}} 3 to 5 cm thick. It never weights more than 1.850 kg. The “petit-Saint-Nectaire” is 12 to 14 cm wide, 3.5 to 4.5 cm thick, and the weight doesn’t exceed 0.650 kg. The cheese has a rind that is similar on both sides, with few moulds. Depending on how old the cheese is, the rind can be white, brown or grey, and with orange, yellow, or red patches. If a cheese has a uniform colour, it can’t be sold as a Saint-Nectaire cheese.
