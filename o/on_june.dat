5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 3. It tracked westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean, and <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 15 it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean. The system continued westward, and late <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 16 a low pressure area developed about 300miles (480km) southwest of San José, Costa Rica. At around 1200UTC <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 17, Dvorak classifications began on the disturbance, though initially its convection was broadly distributed and disorganized. The next day, however, an area of concentrated convection developed just south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Ships in the vicinity confirmed the development of a surface circulation within the system, while satellite imagery showed the development of a central dense overcast. Based on its organization, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three-E late <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 18 while located about 270miles (470km) southeast of Puerto Angel, Oaxaca in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 21, 2001. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, retaining little convection on its way. After moving across South America and the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the wave entered the eastern North Pacific Ocean <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 1. A low-level circulation developed <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 2, while it was about 230miles (370km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. Southerly flow forced the system northward, and the wave moved inland <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 3. The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 4, and developed deep convection on its eastern side. Early <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 5, satellite imagery suggested that a tropical depression was forming in the northwest Gulf of Mexico, which was furthered by reports of wind gusts as high as 60mph (95km/h) just a few hundred feet above the surface, towards {{the east side of the}} system.|$|E

5|$|After {{making its}} final Florida landfall, Allison rapidly weakened. Tropical storm force winds {{continued}} over the eastern Florida Panhandle until late that afternoon, {{as the storm}} moved northward into Georgia.

Early <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 6, Allison began to transition into an extratropical storm as it interacted with a warm front to the northeast while tracking across the Carolinas. The remnant low emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Cape Hatteras that evening.

5|$|Alberto quickly {{strengthened}} while moving northeastward {{through the}} southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into a hurricane about nine hours after attaining tropical storm status. Late <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 3, Alberto attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) while located about 120miles (195km) west-southwest of Key West, Florida. Shortly after peaking in intensity, strong upper-level westerly winds impacted the deep convection of the storm. By early <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 4 Alberto weakened to {{a tropical storm}} after turning sharply westward due to weak steering currents. It drifted erratically as the circulation became exposed, and early <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 5 it degenerated into a convectiveless tropical depression. As a tropical depression, Alberto drifted to the east-northeast and later turned to the east, and late <b>on</b> <b>June</b> 6 it dissipated while located about 70miles (115km) {{off the coast of}} Florida.|$|E
