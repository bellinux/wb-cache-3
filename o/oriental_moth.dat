40|$|The oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta Busck, {{and fruit}} flies, Anastrepha fraterculus L., are the {{important}} apple pests under Subtropical climate in Southern Brazil, and control is normally accomplished with insecticides. An alternative {{strategy for the}} control of G. molesta is mating disruption, {{through the use of}} pheromones. Mating disruption strategies using a low density of dispensers (20) per hectare were tested in comparison with conventional pesticides for control of G. molesta in commercial Gala apple orchards in Fraiburgo, SC, for a period of five years. The average field efficiency period of mating disruption formulation over five years was 113 days. In this period the mating interruption index on mating disruption plots was 84. 8 % over five years. Damage to Gala apples by <b>oriental</b> <b>moth</b> larvae was low (< 0. 1 %) in mating disruption plots but did not differ from conventional plots, except in the third year. The use of mating disruption allowed for an average reduction of 5. 2 insecticide treatments per year in Gala orchards during field efficiency period. It was necessary to apply 1. 0 and 1. 2 applications of insecticide to control of G. molesta and A. fraterculus, respectively. Mating disruption with a low density of diffusers proved to be an effective alternative to conventional methods for control of G. molesta in Gala apple orchards in subtropical climate in southern Brazil...|$|E
40|$|A survey {{has been}} carried out in two {{experimental}} organic orchards located at the INRA experimental station of Gotheron near Valence (Southeastern France). The program also associated the GRAB (Groupe de Recherche en Agriculture Biologique, Avignon). The aims were:(i) to acquire references about peach and apple organic farming; (ii) to improve the management of organic orchards by integrating some results of previous research; and (iii) to measure on the long term the effect of organic farming on the soil and on the arthropod community of the orchard. Soils were shallow and washed out stone soils presenting low pH, low organic matter content and low CEC (Cationic Exchange Capacity). Both orchards had been organically managed since planting, realised in 1994 for the apple orchard (Smoothee 2832 T(r) cultivar), and in 1999 for the peach orchard (Bénédicte(r) cultivar). Several parameters measuring the growth of the trees, the yield and the fruit quality were monitored. The low ability of the soil to store and supply nutrients to fulfill the tree requirements implied: (i) to use appropriate types of fertilizers, such as compost in autumn, with additional organic fertilizers which quickly mineralized in spring; (ii) to decrease the dose of fertilizers increasing therefore the number of doses; and (iii) to make additional sprays with oligoelements (Mn, B) in apple orchard. This strategy allowed to increase the pH, to improve the organic matter soil content and to preserve or to increase the availability of the soil nutrients. PEACH ORCHARD The yield was balanced at about 20 tons per ha with a high fruit quality (high sugar content, well balanced sugar/acidity ratio), that was favoured by a water supply restriction during the fruit first growth stages. Most probably because of a well-balanced nutrition and because of a non-disruptive pest management, aphids did not cause any damages: the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) was very seldom monitored and Brachycaudus persicae did not affect seriously the trees. Most of all other pests were under control, using mating disruption against the <b>oriental</b> <b>moth</b> (Cydia molesta), sulphur against powdery mildew and mineral oils in winter against wintering arthropods. The main worrying pest was leaf curl due to Taphrina deformans. With a susceptible period lasting 6 to 7 weeks in winter, and a control of this desease relying on the use of copper, the total amount of this compound sprayed in one year can be high, unless the cultivar is not highly susceptible. APPLE ORCHARD The yield has increased regularly since planting until 2000. In 2001, the decrease in yield was most probably related to aphid infestation in 2000, which is lileky to have induced biennal bearing. The most prevailing pest was the apple rosy aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea) which proved {{to be very difficult to}} control and could damage seriously trees and fruits. Granulosis virus was sprayed against codling moth (Cydia pomonella), which allowed to control the level of wintering populations even if damages at harvest were sometimes high (from 4...|$|E

40|$|T he risk of {{lepidopteran}} pestsinfesting {{tree fruit}} has increasedover {{the past five}} years. It began with peaches and Bosc pears in the late 90 ’s, and shoot-tip infestation of apples. The problem in peach was addressed by incorporating pheromone traps into management schemes to determine first flight of <b>oriental</b> fruit <b>moth</b> (OFM). This {{was followed by the}} use of the Michigan State University degree-day model to time insecticide applications. Growers saw an improvement in control of OFM by using pheromone trapping, spraying according to degree-day models and implementing mating disruption technology. These solutions for <b>oriental</b> fruit <b>moth</b> management in peaches should serve as lessons in managing internal lepidopteran pests in apples. Monitoring insect activity with pheromone traps will be a key component of a decision-making model to schedule management practices for internal lep pests. Observations made in apples and pears across the region in 2002 showed that internal lepidopteran larvae were infesting fruit at increased levels. The primary species were <b>oriental</b> fruit <b>moth</b> (Grapholitha molesta), codling moth (CM, Cydia pomonella), and lesser appleworm, (LAW, Grapholitha prunivora). The number of truckloads of processing apples rejected at processors due to presence of larvae increased from 30 loads from 12 growers in 2001 to 113 loads from 48 growers in 2002.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{progress}} has been made over the last three decades in research on pheromone-mediated mating disruption technology for the <b>oriental</b> fruit <b>moth,</b> Grapholita molesta (Busck). Pheromones can interrupt normal orientation, and the most likely mechanism of pheromone disruption, competitive-attraction (false-plume following), invokes competition between point sources of pheromone formulation and females for males. This technology, performed by broadcasting pheromones into orchards to disrupt mate finding, has been successfully implemented in <b>oriental</b> fruit <b>moth</b> control. Reservoir-style dispensers made of polyethylene tubes, which release pheromone throughout the full growing season, are the current industry standard. Although reasonably effective, they require labor-intensive hand application. Recently, a new formulation, paraffin wax, which maximizes competition between point sources of synthetic pheromone and feral females for males, was shown to have high disruption performance. As this formulation is highly effective, inexpensive, and easy to produce, further study and development are advisable. Increased understanding of the principles of mating disruption will aid in the design of more effective dispensers. Continued research is needed to meet grower concerns with regard to risk, efficacy, and cost and to identify other semiochemicals that can be applied to this delivery system. Greater knowledge of the integration of different biological control methods is therefore essential...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Emamectin {{benzoate}} {{is a novel}} macrocyclic lactone insecticide {{derived from}} naturally occurring avermectin molecules isolated by fermentation from the soil microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis Kim & Goodfellow. The present study aims to evaluate the toxicity of emamectin benzoate to codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), and <b>oriental</b> fruit <b>moth,</b> C. molesta (Busck), under laboratory and semi-field conditions. RESULTS: Dose response bioassays showed that emamectin benzoate had {{a high level of}} intrinsic toxicity to early-stage larvae of both species, and that contact activity might contribute significantly to mortality. In the semi-field trials, residual toxicity lasted for more than 1 week. Ovicidal activity was recorded only for C. pomonella (approximately 30 %), irrespective of the concentrations tested. Field trials confirmed the efficacy of emamectin benzoate on codling moth when applied at 7 day intervals. Fruit damage, both from the first and second generations, was comparable with that on treatment with chlorpyrifos-ethyl, used as a chemical reference. CONCLUSION: Emamectin benzoate may be considered a valuable tool for the control of codling moth as a component of an IPM programme. Its collective advantages are: high efficacy, lack of cross-resistance with currently used products, control of secondary pests such as <b>oriental</b> fruit <b>moth</b> and selective toxicity that spares beneficials...|$|R

40|$|The <b>oriental</b> fruit <b>moth,</b> Grapholita molesta, is an {{extremely}} important oligophagous pest species of stone and pome fruits throughout the world. As a host-switching species, adult moths, especially females, depend on olfactory cues {{to a large extent}} in locating host plants, finding mates, and selecting oviposition sites. The identification of olfactory genes can facilitate investigation on mechanisms for chemical communications. We generated transcriptome of female antennae of G. molesta using the next-generation sequencing technique, and assembled transcripts from RNA-seq reads using Trinity, SOAPdenovo-trans and Abyss-trans assemblers. We identified 124 putative olfactory genes. Among the identified olfactory genes, 118 were novel to this species, including 28 transcripts encoding for odorant binding proteins, 17 chemosensory proteins, 48 odorant receptors, four gustatory receptors, 24 ionotropic receptors, two sensory neuron membrane proteins, and one odor degrading enzyme.
