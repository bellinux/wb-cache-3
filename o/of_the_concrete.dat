40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> {{an investigation}} on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> metakaolin (MK) as a supplementary cementing material to improve <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> Two MK replacement levels {{were employed in}} the study: 10 % and 20 % by weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Portland cement used. Plain and PC-MK concretes were designed at two water–cementi-tious materials (w/cm) ratios of 0. 35 and 0. 55. <b>The</b> performance characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> were evaluated by measuring compressive and splitting tensile strengths, water absorption, drying shrinkage, and weight loss due to the corresponding drying. The porosity and pore size distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> were also examined by using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). Tests were conducted at different ages up to 120 days. The results revealed that <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> MK remarkably reduced the drying shrinkage strain, but increased <b>the</b> strengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> in varying magnitudes, depending mainly on <b>the</b> replacement level <b>of</b> MK, w/cm ratio, and age of testing. It was {{also found that the}} ultrafine MK enhanced substantially <b>the</b> pore structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> and reduced <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harmful large pores, hence made concrete more impervious, especially at a replacement level of 20 %...|$|R

5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concrete,</b> which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E

According to <b>the</b> results, <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> produced with a combined mixture of 50 % coarse mixed aggregates and 50 % of coarse steel aggregates achieved the most adequate properties for use in dyke block manufacturing. <b>The</b> <b>concrete</b> produced employing high percentages of coarse mixed recycled aggregates (without steel slag aggregates) could achieve adequate properties in its saturated state. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> seawater instead <b>of</b> freshwater reduced <b>the</b> <b>concrete’s</b> setting {{time as well as}} <b>the</b> porosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> produced, resulting in both <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> water penetration and the capillary water absorption capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concretes.</b> <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> seawater increased concrete’s compressive strength at early age.

5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and domes {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated {{by the use of}} concrete and brick. By varying the weight of the aggregate material in the concrete, the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E
5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E

The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments.

5|$|The large {{spillway}} tunnels {{have only}} been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock. The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused cavitation, a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with explosive force. In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> was polished mirror-smooth. The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, {{in an attempt to}} eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways. Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.|$|E
5|$|The track {{had been}} patched up {{prior to the}} weekend's racing using a {{synthetic}} rubber compound, and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions, {{as well as the}} Grand-Am and Indy Lights races. However, the Dallara DW12's aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull the compound out. After assessing the track conditions, {{the decision was made to}} attempt to repair the track and restart the race. Marshalls and track workers started to pull the loose strips up from the track, and a quick drying concrete was used to fill the troughs. The repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concrete,</b> as the on-site resources had been used up, but eventually the race director was happy the race could restart. Kanaan and Power drove around to survey the repairs, acting as driver representatives, and although Kanaan particularly did not sound confident that they would hold up, they agreed to try and continue racing. There was some confusion about the rules of the restart; no repairs were allowed, and the teams could change tires, but had to remain on the same compound. This led to J.R. Hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work, and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on the harder tires, which were the slower compound.|$|E

Nearly half of their concrete containment buildings are double containments whose leak tightness is primarily dependent on <b>the</b> integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-tensioned inner <b>concrete</b> containment building. <b>The</b> post-tensioning is calibrated {{in order to ensure}} that in case <b>of</b> an accident <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> remains in compression. However, due to creep of concrete, it decreases in time. It is therefore important for EDF to have a detailed knowledge about <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> used in <b>the</b> containment buildings, in order to be able to predict <b>the</b> future evolution <b>of</b> creep, post-tensioning, and leak-tightness of buildings.
