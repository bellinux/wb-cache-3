50|$|Opportunity {{providing}} is {{a social}} learning mechanism in which the experienced individual puts the observer {{in a situation that}} facilitates the acquisition of knowledge or a new skill. A well known example of unintentional opportunity providing is the transmission of feeding behavior in black rats (Rattus rattus). One pilot study determined that black rats living in the forests of Israel preferentially fed on pine cones instead of <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetation nearby. These rats also methodically stripped pine cones rather than gnawing at them randomly. To determine how these food preferences developed, researchers provided naive adult black rats with fresh pine cones in captivity and observed their behavior. After three months of experimentation, they found that none of the rats had successfully opened the pine cones and had instead haphazardly and inefficiently attempted to feed on the cones. In further experiments, the rats were allowed to observe experienced individuals opening the pine cones but were still unable to pick up the skill of pinecone stripping. Eventually, the researchers determined that naive adult rats could learn to strip pine cones efficiently if presented with an already partially stripped cone. This is consistent with opportunity providing because experienced individuals inadvertently provide naive rats with partially stripped cones that facilitate their learning without altering the experienced rats' behavior.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to specify and {{estimate}} a complete demand system for <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> in Canada. The Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) is used as the functional form to accomplish the {{purpose of this}} study. <b>Fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> was assumed to be weakly separable from all other goods at the first stage of the budgeting process and a conditional demand analysis for <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> was carried out at the second stage of the budgeting process, treating total expenditure as an exogenous variable. At the second stage, expenditure on <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> is allocated to five groups: apples, bananas, grapefruit, oranges, and <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit.</b> The <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> group includes: apricots, blueberries, cherries, grapes, lemons, pineapples, and strawberries. The second stage allocation was estimated utilising Zellner's iterative SURE procedure with homogeneity and symmetry conditions imposed on the restricted model. Data used in this study were obtained from Statistics Canada and consist of thirty-four observations from 1960 [...] 1993. Results of the likelihood ratio test failed to reject the restricted model at 5 % significant level. The R-square and Durbin-Watson test statistics indicated that the fit of the model is satisfactory. This study showed that a system of <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> demand is inelastic to total expenditure, own-price, and cross-price effects. All the expenditure elasticity estimates were positive and significant over the study period, and indicate that apples, grapefruit, and oranges were relatively normal goods, while bananas and <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> category were relative luxury goods.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Alcoholic {{off-flavor}} {{and accompanying}} volatile compounds produced by bananas (Cavendishii spp) held at 20 °C {{and subjected to}} aerobic (air control treatment) or anaerobic conditions (nitrogen treatment) were compared by solid phase micro extraction (SPME), a newly developed method for volatile separation. In general, volatile production was suppressed under anaerobic conditions but resumed, to some extent, after fruits were returned to air. The effects of anaerobic conditions on individual compounds were separated into six groups based on their production trends relative to those of air conditions. It was clear that bananas subjected to anaerobic conditions produced ethanol that could be detected easily by SPME. Anaerobic conditions almost completely blocked the esterification step needed to produced normal volatile profiles of ripening bananas. The effects of anaerobic conditions on banana flavor and off-flavor development were determined by a taste panel quality scaling method. In {{order to determine the}} difference between bananas subjected to both conditions (aerobic and anaerobic), the "difference from control" method was used in other experiments. Generally, the bananas subjected to anaerobic conditions had better physical appearance than bananas in the air control group but lacked fruit flavor and firmness. Off-flavor developed to a greater extent in bananas under anaerobic conditions than those under the air control which had almost no off-flavor. The correlation between off-flavor and ethanol was very high (r = 0. 87) while for other volatiles was very low. This finding implies that ethanol is probably the only volatile causing anaerobic off-flavor in ripening bananas. In order to confirm this, headspace ethanol was detected by SPME, and tissue ethanol was extracted and assayed enzymaticaily. The result showed that tissue ethanol was correlated with headspace ethanol (r² = 0. 66). The threshold for off-flavor development in ripening bananas was 300 mg of tissue ethanol / 100 g FW or 0. 5 ppm for headspace ethanol. Our results indicate that even three days in anaerobic conditions could injure ripening bananas. Thus unlike <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits,</b> O₂ levels at or below 1...|$|E

A MSI+ phenotype was detected in 43 of 126 cases (34. 1 %), whereas 83 cases were classified as MSI-. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to compare the two subgroups of GC classified according to MSI status in the same analysis, with all of the available population controls. A case-case approach was also used. The risk of MSI+ tumors was positively associated with high consumption of red meat and meat sauce and negatively associated with consumption of white meat. A positive association was also seen with total protein and nitrite intake, whereas no relation was found with micronutrient intake. Risk was especially high among subjects reporting both a positive GC family history and a high consumption of red meat (odds ratio, 25. 7; 958 confidence interval, 6. 4 - 102. 8), For MSI- tumors, a significant protective effect was associated with frequent consumption of citrus and <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit,</b> garlic, legumes, vegetables, and olive oil and with high intake of p-carotene and other antioxidants and sugar, whereas positive associations were seen with protein and sodium intake.

In Sicily, the temperatures {{and the average}} rainfalls are characteristic of an upper thermos-Mediterranean lower sub-humid bioclimatic belt (Gianguzzi et al. 2015), and the avocado tree has shown adaptability {{to a wide range}} of ecological conditions. The orchards are mainly located along the Tyrrhenian coastal areas from the province of Palermo to the province of Messina, as well as in the Piana di Catania, mainly in the municipality of Giarre, covering a wide range of climates and soil types, from sandy loam to volcanic soils. From 1978 (Continella 1978; Calabrese et al. 1980), many cultivars were studied in Sicily with interesting results in terms of vegetative performances, yield, and fruit quality with the best observed results for Hass, Reed, and Bacon cultivars (De Michele et al. 2007). A recent study indicates that Sicilian avocado fruit is an important source of phenolic compounds, which depend on genetic differences and maturation stage (Di Stefano et al. 2017). Considering the suitability of the environment in these areas, as well as a good market trend in Europe and productive-qualitative results, avocado is grown on some farms in Sicily and its cultivation is quickly expanding in conjunction with the crisis in the citrus market. Today, Sicilian farms of all sizes have diversified into avocado fruit production. Some of these have an area of less than 1  ha, and their production is directed to the local market. Other farms have combined their orchards and developed a unique brand with the aim to reach the European market with a high-quality fruit. The estimated total area in the region is around 60  ha. The European Union is the largest importer of the fruit coming from countries such as South Africa, Chile, Israel, and Spain. Fresh avocado could be cultivated and commercialized in Mediterranean areas limiting the long-distance fruit export season from tropical countries and represents a diversification market for some fruit tree growers. Avocado is very much appreciated, and it occupies a prominent place in the market due to its high nutritional value, especially vitamins, antioxidants, fibre, fats, and low sugar content (Bergh 1990 a). It is a good source of provitamin A, riboflavin, and niacin. The protein content of 1 – 2 % is considered to be greater than in any <b>other</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> (Bergh 1990 b).
