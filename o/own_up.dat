On the very first day, Chief Commander of German forces ordered surrender of all firearms present within the occupied territory. This pertained not only to civilian owned firearms, but also to those held by the police force. In August 1939, this order was replaced by Regulation of Reich Protector No. 20/39. The regulation again ordered surrender of all firearms and introduced personal responsibility of land plot owners for all firearms that would be find within their property. Reich and Protectorate officials (including police) and SS Members were exempt from the gun ban. Licensed hunters could <b>own</b> <b>up</b> to 5 hunting guns and up to 50 pieces of ammunition.

By the end of the year, Glazer had increased his shareholding from 3.17% to around 15%, which he almost doubled in the year up to October 2004. His acquisition of John Magnier and J. P. McManus's 28.7% stake in May 2005 pushed his <b>own</b> <b>up</b> to around 57%, well over the 30% threshold that would force him to launch a takeover bid. A few days later, he took control of 75% of the club's shares, allowing him to delist the company from the stock exchange, and within a month, the Glazers took 98% ownership of the club via their Red Football parent company, forcing a squeeze out of the remaining 2%.

2500|$|Because of its {{commanding}} {{view of the}} harbor, {{the roof}} of the warehouse has long been the site of various operations. [...] Starting in the early 1920s, the Marine Exchange operated on its roof, providing lookout reports on ships entering and leaving the port. [...] In 1925, the Radio Corporation of America located its harbor receiving station {{to the top of the}} massive warehouse. [...] A new four-room lookout station for use by the Marine Exchange was built in 1928 atop the warehouse. [...] The new station had a large circular window giving telescopes a commanding view of the harbor and ocean, and also included a neon red beacon which shed a red glow over the building at night. [...] In 1939, the Los Angeles Times described the Exchange as [...] "a world all its <b>own</b> <b>up</b> there on Warehouse No. 1." [...] In eight-hour shifts, three men manned the Exchange, climbing seven flights of stairs to reach the lookout station. [...] The Times described the station as follows: [...] "In one room with big windows commanding every approach from the sea, there is a large telescope on wheels. [...] It can be pointed in any direction with the touch of a finger. [...] At a little desk looking out over the channel and the harbor sits one of the three men who are on duty as lookouts ..." [...] During World War II, as blackout rules were applied along the coast, the Marine Exchange ceased operations but resumed its lookout operations atop the warehouse in late 1945.

2500|$|Upon his return, Adorno {{helped shape}} the {{political}} culture of West Germany. Until his death in 1969, twenty years after his return, Adorno contributed to the intellectual foundations of the Federal Republic, as a professor at Frankfurt University, critic of the vogue enjoyed by Heideggerian philosophy, partisan of critical sociology, and teacher of music at the Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music. Adorno resumed his teaching duties at the university soon after his arrival, with seminars on [...] "Kant's Transcendental Dialectic", aesthetics, Hegel, [...] "Contemporary Problems in the Theory of Knowledge", and [...] "The Concept of Knowledge". Adorno's surprise at his students' passionate interest in intellectual matters did not, however, blind him to continuing problems within Germany: The literary climate was dominated by writers who had remained in Germany during Hitler's rule, the government re-employed {{people who had been}} active in the Nazi apparatus and people were generally loath to <b>own</b> <b>up</b> to their own collaboration or the guilt they thus incurred. Instead, the ruined city of Frankfurt continued as if nothing had happened, holding on to ideas of the true, the beautiful, and the good despite the atrocities, hanging on to a culture that had itself been lost in rubble or killed off in the concentration camps. All the enthusiasm Adorno's students showed for intellectual matters could not erase the suspicion that, in the words of Max Frisch, culture had become an [...] "alibi" [...] for the absence of political consciousness. Yet the foundations for what would {{come to be known as}} [...] "The Frankfurt School" [...] were soon laid: Horkheimer resumed his chair in social philosophy and the Institute for Social Research, rebuilt, became a lightning rod for critical thought.|$|E
