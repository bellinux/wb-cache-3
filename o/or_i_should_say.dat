500|$|Epstein {{spent a year}} {{studying}} acting at RADA, but {{dropped out}} shortly after his arrest for [...] "persistent importuning" [...] outside a men's public toilet in Swiss Cottage, London; cottaging, as it was called, {{was one of the}} few public places gay and bisexual men could meet at the time, especially if they were closeted. When Epstein first saw the Beatles perform he noticed their stage attire first, saying, [...] "They were rather scruffily dressed, in the nicest possible way, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> in the most attractive way— black leather jackets, jeans, long hair of course." [...] McCartney said that when Epstein started to manage the Beatles they knew that he was homosexual but did not care, because he encouraged them professionally and offered them access to previously off-limits social circles.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now then," [...] said he, as he seated himself, [...] "we {{have all}} {{been in the same}} box, <b>or,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> in the same boxes of {{different}} kinds, and although I may {{not have the right to}} call myself a friend, I am just as friendly to you as if I was, and feel as if people who have been through what we have ought to stand by each other even after they've got through their hardest rubs.|$|E
6000|$|The Prime Minister (with some asperity). [...] "Members {{are well}} aware what Home Rule meant. It was a plan--or rather it was a scheme--that is to say, {{it was an act}} of parliament, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> a bill, in fact, Mr. Speaker, I don't mind confessing that, not having my papers with me, I am unable to inform the House just what Home Rule was. I think, perhaps, the Ex-Minister of Munitions has a copy of last year's bill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eleanor, I {{positively}} {{hate that}} phrase 'modern feminine unrest!' It smacks of ultra--ultra--Oh! I don't know what. That phrase {{ought to be}} translated by a Western acquaintance of mine--one Haze Ruff. I'd not like to hurt your sensitive feelings with what he'd say. But this unrest means speed-mad, excitement-mad, fad-mad, dress-mad, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> undress-mad, culture-mad, and Heaven only knows what else. The women of our set are idle, luxurious, selfish, pleasure-craving, lazy, useless, work-and-children shirking, absolutely no good." ...|$|E

Excuse my inexperience; <b>or,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> excuse my congenital inability to profit by experience, now considerable, of DIFFICULTIES--and of friendship.

6000|$|... "Your Majesty," [...] Nicholas answered, [...] "has {{admitted}} them, considering their position, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> {{their lack}} of position, to a somewhat surprising familiarity. This too {{has given rise to}} much comment in the city. Miss Van Decht is a very beautiful young woman, and your Majesty has treated her publicly with great consideration, almost as an equal. Your Majesty must bear with our prejudices. This is not a democratic country. We hold by our rank and its obligations, and we do not consider an American retired tradesman and his daughter people whom we can meet habitually on terms of equality--even at the Court of the King." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tom, to my surprise, {{refused a}} cocktail. It seems, as he explained, that he [...] "got {{into the way}} of taking nothing over there." [...] I noticed that my friend Quiller, who is a war correspondent, <b>or,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> a war {{editorial}} writer, took three cocktails and talked all the more brilliantly for it through the opening courses of the dinner, about {{the story of the}} smashing of the Hindenburg line. He decided, after his second Burgundy, that it had been simply a case of sticking it out. I say [...] "Burgundy" [...] because we had substituted Burgundy, the sparkling kind, for champagne at our dinners as one of our little war economies.|$|E
5000|$|Margo (Bette Davis) says to Karen (Celeste Holm), [...] "Please don't play governess, Karen. I haven't your unyielding good taste.

5000|$|.....Human {{problems}} aren't economic. They're {{moral and}} they can't {{be solved by}} immoral measures.

60|$|I {{turned my}} head {{and looked at him}} without answering; for, to my thinking, his sudden {{appearance}} (<b>or</b> rather, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> his unexpected approach) had, amidst the gathering shadows and lingering light, something in it which was wild and ominous.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{swear that}} I, too, {{will become a}} {{conspirator}} if I remain long on this soil. Oh, for a thousand young men of Devon and Somerset here with me, {{every one of them}} with a brain on fire with thoughts like mine! What a glorious deed would be done for humanity! What a mighty cheer we would raise for the glory of the old England that is passing away! Blood would flow in yon streets as it never flowed before, <b>or,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> as it only flowed in them once, and that was when they were swept clean by British bayonets. And afterwards there would be peace, and the grass would be greener and the flowers brighter for that crimson shower.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I will explain. My son Adrian, {{a worthy}} young {{man on the}} whole--you {{know that he is}} my son, do you not?--has had the misfortune, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> the good fortune, to fall earnestly in love with you, whereas you have the bad taste--or, perhaps, the good taste--to give your {{affections}} elsewhere. Under the circumstances, Adrian, being a youth of spirit and resource, has fallen back upon primitive methods in order to bring his suit to a successful conclusion. He is here, you are here, and this evening I understand that the priest will be here. I need not dwell upon the obvious issue; indeed, it is a private matter upon which I have no right to intrude, except, of course, as a relative and a well-wisher." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{pushed me}} towards him. I thought Diana very provoking, and felt uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus {{thinking}} and feeling, St. John bent his head; his Greek face {{was brought to}} a level with mine, his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me. There are no such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> my ecclesiastical cousin's salute belonged {{to one of these}} classes; but there may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss. When given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never omitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} not," [...] the other laughed. [...] "Mr. Hartley; <b>or</b> rather, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> the Earl; would have {{discovered}} it, himself. I only recognized the name, which {{plenty of people}} would have done, {{as soon as they}} saw it in despatches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This other gentleman,' cried Mr. Pickwick, 'is, as {{you will}} see when you have read the letter with which I am intrusted, a very near relative, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> rather <b>say</b> a very {{particular}} friend of your son's. His name is Allen.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{have had}} time, Colonel Campbell, to read our despatches, and can now {{estimate}} the service that you rendered the Duc d'Enghien and our army. General Gassion, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> Marshal Gassion, for he has today {{been raised to}} that rank, speaks {{of the value of}} that service in terms of the highest eulogy, and indeed says frankly, that {{had it not been for}} your voluntary expedition and the discovery by you of the Spanish ambuscade, it is probable that we should have suffered a defeat instead of a victory. The duke speaks no less strongly in your favour. I can remember that when the Viscount Turenne was here three years ago, he told us how a young Scottish officer on his staff had saved Turin to us by a most daring enterprise, by which he informed the garrison of the citadel that help would soon reach them, and mentioned that for that service he had appointed Monsieur Campbell a captain. You are Scottish by birth, are you not?" ...|$|E
60|$|They lifted {{their eyes}} together, to {{encounter}} Mr. Heathcliff: {{perhaps you have}} never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they are those of Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other likeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or not. With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all times, then it was particularly striking; because his senses were alert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. I suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: {{he walked to the}} hearth in evident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man: <b>or,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> altered its character; for it was there yet. He took the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her companion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart also, but he bid me sit still.|$|E
60|$|There can nothing pass in {{the streets}} of a city without some {{following}} of idle folk and children. It was so now; but the more part melted away incontinent until but three were left. One was a girl; she was dressed like a lady, and had a screen of the Drummond colours on her head; but her comrades <b>or</b> (<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say)</b> followers were ragged gillies, such as I had seen the matches of by the dozen in my Highland journey. They all spoke together earnestly in Gaelic, the sound of which was pleasant in my ears for the sake of Alan; and though the rain was by again, and my porter plucked at me to be going, I even drew nearer where they were, to listen. The lady scolded sharply, the others making apologies and cringeing before her, so that I made sure she was come of a chief's house. All the while the three of them sought in their pockets, and by what I could make out, they had the matter of half a farthing among the party; which made me smile a little to see all Highland folk alike for fine obeisances and empty sporrans.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, Sir; my niece, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> my heiress, {{as well as}} the heiress of old Etienne de Barbérie. The cruise was short, Captain Cornelius Ludlow; but the prize-money will be ample--unless, indeed, a {{claim to}} neutral {{privileges}} should be established in favor of part of the cargo!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is {{the place}} {{that we have been}} looking for for the last week," [...] Godfrey said. [...] "This is where we must manage to get clothes. The {{question}} is, how many men are there there? Not above two <b>or</b> three, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say.</b> But anyhow we must risk it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Stringham {{produced}} {{it with an}} effort. [...] "Well it was in reference to Miss Croy.

60|$|Next {{to these}} public things were {{the dreams of}} old women; <b>or,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> the {{interpretation}} of old women upon other people's dreams; and these put abundance of people even out of their wits. Some heard voices warning them to be gone, for {{that there would be}} such a plague in London so that the living {{would not be able to}} bury the dead; others saw apparitions in the air: and I must be allowed to say of both, I hope without breach of charity, that they heard voices that never spake, and saw sights that never appeared. But the imagination of the people was really turned wayward and possessed; and no wonder if they who were poring continually at the clouds saw shapes and figures, representations and appearances, which had nothing in them but air and vapor. Here they told us they saw a flaming sword held in a hand, coming out of a cloud, with a point hanging directly over the city. There they saw hearses and coffins in the air carrying to be buried. And there again, heaps of dead bodies lying unburied and the like, just as the imagination of the poor terrified people furnished them with matter to work upon.|$|E
60|$|And now, with my reader's consent, I {{will follow}} the postman with that letter to Framley; not by its own {{circuitous}} route indeed, or by the same mode of conveyance; for that letter went into Barchester by the Courcy night mail-cart, which, on its road, passes through the villages of Uffley and Chaldicotes, reaching Barchester {{in time for the}} up mail-train to London. By that train, the letter was sent towards the metropolis as far as the junction of the Barset branch line, but there it was turned in its course, and came down again by the main line as far as Silverbridge; at which place, between six and seven in the morning, it was shouldered by the Framley footpost messenger, and in due course delivered at the Framley Parsonage exactly as Mrs. Robarts had finished reading prayers to the four servants. <b>Or,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> rather, that such would in its usual course have been that letter's destiny. As it was, however, it reached Silverbridge on Sunday, and lay there till the Monday, as the Framley people have declined their Sunday post. And then again, when the letter was delivered at the parsonage, on that wet Monday morning, Mrs. Robarts was not at home. As we are all aware, she was staying with her ladyship at Framley Court.|$|E
