Attendance at the Academy’s conferences increased steadily. By 2006, the EA-OHP conference series became biennial. By way of an agreement reached in 2008 with their U.S. counterparts in the Society for Occupational Health Psychology (SOHP), the EA-OHP now coordinates its conference series with the APA/NIOSH/SOHP Work, Stress, and Health conference series. The first EA-OHP conference was attended mainly by academics, but the conference series increasingly attracted practitioners and graduate {{students as well as}} occupational safety and health practitioners. In 2000, the journal Work & Stress, which was founded in 1987 by Tom Cox, [...] became associated with the Academy. <b>Other</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>activities</b> include the publication of conference proceedings and a book series.

Application of the general diagnostic model of company productivity to the net income has been a frequent problem of company practice. This problem is of profit showing, which is an inevitable precondition for long-term company development and growth. Diagnostic access of company productivity allows recognition of specific problems in greater detail, which results from the activity of each company.

40|$|Researchers {{and policy}} makers are {{becoming}} increasingly aware that the link between research and development in Africa is very weak. One {{of the reasons for}} this is the shortage of trained communications personnel in NARS and consequently that research results are not disseminated effectively. In view of the growing pressure for accountability and the competition for dwindling funding resources, it is essential that research institutes be able to communicate effectively with the donors and other target groups. The aim of the CTA/ISNAR project is to help publications staff in NARS to improve their skills in editing and managing publications programmes. The project started with the production of annual reports as these are often the only venue for researchers to report their findings and for the institutes to communicate with the donors. With the skills acquired while producing the annual reports the participants should be able to edit and produce other institutional publications such as newsletters, project reports and simple manuals. For a start, participants in this project were selected from NARS in five Eastern African countries: Ethiopia, Seychelles, Sudan, Tanzanian and Uganda. An introductory workshop was held in Arusha, Tanzania, from 24 - 29 April, 1995 and it was attended by 22 participants from the countries mentioned above. The workshop reviewed the different types of annual reports and their audiences and the different target groups. Emphasis was laid on aspects of publication management such as planning, budgeting and scheduling. At the end of each lecture, participants and facilitators discussed possible bottlenecks and ways of overcoming them. The workshop was very practical and a lot of time was spent on hands-on exercises. The whole process of producing a book was reviewed in detail; from collecting the information through to writing, editing, design, printing and distribution. The last day of the workshop was devoted to planning annual report production schedules for all the participants. CTA and ISNAR will keep in close contact with the participants to monitor progress in the production of the reports. After 12 months it is planned to hold another workshop to assess the reports produced so far and to plan for <b>other</b> <b>publishing</b> <b>activities</b> in the institutes. This was a pilot project. If it is as successful as hoped it can be replicated in other ACP regions. The group of participants was varied. There were trained librarians, editors, professors, research scientists and agricultural extension officers. What they all had in common was that they were required to produce their institutes' publications. The workshop also revealed that the shortage of equipment and other resources is not the main reason why so little is published. The main reason seems to be lack of awareness and little management support for information services.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Biochemistry)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Science, 1980. Gluconeogenesis from {{amino acids}} {{in the liver}} is {{enhanced}} when the utilisation of glucose is limited under various hormonal and dietary conditions, such as diabetes, starvation or administration of a carbohydrate free diet. Pyruvate is of great importance as a carbon source for gluconeogenesis, since the sequence of gluconeogenic reaction is initiated by carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. From this point of view, an important physiological role is suggested for serine dehydratase, which catalyses the degradation of serine to pyruvate and ammonia. The relationship of serine dehydratase levels to gluconeogenic activities, however, is poorly understood, A study of the hormonal and dietary control of serine dehydratase activity {{was carried out in}} vivo and in vitro in rat liver. Serine dehydratase was assayed by the colorimetric method of Suda and Nakagawa (1971) and the enzymatic method of Wimhurst and Manchester (1973). Both these methods {{have been found to be}} suitable since they are in agreement with each other and also give results which compare favourably with <b>other</b> <b>published</b> values. <b>Activities</b> of serine dehydratase from fresh liver and in slices of liver cultured for various periods have been compared, Also a study of the activity of another soluble enzyme, lactic dehydrogenase, was undertaken and the in vivo and in vitro levels were compared...|$|R

We have devised a clinical index of disease activity, and evaluated its use in several forms of necrotizing vasculitis. The weighted score is based on symptoms and signs in nine separate organ systems. Disease features are only scored if they are attributable to active vasculitis. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) was compared with two <b>other</b> <b>published</b> vasculitis <b>activity</b> scores, with the physician's global assessment (PGA), with outcome, and with serological markers of disease activity. In a cross-sectional study of 213 consecutive patients with different forms of vasculitis, all 107 vasculitis patients who were judged completely well on clinical assessment had a BVAS score of 0. Twenty-two patients with active vasculitis prior to treatment had a median score of 7. 5 (range 4 - 30) and 69 with active disease on treatment had a median score of 10 (1 - 29). Of the 12 who died, median score immediately prior to death was 20. 5 (9 - 30). In a serial prospective study, 30 cases had documented episodes of active disease. During periods of disease activity, the median BVAS values {{were significantly higher than}} in remission (15 [range 3 - 32] vs. 0 [0 - 2], p < 0. 001); the same was true for CRP values (80 [9 - 361] vs. 13. 5 [5 - 68], p < 0. 001). This was not true for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), haemoglobin (Hb) or von Willebrand factor (VWF). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|BitTorrent {{is one of}} {{the most}} used file sharing {{protocols}} on the Internet today. Its efficiency is based on the fact that when users download a part of a file, they simultaneously upload other parts of the file to other users. This allows users to efficiently distribute large files to each other, without the need of a centralized server. The most popular torrent site is the Pirate Bay with more than 5, 700, 000 registered users. The motivation for this research is to find information about the use of BitTorrent, especially on the Pirate Bay website. This will be helpful for system administrators and researchers. We collected data on all of the torrents uploaded to the Pirate Bay from 25 th of December, 2010 to 28 th of October, 2011. Using this data we found out that a small percentage of users are responsible for a large portion of the uploaded torrents. There are over 81, 000 distinct users, but the top nine publishers have published more than 16 % of the torrents. We examined the publishing behaviour of the top publishers. The top usernames were publishing so much content that it became obvious that there are groups of people behind the usernames. Most of the content published is video files with a 52 % share. We found out that torrents are uploaded to the Pirate Bay website at a fast rate. About 92 % of the consecutive uploads have happened within 100 seconds or less from each <b>other.</b> However, the <b>publishing</b> <b>activity</b> varies a lot. These deviations in the <b>publishing</b> <b>activity</b> may be caused by down time of the Pirate Bay website, fluctuations in the <b>publishing</b> <b>activity</b> of the top publishers, national holidays or weekdays. One would think that the <b>publishing</b> <b>activity</b> with so many independent users would be quite level, but surprisingly this is not the case. About 85 % of the files of the torrents are less than 1. 5 GB in size. We also discovered that torrents of popular feature films were uploaded to the Pirate Bay very fast after their release and the top publishers appear to be competing on who releases the torrents first. It seems like the impact of the top publishers is quite significant in the publishing of torrents...|$|R
