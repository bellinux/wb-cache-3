40|$|From {{the first}} {{results of the}} French 1999 census {{we can see that}} the {{existing}} regional trends {{in the development of the}} population in France are continuing in weakened form. While the north and north-east with their high birth rates, as an <b>older</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>region,</b> continue to be migration areas, the south is gaining as a result of population moving in. Another thing that is taking on the form of a continuous development is the growth of some regional centres such as Nice, Montpelier and Toulouse. The traditional imbalance between Paris and the "province" seems to be diminishing as a result of the region of Paris (Ile-de-France) losing quantitative amounts of population. In spite of this, we should still be cautious about interpreting the data with reference to the possibility of decentralisation or a loss of importance in the region of the capital. The intertwining area of Paris has continued to extend itself into the bassin Parisien (the Parisian basin) in the last decade, i. e. the bordering region.

40|$|The {{major reason}} of {{economic}} depression of <b>old</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> is {{the aging of}} their economic structure and loss of competitive advantages of their basic sectors. Not the sectors of the regional economy are getting old but determined by economic age conditions of their development in the concrete region. Indicators of basic sectors getting old can be production of non-competitive output because of backward technique and technology, ineffective organization of the industrial process etc. It is possible {{to include in the}} list of <b>old</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> not only manufacturing but also resource-dependent regions like Magadan Oblast in the North-East of Russia. Resource regions have distinct specificity in their aging: it is general decrease in the quality of extracted resources and lack of technology to utilize depleted resources. Generally the main directions of the restructuring of the economy of the <b>old</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> are diversification, introduction of product, process and organizational innovations and elaboration of new competencies. Magadan Oblast in the North-East of Russia has been developed its gold deposits for more than 80 years. So it can be regarded as Northern resource <b>old</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>region.</b> And its directions of economic restructuring lie in resource diversification, technological and institutional innovations, and new economic competencies of the labor force. Efficiency of each direction of regional economic restructuring is measured by indicators of GRP, employment, and real income. At the result of different combination of the projects in the three directions of restructuring one can characterize four scenarios for Magadan Oblast future development. The first is connected with the introduction of innovation in the existing resource projects. The second includes existing and new projects connected with coal deposits. The third includes the projects from the previous scenarios plus project of diversification connected with elaboration of tin and tungsten deposits. This scenario can help Magadan Oblast to come into the group of Russian regions with the average level of economic and social development. And finally fourth scenario related to the large-scale exploitation of the off-shore oil and gas deposits can help to change radically the economic specialization of the region and increase rates of economic growth of the previously territory of economic depression...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Regions of {{traditional}} industry are often perceived as doomed to economic decline. <b>Old</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> in transitional countries constitute entirely new category of problem regions since their economic decay differs from their western counterparts substantially {{both in terms}} the origin and the character of their troubles. In the early 1990 s these regions suddenly faced the double shock {{in the form of}} severe international competition and rather painful inner restructuring. Restructuring of <b>old</b> <b>industrial</b> areas in Central East Europe thus represents a truly topical problem not only for the sake of its unprecedented character but also with regard to its socio-economic impacts. Some of these regions suffer from serious socio-economic problems just according to the initial gloomy prognoses on the one hand but the group of temporary winners emerged on the other hand. It is argued that differentiated transformational trajectories of <b>old</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>regions</b> in transitional countries cannot be satisfactorily explained by traditional theories. However, institutional approaches combined with hermeneutical methods bring acceptable clarification of the diverse development of such kind of regions in Central East Europe. The paper is devoted to the comparison of restructuring in Ostrava agglomeration (Czech Republic) and Katowice conurbation (Poland) from institutional-hermeneutical perspective. While in case of Ostrava region this restructuring turned out to be far from perfect, in Katowice area, on the contrary, pessimistic scenario did not materialise. The different course of restructuring in afore-mentioned regions will be analysed from both rank-territorial (national and regional) and functional (restructuring {{of traditional}} industries, development of new activities and communication level of restructuring) perspectives...|$|R

Using the case study of Twente in the eastern Netherlands, we explore whether universities can strengthen their regional innovation systems. We distinguish local networking from external-investment attraction to show that universities can become temporary venues for ‘local buzz’, building networks which become attractive to outside investors and promoting regional innovation.
