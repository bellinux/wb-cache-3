25|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding these reports are somewhat obscure and inconsistent. Several reports of “volcanic eruptions” in the Lassen area {{had appeared in}} Northern California newspapers in the 1850s, but Harkness was probably unaware of them. In the earliest of these, published in the August 21, 1850, edition of the Daily Pacific News, a San Francisco newspaper, an unnamed observer reported seeing an erupting volcano with “burning lava still running down the sides.” In 1859, the San Francisco Times printed an article in which Wozencraft and a companion were purported to have seen, from a position somewhere west of the Lassen area, flames in the sky that they attributed to a volcanic eruption. This article was widely reprinted and popularized in other papers, but no specific date or location was given for their sighting. The Shasta Republican noted on several occasions in April 1859 (referring to Wozencraft) that the Dr.’s imagination is far more active than any volcano in <b>our</b> <b>County</b> or State. It was in Harkness’ 1875 report that the date of Wozencraft’s observation is first mentioned to be the winter of 1850–1851.|$|E

2500|$|The royalist army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, {{heading for}} London on a {{campaign}} that would culminate in the inconclusive Battle of Edgehill. Its first halt was at Bridgnorth, where the king issued a proclamation [...] "for the better peace of <b>our</b> <b>County</b> of Salop," [...] ordering the arrest of [...] "some persons of good quality," [...] accused of spreading sedition and libel, whom Charles intended to put on trial for high treason. Only three of these were named: Thomas Nichols, Humphrey Mackworth and Thomas Hunt. All three were among those suspended by Shrewsbury Corporation, acting on {{a letter from the}} king, from attending further meetings unless and until they could clear their names. Mackworth's lands were sequestered by the royalists, apparently under Ottley's control, to provide funds for their own war effort. Evidently the sequestration was very thorough, but not thought through. The royalist William Browne had acquired an interest in Mackworth's estates through an indenture of mortgage, in return for a loan of £300 to Mackworth. Sequestration deprived him of a substantial income. Early in 1643 Ottley was compelled to issue an order allowing Browne to draw £70 a year from Mackworth's estates. On 31 March Mackworth's mother, Dorothy Gorton, the widow of Ottley's uncle, wrote to Ottley from Sutton Coldfield seeking to recover the rents of part of the sequestered Mackworth estates that she claimed as jointure property. She asked that he [...] "not let me suffer for my sonns esteemed fault." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{investigate}} the demand for forest contractors using horses in forest operations and also how well they think the opportunities are for new generations of coachmen to get educated using horses in forestry.

The reason for this investigation is that the environmental concerns are increasing in Sweden {{and the demand for}} more environmentally friendly solutions. The results showed for instance that nearly every one of the contractors that participated in the study provided their horses into forest operations. On the contrary many of them thought that the demands for horses in forest operations were small.
