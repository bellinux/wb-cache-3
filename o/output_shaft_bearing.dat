Condition indicators were monitored and recorded on UH- 60 M (Black Hawk) tail gearbox <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> thrust <b>bearings,</b> which {{had been removed from}} helicopters and installed in a bearing spall propagation test rig. Condition indicators monitoring the tail gearbox <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> thrust <b>bearings</b> in UH- 60 M helicopters were also recorded from an on-board HUMS. The spal-lpropagation data collected in the test rig was used to generate condition indicators for bearing fault detection. A damage progression model was also developed from this data. Determining the RUL of this component in a helicopter requires the CI response to be mapped to the damage state. The data from helicopters and a test rig were analyzed to determine if bearing remaining useful life predictions could be correlated with HUMS condition indicators (CI). Results indicate data fusion analysis techniques can be used to map the CI response to the damage levels...|$|R

40|$|Different {{types of}} {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) {{have been developed for}} vehicle and wind turbine applications, which can generate constant-frequency current without using power converters. An infinitely variable speed converter (IVSC) is a type of CVT that can achieve a zero speed ratio and transmit a large torque at low speed ratios. An IVSC with drivers that convert an eccentric motion of cams to a concentric motion of the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> through one-way <b>bearings</b> is introduced, and an active control system with a combined feedback and feed forward control that can automatically control the speed ratio of the transmission is developed. The kinematic model of the IVSC is derived and fitted by a polynomial function to serve as the nonlinear feed forward function in the control law. The benefit of the nonlinear feed forward function is exhibited by using it in the control of the Variable Electromotive-Force Generator (VEG). A dynamic model of the IVSC is derived to investigate the effect of the dynamic load on the input and output speeds. Static and dynamic tests were conducted to validate the kinematic model of the IVSC. The variation of the average output speed per revolution of the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is 0. 56 % with respect to the desired output speed in the simulation and 0. 91 % in the experiments...|$|R

5000|$|While the {{standard}} (Type 1 or T1) Torsen supports a static torque ratio of 50:50; i.e., input torque is supported equally across both <b>output</b> <b>shafts,</b> the T1 has a Torque Bias Ratio (TBR) of 2.7-4:1; i.e., it allows about 3 to 4 times the torque {{to be supplied}} to the most tractive <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> than that {{is available on the}} least tractive shaft or, a torque split of between 25% to 75%. However, by nature the T1 Torsen is locked under most circumstances (<b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> locked together). Only when the TBR is reached (i.e., there is a greater torque difference across the <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> than can be supported by the TBR) do the <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> turn relative to each other, and the differential unlocks. This characteristic results in a relatively free torque movement between both outputs of the (centre) differential, within the limits of the TBR. Thus the static torque distribution of the T1 Torsen in a centre differential installation, rather than being 50:50, will mirror the weight distribution (both static and dynamic) of the vehicle due to the traction available at either (front:rear) <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> In a standard car, this is desirable from the perspective of stability, acceleration and traction, but can be undesirable in terms of handling (understeer). While {{the standard}} quattro Torsen T1 with 2.7:1 TBR is more than sufficient in most conditions, Torsen T1 differentials with higher TBRs (4:1) are available and can further limit understeer by supporting a wider torque split. A better solution, however, is to apportion a torque split directly between both <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> (front & rear) and for this reason Audi has adopted the Type 3 (T3) Torsen design in the latest generations of quattro.|$|R
