The game received generally positive reviews when it was released, with praise for its level design, story, gameplay, combat, soundtrack and multiplayer mode. However, criticism was directed at its dated graphics, lack <b>of</b> <b>challenge</b> and ending. It failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, with sales of two million copies three months after its release.|$|E
5|$|According to biographer C. Douglas Kroll, {{the first}} {{evidence}} of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward. However, {{it is widely believed}} by football researchers that the playing of intercollegiate football began in November 1869, when a player at Rutgers University challenged another player at the nearby College of New Jersey (now Princeton). The contest more closely resembled soccer, with teams scoring by kicking the ball into the opponent's net, and lacked a uniform rules structure. The game developed slowly; the first rules were drafted in October 1873, and only consisted of twelve guidelines. Even though the number of teams participating in the sport increased, the game was still effectively controlled by the College of New Jersey, who claimed eight national championships in ten years. Only Yale presented any form <b>of</b> <b>challenge,</b> claiming four national championships in the same time period.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylum {{features}} a series <b>of</b> <b>challenge</b> maps {{separate from the}} game's story mode that are unlocked while playing, and others are available as optional downloadable content (DLC). The maps focus on the completion of specific goals, such as eliminating successive waves of enemies in combat, and subduing patrolling enemies while using stealth. The methods and variety of abilities used to achieve these goals earn an overall performance score that is ranked online against other players. On the PlayStation 3, the Joker is a playable character in the combat and stealth challenge maps via optional DLC; he must confront the asylum guards and police commissioner James Gordon. The Joker has his own combat abilities and weapons, such as a handgun, exploding chattering teeth, and x-ray glasses which allow him to see opponents through walls.|$|E

5|$|On 11October 1900, Beerschot AC honorary {{president}} Jorge Díaz announced that Antwerp would host a series <b>of</b> <b>challenge</b> matches between Europe's best football teams. After some organisational problems, on 28April 1901, Beerschot's pitch hosted its first tournament, {{in which a}} Belgian A-squad and a Dutch B-team contested the Coupe Vanden Abeele. Belgium won, and beat the Netherlands in all three follow-up games; FIFA does not recognise these results because Belgium fielded some English players. On 1 May 1904, the Belgians played their first official game, against France at the Stade du Vivier d'Oie in Uccle; their draw left the Évence Coppée Trophy unclaimed. Twenty days later, the football boards of both countries were among the seven FIFA founders. At that time, the Belgian squad was chosen by a committee drawn from the country's six or seven major clubs. In 1906, the national team players received the nickname Red Devils because of their red jerseys, and four years later, Scottish ex-footballer William Maxwell replaced the UBSSA committee as their manager. From 1912, UBSSA governed football only and was renamed UBSFA. During the Great War, the national team only played unrecognised friendlies, with games in and against France.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} move from Namco Bandai to Nintendo, Sugiura commented {{that it was a}} {{challenge}} to only be developing games for a single group of consoles, but then Nintendo endorsed the challenge to Monolith Soft with incentives such as making a particular game within given hardware specifications, with Nintendo providing the company time and resources to accomplish that. Another factor that changed within Monolith Soft's development process was Nintendo's increased quality control, which would moot any project that did not have the desired quality for their systems. The sense <b>of</b> <b>challenge</b> was also echoed by Takahashi, who described both Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X as being partially defined by self-imposed challenges to the development team when creating the environments on limited gaming hardware. Monolith Soft's scope and goals are often attributed to Takahashi's drive and ambition. While commonly associated with Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), Monolith Soft focuses more on making role-playing games for a worldwide audience.|$|E

5|$|The Stanley Cup is {{a trophy}} awarded {{annually}} to the playoff champion club of the National Hockey League (NHL) ice hockey league. It was {{donated by the}} Governor General of Canada Lord Stanley of Preston in 1892, and is the oldest professional sports trophy in North America. Inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy was first awarded to Canada's amateur ice hockey clubs who won the trophy as the result <b>of</b> <b>challenge</b> games and league play. Professional clubs came to dominate the competition {{in the early years}} of the twentieth century, and in 1913 the two major professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) (forerunner of the NHL) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other in an annual series for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it became the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926, though it was nominally still subject to external challenge. After 1947, the Cup became the de jure NHL championship prize.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{wanted to}} introduce a new talent agency that would be separate from 765 Pro to better suit {{the details of the}} story, such as how the idols at 876 Pro are just starting out while the idols at 765 Pro already have an establish fanbase. Tanaka would go on to say that the scenario in Dearly Stars would not have worked without having a different company president—in this case, the president of 876 Pro, Minori Ishikawa. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story. However, Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer <b>of</b> <b>challenge,</b> such as the introduction of the choreography panel to make adjustments to an idol's dance sequence or the positioning and manipulation of in-game cameras. The staff also altered how the lessons and auditions operate in Dearly Stars compared to previous games in the series, which also modified the game's degree of difficulty.|$|E

The player has access to the three idols' different scenarios when playing, and each one involves a branching plot line.|$|E
30|$|For the {{agent-based}} thinking challenges (see Fig.  9), challenges {{went down}} with time in both the kinematics and ecology units. Since the kinematics models had single agents, the challenges related to agent-aggregate relationships did not occur in activities 1 – 4. Unlike the other three categories <b>of</b> <b>challenges,</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> did not increase in activity 4. This is possibly because activity 4 did not introduce any new agent-based-thinking-related challenges. However, the agent-based thinking challenges resurfaced in activity 5 when the students were required to model multiple new agents, and modeling multiple agents caused the number <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> to increase sharply. Like other types <b>of</b> <b>challenges,</b> the students were also able to overcome most <b>of</b> these <b>challenges</b> by activities 6 and 7.|$|R
40|$|Background: The prevalence, {{persistence}} and often early onset <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour in individuals with severe intellectual disabilities allude {{to the potential}} of early intervention. Identification of children at high risk <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour would enable effective implementation of this strategy. Method: Questionnaire studies examined the association between child characteristics and the presence <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour {{at one point in}} time and 18 months later using the Challenging Behaviour Screening Questionnaire (CBSQ). Natural observations, questionnaires and objective measures were utilised to assess the validity of the CBSQ. The functional and communicative nature <b>of</b> the <b>challenging</b> behaviour demonstrated by participants at high risk was examined using experimental functional and descriptive analyses. Results: The relative risk <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour at one point in time and its persistence 18 months later was significantly increased by repetitive, restricted, overactive and impulsive behaviour. The concurrent and convergent validity of the CBSQ was demonstrated. Much <b>of</b> the <b>challenging</b> behaviour demonstrated by high risk participants appeared functional and closely associated with communicative behaviours. Discussion: Theoretical underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour in this population are examined with emphasis on the interaction between child characteristics and environmental variables and the potential success of early intervention programmes for these children proposed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the frequency and severity <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour in adults with Down’s syndrome with and without signs of dementia. Care staff were interviewed using the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Community version (M. G. Aman & N. N.

Individuals’ ‘dementia status’ was assessed by using the Dementia Scale for Down’s syndrome (Gedye Research and Consulting, Vancouver, 1995). The {{results showed that the}} dementia group displayed more frequent and severe forms <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour than the nondementia group. The difference in reported levels <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour <b>of</b> both groups with the general learning disabilities population was not considered to be clinically significant and levels fell predominantly within the ‘normal range’. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} frequent and severe forms <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour in adults with Down’s syndrome is more likely to be a behavioural symptom associated with the onset of a dementing illness and not due to normal ageing alone...|$|R

5|$|Japanese {{magazine}} Famitsu {{praised the}} gameplay for being both fun and accessible for those {{not used to}} action games, with further praise going to the control scheme. Computer and Video Games, reviewing the Japanese version, praised the combat's versatility despite some faults, but found the puzzle elements tedious and criticized the camera. The gameplay was generally praised by Ponce despite some repeating puzzles and enjoyed both the extensive post-game content and level <b>of</b> <b>challenge.</b> In contrast, Fitch found combat repetitive, criticized the fact that enemies respawned after leaving each area, and found elements from the dungeon design to the relationship mechanics poorly implemented {{when compared to other}} similar Japanese titles. Despite this, he did enjoy the variety of dungeon designs and the mechanics employed in boss battles. Edwards praised the overall gameplay mechanics, particularly noting the chain's gameplay options and the game's difficulty curve, although he noted that the normal melee combat lacked sophistication when compared to other titles available at the time. Schilling felt that the Oraclos Chain mechanics helped keep the combat interesting in addition to challenging boss battles, but found standard combat repetitive. Raze echoed many of these sentiments, but found that repetitive enemy design and an awkward camera hampered the experience. Kemps found normal weapon combat boring when compared to the Chain, and felt that each available control scheme had advantages and drawbacks related to them. Hogarty enjoyed the boss battles, but found overall combat repetitive and faulted both the controls and the fixed camera.|$|E
5|$|The 1966 Advance Party Report {{recommended}} a wholly new Progressive Training Scheme; for Cub Scouts the Bronze, Silver and Gold Arrows, for Scouts the Scout Standard, Advanced Scout Standard and Chief Scout's Award {{and for the}} new Venture Scout Section, the Venture Award and the Queen's Scout Award which focussed on long-term service and commitment {{as well as the}} completion of an expedition lasting four days and fifty miles. These changes were implemented in October 1967. From then on, the programme has been subject to regular revision; the Scout standards were replaced in 1984 by the Scout Award, Pathfinder Award and Explorer Award with a fully revised Chief Scout's Award. The Cub arrows were replaced in 1991 with the Cub Scout Award, Adventure Award and Adventure Crest Award. All these awards were replaced following the introduction of the Programme Review in February 2002. A new concept called the Balanced Programme replaced the previous scheme. Challenge Awards could be earned by participating in activities in various Programme Zones such as outdoors, fitness, community or international. Earning a certain number <b>of</b> <b>Challenge</b> Awards and the completion of a personal challenge led to the Bronze Chief Scout's Award for Beavers, Silver for Cubs and Gold for Scouts. Proficiency Badges were revised and renamed Activity Badges. In 2015, the programme was revised again following consultation within the association, the changes being called the Programme Refresh.|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that an {{approach}} characterised by either genetic or environmental determinism fails to adequately describe the contingencies involved in the evocation and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviors in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
