60|$|The latest charts of Liberia show no {{less than}} twenty-six parallelograms {{stretching}} inland, at various angles with the shore, and stated to have been acquired by 'conquest or purchase' between 1822 and 1827; but the natives, especially the Krumen, complain that after allowing the foreigners to dwell, amongst them they have been despoiled of their possessions, and that, once lords of the soil, they have sunk to mere serfs. Hence the frequent wars and chronic bad blood. Every African traveller knows the meaning of land-purchase in these regions. There are two ideas peculiar to the negro brain, but apparently inadmissible into European heads. The first is the non-alienation of land. Niger never parts with his ground in perpetuity; he has always the mental reservation, while selling it to a stranger, that the soil and its improvements return to him by right after the death or {{the departure of the}} purchaser. Should the settler's heirs or assignees desire to remain in loco, they are expected to pay a fresh gratification; the lessor will raise his terms as high as possible, but public opinion will oblige him to remain content with a 'dash,' or present, equivalent to that paid by the <b>original</b> <b>lessee.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{sublessor}} remains {{liable to}} the original lessor {{in accordance with the}} initial lease, including all remaining rent payments, including operating expenses and all other original lease terms. In a down-market, the <b>original</b> <b>lessee</b> may require a lower rent payment from the sublessee than what he or she may have originally paid, leaving the remaining rent owed to the lessor to be paid by the <b>original</b> <b>lessee.</b> However, if market prices have increased since the original lease was signed, the sublessor might be able to secure a higher rent price than what is owed the original lessor. However, many commercial leases stipulate that any overages in rent be shared with the landlord, the lessor.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, a novated lease {{refers to}} a car lease which has been novated (transferred) to a third party {{with the consent of}} the lessor, the <b>original</b> <b>lessee</b> and the {{prospective}} lessee. The transfer of liability for the lease, between two legal entities, is normally covered by tripartite contract.|$|E
50|$|Faced {{with the}} {{possibility}} of dispossession from the Globe, on 28 January 1632, through their lawyer, Richard Lane, the remaining <b>original</b> <b>lessee,</b> Cuthbert Burbage, and the representatives of the other original lessees, who at the time were Richard Robinson and Winifred Robinson (d.1642), his wife, William Heminges, John Lowin and Joseph Taylor, filed a bill of complaint against Brend in the Court of Requests.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Flemington, near Navan in County Meath. Little is known of his early career. He was {{appointed}} Baron of the Exchequer in 1521, and apart from a short period on the Court of King's Bench (Ireland) he served on the Court of Exchequer until his death. He {{was one of the}} <b>original</b> <b>lessees</b> of the King's Inns in 1541.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} if Cromwell responded: but Barnewall presumably {{continued}} to press the matter even after Cromwell's downfall. He {{was one of the}} <b>original</b> <b>lessees</b> named in the lease of Blackfriars (the property comprising the present day King's Inns) by the King in 1541; and he was among those who signed the petition to the Privy Council later that year asking for the title to the property to be confirmed.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the next}} two years, {{approximately}} 200 Gen I EV1s were refitted with NiMH batteries and re-issued to their <b>original</b> <b>lessees</b> on revised two-year leases, including a new limited-mileage clause. Delays were involved due to design complications resulting from the NiMH pack retrofit. As a result, GM offered Gen I drivers the opportunity to terminate their lease at no charge, or the chance to transfer the lease {{to one of the}} remaining 150 second-generation EV1s — ahead of those already on the waiting list for Gen II models.|$|R

50|$|Unlike a Novation where {{consent of}} both the lessor and lesse is {{required}} for the third party to assume all obligations and liabilities of the <b>original</b> <b>lessee,</b> an assignment does not always need the consent of all parties. If the contract terms state specifically that the lessor's consent is not needed to assign the contract, then the lesee can assign the contract to whomever the lesee wants to.|$|E
5000|$|The court house {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} the <b>original</b> <b>lessee</b> and his descendants until it was purchased by the county in 1913 for $4,000. [...] Preservation Virginia had the building moved to its current location, near the Clerk's Office. Using funds from the County of Northampton, the local Preservation Virginia Branch, and a grant from the parent Preservation Virginia, the 1731 Courthouse, Clerk's Office, and the Debtor's Prison underwent extensive repair in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Edward Murphy (born 1845 at St. Kilda, Victoria) {{obtained}} a lease of Paremata (Tolaga Bay) in 1873 and was appointed a Justice of the Peace at that time. With his family, {{he returned to}} Australia in 1882; in 1884, he returned and settled in Panikau (then undeveloped), making his home at Manutuke. In 1891, Murphy became an <b>original</b> <b>lessees</b> of Tauwhareparae. For a number of years, he served on the Cook County Council. Among Murphy's gifts was the Bethany (Edward Murphy Memorial) Hospital at Gisborne, which was opened on 14 December 1920. He died in Auckland on 27 June 1919.|$|R
50|$|He {{was opposed}} to the Reformation, but {{like many of the}} Anglo-Irish nobility, he was {{eventually}} persuaded of the advantages which would flow from the Suppression of the Monasteries, and he served on the commission for their suppression in 1541. He was one of the <b>original</b> <b>lessees</b> of the King's Inn and signed the petition for the title to be transferred to the lessees in 1542. He resigned as Remembrancer in 1544 on receiving a pension, but remained on the Privy Council. He received thanks from the Government of Edward VI for his faithful and diligent service in 1547.|$|R
5000|$|The Mosser {{rule was}} then {{expanded}} by the First District Court of Appeals in July 2015, in T & A Drolapas v. City and County of San Francisco (Borjas). That decision dealt with similar facts (a landlord attempting {{to increase the}} rent of {{the son of the}} <b>original</b> <b>lessees,</b> after they had moved out). The court first found that, as the family had moved in prior to the enactment of Costa-Hawkins, even if the son was merely a subtenant, he would have been grandfathered in. A [...] "subtenant" [...] in that circumstance could be an [...] "original occupant". However, it went on to find that he was also an original occupant under the Mosser rule, even though, unlike in Mosser, {{there was no evidence that}} the landlord knew about the son at the commencement of the tenancy.|$|R
50|$|Hughes was {{contracted}} {{to provide a}} worldwide communications system based on four satellites, one over the continental United States (CONUS), and one each over the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, spaced about 90 degrees apart. Five satellites were ordered, with one as a replacement. Also part of the contract were the associated control systems and ground stations. The lease contracts were typically for 5-year terms, with the lessee having the opportunity to extend the lease or to purchase the equipment outright. The US Navy was the <b>original</b> <b>lessee.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ripley {{was also}} {{involved}} in various speculative adventures, mainly in central London. In 1726 he was the <b>original</b> <b>lessee</b> of {{the west side of}} Grosvenor Square, and although his contribution there was limited to 16 Grosvenor Street he built a number of other houses in central London. Ripley was active in promoting the scheme to build Westminster Bridge and was {{also involved in}} Richard Holt's failed attempt to develop artificial stone. Nevertheless, he seems to have been an eager investor, being one of the few to make a fortune out of the South Sea Bubble.|$|E
5000|$|Built in 1892-93 to {{a design}} by William H. Hume for William Waldorf Astor, its <b>original</b> <b>lessee</b> was Ferdinand P. Earle. The {{structure}} was [...] in height with 17 stories, {{making it the}} [...] "tallest hotel structure in the world". The structure {{was among the first}} steel-framed buildings in the city and it enjoyed a reputation for being a very fashionable hotel and location in its day. It was classified as a luxury hotel, rather than one with apartment accommodations as it provided permanent accommodations to its residents, albeit without kitchens. Meals were served in the hotel's dining room, the Louis Sherry restaurant. Renamed the Hotel Netherland in 1908, the neo-Romanesque structure was razed in 1927, replaced by the Sherry Netherland Hotel.|$|E
50|$|On the {{breaking}} up of a severe frost {{in the winter}} of 1854-5, a great part of the timber bridge was broken down by the ice, and all communication between the county of Radnor and the town of Hay was stopped. During the suspension of traffic a boat was put upon the river by the inhabitants of Hay and neighbourhood, a little above the fallen bridge, for the convenience of foot passengers. In 1861 the lease expired, and consequently the Commissioners were empowered to make what arrangements they liked. They found it necessary to rebuild the bridge,* but they had no remedy against the <b>original</b> <b>lessees.</b> They entered into negotiations with Mr. Thomas Savin (the contractor for the Hereford, Hay, and Brecon Railway), with the result that in 1862 he agreed with the Commissioners to rebuild the bridge in consideration of having the tolls assigned to him for 99 years. The present bridge was completed in 1865, and the Commissioners then granted a lease to Mr. Savin for 99 years. The lease dated from 7 April 1862. The lease was afterwards transferred to T. E. Williams (Peterchurch), William Farr (Dorstone), and John Andrew. A new site has recently been purchased for a toll-house by the Commissioners from the Midland Railway Company, and a toll-house erected thereon by the lessees. The present bridge, which cost between £7,000 and £8,000, was designed by W. E. Hughes, of London.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} nature of {{covenants}} for planning control from a legal perspective; to examine the legal mechanisms by which different parties may be bound by covenants and to illustrate the better legal meaning {{for the idea of}} "planning by contract". Design/methodology/approach: The legal principles in Hong Kong relating to how land covenants may affect land owners are used in analyzing the concept of "planning by contract", which conveys a meaning of an origin from the concept of privity of contract. Examples by reference to real life cases are used to illustrate how planning control through covenants has affected land owners. Findings: Covenants relating to planning control in land leases affect not only the <b>original</b> government <b>lessees</b> but also all subsequent owners to the land. The operation of planning control through covenants is more than a concept based on operation of contract. Research limitations/implications: The analysis is largely based on the law in Hong Kong. The extent to which the analysis may apply elsewhere is a matter depending on the legal framework in the operation of land covenants at different places. Practical implications: Land owners and facility managers should fully understand the mechanism by which land covenants may bind land owners even if they have never agreed to the covenants and that the development potential of the property may be seriously affected. Originality/value: This paper will serve as an aid to land owners and facility managers to understand the mechanism by which land covenants may affect the land and its development potential. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Sir Matthew Brend (6 February 1600 - 1659) {{inherited}} from his father, Nicholas Brend, the {{land on which}} {{the first and second}} Globe Theatres were built, and which Nicholas Brend had leased on 21 February 1599 for a 31-year term to Cuthbert Burbage, Richard Burbage, William Shakespeare, Augustine Phillips, Thomas Pope, John Heminges, and William Kempe. During much of the time he was the legal owner of the Globe, Matthew Brend was underage, and his properties were managed for him by Sir Matthew Browne, John Collet, Sir John Bodley, and Sir Sigismund Zinzan. In 1623 Brend conveyed the property on which the Globe was built to his wife, Frances, as part of her jointure. In 1632 he was sued in the Court of Requests by the remaining <b>original</b> <b>lessee,</b> Cuthbert Burbage, and others, for an extension of their original lease.|$|E
50|$|In 1807, a Sephardic {{immigrant}} from Egypt, Rabbi Haim Yeshua Hamitzri (Haim the Jewish Egyptian) purchased 5 dunams {{on the periphery}} of the Old City, and, in 1811, signed two lease contracts for 800 dunams of land, among which were 4 plots at Tel Rumeida. The duration of the lease was 99 years. Since his descendant Haim Bajaio, the last Sephardic rabbi in the city, administered it after the Jews left Hebron, it is believed that the lease must have been renewed. These properties were appropriated by the Jordanian government in 1948, and the Israeli government in 1967. It is on the basis of the original lease taken out for 99 years by Haim Yeshia Hamitzri that settlers, none of whom is related to the <b>original</b> <b>lessee,</b> then asserted a claim to the land in Tel Rumeida, a claim dismissed by Haim Hanegbi, a founder of Matzpen, who argue that settlers in Hebron have no right to speak in the name of the old Jewish families of the city. The Israeli Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that Jews have no right to properties they possessed in places like Hebron and Tel Rumeida before 1948.|$|E
