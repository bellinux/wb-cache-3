5|$|Based on his {{industry}} experience <b>on</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> missile projects, Mueller realized some skilled managers {{could be}} found among high-ranking officers in the United States Air Force, so he got Webb's permission to recruit General Samuel C. Phillips, who gained a reputation for his effective management of the Minuteman program, as OMSF program controller. Phillips' superior officer Bernard A. Schriever agreed to loan Phillips to NASA, along {{with a staff of}} officers under him, on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo Program Director. Mueller agreed, and Phillips managed Apollo from January 1964, until it achieved the first manned landing in July 1969, after which he returned to Air Force duty.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of {{daylight}} saving time and a common time zone in Indiana often claim Indiana must adopt the time-keeping system of the Eastern United States to preserve interstate business with that region. Some believe that Indiana businesses have lost hours of productive time with out-of-state colleagues because the time quirks are too confusing {{to keep track of}} on a daily basis. The confusion caused to outsiders featured prominently in the plot of an episode of The West Wing in which presidential aides unfamiliar with Indiana's non-observance of DST miss their return flight to Washington, D.C., <b>on</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> One and express consternation with the variances in the state's time measurement.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{was quickly}} {{sworn in as}} President <b>on</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> One in Dallas on November 22, 1963, just 2 hours and 8 minutes after John F. Kennedy was assassinated, amid suspicions of a {{conspiracy}} against the government. He was sworn in by U.S. District Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a family friend. In the rush, a Bible was not at hand, so Johnson took {{the oath of office}} using a Roman Catholic missal from President Kennedy's desk. Cecil Stoughton's iconic photograph of Johnson taking the presidential oath of office as Mrs. Kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Korolyov. 1966 {{started with}} death of Sergey Korolyov. His successor, Vasily Mishin, backed by Mstislav Keldysh, {{started his own}} {{political}} campaign, targeted at capturing cosmonaut training facilities from the Air Force - which forever alienated Kamanin. In particular, Mishin promoted his own candidates into the space program; Kamanin deemed them inadequately trained to fly and insisted <b>on</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> candidates with a proven flight record. For some time, the future Soyuz missions had two competing crews - Air Force and OKB-1,. Kamanin's cosmonauts were also assigned to the future Almaz, Spiral and two competing lunar projects. Probably as a reaction against Mishin, Kamanin rated Vladimir Chelomei and his staff very high, and his products - superior to Mishin's.|$|E

500|$|Many war {{films have}} been {{produced}} {{with the cooperation of}} a nation's military forces. After the Second World War, the United States Navy provided ships and technical guidance for films such as Top Gun. The U.S. Air Force assisted with The Big Lift, Strategic Air Command and A Gathering of Eagles, which were filmed <b>on</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> bases; Air Force personnel appeared in many roles. Critics point out that the film Pearl Harbors US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for technical assistance received by the US armed forces; the premiere was actually held on board a U.S. Navy carrier. In another case, the U.S. Navy objected to elements of Crimson Tide, especially mutiny on board an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their assistance. Film historian Jonathan Rayner observes that such films [...] "have also clearly been intended to serve vital propagandist, recruitment and public relations functions".|$|E
500|$|During the crisis, Gingrich's {{public image}} {{suffered}} from {{the perception that the}} Republicans' hardline budget stance was owed partly to an alleged snub of Gingrich by Clinton during a flight <b>on</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> One to and from Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in Israel. That perception developed after the trip when Gingrich, while being questioned by Lars-Erik Nelson at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast, said that he was dissatisfied that Clinton had not invited him to discuss the budget during the flight. He complained that he and Dole were instructed to use the plane's rear exit to deplane, saying the snub was [...] "part of why you ended up with us sending down a tougher continuing resolution". In response to Gingrich's complaint that they were [...] "forced to use the rear door," [...] NBC news released their videotape footage showing both Gingrich and Dole disembarking at Tel Aviv just behind Clinton via the front stairway.|$|E
