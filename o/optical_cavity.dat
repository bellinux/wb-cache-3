These can be {{achieved}} only via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, {{in order to reduce}} the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the <b>optical</b> <b>cavity.</b> The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber, and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems.|$|E

The optical pulse stretcher has {{a plurality of}} <b>optical</b> <b>cavities,</b> having multiple <b>optical</b> reflectors such that an optical path length {{in each of the}} <b>optical</b> <b>cavities</b> is different. The optical pulse stretcher also has a plurality of beam splitters, each of which intercepts a portion of an input optical beam and diverts the portion into one of the plurality of <b>optical</b> <b>cavities.</b> The input <b>optical</b> beam is stretched and a power of an output beam is reduced after passing through the optical pulse stretcher and the placement of the plurality of <b>optical</b> <b>cavities</b> and beam splitters is optimized through a model that takes into account optical beam divergence and alignment in the pluralities of the <b>optical</b> <b>cavities.</b> The <b>optical</b> pulse stretcher system can also function as a high-repetition-rate (MHz) laser pulse generator, making it suitable for use as a stroboscopic light source for high speed ballistic projectile imaging studies, or it can be used for high speed flow diagnostics using a laser light sheet with digital particle imaging velocimetry. The optical pulse stretcher system can also be implemented using fiber optic components to realize a rugged and compact optical system that is alignment free and easy to use...|$|R

25|$|The {{reported}} composite magnetic/plasmonic nanostructure can be visualized to be {{a magnetic}} particle {{embedded in a}} resonant <b>optical</b> <b>cavity.</b> Because of the large density of photon states in the cavity, {{the interaction between the}} electromagnetic field of the light and the electronic transitions of the magnetic material is enhanced, resulting in a larger difference between the velocities of the right- and left-hand circularized polarization, therefore enhancing Faraday rotation.|$|E

25|$|A nanophotonic {{resonator}} or nanocavity is an <b>optical</b> <b>cavity</b> {{which is}} on the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers in size. Optical cavities are a major component of all lasers, they are responsible for providing amplification of a light source via positive feedback, a process known as amplified spontaneous emission or ASE. Nanophotonic resonators offer inherently higher light energy confinement than ordinary cavities, which means stronger light-material interactions, and therefore lower lasing threshold provided the quality factor of the resonator is high. Nanophotonic resonators can be made with photonic crystals, silicon, diamond, or metals such as gold.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{addition}} to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically {{on the order of}} a few percent) and also a very large free spectral range (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In {{addition to}} boosting the total signal gain, the use of the resonant cavity structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the <b>optical</b> <b>cavity,</b> this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.|$|E

The gain medium in the cavity (such as a crystal) emits light coherently, exciting standing waves of light in the cavity. The wavelength of light is very short (in the range of nanometers, 10−9 m) so the standing waves are microscopic in size. One use for standing light waves is to measure small distances, using optical flats.|$|R

2500|$|An optical {{amplifier}} is {{a device that}} amplifies an optical signal directly, without the need to first convert it to an electrical signal. An {{optical amplifier}} may {{be thought of as}} a laser without an <b>optical</b> <b>cavity,</b> or one in which feedback from the cavity is suppressed. Optical amplifiers are important in optical communication and laser physics. [...] An important practical goal is to develop an amplifier adequate for use as an optical repeater in the long distance fiberoptic cables which carry much of the world's telecommunication links. Existing fiberoptic repeaters must convert the light beam to an electronic signal to amplify it, then convert it back to light.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>cavity,</b> {{resonating}} cavity or [...] optical resonator is {{an arrangement}} of mirrors that forms a standing wave cavity resonator for light waves. Optical cavities are {{a major component of}} lasers, surrounding the gain medium and providing feedback of the laser light. They are also used in optical parametric oscillators and some interferometers. [...] Light confined in the cavity reflects multiple times producing standing waves for certain resonance frequencies. [...] The standing wave patterns produced are called modes; longitudinal modes differ only in frequency while transverse modes differ for different frequencies and have different intensity patterns across the cross section of the beam.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{important}} {{properties of}} laser diodes {{are determined by}} the geometry of the <b>optical</b> <b>cavity.</b> Generally, the light is contained within a very thin layer, and the structure supports only a single optical mode in the direction perpendicular to the layers. In the transverse direction, if the waveguide is wide compared to the wavelength of light, then the waveguide can support multiple transverse optical modes, and the laser is known as [...] "multi-mode". These transversely multi-mode lasers are adequate in cases where one needs a very large amount of power, but not a small diffraction-limited beam; for example in printing, activating chemicals, or pumping other types of lasers.|$|E

2500|$|As {{in other}} lasers, the gain region is {{surrounded}} with an <b>optical</b> <b>cavity</b> {{to form a}} laser. In the simplest form of laser diode, an optical waveguide is made on that crystal's surface, such that the light is confined to a relatively narrow line. The two ends of the crystal are cleaved to form perfectly smooth, parallel edges, forming a Fabry–Pérot resonator. Photons emitted into a mode of the waveguide will travel along the waveguide and be reflected several times from each end face before they exit. As a light wave passes through the cavity, it is amplified by stimulated emission, but light is also lost due to absorption and by incomplete reflection from the end facets. Finally, if there is more amplification than loss, the diode begins to [...] "lase".|$|E
2500|$|A {{distributed}} Bragg reflector laser (DBR) {{is a type}} {{of single}} frequency laser diode. [...] It is characterized by an <b>optical</b> <b>cavity</b> consisting of an electrically or optically pumped gain region between two mirrors to provide feedback. [...] One of the mirrors is a broadband reflector and the other mirror is wavelength selective so that gain is favored on a single longitudinal mode, resulting in lasing at a single resonant frequency. The broadband mirror is usually coated with a low reflectivity coating to allow emission. [...] The wavelength selective mirror is a periodically structured diffraction grating with high reflectivity. The diffraction grating is within a non-pumped, or passive region of the cavity [...] [...] A DBR laser is a monolithic single chip device with the grating etched into the semiconductor. [...] DBR lasers can be edge emitting lasers or VCSELs.

2500|$|For a laser in a nanocavity, {{spontaneous}} emission (SE) from the gain medium {{is enhanced by}} the Purcell effect, equal to the quality factor or Q-factor of the cavity divided by the effective mode field volume, F = Q/Vmode.

This also means that the response time of {{spontaneous emission}} from a gain medium in a nanocavity also decreases, the result being that the laser may reach lasing steady state picoseconds after it starts being pumped. A laser formed in a nanocavity therefore may be modulated via its pump source at very high speeds. Spontaneous emission rate increases of over 70 times modern semiconductor laser devices have been demonstrated, with theoretical laser modulation speeds exceeding 100GHz, an order of magnitude higher than modern semiconductor lasers, and higher than most digital oscilloscopes.

2500|$|In {{applications}} {{where a small}} focused beam is needed, the waveguide must be made narrow, on {{the order}} of the optical wavelength. This way, only a single transverse mode is supported and one ends up with a diffraction-limited beam. Such single spatial mode devices are used for optical storage, laser pointers, and fiber optics. Note that these lasers may still support multiple longitudinal modes, and thus can lase at multiple wavelengths simultaneously. [...] The wavelength emitted {{is a function of the}} band-gap of the semiconductor material and the modes of the <b>optical</b> <b>cavity.</b> In general, the maximum gain will occur for photons with energy slightly above the band-gap energy, and the modes nearest the peak of the gain curve will lase most strongly. The width of the gain curve will determine the number of additional [...] "side modes" [...] that may also lase, depending on the operating conditions. [...] Single spatial mode lasers that can support multiple longitudinal modes are called Fabry Perot (FP) lasers.

These experiments gave rise to cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), the study of effects of mirrors and cavities on radiative corrections.
