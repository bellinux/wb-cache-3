5|$|In later years, {{numerous}} {{proposals were}} put forward to salvage Titanic. However, all fell afoul of practical and technological difficulties, {{a lack of}} funding and, in many cases, a lack <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the physical conditions at the wreck site. Charles Smith, an architect from Denver, proposed in March 1914 to attach electromagnets to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wreck's steel hull. Having found its exact position, more electromagnets would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch Titanic to the surface. An estimated cost of $1.5 million (£ today) and its impracticality meant that the idea was not put into practice. Another proposal involved raising Titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using electromagnets. Once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float gently to the surface. Again, the idea got {{no further than the}} drawing board.|$|E

Marge immediately drives to North Haverbrook, which Lanley mentioned was a previous purchaser {{of one of his}} monorails. She discovers that the town is in ruins. While exploring, Marge meets Sebastian Cobb, the engineer who designed Lanley's North Haverbrook monorail. Cobb explains that Lanley embezzled construction funds through shoddy workmanship and materials, and that the entire project was a scam. Realizing Marge believes him, he offers his assistance in helping to prevent the same fate from happening to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Aiyer sent Ramanujan, {{with letters}} of introduction, to his {{mathematician}} friends in Madras. Some {{of them looked}} at his work and gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore {{and the secretary of}} the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> his work but concluded that he was not a phony. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E
5|$|Lack <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> {{wildfire}} {{management by}} the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. Some news agencies gave the impression {{that most of the}} park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires—a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, {{due to a lack of}} fuel, and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the media were again highly critical of the park service and their policies.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on the nature <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> {{can be divided into}} two broad camps. Explanationists believe that it is knowledge of explanations that is key to understanding.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a novel knowledge based account <b>of</b> <b>understanding.</b> More specifically, it proposes an account <b>of</b> maximal <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> a given phenomenon in terms of fully comprehensive and maximally well-connected knowledge of it and <b>of</b> degrees <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> in terms <b>of</b> approximations to such knowledge. It is completed by a contextualist semantics for outright attributions <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> according to which an attribution <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> is true <b>of</b> one just in case one knows enough about it to perform some contextually determined task.
