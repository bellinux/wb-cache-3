In his last book, unfinished when he died, he talks of how <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> reality is shaped and limited. Conquest of Abundance: A Tale of Abstraction versus the Richness of Being bemoans the propensity we have of institutionalizing these limitations.|$|E
25|$|Social action models {{help explain}} Social Outcomes because of basic sociological ideas {{such as the}} Looking Glass Self. The idea of Cooley's looking glass self is that <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self {{develops}} as we observe and reflect upon others and what they may think of our actions. Additionally, impression formation processes allow us to interpret the significance of others' actions.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to its Afrocentric point of view, Wild Seed has also been classified as an Afrofuturistic text. As Elcye Rae Helford contends, the novel is part of Butler’s larger project to “depict the survival of African-American culture throughout history and into the future.” Indeed, as the origin story of the Patternist series, which follows the exploits of a race of genetically-mutated black superhumans who eventually rule Earth in the 27th century, Wild Seed revises <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> human history as directed by white supremacy.|$|E
25|$|In , Harris {{writes that}} the purpose of spirituality (as he defines it – he concedes that the term's uses are diverse and {{sometimes}} indefensible) is to become aware that <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self is illusory, and says this realization brings both happiness and insight into the nature of consciousness. He argues this process of realization is based on experience and is not contingent on faith. In the same book, he describes his experience with Dzogchen, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice, and recommends it to his readers.|$|E

500|$|In Sweden, Lennart Fridén, {{a member}} of the Parliament of Sweden, lamented in a January 1995 speech to Parliament the usage of [...] "ha en bra dag"—"have a nice day" [...] in Swedish. Fridén stated that the {{increased}} usage of English loan expressions like [...] "ha en bra dag" [...] "impairs <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> language and style". He proposed a motion that an authoritative body, working in conjunction with linguistic institutions, be delegated the job of [...] "caring for the Swedish language"; the motion did not pass.|$|E
500|$|The Moon Matrix is {{introduced}} in Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More (2010), in which Icke {{suggests that the}} Earth and collective human mind are manipulated from the Moon, a spacecraft and inter-dimensional portal controlled by the reptilians. The Moon Matrix is a broadcast from that spacecraft to the human body–computer, specifically to the left hemisphere of the brain, which gives us <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> reality: [...] "We {{are living in a}} dreamworld within a dreamworld—a Matrix within the virtual-reality universe—and it is being broadcast from the Moon." [...] Unless people force themselves to become fully conscious, their minds are the Moon's mind.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins {{states that he}} agrees with Robert Hinde's Why Good is Good, Michael Shermer's The Science of Good and Evil, Robert Buckman's Can We Be Good Without God? and Marc Hauser's Moral Minds, that <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> right and wrong {{can be derived from}} our Darwinian past. Christopher Hitchens in God is Not Great has argued that [...] "Modern vernacular {{describes}} conscience—not too badly—as whatever it is that makes us behave well when nobody is looking... Those who believe that the existence of conscience is a proof of a godly design are advancing an argument that simply cannot be disproved because there is no evidence for or against it." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{newcomers}} to the Scooby Gang, Tara Maclay and Giles' girlfriend Olivia (Phina Oruche) are inexperienced with monsters, and were brought in to express [...] "real childlike terror". Willow had, after three seasons, grown considerably more confident, having found her intellectual and emotional niche at college, and therefore was no longer evincing the terror she once had; Tara, shy, unsure of herself, and unaccustomed to such experiences, served {{to fill the gap}} that Willow's maturing had created. According to Buffy essayist Patrick Shade, Tara's and Olivia's fear [...] "heighten(s) <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability and so make these scenes more frightening". Joss Whedon has said that one of his favorite shots in the episode is of Olivia's frightened reaction to a Gentlemen floating by her window, leering in at her.|$|E
500|$|Miller also {{aimed to}} imbue the novel {{with a sense}} of anxiety, {{especially}} concerning the decisions Jean-Baptiste must take. Commenting on fiction in general in an interview with Lorna Bradbury for The Daily Telegraph, Miller stated that [...] "a novel is a collection of anxieties held together, more or less well, more or less interestingly, by the chicken wire of plot". Bradbury goes on to state [...] "that is absolutely the case with Pure, which details multiple counts of insanity as the panic-inducing business of razing the cemetery takes hold". Of Pure specifically, Miller stated that [...] "I'm interested in what anxiety does to people", [...] "in what happens when they can't respond the way the world expects them to. What happens when <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ourselves falls away under the pressure of circumstances? What's left? That's a very interesting place to be." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was {{the first}} {{full-length}} episode of the series to be produced in stop motion animation. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square. Walsh explained, [...] "They dug one of our shorts that we'd done a while back, which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted to have us apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ... We {{come from the same}} planet as far as <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and comic sensibilities are concerned.

50|$|Although {{food is a}} {{basic and}} {{frequently}} experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into gastronomy. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using colour and arrangement; they inspire <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> taste and smell using spices, diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes. In regard to drinking water, there are formal criteria for aesthetic value including odour, colour, total dissolved solids and clarity. There are numerical standards in the U.S. for aesthetic acceptability of these parameters.|$|R

500|$|With the {{validity}} of the agreement in question, the tribes, joined by the Indian Rights Association (IRA) and local ranchers, lobbied against its ratification by Congress. [...] The IRA wrote letters to Senators, stating that the agreement was: [...] "utterly destructive of that honor and good faith which should characterize our dealings with any people, and especially with one too weak to enforce their rights as against us by any other mean as than an appeal to <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> justice." [...] The Secretary of the Interior informed Congress that the allotment would be devastating to the tribes, as the land was not suited to farming, and the amount of land allotted would not allow them sufficient land to graze cattle. [...] A bill was introduced in 1892 to ratify the agreement, but failed to receive the necessary votes. [...] It was reintroduced every year until it passed in 1900, eight years later. [...] The agreement finally passed when the Rock Island Railroad agree to set aside an additional 480,000 acres of pastureland for the tribes to hold in common.|$|E
500|$|All of Ecstasys seven {{tracks were}} written and {{composed}} by Kevin Shields, with Colm Ó Cíosóig credited as the co-writer of three tracks—"The Things I Miss", [...] "Clair" [...] and [...] "(Please) Lose Yourself in Me". Regarding the lyrical {{content of the}} album {{in contrast to the}} music, Shields said that [...] "the songs may sound sweet, but the subject matter isn't necessarily very nice. A lot of it is relationship-based, but it's always vague, and never just boy-meets-girl. It could easily be boy-meets-boy, or girl-meets-girl. Then there's hate, and whimsical thoughts you get from nowhere". Ó Cíosóig remarked that [...] "it's more weird perversions of feeling you get in a relationship" [...] and referred to the lyrics as being marked by [...] "extremes, because we're entertained by extreme things". Shields noted that the lyrics were a progression from the band's earlier releases as [...] "the idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar-coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour" [...] and considered the songwriting process for Ecstasy as [...] "fresh after having made pure noise earlier".|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, {{explaining}} that {{though he did}} not want to give a full review until the season finale aired, he was [...] "enjoying how Fringe third season is wrapping up", such as [...] "the cross-cutting between Earth-1 and Earth-2, and the sense of imminent doom." [...] Murray continued that he [...] "especially liked... that in the midst of all this end-times rush, it pauses periodically to check in with the various characters in short one-on-one scenes, strengthening <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> what these relationships mean. (It's something that Fringe has gotten good at in the past year-and-a-half, and something I wouldn't have predicted for the show back in season one.)" [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted Fringe is preparing for the finale, calling [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] a [...] "movement episode [...] give an opportunity to get everyone into place for the big climax" [...] in a vein similar to the television series Lost. Hanson enjoyed the two [...] "sleights of hand", explaining he was surprised by Fauxlivia's universe-crossing device failing and what happened to Peter after touching the machine.|$|E
30|$|Friction {{perception}} {{is a major}} factor affecting <b>our</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> material textures. Especially, previous research intensively studied the roles of frictional vibration in the textural perception of materials when a finger is slid over a material surface [1 – 6]. For example, Fagiani [1] investigated the spectra of frictional vibrations where a finer surface roughness and higher sliding velocity led to higher frequency components in the spectra. Nonomura et al. [2] suggested that humans may discern different types of liquids based on the stick-slip phenomenon when they investigate fluids on flat glass.|$|R

500|$|Throughout The Ecstatic, Mos Def alternated {{between what}} AllMusic's Andy Kellman called {{nonsensical}} yet intellectual raps and [...] "seemingly nonchalant, off-the-cuff boasts", set against eccentric, lightly reverbed productions. According to The Guardians Paul MacInnes, The Ecstatic featured his characteristically [...] "fragmented lyrical style, which looped words within phrases and played on sound {{as much as}} meaning". [...] "Auditorium" [...] showcased his [...] "complex and convoluted" [...] lyricism delivered closely in rhythm with the beat, Patrin said, citing the lines [...] "soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren / I swing 'round, wring out and bring down the tyrant / chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided". He explored Afrocentric themes on [...] "Revelations" [...] and compared love to a gunfight on [...] "Pistola". On [...] "Roses", Muldrow sang nature-friendly lyrics about drawing flowers in times of sadness rather than plucking them from the ground. [...] "Roses is about creativity and human capacity", she explained. [...] "A lot of times Western society makes [...] base <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> worth on 'diamonds are forever' or 'a dozen roses' and that's how you prove your love to somebody... but you receive so many gifts and still feel empty. So draw them and let the roses come from inside." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} called The Good Terrorists title an oxymoron. Robert Boschman {{suggested}} it {{is indicative of}} Alice's [...] "contradictory personality" [...] – she renovates the squat's house, yet is bent on destroying society. In The Hudson Review, George Kearns wrote that the title [...] "hovers above the novel with... irony". The reader assumes that Alice is the [...] "good terrorist", but that while {{she may be a}} good person, she is [...] "rotten at being a terrorist". Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the [...] "good terrorist", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. She knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice [...] "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the [...] "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is [...] "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in [...] "very domestic-looking fiction", and [...] "direct challenge... <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> reality".|$|E
500|$|Barker wrote {{much of the}} show's material, roughly three-quarters, again {{under the}} name Gerald Wiley. He was heavily {{involved}} with the show's production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] and [...] "as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look." [...] After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it. While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look {{through all of the}} potential material for the studio recording {{of the rest of the}} show's content and decide on the running order. He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting [...] "People refuse to believe that we don't have rows, tensions, private wars. It's a strange thing after so many years but we never have. Actually, it's even more amicable than a marriage – wedlock without the bad patches. <b>Our</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour and perception of what's good and what's rubbish are uncommonly in tune." [...] They took turns to play the parts which had the [...] "good lines". One of the show's other writers, Barry Cryer, said: [...] "You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they weren't a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers." ...|$|E
40|$|Performing arts {{allow us}} to creatively {{challenge}} digitally remediated experience, and to collectively reflect on and explore its prolific scales, materials, and modes of existence. Through celebrations of diversity and idiosyncracy, live performance helps us counter the normative pressures of digitisation. This keynote looks at how theatre - Artaud's crucible - is a uniquely powerful means for mobilising the poetic energies that characterise what is human, {{and what it is}} to be human. This in turn is seen as a source of vital resilience, tuning <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> liveness to digital - and post-digital - times...|$|R

40|$|It was Milgram, Takemura, Utsumi, and Kishino who {{introduced}} the Virtuality Continuum in 1995 and highlighted {{that the distinction}} between real and virtual was increasingly not a hard boundary but one in which both the real and the virtual coexisted.
