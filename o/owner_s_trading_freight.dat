40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} place of active trade policy in U. S. {{industrial}} change. The growing role of imperfectly competitive multinational corporations provides new arguments for more active U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> policy, as does an increased social consensus that governments should insure what markets do not. Arguments against more active U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> policy stem from its manage ability in a democratic {{system of checks and}} balances, from its possible perception as a form of policy aggression, and from the likelihood that there are feasible alternatives to trade policy with smaller implementation costs, administrative costs, incentive costs, and resource-diversion costs. Considered promising among such alternatives are government adjustment programs, foreign-exchange-market intervention, and macroeconomic renovation. Sections 2 and 3 of the paper describe how international economic and policy environments encourage industrial change and pressure U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> policy. Section 4 describes {{the pros and cons of}} more active U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> policy where imperfectly competitive industrial structure and missing insurance markets are taken as facts of life.

The report contains the analysis of international trade analysts of the Commission’s Office of Industries, who routinely monitor trade developments in all natural resource, agricultural, and manufacturing industries. The report is divided into three parts. Part I presents an analysis of U. <b>S.</b> merchandise <b>trade</b> in 10 merchandise sectors and overall economic performance from 2007 to 2008. U. <b>S.</b> merchandise <b>trade</b> performance in 2008 is summarized and compared with such performance in 2007. Coverage of the individual merchandise sectors includes data showing U. S. export, import, and trade balance shifts by sectors, industry/commodity groups (and in some cases subgroups), and shifts in <b>trade</b> with U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> partners. Major shifts in trade are highlighted and examined in greater detail {{in the rest of the}} report. Part I also examines U. <b>S.</b> imports from <b>trade</b> partners eligible for U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> preference programs, most notably imports from beneficiaries of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the Andean Trade Preference Act, the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and the Generalized System of Preferences. Part II examines the shifts in U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> with each of the top five U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> partners - Canada, China, the EU, Japan, and Mexico. Also examined are shifts in trade with Brazil, India, and Russia—U. <b>S.</b> <b>trading</b> partners that are growing in significance.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 1974, Congress mandated creation of a private sector advisory system to ensure that representatives from private business and other groups with a stake in trade policy could provide input as negotiations unfolded. The hope was that such involvement would result in trade agreements that Congress could approve with confidence. The law established a three-tier structure of committees to advise the President on overall U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> policy, general policy area, and technical aspects of trade agreements. Four agencies, led by the Office of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Trade</b> Representative (USTR), currently administer the committee system. According to many negotiators, agency officials, and committee members, the trade policy advisory committee system {{plays an important role}} in U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> policy and has made valuable contributions to U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> agreements. Although GAO's survey of committee members found high levels of satisfaction with many aspects of committee operations and effectiveness, more than a quarter of respondents indicated that the system has not realized its potential to contribute to U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> policy. GAO found that consultations could be more timely and meaningful and that the consultation process needs greater accountability. The structure and composition of the committee system have not been fully updated to reflect changes in the U. S. economy and U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> policy. In general, the system's committee structure is largely the same as it was in 1980, even though the focus of U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> policy has shifted from border taxes toward other complex trade issues, such as protection of intellectual property rights and food safety requirements. Leadership direction and administrative support by USTR and the other managing agencies have not been sufficient to ensure that the advisory committee system works reliably. GAO found that negotiators have used inconsistent approaches to solicit committee member views, with some negotiators not consulting with committees at all. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{introducing}} the powerful, nonparametric time series analysis and forecasting technique of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for trade forecasting via an application which evaluates {{the impact of the}} 2008 recession on U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> forecasting models. This research is felicitous given the magnitude of the structural break visible in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> series following the 2008 economic crisis. Structural breaks resulting from such recessions might affect conclusions from traditional unit root tests and forecasting models which makes use of these tests. As such, it is prudent to evaluate the sensitivity and reliability of parametric, historical trade forecasting models in comparison to the relatively modern, nonparametric models. In doing so, we introduce the SSA technique for trade forecasting and perform exhaustive statistical tests on the data for normality, stationarity and change points, and the forecasting results for statistical significance prior to reaching the well-founded conclusion that SSA is less sensitive to the impact of recessions on U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade,</b> in comparison to an optimized ARIMA model, Exponential Smoothing and Neural Network models. Ergo, we conclude that SSA is able to provide more accurate forecasts for U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> in the face of recessions, and is therefore presented as an apt alternative for U. <b>S.</b> <b>trade</b> forecasting before, during and after a future recession...|$|R
