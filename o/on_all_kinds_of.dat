Early {{in his career}} he took <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> work such as engraving cutlery, making the wood blocks for advertisements, and illustrating children's books. He gradually turned to illustrating, writing and publishing his own books, gaining an adult audience for the fine illustrations in A History of Quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector sights {{have come}} to be used as gun sights <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun sights, anti tank gun sights, and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|E
5|$|With {{his health}} {{improved}} by the tour, Wisden reported that Macaulay was in excellent {{form for the}} whole of the 1923 season. His performances earned him selection as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation praised his stamina, spin and ability to bowl <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> pitches but noted that he was easily discouraged and had a negative attitude if circumstances went against him. He achieved his highest season total of wickets to date, taking 166 at an average of 13.84, and came third in both the Yorkshire and national bowling averages. His best performance came in the first match of the season, when he took seven wickets for 13 against Glamorgan as they were dismissed for 63. Later in the season, he took a hat-trick against Warwickshire while claiming five for 42. With the bat, Macaulay scored 463 runs at an average of 18.52. There were no international matches that season, but Macaulay was selected for The Rest in a Test trial against England in which he took just one wicket.|$|E

25|$|The {{source of}} the data {{discussed}} above is the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), a program managed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) with data provided by state agencies. CFOI is the most comprehensive surveillance system for work-related injury fatalities in the U.S. Multiple data sources are accessed to compile data, including death certificates, OSHA reports, workers’ compensation reports, police reports, and media accounts. Cases are deemed to be work-related upon confirmation by two independent data sources. CFOI combines strong methods for case ascertainment with detailed information on worker demographics and company characteristics. However, because CFOI must capture information <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> occupational fatalities, it provides little detail on circumstances and risk factors specific to MVCs.|$|E

500|$|It {{was noted}} soon after its {{invention}} that the sight {{could be a}} good alternative to iron sights and also had uses in surveying and measuring equipment. The reflector sight was first used on German fighter aircraft in 1918 and widely adopted <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> fighter and bomber aircraft in the 1930s. By World War II the reflector sight was being used on many types of weapons besides aircraft, including anti-aircraft guns, naval guns, anti tank weapons, and many other weapon where the user needed the simplicity and quick target acquisition nature of the sight. Through their development in the 1930s and into World War II the sight was also being referred to in some applications by the abbreviation [...] "reflex sight".|$|E

Matt Thorne noted that while he found Gibson's tendency towards hyper-specificity initially irritating, [...] "there's hypnotic quality to the relentless cataloguing". The author's prose was also extolled by Clay Evans of the Daily Camera, and by Benjamin Lytal in The New York Sun, who declared that [...] "the real news, in Spook Country, is {{that much of the}} flair that Mr. Gibson once brought to descriptions of cyberspace seems to fit perfectly, now, <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> things."

500|$|Jardine, {{who retired}} from regular {{first-class}} cricket after the tour, had little patience with his fast bowlers on the tour. On one occasion, {{when they were}} having difficulty in the heat, Jardine said: [...] "Thank God we have one bowler in the side"—referring to Verity. The two men admired each other greatly. Verity {{was impressed with the}} depth of Jardine's thinking on the game and his intelligence, enjoying tactical discussions with him on the voyage to Australia. According to Alan Hill, Verity did not relish the Bodyline tactics on that tour but supported his captain's stance completely. Verity even named his second son Douglas after Jardine. Jardine considered Verity to be the best slow left-arm bowler of all time, writing: [...] "I venture to doubt whether any other bowler of his type has proved such a master <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> wickets... No captain could have a greater asset on his side than Verity. He would make a great captain himself." [...] Historian David Frith writes that Verity was [...] "probably the cricketer [...] admired above all others", while Bob Wyatt believed the two men were very similar in outlook, temperament and desire to succeed.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{psychologist}} Charles Spearman in 1904 {{made the}} first formal factor analysis of correlations between the tests.

He suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized {{in terms of a}} single general ability factor and a large number of narrow task-specific ability factors. Spearman named it g for [...] "general factor" [...] and labeled the specific factors or abilities for specific tasks s. In any collection of test items that make up an IQ test, the score that best measures g is the composite score that has the highest correlations with all the item scores. Typically, the [...] "g-loaded" [...] composite score of an IQ test battery appears to involve a common strength in abstract reasoning across the test's item content.

[...] An exhorter was a lay person who preached an informal or impromptu sermon, encouraging others toward experiential conversion, often immediately after his own conversion. [...] McGready was especially impressed with recurring instances of child exhorters who sometimes exhibited the falling behavior, only to rise later and expound upon the mysteries of the gospel in words that seemed beyond their years. [...] He reported that “the conduct of young converts, and especially of such as were but children, fastened more convictions at these times than all the preaching." [...] McGready accepted children as young as eight in the sacrament based on their conversion experiences rather than satisfactory answers to questions based on the catechism, one of the usual requirements for participating in communion. [...] McGready repeated throughout his account the universal character of the revivals’ effects <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> people—young and old, male and female, children and slaves.
