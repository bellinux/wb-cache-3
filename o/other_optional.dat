5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. <b>Other</b> <b>optional</b> collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E

25|$|During the Falklands War, the Gazelle {{played a}} {{valuable}} role operating from the flight decks of Royal Navy ships. Under a rapidly performed crash programme {{specifically for the}} Falklands conflict, Gazelles were fitted with 68mm SNEB rocket pods and various <b>other</b> <b>optional</b> equipment such as armour plating, flotation gear and folding blade mechanisms.|$|E

But: [...] (amount of bytes), [...] (get rid of excess kilograms).|$|R
40|$|The {{translation}} of poetry {{is not a}} mere semantic transfer from one language to another because the poetic text {{is a collection of}} codes whose intersection in various ways and proportions has as a result its specific profile and, consequently, its originality. Our approach presents the main codes which can govern poetry, some of them being compulsory, the <b>others</b> <b>optional.</b> The evaluation of performance in translating poetry is strictly subjective because of the absence of adequate criteria...|$|R
25|$|Various tools enable and {{optimize}} fly tying. Skip Morris, {{a professional}} fly tyer, lists the essential tools {{as being a}} vise to hold the hook of the fly to be tied, bobbins, a magnifying glass for delicate work, hackle pliers, hackle gauges, lights, hair stackers, and scissors. <b>Other</b> <b>optional</b> tools are pliers, toothpicks, bodkins, dubbing twisters, blenders, floss bobbins, whip finishers, wing burners and bobbin threaders.|$|E
25|$|In New York State, a town is {{the major}} {{subdivision}} of each county. Towns provide or arrange for most municipal services for residents of hamlets and selected services for residents of villages. All residents of New York who {{do not live in}} a city or on an Indian reservation live in a town. A village is an incorporated area which is usually, but not always, within a single town. A village is a clearly defined municipality that provides the services closest to the residents, such as garbage collection, street and highway maintenance, street lighting and building codes. Some villages provide their own police and <b>other</b> <b>optional</b> services. A hamlet is an informally-defined populated area within a town that is not part of a village.|$|E
25|$|In many LCAs, {{characterization}} concludes the LCIA analysis; this is {{also the}} last compulsory stage according to ISO 14044:2006. However, in addition to the above mandatory LCIA steps, <b>other</b> <b>optional</b> LCIA elements – normalization, grouping, and weighting – may be conducted depending on the goal and scope of the LCA study. In normalization, the results of the impact categories from the study are usually compared with the total impacts in the region of interest, the U.S. for example. Grouping consists of sorting and possibly ranking the impact categories. During weighting, the different environmental impacts are weighted relative to each other so that they can then be summed to get a single number for the total environmental impact. ISO 14044:2006 generally advises against weighting, stating that “weighting, shall not be used in LCA studies intended to be used in comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public”. This advice is often ignored, resulting in comparisons that can reflect a high degree of subjectivity as a result of weighting.|$|E
5000|$|He concludes, [...] "Some {{of these}} {{constraints}} {{seem to me}} binding, <b>others</b> <b>optional.</b> Constraints 9-12 are essential for {{the very existence of}} stability conditions. Constraints 13-17, on the other hand, can be variously jettisoned." [...] Examples given are South Indian music, which doesn't modulate and isn't equally tempered (13 & 14), and music such as that of Claude Debussy, Béla Bartók, and others who [...] "have developed consonance-dissonance patterns directly from the total chromatic" [...] (14-17).|$|R

25|$|In 1998, {{the newly}} {{introduced}} convertible {{version of the}} C5 was chosen to pace the Indianapolis 500 race, and a Pace Car Replica (RPO Z4Z) was offered to the public. Aside from lacking the equipment necessary for actual pace car duties (light bar, special racing harnesses, etc.), there was little difference between the Pace Car Replica C5 and the vehicle that actually saw duty during the race. The Pace Car Replica package consisted of a special paint color ("Radar Blue"), unique interior colors (black and yellow), painted yellow wheels, and special pace car decals. The Pace Car Replica package also included <b>other</b> <b>optional</b> equipment: the newly introduced Active Handling System (RPO JL4); an electronically tuned AM/FM radio with CD player and a Bose speaker system; an electronic dual-zone heating & air conditioning system; and leather adjustable sport bucket seats. While regarded {{by many as the}} most garish Corvette appearance package offered to date, the 1998 Pace Car Replicas nevertheless enjoy a strong and loyal following of owners and collectors.|$|E
25|$|JPEG uses a lossy form of {{compression}} {{based on}} the discrete cosine transform (DCT). This mathematical operation converts each frame/field of the video source from the spatial (2D) domain into the frequency domain (a.k.a. transform domain). A perceptual model based loosely on the human psychovisual system discards high-frequency information, i.e. sharp transitions in intensity, and color hue. In the transform domain, the process of reducing information is called quantization. In simpler terms, quantization is a method for optimally reducing a large number scale (with different occurrences of each number) into a smaller one, and the transform-domain is a convenient representation of the image because the high-frequency coefficients, which contribute less to the overall picture than other coefficients, are characteristically small-values with high compressibility. The quantized coefficients are then sequenced and losslessly packed into the output bitstream. Nearly all software implementations of JPEG permit user control over the compression-ratio (as well as <b>other</b> <b>optional</b> parameters), allowing the user to trade off picture-quality for smaller file size. In embedded applications (such as miniDV, which uses a similar DCT-compression scheme), the parameters are pre-selected and fixed for the application.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation RX comes {{standard}} with a twin-chamber {{front passenger}} airbags, side torso airbags {{for the front}} row, side curtain airbags for front and rear rows, and knee airbags for the front row. Active headrests become standard to help reduce whiplash injuries. Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Hill Assist Control (HAC) which helps prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards on inclines are standard while a more advanced Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system is optional. VDIM {{is designed to be}} more subtle and less intrusive in performance than VSC alone, VDIM can also engage prior to an actual skid taking place acting as a preventative measure. The Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) remains optional, while a new bi-xenon optional Intelligent Highbeam feature is added, this system can dim the high-beams automatically whenever traffic is detected. <b>Other</b> <b>optional</b> safety features include a Pre-Collision System (PCS) and a Head-up Display (HUD) which helps the driver keep attention on the road ahead by displaying navigation, speed, and audio information on the windshield; the HUD uses high-intensity LEDs displaying high contrast white figures on the windshield allowing it to be read in direct sunlight. The optional navigation system offers a backup camera and a Wide-View Side Monitor utilizes a camera on the passenger side view mirror to help eliminate blind spots on the passenger side at low speeds, this system does not include the 180° wide-angle front camera found in the LX 570. To further help improve visibility, water-repellent glass is used on the front doors.|$|E

2500|$|The general {{agent for}} Honda in Norway {{required}} all Preludes for the Norwegian market {{to have the}} ALB-system as a standard feature, making Honda Prelude {{to be the first}} car delivered in Europe with ABS as a standard feature. The Norwegian general agent also included sun roof and other options to be standard equipment in Norway, adding more luxury to the Honda brand. However, the Norwegian tax system made the well-equipped car very expensive, and the sales suffered from high cost. From 1984 the ALB-system, as well as the <b>other</b> <b>optional</b> features from Honda, was no longer a standard feature in Norway.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Other,</b> <b>optional</b> {{gameplay}} modes {{include a}} training mode for learning each character’s moves; an arcade mode, where the player fights {{through a series}} of chosen opponents; a multiplayer Skirmish mode; and a token minigame, which plays like {{a modified version of the}} card game War. [...] Initially, only five characters (Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, and The Masked Fighter) are playable in these modes. However, as the player advances through the story mode, other characters are added to playable roster, alternate costumes are made available, more tokens can be used in the token game, and two extra modes (Survival and Dark Tournament Plus) are unlocked.|$|E
2500|$|Durum wheat {{semolina}} or flour, common farina or flour, or {{combination of}} both is mixed with water and eggs (for egg noodles) and <b>other</b> <b>optional</b> ingredients (like spinach, tomato, herbs and etc.). [...] Usually 25-30 kg of water is added per 100 kg of semolina. The amounts are measured by computerized dispensers. The mixture is then kneaded by auger extruder equipped with mixing paddles and kneading blades to obtain a homogeneous mass, and after that is extruded through various shaped dies. Drying process begins immediately after the products are shaped to prevent deformation and sticking. The pastas are dried completely in drying chambers and stabilized, then ready for packaging. In modern factories, dry pasta is processed using automatic continuous lines.|$|E
50|$|A raga is {{a central}} concept of Indian music, {{predominant}} in its expression. According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of raga cannot be offered {{in one or two}} sentences. Raga may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, {{in a manner similar to}} how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression. In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in <b>others</b> <b>optional.</b> The raga allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.|$|R
50|$|The FIX {{protocol}} also defines sets {{of fields}} {{that make a}} particular message; within the set of fields, some will be mandatory and <b>others</b> <b>optional.</b> The ordering of fields within the message is generally unimportant, however repeating groups are preceded by a count and encrypted fields are preceded by their length. The message is broken into three distinct sections: the head, body and tail. Fields must remain within the correct section and within each section the position may be important as fields can act as delimiters that stop one message from running into the next. The final field in any FIX message is tag 10 (checksum).|$|R
5000|$|In Russian, {{the form}} of noun {{following}} the numeral is nominative singular if the numeral ends in [...] "one", genitive singular if the numeral ends in [...] "two" [...] to [...] "four", and genitive plural otherwise. As an exception, {{the form of}} noun is also genitive plural if the numeral ends in 11 to 14. Also, some words (for example, many measure words, such as units) have a special [...] "count form" [...] (счётная форма) for use in numerical phrases instead of genitive (for some words mandatory, for <b>others</b> <b>optional),</b> for example, восемь мегабайт, пять килограмм and пять килограммов, три ряда́ and три ря́да, and полтора часа́.|$|R
2500|$|Springfield Armory, Inc. of Geneseo, Ill., {{produces}} a semi-automatic-only {{version of the}} M14 rifle. [...] The standard rifle {{is known as the}} M1A. [...] The company produces several variations of the basic rifle with different stocks, barrel weights, barrel lengths, and <b>other</b> <b>optional</b> features.

2500|$|Taki's {{height is}} [...] and weighs [...] (later [...] ); {{at the height}} of 5'7, she has been the tallest female {{character}} in the first game until Ivy Valentine's appearance in Soulcalibur. Her original weapon in Soul Edge is a ninjatō, called Rekkimaru (Rekki-Maru), which she made by infusing it with mystical powers. This is her preferred weapon {{and is one of the}} few original weapons that have not been replaced in subsequent games. Her secondary weapon, the kodachi Mekkimaru (Mekki-Maru), formerly property of Yoshimitsu's deceased clan, was added for her dual-wielding style in Soulcalibur as the lower blade on her back. (Though Taki can use only a single weapon in Soul Edge, Mekkimaru was also featured in this game but as an unlockable alternative weapon; her <b>other</b> <b>optional</b> weapons include a jutte, a kunai, a tantō and a bladed iron fan.) Taki's outfits are generally supposed to give emphasis on ease of movement due to her fighting style's emphasis on high leaping, tumbling and rolling.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, the GTO reverted from a {{separate}} model line to a US$353.88 option {{package for the}} Le Mans and Le Mans Sport coupes. On the base Le Mans line, the GTO package could be had with either the low-priced pillared coupe or hardtop coupe. Both models came standard with cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and rubber floor mats on the pillared coupe and carpeting on the hardtop, creating a lower-priced GTO. The Le Mans Sport, offered only as a hardtop coupe, came with Strato bucket seats upholstered in vinyl, along with carpeting on floor and lower door panels, vinyl door-pull straps, custom pedal trim and cushioned steering wheel, much like GTOs of previous years. <b>Other</b> <b>optional</b> equipment was similar to 1971 and earlier models. Planned for 1972 as a GTO option was the ducktail rear spoiler from the Pontiac Firebird, {{but after a few}} cars were built with that option, the mold used to produce the spoiler broke, and it was cancelled. Rally II and honeycomb wheels were optional on all GTOs, with the honeycombs now featuring red Pontiac arrowhead emblems on the center caps, while the Rally IIs continued with the same caps as before, with the letters [...] "PMD" [...] (for Pontiac Motor Division).|$|E
