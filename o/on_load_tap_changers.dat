Besides voltage regulators (VRs), such as transformers with <b>On</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Tap</b> <b>Changers</b> (OLTCs), distributed generators can provide a certain voltage support by means of reactive power control (RPC).

40|$|Abstract- The on-load tap {{changing}} (OLTC) {{regulators have}} been widely used since the introduction of electrical energy. They ensure a good regulation of the output voltage in presence of large variations of the input voltage with typical response time from several mili-seconds to several seconds. Earlier mechanical type of <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changers</b> were into practice. But they had considerable limitations and drawbacks like arcing, high maintenance, service costs and slow reaction times. In order to overcome these limitations and drawbacks electronic (or solid-state) tap-changers were developed. The continuous growth of power semiconductor devices, such as the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), triac, thyristor, has allowed the development of quick operating OLTC regulators which is also helpful in fixing other problems in the ac mains, like flicker and sags. The major idea in the solid-state-assisted tap changer is that solid-state switches with more controllability, operates during the tap-changing process instead of mechanical switches which helps in reducing the arcing phenomena during the tap-changing process. In this paper implementation of a fast OLTC regulator is presented. The control strategy is Microcontroller-based, ensuring flexibility in programming the control algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the fast OLTC is able to correct several disturbances of the ac mains besides, the long duration in variation in time is much lower than the one corresponding to the traditional regulators...|$|E
40|$|Automatic tap {{changing}} transformers {{have been}} in service {{for a number of}} decades. Their performance has been exceptional; however, with deregulation now on the horizon, the frequency and scope of maintenance of these devices has become an issue of concern. Maintenance is certainly important to the proper operation and reliability of tap changing transformers, but time-based maintenance is costly and can erode profitability of a company if unnecessary maintenance is routinely performed on any device. Operations counter-based maintenance is an improved approach but cumulative operations are not always a reliable trigger of need for maintenance.

40|$|The {{objective}} of an Energy Control Center (ECC) {{is to ensure}} secure and economic operation of power system. The challenge to optimize power system operation, while maintaining system security and quality of power supply to customers, is increasing. Growing demand without matching expansion of generation and transmission facilities and more tightly interconnected power systems contribute to the increased complexity of system operation. Rising costs due to inflation and increased environmental concerns has made transmission, as well as generation systems to be operated closure to design limits, with smaller safety margins and hence greater exposure to unsatisfactory operating conditions following a disturbance. Investigations of recent blackouts indicate that {{the root cause of}} most of these major power system disturbances is voltage collapse. Information gathered and preliminary analysis, from the most recent blackout incident in North America on 14 th August 2003, is pointing the finger on voltage instability due to some unexpected contingency. In this incident, reports indicate that approximately 50 million people were affected interruption from continuous supply for more than 15 hours. Most of the incidents are related to heavily stressed system where large amounts of real and reactive power are transported over long transmission lines while appropriate real and reactive power resources are not available to maintain normal system conditions. Hence, the problem of voltage stability and voltage collapse has become a major concern in power system planning and operation. Reliable operation of large scale electric power networks requires that system voltages and currents stay within design limits. Operation beyond those limits can lead to equipment failures and blackouts. In the last few decades, the problem of reactive power control for improving economy and security of power system operation has received much attention. Generally, the load bus voltages can be maintained within their permissible limits by reallocating reactive power generations in the system. This can be achieved by adjusting transformer taps, generator voltages, and switchable Ar sources. In addition, the system losses can be minimized via redistribution of reactive power in the system. Therefore, the problem of the reactive power dispatch can be optimized to improve the voltage profile and minimize the system losses as well. The Instability in power system could be relieved or at least minimized with the help of most recent developed devices called Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controllers. The use of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controllers in power transmission system have led to many applications of these controllers not only to improve the stability of the existing power network resources but also provide operating flexibility to the power system. In the past, transmission systems were owned by regulated, vertically integrated utility companies. They have been designed and operated so that conditions in close proximity to security boundaries are not frequently encountered. However, in the new open access environment, operating conditions tend to be much closer to security boundaries, as transmission use is increasing in sudden and unpredictable directions. Transmission unbundling, coupled with other regulatory requirements, has made new transmission facility construction more difficult. In fact, there are numerous technical challenges emerging from the new market structure. There is an acute need for research work in the new market structure, especially in the areas of voltage security, reactive power support and congestion management. In the last few decades more attention was paid to optimal reactive power dispatch. Since the problem of reactive power optimization is non-linear in nature, nonlinear programming methods have been used to solve it. These methods work quite well for small power systems but may develop convergence problems as system size increases. Linear programming techniques with iterative schemes are certainly the most promising tools for solving these types of problems. The thesis presents efficient algorithms with different objectives for reactive power optimization. The approach adopted is an iterative scheme with successive power-flow analysis using decoupled technique, formulation and solution of the linear-programmingproblem with only upper-bound limits on the state variables. Further the thesispresents critical analysis of the three following objectives, Viz., •Minimization of the sum of the squares of the voltage deviations (Vdesired) •Minimization of sum of the squares of the voltage stability L indices (Vstability) •Minimization of real power losses (Ploss) Voltage stability problems normally occur in heavily stressed systems. While the disturbance leading to voltage collapse may be initiated by a variety of causes, the underlying problem is an inherent weakness in the power system. The factors contributing to voltage collapse are the generator reactive power /voltage control limits, load characteristics, characteristics of reactive compensation devices, and the action of the voltage control devices such as transformer <b>On</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Tap</b> <b>Changers</b> (OLTCs). Power system experiences abnormal operating conditions following a disturbance, and subsequently a reduction in the EHV level voltages at load centers will be reflected on the distribution system. The OLTCs of distribution transformers would restore distribution voltages. With each tap change operation, the MW and MVAR loading on the EHV lines would increase, thereby causing great voltage drops in EHV levels and increasing the losses. As a result, with each tap changing operation, the reactive output of generators throughout the system would increase gradually and the generators may hit their reactive power capability limits, causing voltage instability problems. Thus, the operation of certain OLTCs has a significant influence on voltage instability under some operating conditions. These transformers can be made manual to avoid possible voltage instability due to their operation during heavy load conditions. Tap blocking, based on local measurement of high voltage side of load tap changers, is a common practice of power utilities to prevent voltage collapse. The great advantage of this method is that it can be easily implemented, but does not guarantee voltage stability. So a proper approach for identification of critical OLTC s based on voltage stability criteria is essential to guide the operator in ECC, which has been proposed in this thesis. It discusses the effect of OLTCs with different objectives of reactive power dispatch and proposes a technique to identify critical OLTCs based on voltage stability criteria. The fast development of power electronics based on new and powerful semiconductor devices has led to innovative technologies, such as High Voltage DC transmission (HVDC) and Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS), which can be applied in transmission and distribution systems. The technical and economicalBenefits of these technologies represent an alternative to the application in AC systems. Deregulation in the power industry and opening of the market for delivery of cheaper energy to the customers is creating additional requirements for the operation of power systems. HVDC and FACTS offer major advantages in meeting these requirements.. A method for co-ordinated optimum allocation of reactive power in AC/DC power systems by including FACTS controller UPFC, with an {{objective of}} minimization of the sum of the squares of the voltage deviations of all the load buses has been proposed in this thesis. The study results show that under contingency conditions, the presence of FACTS controllers has considerable impact on over all system voltage stability and also on power loss minimization. minimization of the sum of the squares of the voltage deviations of all the load buses has been proposed in this thesis. The study results show that under contingency conditions, the presence of FACTS controllers has considerable impact on over all system voltage stability and also on power loss minimization. As power systems grow in their size and interconnections, their complexity increases. For secure operation and control of power systems under normal and contingency conditions, it is essential to provide solutions in real time to the operator in ECC. For real time control of power systems, the conventional algorithmic software available in ECC are found to be inadequate as they are computationally very intensive and not organized to guide the operator during contingency conditions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as, Expert systems, Neural Networks, Fuzzy systems are emerging decision support system tools which give fast, though approximate, but acceptable right solutions in real time as they mostly use symbolic processing with a minimum number of numeric computations. The solution thus obtained {{can be used as a}} guide by the operator in ECC for power system control. Optimum real and reactive power dispatch play an important role in the day-to-day operation of power systems. Existing conventional Optimal Power Flow (OPF) methods use all of the controls in solving the optimization problem. The operators can not move so many control devices within a reasonable time. In this context an algorithm using fuzzy-expert approach has been proposed in this thesis to curtail the number of control actions, in order to realize real time objectives in voltage/reactive power control. The technique is formulated using membership functions of linguistic variables such as voltage deviations at all the load buses and the voltage deviation sensitivity to control variables. Voltage deviations and controlling variables are translated into fuzzy set notations to formulate the relation between voltage deviations and controlling ability of controlling devices. Control variables considered are switchable VAR compensators, OLTC transformers and generator excitations. A fuzzy rule based system is formed to select the critical controllers, their movement direction and step size. Results show that the proposed approach is effective for improving voltage security to acceptable levels with fewer numbers of controllers. So, under emergency conditions the operator need not move all the controllers to different settings and the solution obtained is fast with significant speedups. Hence, the proposed method has the potential to be integrated for on-line implementation in energy management systems to achieve the goals of secure power system operation. In a deregulated electricity market, it may not be always possible to dispatch all of the contracted power transactions due to congestion of the transmission corridors. System operators try to manage congestion, which otherwise increases the cost of the electricity and also threatens the system security and stability. An approach for alleviation of network over loads in the day-to-day operation of power systems under deregulated environment is presented in this thesis. The control used for overload alleviation is real power generation rescheduling based on Relative Electrical Distance (RED) concept. The method estimates the relative location of load nodes with respect to the generator nodes. The contribution of each generator for a particular over loaded line is first identified, then based on RED concept the desired proportions of generations for the desired overload relieving is obtained, so that the system will have minimum transmission losses and more stability margins with respect to voltage profiles, bus angles and better transmission tariff. The results obtained reveal that the proposed method is not only effective for overload relieving but also reduces the system power loss and improves the voltage stability margin. The presented concepts are better suited for finding the utilization of resources generation/load and network by various players involved in the day-to-day operation of the system under normal and contingency conditions. This will help in finding the contribution by various players involved in the congestion management and the deviations can be used for proper tariff purposes. Suitable computer programs have been developed based on the algorithms presented in various chapters and thoroughly tested. Studies have been carried out on various equivalent systems of practical real life Indian power networks and also on some standard IEEE systems under simulated conditions.

The traditional voltage control method, localised volt/var control and IVVC methods are tested on a modified IEEE 13 node test feeder over a 24 -hour period. The results obtained using these methods are compared with each other in order to validate the effectiveness of using IVVC in the network. The results obtained demonstrate that IVVC is able to improve the overall voltage profile of the test feeder, reduce the total number of tap operations performed by the <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> at the zone substation while reducing active power losses...|$|R
40|$|Active {{management}} {{strategies such as}} coordinated <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> (OLTC) voltage control and reactive power compensation (RPC) are frequently suggested for voltage regulation in a distribution system {{with a high level}} of distributed generation (DG). This paper proposes a control and coordination algorithm for these two active {{management strategies}}. Voltage control through OLTC is achieved by using state estimation (SE) to determine the voltage in the network. To lower the implementation cost of the proposed control strategy, pseudo-measurements are used together with real-time measurement data in the SE. Moreover, the deadband of the automatic voltage control (AVC) relay is relaxed so that the AVC relay acts on the network's maximum or minimum voltage obtained through the SE. This is found to be simpler to realize than adjusting the set point of the AVC relay. Voltage control through RPC is actualized by using integral controllers implemented locally at the wind turbine site. Furthermore, RPC from the local wind turbine is also used to mitigate an overvoltage at a remote bus on the same feeder when the remote wind turbine reaches its regulation limit. The applicability of the proposed voltage regulation algorithm is successfully demonstrated using a case study syste...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{selection of}} optimal locations and sizes of voltage regulators in radial distribution system using Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm (PGSA). Voltage {{has always been}} considered {{as an integral part}} of the power system response. There are several factors, which contribute to voltage collapse such as increased <b>loading</b> <b>on</b> distribution feeders, reactive power constraints, <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> dynamics and <b>load</b> characteristics. The proposed method for voltage regulator placement is suitable for large radial distribution network. The VR problem consists of two sub problems, that of optimal placement and optimal choice of tap setting. The proposed method deals with initial selection of voltage regulator buses by using power loss indices (PLI). The candidate node identification technique and Plant Growth Simulation Algorithm (PGSA) are used for optimal location and number along with tap setting of the voltage regulators that maintain a smooth voltage profile throughout the network. The aim of this paper is to obtain optimal voltage control with voltage regulators and then to decrease the total cost and losses, to obtain the maximum net savings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated with 33 bus and 69 bus radial distribution systems and these results are compared with Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Since {{regulating}} transformers {{have proved}} to be ef-ficient in controlling the power flow and regulating the voltage, they are more and more widely used in today’s environment of en-ergy production, transmission and distribution. This changing en-vironment challenges protection engineers as well to improve the sensitivity of protection, so that low-current faults could be de-tected (like turn-to-turn short circuits in transformer windings) and a warning message could be given. Moreover, the idea of an adaptive protection that adjusts the operating characteristics of the relay system in response to changing system conditions has became much more promising. It improves the protection sensitivity and simplifies its conception. This paper presents an adaptive adjust-ment concept in relation to the position change of the <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> for universal differential protection of regulating trans-formers; such a concept provides a sensitive and cost-efficient pro-tection for regulating transformers. Various simulations are car-ried out with the Electro-Magnetic Transients Program/Alterna-tive Transients Program. The simulation results indicate the func-tional efficiency of the proposed concept under different fault con-ditions; the protection is sensitive to low level intern faults. The paper concludes by describing the software implementation of the algorithm on a test system based on a digital signal processor.

40|$|AbstractA medium-voltage AC {{network with}} {{distributed}} generation and storage devices is considered for which set points are assigned in each time {{period of a}} given time horizon. A set point in a time period is defined by modules and phases of voltages in all nodes, active and reactive powers, <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> and variable <b>loads.</b> When some parameters vary, in order to restore feasibility new set points need to be determined so as to minimize the variations {{with respect to the}} initial ones. This can be done by minimizing distributor's redispatching costs, which are modeled by means of binary variables, while satisfying service security requirements and ensuring service quality, which are represented by nonlinear constraints, such as the nodal balance of active and reactive power and the current transits on lines and transformers for security. Storage devices are modeled by means of constraints that relate adjacent time periods. A two-step solution procedure is proposed, which is based on decoupling active and reactive variables: in the first step a MILP model determines the active power production and the use of storage devices that minimize redispatching costs over all time periods in the time horizon; in the second step, given the optimal active power production computed in the first step, reactive variables in each time period are computed by solving a nonlinear programming model...|$|R
40|$|Voltage {{regulation}} {{is a crucial}} practice in distribution networks {{to ensure that the}} steady state voltage levels at customer connection points are within prescribed limits. In addition to ensuring required voltage levels, within a range of power quality problems, voltage unbalance is an important factor that determines the quality of supply. With regard to voltage regulation, one of the common methods employed by distribution network service providers is volt/var control. This method regulates the voltage of a network by controlling the voltage at the zone substation and by the injection or absorption of reactive power at different locations in the network. Typically, volt/var control is employed in medium voltage networks only, which overlooks the growth of distributed generation in low voltage networks. The increasing penetration of distributed generation may change the paradigm of voltage regulation to the extent that traditional volt/var control may not be effective. However, the effects of this increasing penetration can be countered by exploiting the versatility of distributed generation devices. This paper proposes a holistic volt/var control approach which takes into account voltage regulation in both medium and low voltage networks and voltage unbalance reduction in a low voltage network. The proposed control method utilises an <b>on</b> <b>load</b> <b>tap</b> <b>changer</b> and a fixed capacitor bank in the medium voltage network and also photovoltaic inverters in the low voltage network. The proposed control is tested on a modified IEEE 13 node test feeder over a 24 -hour period over which the load varies. The results demonstrated that the proposed control method is able to perform voltage regulation and voltage unbalance reduction concurrently...|$|R
