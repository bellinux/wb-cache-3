5|$|Around 1825, Hinde {{settled in}} Mount Carmel, leaving the Methodist circuit to focus <b>on</b> <b>religious</b> and {{historical}} writing, and business. He founded {{one of the}} first churches in the town and occasionally held Methodist gatherings at his home. On September 20, 1827 more than 27 Methodist ministers met in the upper room of his house. It was one of the largest gatherings of the time.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hinde opposed slavery. Although their parents owned slaves, {{he and his}} {{siblings}} repudiated slavery <b>on</b> <b>religious</b> grounds. Hinde's opposition increased and eventually he and other friends became outspoken critics of the institution in Kentucky, where slavery was commonplace {{in the middle and}} western parts of the state. In the Great Awakening, Methodists were prominent among those who opposed slavery, although they also converted slaves and welcomed them into congregations. In Kentucky Hinde joined other Methodist ministers in the abolitionist movement.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University hosts notable {{speakers}} each year, {{largely because}} {{of the success of the}} Georgetown Lecture Fund and the Office of Communications. These are frequently important heads of state who visit Georgetown while in the capital, as well as scholars, authors, U.S. politicians, and religious leaders. Many prominent alumni are known to frequent the main campus. The Office of the President hosts numerous symposia <b>on</b> <b>religious</b> topics, such as Nostra aetate, Pacem in terris, and the Building Bridges Seminar.|$|E
5|$|In Strasbourg, Bucer {{joined a}} team of notable reformers: Zell, who took {{the role of the}} preacher to the masses; Wolfgang Capito, the most {{influential}} theologian in the city; and Caspar Hedio, the cathedral preacher. One of Bucer's first actions in the cause of reform was to debate with Thomas Murner, a monk who had attacked Luther in satires. While the city council vacillated <b>on</b> <b>religious</b> issues, the number of people supporting the Reformation and hostile towards the traditional clergy had grown.|$|E

Students were taught general subjects, including mathematics and geography but were not tested on these subjects; the only exams were <b>on</b> <b>religious</b> subjects.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Darwis (Ihsan Tarore) is a {{youth in}} 19th-century Kauman, Yogyakarta, {{and the son}} of Kyai Abubakar, the imam of the area's mosque.

While there, he studies what he considers the true form of Islam over a period of five years.|$|E
5|$|Polyptychs were {{produced}} by the more accomplished masters.

The Ghent Altarpiece, completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the occupation, {{the most}} recent Yugoslav census had been taken in 1931. This census used {{language}} as the primary criterion, and counted all speakers of Serbo-Croatian as one group, rather than recognising distinct Serb, Croat, Bosnian Muslim, Macedonian and Montenegrin nationalities. Aligning data <b>on</b> <b>religious</b> affiliation with the linguistic data {{has been used by}} scholars to determine approximate numbers of Serbs and Croats in the 1931 census, by counting those of the Roman Catholic denomination as Croats.|$|E
5|$|Sunday never {{attended}} seminary {{and made}} no pretense of being a theologian or an intellectual, {{but he had a}} thorough knowledge of the Bible and was well read <b>on</b> <b>religious</b> and social issues of his day. His surviving Winona Lake library of six hundred books gives evidence of heavy use, including underscoring and reader's notes in his characteristic all-caps printing. Some of Sunday's books were even those of religious opponents. He was later charged with plagiarizing a Decoration Day speech given by the noted agnostic Robert Ingersoll.|$|E
