500|$|Boortz is a {{self-described}} libertarian. He advocates a complete {{overhaul of the}} U.S. tax system {{and the release of}} all non-violent drug offenders who are currently in prison. He has supported Republican candidates and Republican tax policy, though he occasionally clashes with Republicans on social issues. Others describe his political views as being more in line with [...] "republitarian" [...] philosophy that embraces incrementalism domestically, and a generally interventionist foreign policy based on self-interest, national defense and the expansion of freedom. Boortz disagrees with the Libertarian Party platform on several key issues including his firm support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> incremental tax reform, and his opposition to the unrestricted immigration policy advocated by the Libertarian Party.|$|E

500|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Bob Barr, former Congressman of Georgia began on May 12, 2008.

Barr won the party's nomination after six rounds of balloting at the 2008 Libertarian Party National Convention. Former contender Wayne Allyn Root was named as his running mate.

He also attended party fundraisers and met with activists during his three-day stay. While in Des Moines, Bayh stated that Democrats must gain credibility on national security, and commented that he would begin a full-fledged presidential campaign if {{he felt he had}} the means to win the Democratic nomination. Throughout the month, he visited Iowa and reflected similar rhetoric to the 2004 Kerry campaign, advocating energy independence, fair trade, lowering the federal deficit and an improved handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> He explained to reporters that his visits to Iowa were [...] "the beginning of a longer conversation".|$|E

Tony Blair received criticism from a number of commentators for his appearance in the episode due to the fact that he recorded his part at the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Sunday Telegraph journalist Jack Roberts noted that it was [...] "not [...] finest hour". On the other hand, Simon Crerar of The Times named Blair's appearance as one of the 33 best guest appearances in the show's history, and the BBC classified his appearance as a [...] "PR masterstroke".

500|$|Meanwhile, McCain {{continued}} {{questioning the}} progress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: [...] "Things {{have not gone}} {{as well as we}} had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers." [...] In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: [...] "We [...] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be." [...] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007. The strategy's opponents labeled it [...] "McCain's plan" [...] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, [...] "McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now." [...] The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, [...] "I would much rather lose a campaign than a war." [...] In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{expressed}} dismay at the then-upcoming presidential election.

Summing up his feelings {{in an interview at}} the time, he said, [...] "This war that's going on in Iraq [...] basically to build a pipeline and put up a fucking Wal-Mart." [...] Armstrong felt a duty to keep his sons away from violent images, including video games and news coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and the 9/11 attacks. Armstrong noted divisions between America's [...] "television culture" [...] (which he said only cared about cable news) versus the world's view of America, which could be considered as careless warmongers. Dirnt felt similarly, especially so after viewing the 2004 documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. [...] "You don't have to analyze every bit of information in order to know that something's not fucking right, and it's time to make a change." [...] Cool hoped the record would influence young people to vote Bush out, or, as he put it, [...] "make the world a little more sane." [...] He had previously felt that it was not his place to [...] "preach" [...] to kids, but felt there was so much [...] "on the line" [...] in the 2004 election that he must.|$|E
