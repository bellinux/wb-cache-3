Productive gold deposits are confined to those primary lodes, permeable to supergene solution movement, which intersected the Upper Cretaceous weathering surface. The Ordovician sediments hosting the <b>ore-bodies</b> are only weathered to depth along deformation zones, and primary ore values appear to be enriched to workable grades by supergene processes...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in using remote elastostatic deformations {{to identify the}} evolving geometry of underground fractures that are forced to propagate by the injection of high pressure viscous fluids. These so-called hydraulic fractures are used to increase the permeability in oil and gas reservoirs {{as well as to}} pre-fracture <b>ore-bodies</b> for enhanced mineral extraction. The undesirable intrusion of these hydraulic fractures into environmentally sensitive areas or into regions in mines which might pose safety hazards has stimulated the search for techniques to enable the evolving hydraulic fracture geometries to be monitored. Previous approaches to this problem have involved the inversion of the elastostatic data at isolated time steps in the time series provided by tiltmeter measurements of the displacement gradient field at selected points in the elastic medium. At each time step, parameters in simple static models of the fracture (e. g. a single displacement discontinuity) are identified. The approach adopted in this paper is not to regard the sequence of sample...|$|R
40|$|Some of the {{relationships}} that might be used in determining whether the ores are syngenetic or epigenetic are discussed. Some experiments were run to {{determine the amount of}} comminution of silicate rocks and sulfide ores in a stream environment. The possible equations that might produce covellite, chalcopyrite and bornite are cited. IN any classification of ore deposits there are compartments for those <b>ore-bodies</b> that are syngenetic and supergene and there are quite distinct com-partments for deposits that are epigenetic and either supergene or hypogene. To have these distinctions on paper is one thing, but to place a deposit in the field in its proper category is another. A perusal of recent papers on the origin of the copper ores of Northern Rhodesia, or to go back even further to the various theories that have been advanced for the origin of the Clinton iron ores or for the gold on the Wit-watersrand, shows the difficulty of placing these deposits in their prope...|$|R
