5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% <b>of</b> <b>hospitals</b> suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number <b>of</b> <b>hospitals</b> who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E
