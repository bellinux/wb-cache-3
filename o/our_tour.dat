25|$|The opening Test at Brisbane has {{a history}} of having {{important}} psychological effects on the teams. The four England teams before ours had all lost there. Even Len Hutton's eventually victorious side went down there by an innings. We drew the match and I believe this was the turning point of <b>our</b> <b>tour.</b> Nobody expected us to come out of it with our pride intact.|$|E
25|$|My {{attention}} has been directed to a letter signed W.S. in the Field of July 24th, enclosing a clipping from the Philadelphia Public Ledger, severely criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during <b>our</b> <b>tour</b> through England. I wish to state {{on behalf of the}} Philadelphia team that the sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we emphatically repudiate any insinuation of unfair treatment. On the contrary, we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness {{both on and off the}} field. I wish to take this opportunity of making a public acknowledgement of our indebtedness to Mr. Perkins, of the M.C.C., for the umpires assigned to us, and to testify, unnecessary though it be, to their ability and integrity.|$|E
500|$|Lovering {{appeared}} in the 2006 documentary loudQUIETloud, which covered the Pixies' 2004 reunion tour. His father died midway during the tour, and Lovering began drinking heavily as a result. According to Thompson, Lovering [...] "messed {{up a couple of}} songs" [...] during a number of live shows. [...] "It was all caught on film", said Thompson, [...] "but they re-edited this to look like it happened in the middle of <b>our</b> <b>tour</b> and it looked like this whole tour careened into this drunken stupor with David. It really wasn't like that at all". He toured with the Pixies throughout 2005 and 2006, while performing at the Magic Castle on Friday nights with The Unholy Three. In 2007, Lovering played a benefit concert for Wally Ingram as part of The Martinis. Later that year, he formed a new band called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with Los Angeles musicians Amit Itelman and Oscar Rey.|$|E

500|$|As Field reported, The Wiggles Pty Ltd was [...] "not {{your regular}} 'corporate culture'." [...] The four {{original}} members made decisions by consensus and would {{spend more time}} on creative decisions than on business ones. [...] Field reported that many of their key products were launched [...] "during a brief pause in an Xbox game on <b>our</b> <b>tour</b> bus". They answered to no one but themselves, with no executive board or shareholders. [...] As Field stated, they made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education, [...] "rather than elaborate, long-term business and strategic plans". [...] When they ventured into international markets, first to the U.S. and the UK in 1998, they chose to follow the same practices that were successful in Australia by keeping their stage show simple: inexpensive props and effects, and the four original members, along with their characters, singing and dancing for their audiences. [...] Financing every business venture themselves, they had to bear the consequences when their ventures did not succeed.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the accident, the Cyrus family released a statement via Cyrus' official website; it stated, [...] "We are deeply saddened {{by the loss of}} Bill 'Uncle Bill' Douglas. Members of <b>our</b> <b>tour</b> are like members of our family. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family {{in the midst of this}} tragedy. He will truly be missed." [...] Omar Abderrahman, the tour's production manager, said, [...] "That was real tough. It's always a tragedy to lose anyone. Uncle Bill was a great driver and a good friend. He’d done a lot of tours with me, and we’re all going to miss him." [...] Although the cause for the accident remains undefined, authorities confirmed the roads were wet from overnight rain. However, CBS News reported that speed and weather were not attributed as factors for the accident's occurrence. Despite the incident, the tour's following concert on November 22, 2009 at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina proceeded as scheduled. During the concert, Cyrus dedicated the performance of [...] "The Climb" [...] to Douglas as overhead screens displayed a video commemorating him.|$|E

5000|$|Reflecting on {{the album}} in 2009, Ted Ottaviano stated, [...] "Everyone deems our first album as 'our moment', but Lullaby was our only CHR record.

I was sitting there in my seat, listening to the finished album on my Walkman, thinking, 'I'm not sure if we got it.' There was something so unbelievably pure and instinctually simple about the first album. There were growing pains with Lullaby." ...|$|R

5000|$|Laleh {{described}} the album as following: [...] "The album is called Prinsessor, it {{is named after}} a track from the album. There are twelve songs on the album in which one is an instrumental track and another classic, but some tough and some soft. As usual, I have been alone in the studio, which I love.
