5|$|It's a touching, believable, often funny but {{ultimately}} sad tale <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>one</b> class {{can take advantage}} of another, even in the guise of patronizing benevolence. Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and color, from the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor background to the stately rituals and autocratic entitlement of the well-to-do.|$|E
5|$|Mani's next film, Kannathil Muthamittal, {{dealt with}} the story of a child of Sri Lankan Tamil {{parentage}} adopted by Indian parents, who wishes to meet her biological mother during the Sri Lankan Civil War. The film was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, winning six National Film Awards, Filmfare Award for Best Direction in Tamil, In the Spirit of Freedom Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival, and an award at the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles. In 2004, he made Aaytha Ezhuthu, which tells the story <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>one</b> incident sends the lives of three youths on a collision course and received positive reviews. Mani made the film simultaneously in Hindi as Yuva, his second venture into Bollywood. Ajay Devgn, Abhishek Bachchan, and Vivek Oberoi replaced Surya Sivakumar, R. Madhavan, and Siddharth, respectively in the Hindi version. Unlike Yuva, Aaytha Ezhuthu was appreciated by critics. Mani suffered his first heart attack while shooting for Aaytha Ezhuthu.|$|E

25|$|The {{expected}} value {{is a key}} aspect <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>one</b> characterizes a probability distribution; it is one type of location parameter. By contrast, the variance {{is a measure of}} dispersion of the possible values of the random variable around the {{expected value}}. The variance itself is defined in terms of two expectations: it is the expected value of the squared deviation of the variable's value from the variable's expected value.|$|E

25|$|A vector may be {{described}} as a list of numbers in terms of a basis, but as a geometrical object a vector retains its own identity regardless <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>one</b> chooses to describe it in a basis. This persistence of identity is reflected in the fact that when a vector is written in one basis, and then the basis is changed, the components of the vector transform according to a change of basis formula. Such a transformation law is known as a covariant transformation. The covariant derivative is required to transform, under a change in coordinates, {{in the same way as}} a basis does: the covariant derivative must change by a covariant transformation (hence the name).|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} statistics, the Kullback–Leibler divergence (also called relative entropy) is {{a measure}} <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>one</b> probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. Applications include characterizing the relative (Shannon) entropy in information systems, randomness in continuous time-series, and information gain when comparing statistical models of inference. In contrast to variation of information, it is a distribution-wise asymmetric measure and thus does not qualify as a statistical metric of spread. In the simple case, a Kullback–Leibler divergence of 0 indicates that we can expect similar, if not the same, behavior of two different distributions, while a Kullback–Leibler divergence of 1 indicates that the two distributions behave in such a different manner that the expectation given the first distribution approaches zero. In simplified terms, it {{is a measure}} of surprise, with diverse applications such as applied statistics, fluid mechanics, neuroscience and machine learning.|$|E

500|$|The game's final {{scenario}} and {{the reason}} for Ghaleon's actions differ slightly from the original, with the Goddess Althena's instability serving as the catalyst for the events rather than a rampaging Black Dragon. In this version, Laike relates the story <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>one</b> day fifteen years ago, the Goddess Althena concluded that people were depending too much on her, rather than growing as people and as a civilization, and that by continuing to mother them, she was doing more harm than good. Despite Ghaleon's pleas, Dyne and Althena used their powers to spread her life force throughout the world, transforming her into an infant, to live out a mortal life as a human. Ghaleon, believing humanity could not survive without a god watching over them, cut off all ties to his former friend and set his plan into motion to ascend to godhood himself in Althena's place; his cause set on rule rather than revenge as in the original. Believing that humanity was strong and resourceful enough to live on their own, Dyne left the young girl in the care of Alex's parents to raise her as their own daughter before he began his new life as a traveling adventurer. Now knowing the truth of Luna's origins, Alex and his friends travel to the Goddess tower to save her and stop Ghaleon from seizing control of the world. Defeating his generals, Alex confronts Ghaleon at the tower's upper pagoda, where the ritual to transfer Luna's power to him has already begun. [...] Echoing Dyne's earlier declaration on the strength of humanity, Alex's team attacks and defeats Ghaleon as his fortress crumbles around them. [...] With Luna still caught in a trance, Alex attempts to reason with her to leave while the others are teleported to safety. Playing his ocarina, Alex awakens Luna's memories before the two are transported to the surface as the tower collapses, re-uniting with their companions.|$|E

50|$|His primary aim in {{teaching}} was to provoke in his students {{a fundamental shift}} in sensibility and perspective from the mode of Critical intellection and reflection that characterizes Modernity and predominates in the academic world, to what he and Michael Polanyi called a Post-Critical mode of thinking. Instead of attending solely to the what of a topic (an item of content, a teaching, a matter {{to be subjected to}} intellectual mastery and critique as an indifferent object of thought), the shift involves becoming aware <b>of</b> the <b>how</b> <b>of</b> intellection itself — specifically <b>of</b> the <b>how</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> responsive relationship as person in the world to the object <b>of</b> thought—of <b>how</b> <b>one</b> personally happens to be relating oneself to it. That <b>how</b> <b>of</b> intellection, the <b>how</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> personal relation to the object of thought—in other words, the underlying relationship between knower and known—is predominantly tacit, difficult to articulate, and therefore not something on which one can easily reflect, which causes it to be all the more potentially consequential in the process of knowing.|$|R
