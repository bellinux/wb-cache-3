40|$|Unit {{tests are}} {{primarily}} written {{as a good}} practice to support software evolution, i. e., to help developers to identify and fix bugs, to refactor code and to serve as documentation for a unit of software under test. To achieve these benefits, unit tests ideally should cover all possible paths in a program. One unit test usually covers one specific path in one function or <b>method.</b> However, a <b>test</b> <b>method</b> is not necessary an encapsulated, independent entity. Often a <b>test</b> <b>method’s</b> coverage is a superset of another <b>test</b> <b>method’s</b> coverage set and thus defects are not well isolated, i. e., one defect causes multiple <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> to fail. In this work we present an approach to automatically migrate JUNIT test classes to JEXAMPLE. JEXAMPLE allows <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> to declare explicit dependencies to other <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> and therefore improves defect isolation.

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{investigate}} the mechanisms behind the Se-rum cholesterol-lowering effect of oat fiber, we simultaneously measured postprandial lipid responses. serum lathosterol con-centrations. and small bowel excretion {{of fat and}} sterols in ileostomy subjects given test meals high or low in oat fiber. Six ileostomy subjects (three women and three men) were served an oat-bran test meal (OB: 16. 3 g fiber) and a wheat test meal (6. 3 g fiber in random order. After the postprandial 7 -h period. a controlled, low-fat, cholesterol-free diet was served and ileos-tomy effluent was sampled throughout the 24 -h period. Bile acid and fat excretion (24 h) increased by 93 % and 146 %, respectively (P < 0. 05), and total and endogenous cholesterol excretion decreased by 14 % and 19 %. respectively (P < 0. 05), after the <b>OB</b> <b>test</b> meal. The change in hepatic cholesterol synthesis was strongly related to the change in bile acid excre-tion (Spearman r = 0. 89. P < 0. 02). The postprandial chylo-micron lipid concentration tended to be lower after the <b>OB</b> <b>test</b> meal (- 43 % for cholesterol, P = 0. 07) whereas {{there was no difference}} in cholesterol absorption measured by isotope in five subjects. The main effect of the viscous oat -glucan seems to be related to increased bile acid excretion and subsequent changes in synthesis and endogenous excretion of cholesterol. An additional effect may have been a delay in the micellar lipid sobubibization process and a consequent reduction in the secre-tion of chylomicrons into the circulation. Am J Cliii Nui...|$|R
