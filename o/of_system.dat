5|$|Development <b>of</b> <b>System</b> Shock 2 {{began in}} 1997 when Looking Glass Studios {{approached}} Irrational Games {{with an idea}} to co-develop a new game. The development team were fans <b>of</b> <b>System</b> Shock and sought to create a similar game. Early story ideas were similar to the novella Heart of Darkness. In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship. The original title of the game, according to its pitch document, was Junction Point. The philosophy of the design was to continue to develop {{the concept of a}} dungeon crawler, like , in a science fiction setting, the basis for System Shock. However, the press mistook System Shock to be closer to a Doom clone which was cited for poor financial success <b>of</b> <b>System</b> Shock. With Junction Point, the goal was to add in significant role-playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance the game from Doom.|$|E

As the {{industry}} undergoes a paradigm shift from a system-based procurement model to a capability-based acquisition model {{with a focus on}} integration <b>of</b> legacy <b>systems</b> and interoperability <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> and families <b>of</b> <b>systems,</b> new challenges have emerged for the field of cost estimating. What is the cost of an operational capability in a net centric environment based on enterprise architecture? This paper explores a set of enterprise architecture-based drivers for estimating the life cycle cost or total ownership cost of operational capabilities from integration <b>of</b> complex <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> and families <b>of</b> <b>systems.</b> It attempts to extend the traditional systems engineering practices and to address the new challenges from capability-based engineering and interoperability <b>of</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
