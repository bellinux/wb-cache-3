30|$|Call networks: The Dataset 1 {{contains}} the number (and duration) <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between any pair of antennae for every hour during a five month period. We construct {{three types of}} networks: (1) G^n_a=(A, N_a) is a directed weighted network where N_a = {n(a_i,a_j)} denotes the total number <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between a_i and a_j; (2) G^d_a=(A,D_a) is also a directed weighted network where D_a={d(a_i,a_j)} denotes the total duration <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between a_i and a_j. We further map antennae into different levels of administrative areas based on their geo-location and aggregate the mobile communication flow (in terms of numbers or duration <b>of</b> <b>calls)</b> between pairs <b>of</b> administrative areas. For instance, G^n_d=(D,N_d) is a directed weighted network of department-to-department communication, where N_d={n(d_i,d_j)=∑_(a_u,a_v):a_u∈ d_i∧ a_v∈ d_j n(a_u,a_v)} denotes the total number <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between department d_i and d_j, aggregated from their antenna records. Here mobile communications within the same department are ignored. Similarly, we generate call networks G^n_r (region-to-region number <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> G^n_p (pole-to-pole call volume), G^d_d (department-to-department duration <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> G^d_r (region-to-region duration <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> and G^d_p (pole-to-pole duration <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> respectively.|$|R

In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation <b>of</b> <b>calling).</b> The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.|$|E
5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants.

5|$|Bulgaria's {{relations}} with the Russian Federation are currently on a good or fair level. Both countries have had centuries-long interactions, sharing a common heritage. The Cyrillic alphabet originated during 9th century and it was created by Clement and Naum, who were the students of Cyril and Methodius, which later accepted the Orthodox Slavic countries as their standard letter. Relations between Russia and Bulgaria have dated {{back as far as}} the 19th century. Both nations had the tradition <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> monarchs tsars, a Slavic word for caesar or emperor. The Russian Empire was the first country to recognize Bulgaria, and greatly helped Bulgaria in its war of independence from Ottoman Empire in 1908. During the Cold War, Bulgaria became an ally of the Soviet Union as a satellite state. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations between Bulgaria and Russia still share many different opinions, such as the two World Wars when Bulgaria both joined German side against Russia, and the problem over the history.|$|E

40|$|The Cruise Itinerary Schedule Design (CISD) problem {{determines the}} optimal {{sequence}} {{of a given}} set <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> (a port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is an intermediate stop in a cruise itinerary) and the arrival and departure times at each port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> {{in order to maximize}} the monetary value of the utility at ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> minus the fuel cost. To solve this problem, in view of the practical observations that most cruise itineraries do not have many ports <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> we first enumerate all sequences <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> and then optimize the arrival and departure times at each port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> by developing a dynamic programming approach. To improve the computational efficiency, we propose effective bounds on the monetary value of each sequence <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> eliminating non-optimal sequences without invoking the dynamic programming algorithm. Extensive computational experiments are conducted and the results showthat, first, using the bounds on the profit of each sequence <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> considerably improves the computational efficiency; second, the total profit of the cruise itinerary is sensitive to the fuel price and hence an accurate estimation of the fuel price is highly desirable; third, the optimal sequence <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is not necessarily the sequencewith the shortest voyage distance, especially when the ports do not have a natural geographic sequence.

5|$|Anxious {{to avoid}} war, Tsar Peter sent his two sons, Boris and Roman, as hostages to Constantinople. This move failed to appease Nikephoros, {{but he was}} not able or willing to {{campaign}} against Bulgaria; his forces were engaged in the East, and furthermore, drawing on the Byzantines' past experience, Nikephoros was reluctant to mount an expedition into the mountainous and heavily forested terrain of Bulgaria. Consequently, he resorted to the old Byzantine expedient <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> in a tribe from eastern Europe to attack Bulgaria. In late 966 or early 967, he dispatched the patrikios Kalokyros, a citizen of Cherson, as his ambassador to Sviatoslav, ruler of the Rus'. The Byzantines had long maintained close relations with the Rus', with whom they were bound by treaty. With promises of rich rewards and, according to Leo the Deacon, a payment of 1,500pounds of gold, the Rus' ruler was induced to attack Bulgaria from the north. That Nikephoros should call upon Sviatoslav for aid was unusual, since the Pechenegs were traditionally used for such tasks. The historian A.D. Stokes, who examined the questions surrounding the background and chronology of Sviatoslav's Bulgarian campaign, suggested that this move had a second motive of turning the attention of Sviatoslav, who had recently destroyed the Khazar khanate, away from the Byzantine outpost of Cherson.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this operation No. 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups from the Special Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> troops by {{letters of the alphabet}} was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop. The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop, to go first and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. Following them, the rest of No.1, No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then be joined by the remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} Apollonius' problem, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is hyperbolic trilateration, {{which seeks to}} determine a position from the differences in distances to at least three points. For example, a ship may seek to determine its position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three synchronized transmitters. Solutions to Apollonius' problem were used in World War I to determine the location of an artillery piece from the time a gunshot was heard at three different positions, and hyperbolic trilateration is the principle used by the Decca Navigator System and LORAN. Similarly, the location of an aircraft may be determined from the difference in arrival times of its transponder signal at four receiving stations. This multilateration problem {{is equivalent to the}} three-dimensional generalization of Apollonius' problem and applies to global positioning systems such as GPS. It is also used to determine the position <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> animals (such as birds and whales), although Apollonius' problem does not pertain if the speed of sound varies with direction (i.e., the transmission medium not isotropic).|$|E
