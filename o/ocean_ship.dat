5000|$|Ocean {{transportation}} was {{the last}} to be addressed. This was done in two acts, the <b>Ocean</b> <b>Shipping</b> Act of 1984 and the <b>Ocean</b> <b>Shipping</b> Reform Act of 1998. These acts were less thoroughgoing than the legislation dealing with U.S. domestic transportation, in that they left in place the [...] "conference" [...] system in international <b>ocean</b> liner <b>shipping,</b> which historically embodied cartel mechanisms. However, these acts permitted independent rate making by conference participants, and the 1998 Act permitted secret contract rates, which tend to undercut collective carrier pricing.

50|$|Ship {{tracks are}} clouds that form around the exhaust {{released}} by ships into the still ocean air. Water molecules collect around the tiny particles (aerosols) from exhaust {{to form a}} cloud seed. More and more water accumulates on the seed until a visible cloud is formed. In the case of ship tracks, the cloud seeds are stretched over a long narrow path where the wind has blown the ship's exhaust, so the resulting clouds resemble long strings over the <b>ocean.</b> <b>Ship</b> tracks are a type of homogenitus cloud.|$|E

5000|$|She is {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} [...] "the world's first large ocean-going diesel-powered ship", an [...] "experiment," [...] as previous powered vessels were driven by steam. The new motorships were described as [...] "smokeless" [...] and caused some to describe them as [...] "phantom ships" [...] with an incident during the trials for [...] "Selandia" [...] in which a captain of another ship ignored warnings and ran across her bows because he [...] "saw no smoke." [...] The ship attracted curious crowds from London to San Francisco that were often skeptical of a deep <b>ocean</b> <b>ship</b> not powered by the commonly used triple expansion steam engine; yet within ten years there were over 2,000,000 deadweight capacity tons in commerce powered by diesel engines and British experts calculated the motorship had a 40% advantage in fuel costs, with fewer crew and steadier sea speeds.|$|E
5000|$|According to the {{tradition}} of the Physiologus and medieval bestiaries, the aspidochelone is a fabled sea creature, variously described as a large whale or vast sea turtle, and a giant sea monster with huge spines on the ridge of its back. No matter what form it is, it is always described as being huge where it is often mistaken for an island and appears to be rocky with crevices and valleys with trees and greenery and having sand dunes all over it. The name aspidochelone appears to be a compound word combining Greek aspis (which means either [...] "" [...] or [...] "shield"), and chelone, the turtle. It rises to the surface from the depths of the sea, and entices unwitting sailors with its island appearance to make landfall on its huge shell and then the whale is able to pull them under the <b>ocean,</b> <b>ship</b> and all the people, drowning them. It also emits a sweet smell that lures fish into its trap where it then devours them. In the moralistic allegory of the Physiologus and bestiary tradition, the aspidochelone represents Satan, who deceives those whom he seeks to devour.|$|E

After a failed attempt by the Alliance forces to destroy an enemy super-weapon, Ledo is knocked into a wormhole and loses consciousness.

Ledo discovers that he is on board an <b>ocean</b> <b>ship</b> named the Gargantia, that is part of a massive fleet of ships on an ocean-covered planet. Chamber tells him that local star charts reveal the planet is Earth, the birthplace of humanity, a place that members of the Alliance were only familiar with from stories and believed was a myth.|$|E
