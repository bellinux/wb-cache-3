5|$|For {{the coup}} to be successful, the {{military}} committee needed {{to gain the}} support {{of some of the}} Syrian <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b> The collapse of the UAR, coupled with mutinies, purges and transfers left the <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> in complete disarray and open to anti-government agitation. At the time, the <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> was split into five different factions; the Damascus faction which supported the ancien régime, supporters of Akram al-Hawrani, a Nasserist faction, a Ba'athist faction and a group of independents. The Damascus faction was the enemy of the military committee because of their support for Nazim al-Kudsi's regime and the Hawranist were considered as rivals because of their stance against pan-Arabism. The Nasserists became allies of the Ba'ath, even while they supported Gamal Abdel Nasser and the reestablishment of the UAR.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{division}} had completed its training, it was still about one third below its designated strength in both officers and NCOs, and its <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> remained almost entirely German. Most of the officers and NCOs were drawn from replacement units of other Waffen-SS divisions.|$|E
5|$|Colonel David Barrett {{evaluated}} the communists' military potential by observing war games between CPC troops and visiting war schools {{set up to}} train the Chinese <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b> Barrett felt the CPC emphasized indoctrinating their soldiers over military training, but he believed that American advisors could train the CPC soldiers to become excellent fighters.|$|E

5|$|U.S. forces also {{established}} an officer candidate {{school during the}} later part of the war, using instructors selected from the American troops in the country. The school conducted two courses and graduated nearly 300 new officers. Just under twenty years later in 1964, the group still made up over 50% of the <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> of the AFL.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{studies of}} {{different}} groups in Wilhelmine Germany have all {{contributed to a}} new view of the period. Although the Junkers did, indeed, continue to control the <b>officer</b> <b>corps,</b> they did not dominate social, political, and economic matters {{as much as the}} Sonderweg theorists had hypothesized. Eastern Junker power had a counterweight in the western provinces {{in the form of the}} Grand Bourgeoisie and in the growing professional class of bureaucrats, teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} {{to establish an}} officer candidate school to train an indigenous <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> from among Haiti's educated upper class failed due to a reluctance among potential candidates to be seen collaborating with the American occupation, and by {{the perception that the}} methods of American military instruction were demeaning. Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, were recruited from indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} had notable {{effects on the}} navies of both Britain and France. The French did not directly contest British supremacy in Northern European waters again, spending most of the next 23 years in Brest and other ports, their few major sallies mainly directed at the Mediterranean. Continued upheavals in the French Navy resulted in a decline of quality in its <b>officer</b> <b>corps,</b> {{so that by the}} Battle of Trafalgar 11 years later the port-bound nature of the French fleet had resulted in a cautious and inexperienced tactical outlook. In Britain, the battle created a division within the Royal Navy's <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b> Howe's dispatch after the battle criticised some officers who he believed had hesitated in action, and those officers received none of the honours distributed {{at the end of the}} campaign. Fallout from this dispute was widespread, with several senior figures resigning in disgust. Captain Molloy of HMS Caesar was ultimately court-martialled and dismissed from the service for failing to support his admiral.|$|E
5|$|As {{the seat}} of the {{government}} of Australia, Canberra is the site of Parliament House, the official residence of the Monarch's representative the Governor-General, the High Court and numerous government departments and agencies. It is also the location of many social and cultural institutions of national significance, such as the Australian War Memorial, Australian National University, Royal Australian Mint, Australian Institute of Sport, National Gallery, National Museum and the National Library. The Australian Army's <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> is trained at the Royal Military College, Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy is also located in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Former Waffen-SS men {{who wished}} to join the Bundeswehr still faced {{heightened}} scrutiny. All Waffen-SS applicants went through the rigorous vetting process reserved only for those with the higher ranks in the Wehrmacht. HIAG protested {{to the government and}} its military planners, but to no avail. As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS officers had been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's <b>officer</b> <b>corps),</b> as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.|$|E
50|$|In the United States Marine Corps (and USMC Reserve), all {{officers}} - including warrant {{officers and}} limited duty officers (LDOs) - are line officers, trained to command combat units, although Marine officers cannot command ships or shore organizations of the Navy. Unlike the Navy, the Marine Corps {{does not have}} any staff corps, consequently all Marine engineer and supply officers, and judge advocates, are line <b>officers.</b> The Marine <b>Corps</b> has no medical <b>corps</b> <b>officers,</b> dental <b>corps</b> <b>officers,</b> nurse <b>corps</b> <b>officers,</b> or chaplain <b>corps</b> <b>officers.</b> Because the Marine Corps is a service within the Department of the Navy, these staff corps billets in the Marine Corps are normally filled by US Navy staff <b>corps</b> <b>officers</b> in those specialties, serving alongside Marines in Marine units, although officers of the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service may be detailed, as well.|$|R

5|$|Hitler made a {{prominent}} {{appearance at the}} trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hans Ludin, in late 1930. Both were charged with membership in the NSDAP, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel. The prosecution argued that the NSDAP was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify. On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections, which won him many supporters in the <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1849, Werner {{became an}} officer in the German Reichsflotte (Imperial Fleet), which had been {{organized}} the year before. In 1852, he transferred to the Preussische Marine (Prussian Navy), at the age of 22. The Preussische Marine accepted only ten applicants to the <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> that year. Werner was the only officer in the first group who was directly commissioned as a lieutenant; the other nine became officer cadets. He was promoted to the rank of kapitänleutnant (captain lieutenant) in 1856. While commanding the warship Elbe, he participated in a naval expedition to the Far East in 1859–1862.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Nasser married Tahia Kazem, the 22-year-old {{daughter}} of a wealthy Iranian father and an Egyptian mother, both of whom {{died when she was}} young. She was introduced to Nasser through her brother, Abdel Hamid Kazim, a merchant friend of Nasser's, in 1943. After their wedding, the couple moved into a house in Manshiyat al-Bakri, a suburb of Cairo, where they would live {{for the rest of their}} lives. Nasser's entry into the <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> in 1937 secured him relatively well-paid employment in a society where most people lived in poverty.|$|E
50|$|Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>officers</b> are {{eligible}} for command of supply units (e.g. a Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>officer</b> is always in command of Naval Cargo Handling Battalions). In addition to shipboard billets, Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>officers</b> also serve in forward deployed land-based units (e.g. with Construction Battalions working alongside Civil Engineer <b>Corps</b> <b>officers</b> and with the Marine Corps).|$|R

50|$|Although {{the first}} regular army units were raised {{as early as}} 1821-1822, on the {{outbreak}} of the Greek War of Independence, the first rudimentary general staff organization, {{in the form of the}} General Staff <b>Officers</b> <b>Corps</b> (Σώμα Γενικών Επιτελών), was created only in 1833, after the establishment of the independent Kingdom of Greece. The first attempt to create a permanent staff service was made in 1877, when the Army General Staff was first instituted. The experiment was short-lived, however, as it and the General Staff <b>Officers</b> <b>Corps</b> were abolished in 1880, and replaced by a simple Staff Service Bureau within the Ministry of Military Affairs.|$|R
5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration. This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came to be seen as a training ground for the <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Model's biographer, the {{military}} historian Steven Newton, {{argues that the}} best explanation for Model's behaviour {{is that he was}} not necessarily a Nazi, but an authoritarian militarist who saw in Hitler the strong leader that Germany needed. According to Newton, Model saw himself as the professional, apolitical soldier; he possessed a strong sense of German nationalism, with the accompanying tenets of racial prejudice against Slavs and Jews. This characterized many in the German <b>officer</b> <b>corps,</b> but in Model's case it was accompanied by a cynical willingness to placate the Nazi regime to expedite his own goals.|$|E
5|$|Most pre-war {{officers}} {{came from}} families with military connections, the gentry or the peerage; {{a public school}} education was almost essential. In 1913, about 2% of regular officers had been promoted from the ranks. The <b>officer</b> <b>corps,</b> during the war, consisted of regular officers from the peacetime army, officers who had been granted permanent commissions during the war, officers who had been granted temporary commissions {{for the duration of}} the war, territorial army officers commissioned during peacetime, officers commissioned from the ranks of the pre-war regular and territorial army and temporary officers commissioned from the ranks {{for the duration of the}} war alone.|$|E
25|$|The Navy Expeditionary Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>Officer</b> (NESCO) {{program is}} {{designed}} to recognize significant contributions made by Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>officers</b> while serving in operational expeditionary billets. Navy Expeditionary Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>officer</b> qualification represents a level of expeditionary knowledge that distinguishes an officer of the Supply Corps from his or her peers. The Navy Expeditionary Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>officer</b> qualification program is mandatory for all Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>officers</b> serving in designated billets as determined by Commander, Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (COMNAVEXPDCMBTCOM) and Commander, Naval Special Warfare Command (COMNAVSPECWARCOM).|$|R
25|$|Commanders {{and above}} with other Supply Corps {{professional}} qualification (e.g., Naval Aviation Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>officer</b> or Surface Warfare Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>officer)</b> may elect not to participate, but Navy Expeditionary Supply <b>Corps</b> <b>officer</b> qualification is encouraged for these officers.|$|R
50|$|The {{expansion}} of the Pakistan armed forces, and the broadening of the social base of its <b>officers</b> <b>corps</b> from the 1960s onwards has inevitably led to the expansion {{in the number of}} cadet colleges and their distribution around the country.|$|R
5|$|Sarraj and Bizri wielded {{substantial}} {{influence in}} Syrian politics, checking {{the power of}} the political factions and purging Nasser's opponents from the <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b> This was a source of concern for Quwatli, but he kept both men in their posts, partially due to pressure from Nasser. Quwatli further solidified his ties with the latter by appointing Akram al-Hawrani, the prominent Arab socialist leader, as speaker of parliament, and Salah al-Din Bitar, the co-founder of the pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party, as foreign affairs minister.|$|E
5|$|The Armada was {{constantly}} being modernized {{with the latest}} developments in naval warfare. It adopted steam navigation in the 1830s, ironclad plate armor in the 1860s, and torpedoes in the 1880s. By 1889, Brazil had the fifth or sixth most powerful navy {{in the world and the}} most powerful battleships in the western hemisphere. The Army, despite its highly experienced and battle-hardened <b>officer</b> <b>corps,</b> was plagued during peacetime by units which were badly paid, inadequately equipped, poorly trained and thinly spread across the vast Empire.|$|E
5|$|The Frenchmen {{were caught}} off guard and five were killed, with three seriously wounded. The mutineers managed to win over a few more tirailleurs from the 5th and 6th {{companies}} of the battalion, and even managed to raise {{the flag of the}} VNQDĐ on top of one of the buildings. They managed to capture the armoury and proclaimed victory. The leaders of the uprising sent a patrol into the centre of the town to exhort the populace to join the insurrection, falsely claiming that they had already eliminated the entire French <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b>|$|E
50|$|The rank of cadet staff {{sergeant}} (CSSG or C/SSgt) {{is used by}} many cadet organisations around the world, including the Army Cadet Force and the Army Section of the Combined Cadet Force in the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Air Force Academy, the Army Reserve <b>Officer</b> Training <b>Corps</b> and Air Force Reserve <b>Officer</b> Training <b>Corps</b> pre-commissioning programs on college and university campuses, the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force Junior Reserve <b>Officer</b> Training <b>Corps</b> programs in U.S. high schools, and the Civil Air Patrol cadet program.|$|R
