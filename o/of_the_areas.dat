5|$|As a {{tropical}} depression, Neoguri (Ambo) brought heavy rainfall to many {{portions of the}} Philippines, including even Metro Manila. In Cebu City, the precipitation caused flooding, which forced 62people to evacuate their houses. In the Camotes Islands, rough waves capsized a motorboat with six passengers; five were rescued, with the other reported missing. But the storm at least alleviated {{for a few days}} the heat that has been experienced over Luzon from the past weeks.

5|$|As hoped by the {{original}} promoters, {{the opening of the}} line stimulated the construction of new areas of private and public residential development throughout the 1930s, although large areas remain as parks and playing fields. The St. Helier Estate was completed in 1936. The opening of the Wimbledon to Sutton line and the C led the population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> through which the lines passed, to increase from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.|$|E

5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> {{in which it}} was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A {{large percentage of the}} original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, colleague, and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> where Gray and his friend and colleague, Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group.

5|$|In {{anticipation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> {{surrounding the}} bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on a sliding scale, {{ranging from a}} penny for pedestrians to 2s6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.|$|E

The former routing of NY17 remained state maintained as an extension of NY989 and NY990P between the two locations. All of NY990P was redesignated as NY268 between 1989 and 1993. In the floods of 2006 between June25 and July5, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> along NY268 suffered serious landslides and, as a result, was temporarily closed off by the New York State Department of Transportation.

5|$|In {{the past}} {{part of the}} {{population}} worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area now. There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley.
