5|$|Colbert {{often makes}} digs {{at the expense}} of Daily Show host Jon Stewart. He has implied a {{strained}} relationship with Stewart, in contrast with the real Colbert's admiration for the comedian, and suggests that his departure from The Daily Show occurred under dubious circumstances. The character has described Stewart as a sexual predator and has been known to become tearful when his name is brought up. On the other hand, Colbert has also implied that he <b>only</b> <b>got</b> his own show by blackmailing Stewart with incriminating photographs.|$|E
5|$|A third raid, {{consisting}} of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF, flying from Palembang, Sumatra, attacked shortly afterwards, losing {{two of their}} number, with their entire crews, to six Ki-27s. A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had <b>only</b> <b>got</b> as far as Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission.

The soldiers were ordered to find their way east on foot.

5|$|The first Jesuit {{reduction}} in the Chiquitania was the mission of San Francisco Xavier, founded in 1691 by the Jesuit priest Fr. José de Arce. In September 1691, de Arce and Br. Antonio de Rivas intended to meet seven other Jesuits at the Paraguay River to establish a connection between Paraguay and Chiquitos. However, {{the beginning of the}} rainy season brought bad weather, and Arce and his companion <b>only</b> <b>got</b> as far as the first native village. The local Piñoca tribe, who were suffering from a plague, begged Arce and Rivas to stay and promised to build a house and a church for the Jesuits, which were finished by the end of year. The mission was later moved a number of times until 1708 when it was established in its present location.|$|E

5|$|The FN {{was hurt}} in the snap 1988 {{legislative}} elections by the return two-ballot majority voting, by the limited campaign period, and by the departure of many notables. In the election the party retained its 9.8% support from the previous legislative election, but {{was reduced to a}} single seat in the National Assembly. Following some anti-Semitic comments made by Le Pen and the FN newspaper National Hebdo in the late 1980s, some valuable FN politicians left the party. Other quarrels soon also left the party without its remaining member of the National Assembly. In November 1988, general secretary Jean-Pierre Stirbois, who, together with his wife Marie-France, had been instrumental in the FN's early electoral successes, died in a car accident, leaving Bruno Mégret as the unrivalled de facto FN deputy leader. The FN <b>only</b> <b>got</b> 5% in the 1988 cantonal elections, while the RPR announced it would reject any alliance with the FN, now including at local level. In the 1989 European elections, the FN held on to its ten seats as it won 11.7% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|In the men's tournament, Fiji secured {{their first}} Olympic medal with {{emphatic}} 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with big win over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch and touch the ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood to show any compassion racking up a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor <b>only</b> <b>got</b> his players {{together for the first time}} on May 30.
