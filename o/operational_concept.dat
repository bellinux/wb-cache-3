5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different <b>operational</b> <b>concept</b> from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended {{to stand in the}} line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E

500|$|At Blamey's Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (Adv LHQ) in St Lucia, Queensland, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Major General Frank Berryman, {{headed the}} {{planning}} process. A {{model of the}} Lae-Salamaua area was constructed in a secure room at St Lucia, the windows were boarded up and two guards were posted on the door round the clock. On 16 May, Blamey held a conference with Berryman and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, the commander of I Corps, around the model at which {{the details of the}} operation were discussed. Blamey's <b>operational</b> <b>concept</b> was for a double envelopment of Lae, using [...] "two of the finest divisions on the Allied side". Major General George Wootten's 9th Division would land east of Lae in a shore-to-shore operation and advance on Lae. Meanwhile, Major General George Alan Vasey's 7th Division, in a reprise of the Battle of Buna–Gona in 1942, would advance on Lae from the west by an overland route. Its primary role was to prevent reinforcement of the Japanese garrison at Lae by establishing itself in a blocking position across the Markham Valley. Its secondary task was to assist the 9th Division in the capture of Lae. The plan was generally known as Operation POSTERN, although this was actually the GHQ code name for Lae itself.|$|E
500|$|On 1 January 1967 Graham was {{appointed}} Commander 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) {{which was based}} in Phuoc Tuy Province, South Vietnam, taking over from Brigadier David Jackson. According to Ian McNeill and Ashley Ekins, the official historians of Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, Graham quickly established himself, and developed a sound <b>operational</b> <b>concept,</b> yet the Viet Cong succeeded in preventing him from implementing it as he had intended. With just two battalions 1 ATF's ability to generate combat power was severely limited, while its location at Nui Dat isolated it from the main population centres and increased the burden of self-protection. During February 1967 1 ATF had sustained its heaviest casualties in the war to that point, losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week, the majority during Operation Bribie after 6 RAR had clashed with two companies from the Viet Cong D445 Battalion reinforced by North Vietnamese regulars, north-west of Hoi My on 17 February. To Graham such losses underscored {{the need for a}} third infantry battalion and tanks, yet with the Australian government unable to provide additional military resources at that time, they confirmed in his mind the need to establish a physical barrier to deny the Viet Cong freedom of movement. Graham subsequently established an [...] long barrier minefield from Dat Do to the coast during Operation Leeton (6March – 1June) in an attempt to regain the initiative.|$|E
40|$|In (Klingspor et al., 1996), we {{have applied}} {{inductive}} logic programming algorithms {{in order to learn}} so-called <b>operational</b> <b>concepts.</b> These high-level concepts can be used by a human user to guide a robot.

500|$|During February 1967 1 ATF had {{sustained}} its heaviest {{casualties in}} the war to that point, losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week. The task force appeared to have lost the initiative {{and for the first}} time in nine months of operations the number of Australians killed in battle, or from friendly fire, mines or booby traps, had reversed the task force's kill ratio. Such losses underscored the need for a third battalion and the requirement for tanks to support the infantry; a realisation which challenged the conventional wisdom of Australian counter-revolutionary warfare doctrine which had previously allotted only a minor role to armour. Regardless, it would be nearly a year before additional Australian forces would finally arrive in Vietnam. Although Graham had quickly established himself since taking over as Commander 1 ATF in January, and had developed a sound <b>operational</b> <b>concept,</b> the Viet Cong had succeeded in preventing him from implementing it as he had intended. Operation Bribie confirmed in his mind the need to establish a physical barrier to deny the Viet Cong freedom of movement and thereby regain the initiative, and the subsequent decision to establish an [...] barrier minefield from Dat Do to the coast increasingly came to dominate task force planning. Yet ultimately this would prove both controversial and costly for the Australians, and despite initial success, the minefield would become a source of munitions for the Viet Cong to use against 1 ATF and later the decision would be made to remove it in 1969.|$|E
