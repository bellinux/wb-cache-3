50|$|This was {{the first}} American front-wheel drive car to be offered to the public, beating the Ruxton {{automobile}} by several months, in 1929. The brainchild of former Miller engineer Carl Van Ranst, its drive system borrowed from the Indianapolis 500-dominating racers, using the same de Dion layout and inboard brakes. This allowed it to be much lower than competing cars. Both stock cars and special bodies built on the Cord chassis by American and European coachbuilders won prizes in contests worldwide. The L-29 came with full instrumentation, including a temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge, and speedometer on the left with a gas gauge, <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> <b>gauge,</b> and Ammeter {{on the right of}} the steering wheel.|$|E

2500|$|The Bristol 138, the record-breaking {{machine is}} a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane designed to fly at extremely high altitudes for the era. Aviation publication Flight observed {{of the aircraft}} that: [...] "except for its size, reminds one very much of the little Bristol Brownie.... the machine is the largest single-seater aeroplane ever built". The pilot was seated in a relatively spacious cockpit, which was heated by air directed from the oil coolers set within the wings, which could be actively controlled. Instrumentation included fore-and-aft <b>levels,</b> <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gauges,</b> airspeed indicator and fuel gauge, engine speed indicator and pyrometer. Purpose-built recording altimeters, developed by the RAE, were housed within the wings, while a separate altimeter was installed within the cockpit for the pilot.|$|R

50|$|The bumpers on the 1933 Series 355C were sectioned, with plain {{ends and}} a three bar center. The grille was made V-shaped and blended into the painted (chrome optional) {{radiator}} shell. The radiator cap disappeared {{under the hood}} {{on the right side}} (same side as the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> <b>gauge).</b> The fender tie bar, after a year's absence was sectioned and the center section was hidden behind the grille. Six horizontal doors replaced the vertical hood doors. Skirts were added to the front and rear fenders. The most significant change in body detail was the introduction of no-draft Individually Controlled Ventilation (ICV) or pivoting vent windows in the front doors and the rear quarter or rear door windows. In early production the front door window had to be lowered to disengage the channel at its front edge from the vent window to allow the vent window to pivot. In later production the sealing channel was attached to the door frame rather than to the window glass so that the vent window could be operated independently of the window glass. Windshield and rear quarter windows were made stationary. Absence of a windshield operating mechanism on the closed car allowed room to conceal the wiper motor behind the headboard. The cowl ventilator was baffled and drained {{in such a way as}} to be rainproof. Chassis changes were few and minor in nature. Controlled free wheeling was discontinued. Vacuum assist was added to the brake system. Changes in shock absorber valves extended the range of the ride control system. During the model year the dual point four lobe distributor was replaced by a single point eight lobe unit. A radio was optional. Model year sales were 2,100.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, the {{calculation}} of temperature fields inside sensors ’ bodies is discussed. The temperature of a sensor {{is a function of}} time and spatial coordinates. Structures of mathematical models describing the temperature fields depend on the environment in which sensors operate. In this paper, temperature fields in sensors are described by the Fourier partial differential equation. Mathematical model of the particular sensor has many parameters which are known with limited accuracy. To upgrade this accuracy, the physical model incorporating both the analyzed sensor and the ambient conditions similar to the real ones is built. Mathematical model is constructed and calculated to solve tasks described by the physical model. Differences between analytical and experimental results are used for an adaptive correction of parameters of the mathematical model. In this paper, differences between models are evaluated from differences between surface temperatures of the sensors. At the physical model, sensor’s surface temperature is measured by the infrared camera. At the mathematical model, sensor’s temperature is obtained solving the Fourier partial differential equation by the finite element method. It is calculated by the ANSYS Workbench software. Numerical values of sensors ’ surface temperatures from both models can be displayed as images. To compare the experimental and analytical results, images generated by the IR camera are transformed by a set of image processing functions. Both the general method and the case study results obtained on the complex problem of the analysis of the heat transfer dynamics of the motor <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> are presented.

40|$|Abstract: In {{industrial}} or automotive dip lubricated gear drives, low <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> {{may be used}} due {{to different}} design requirements or constraints. A variation of the sump <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> affects different working conditions of gears, such as the power loss, the heat generation, and the load-carrying capacity with respect to different types of damage. In particular, reduced <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> decrease the scuffing load capacity of gears because of high bulk temperatures and reduced oil quantity in the gear mesh.

30|$|We will {{compare this}} seismic {{activity}} with the crustal deformation after 1976 (Ukawa et al. 2006). NIED conducted leveling and trilateration 11 times {{every other year}} from 1976 to 1995. Furthermore, GPS surveys were conducted 10 times every 2  years from 1996 to 2016. Results until 2002 are summarized in Ukawa et al. (2006). Figure  2 b shows vertical movement obtained by leveling and GPS from 1977 at the survey point within 10  m of the observation point where GNSS continuous observation was carried out. In the leveling survey until 1995, the average sea level measured by the tide <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> was taken as the reference height (the location of tide <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> is shown by a star in Fig.  1 c). Temporary tide level observation from 1977 to 1980 and a tidal <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> of continuous observation from 1980 to 1995 were employed to monitor the tide level, {{and the results were}} used as the reference height for the levelling surveys.

40|$|A {{prototype}} of a liquid <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> based on pulsed time-of-flight (TOF) method {{was developed for}} measuring liquid level accurately at distances from zero to 30 metres. The system consists of an optomechanical sensor head and electronics unit which are connected to each other by means of two optical fibres.

The pulsing frequency of the laser is 1. 5 MHz and the time interval between start and stop pulses is digitized by means of a simple and inherently linear synchronous digital counter.

50|$|When {{selecting}} a magnetic <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> {{it is important}} {{to take into account the}} strength of the magnetic field. The magnetic field is the heart of the magnetic <b>level</b> <b>gauge</b> - the stronger the field, the more reliable the instrument will function. Some manufacturers rely on a single magnet for their magnetic <b>level</b> <b>gauges</b> which causes the strength of the north field to be identical to, and as weak as, the south field. It is apparent that at the location of the indicators, switches and transmitters, the field would not be as intense. Some manufacturers use a single annular ring magnet, others use a series of single bar magnets in a circular array in their float design. In this design the relative field strength of the north and south poles will be equal to one another and less than that of a dual magnet design. Moreover, the field strength as you travel around the circumference will have high and low spots as you pass between the individual bar magnets.|$|R
