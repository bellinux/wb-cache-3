5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs <b>of</b> <b>disappointment.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the championship win, the 1937–38 season was one <b>of</b> <b>disappointment.</b> Manchester City achieved several high scoring wins, including two 7–1 scorelines, but frequently stuttered to defeat. On {{the final day of}} the season the club faced Huddersfield Town, and went into the match four places clear of the relegation zone. A 1–0 defeat, coupled with wins for all four of the teams immediately below meant reigning champions City were relegated to the Second Division despite scoring more goals than any other team.|$|E

Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States team to beat him to the finish line.

A student who blames their test failure on the teacher would be using the interpersonal perspective, and would use their feeling <b>of</b> <b>disappointment</b> as motivation {{to rely on a}} different study source other than the teacher for the next test.|$|E

Brown joined as captain in 1949, and led the team to six place {{in his first season}} after previous years <b>of</b> <b>disappointment.</b> Under the new leadership of Dennis Brookes (a stalwart batsman for over 20 years), finished second in 1957, their best finish for 45 years. This was mainly due to the bowling attack of Frank Tyson, Vincent Broderick, Michael Allen, George Tribe and Manning. Northamptonshire were widely considered the best team in England in the late 1950s and early 1960s, during this time Keith Andrew, Northants best ever Wicket-keeper broke the records of most victims in an innings and a season.|$|E
