Batistuta is thus {{the only person}} to score hat-tricks in two World Cups. He has another unique record <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> hat-tricks, both were {{achieved}} on 21 June of the year, against World Cup finals debutants (Greece and Jamaica), and each time the third goal was a penalty. Kocsis and Müller scored their hat-tricks in consecutive matches.|$|E
5|$|A creative, hard-working, and {{technically}} gifted playmaker {{who played}} as an attacking midfielder, Gascoigne was capable both <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> {{and setting up}} goals, due to his passing accuracy and his powerful striking ability. Gascoigne was gifted with pace, physical strength, balance, and excellent dribbling skills, which allowed him to protect the ball, beat opponents, and withstand physical challenges. Despite his talent, he was also criticised for his erratic behaviour and aggression on the pitch. His turbulent and often unhealthy lifestyle off the pitch, {{as well as his}} tendency to pick up injuries, is thought to have affected his career.|$|E
5|$|Although Waugh {{made his}} ODI debut against Pakistan in December 1988, {{he did not}} score his first century until four years later. Between his debut and the 1996 World Cup he made five centuries, all against {{different}} opponents. Waugh was more prolific at the 1996 World Cup scoring three centuries. Waugh set {{the record for the}} highest individual score by an Australian when he made 173 against West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in February 2001. The following month he scored a match-winning 133 not out against India at the Nehru Stadium, Pune which also became his last century in the format.

On 13 March, he scored a hat-trick as Chelsea defeated Tottenham Hotspur 4–0. He formed both a good friendship and a productive partnership with Icelandic striker Eiður Guðjohnsen, scoring 29 goals in all competitions whilst Guðjohnsen scored 23 goals in a season which also saw Chelsea reach the FA Cup final after overcoming Norwich City, West Ham United, Preston North End, Tottenham Hotspur, and Fulham. Hasselbaink was a doubt for the final due to a hamstring injury, and was substituted on 68 minutes at the Millennium Stadium as Chelsea lost 2–0 to rivals Arsenal. His total of 23 league goals was one fewer than Golden Boot winner Thierry Henry.|$|E
5|$|Bolton's fifth round home tie against South Shields {{produced}} a straightforward 3–0 victory. The goals were scored by Joe Smith, Jack Smith and David Jack, the latter maintaining his record <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> in every round. The quarter-final against Nottingham Forest required two replays {{to produce a}} winner. Following a 2–2 draw in Nottingham and a goalless game in Bolton, the Wanderers prevailed 1–0 in another close game held at Old Trafford. Bolton drew Swansea Town, the last remaining Second Division club, in the semi-final. This meant Bolton did not meet a single First Division club in their path to the final. Three early goals gave Bolton a comfortable 3–0 win at White Hart Lane.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighth}} game, the {{competition}} {{had become more}} than a battle for hockey supremacy: it was also viewed as a battle between contrasting ways of life, particularly in the Soviet Union, where success in sport was used to promote the superiority of communism over western capitalism. An estimated 50 million Soviets watched the final contest, while in Canada, offices were closed and schools suspended classes to allow students to watch the game on television in gymnasium assemblies. The two teams ended the first period tied at two goals apiece, but Canada trailed at the second intermission, 5–3, and Soviet officials stated they would claim the overall victory if the game ended in a draw as a result <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> more goals throughout the series. Canada rallied {{in the third period}} to tie the game with seven minutes remaining.|$|E

5|$|Miller was {{selected}} for the 1956 Ashes tour, but could not bowl for a month because of a back injury from the first match. Miller captained the Australians against Leicester. Coming in at 3/175, Miller made his highest first-class score of 281 not out, striking 35fours in {{six and a half}} hours. A tougher fight awaited against Surrey at The Oval, who had England's Test spin combination of Laker and Tony Lock. Miller came in at 3/124 and struggled, scoring 18runs in his first 120minutes, his slowest two hours <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> in his career. As his partners continued to fall Miller ended unbeaten on 57 as Australia were bowled out for 259; Laker taking all ten wickets. Australia lost by ten wickets, its first loss to a county since 1912. As a result, sections of the Australian media began campaigning for Miller to replace Johnson as captain.|$|E

In Canada's qualification round game versus Germany, Weber scored Canada's second goal of the game in an 8–2 victory. His shot passed through the mesh net behind German goaltender Thomas Greiss and a video review was required to award the goal. Weber finished the tournament with six points in seven games, ranking second amongst defencemen in terms <b>of</b> <b>scoring,</b> and was named to the tournament's all-star team, which defeated the United States 3–2 in overtime to win the gold medal.

The rules were based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> (a change that would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, {{as a result of}} the meeting.

5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974.
