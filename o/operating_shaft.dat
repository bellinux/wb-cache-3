Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. A force measurement dynamometer has been constructed which will be the primary instrument used to measure the dynamic forces applied by a magnetic bearing to a rotating shaft. The dynamometer consists of two force measurement assemblies, named flexnounts, mounted directly to the shaft support bearing housings which utilize strain gage measurements to determine the magnitude of radial loads transmitted through the shaft. The design of the flexmounts focused on two main objectives: 1) minimizing coupling in the strain gage measurements to simplify calibration procedures and reduce cross-coupled stiffnesses, and 2) providing ample sensitivity for accurate force measurement while maintaining sufficient radial stifffiess to keep the first critical speed of the rotor-bearing system above the maximum <b>operating</b> <b>shaft</b> speed of the system. Analytical verification of the design was provided via a finite element model to determine the level of coupling between the primary axes of measurement and a lumped-inertia model of the rotor-bearing system to confirm critical speed locations. Finally, a static force calibration of the flexmounts was performed with the primary goal of measuring the forces applied by the magnetic bearing to within I?% accuracy over the widest range of forces possible...|$|E

In many cases, SFDs are also employed to control the placement of (rigid body) critical speeds displacing the machine operation into a speed range with effective structural isolation.

Compact aero jet engines implement ultra-short length SFDs (L/D ? 0. 2) to satisfy stringent weight and space demands with low parts count. A manufacturer, {{as part of a}} business plan to develop and commercialize energy efficient aircraft gas turbine engines, supported a multiple?year project to test novel SFD design spaces. In spite of the myriad of analyses and experimental result reported in the literature, there has not been to date a concerted effort to investigate the dynamic forced performance of a SFD through its many configurations: open ends vis-?-vis sealed ends conditions, and supply conditions with a fluid plenum or deep groove vis-?-vis feed holes directly impinging into the film land. This lecture presents experimental results obtained with a dedicated rig to evaluate short length SFDs operating under large dynamic loads (2. 2 kN ? 500 lbf) that produced circular and elliptical whirl orbits of varying amplitude, centered and off-centered. The lecture first reviews how SFDs work, placing emphasis on certain effects largely overlooked by practitioners who often regard the SFD as a simple non-rotating journal bearing. These effects are namely fluid inertia amplification in the supply or discharge grooves, pervasive air ingestion at high whirl frequencies, and effective end sealing means to enhance damping. The bulk of the lecture presents for various SFD configurations comparisons of experimentally identified damping (C) and inertia or added mass (M) coefficients versus amplitude of motion (orbit size) and static eccentricity position, both ranging from small to large; as large as the film clearance!

40|$|To {{refer to}} the Jacquard loom as a {{precursor}} of the computer is a common narrative in histories of computing beginning with Ada Lovelace comparing the punched card operated loom with the calculating engine designed by Charles Babbage: “We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves. ” But {{this does not mean}} that Jacquard invented the algebra of patterns. He only constructed the first widely known and used mechanism replacing the drawboy by punched cards to feed pattern information into his mechanism. To control a weave means to decide whether a warp thread is to be picked up or not. Weaving has therefore been a binary art from its very beginning, applying operations of pattern algebra for millennia. Jacquard’s cards were the end of this story rather than its beginning, reducing the weaver to an operator who had to step on a single treadle repeatedly.

40|$|Some {{shafting}} systems, such {{as those}} in certain types of rotorcraft, are mounted on flexible foundations. Since the foundation can deform, shaft segments are joined by flexible couplings to accommodate motion. Many of these couplings are non-constant velocity, meaning there is a difference in angular velocity between the input and output of the coupling, and this difference can lead to large motion in the shaft system. In this paper, a model is developed which allows the misalignment angle between the input and output shafts to vary dynamically with time, and this kinematic relationship creates a nonlinearity in the system. Through nonlinear analysis and accompanying simulation, this research explores some interesting and potentially harmful phenomena which occur at secondary resonances of such a shaft system. At particular <b>shaft</b> <b>operating</b> speeds, the <b>shaft</b> system may experience internal resonance, large and rapid amplitude growth, or chaotic motion, all of which can lead to destructive large amplitude vibration.
