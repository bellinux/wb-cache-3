2500|$|The {{idea for}} doing {{animation}} was born from the huge {{success of the}} film The Haunted Hotel, released by Vitagraph and directed by J. Stuart Blackton. It premiered in Paris in April 1907 and immediately there was a demand for more films using its incredible <b>object</b> <b>animation</b> techniques. According to a story told by Arnaud in 1922, Gaumont had ordered his staff {{to figure out the}} [...] "mystery of 'The Haunted Hotel'." [...] Cohl studied the film frame by frame, and in this way discovered the techniques of animation. It should be noted that Cohl, who was always seeking to enlarge his reputation in later life, never corroborated this story. Also, there were a fair number of films released before 1907 with stop-motion and/or drawn animation in them, by Blackton and others, any one of which could have taught Cohl animation, if he didn't just work the technique out on his own. The main reason The Haunted Hotel is significant {{is the fact that it}} was popular enough to make the arduous work of animation profitable.|$|E

40|$|In Computer Graphics L-systems {{represent}} a powerful rule-based language for modeling complex <b>objects</b> and their <b>animation.</b> However, designing <b>objects</b> and <b>animations</b> by rules {{is a difficult}} task, because designers often cannot foresee the consequences of rules. This {{is especially true for}} non-experts in the domain. Therefore, we propose to enhance an L-system based animation system with evolutionary features based on genetic algorithms (GAs). These features support the designers' task of interactively modeling <b>objects</b> and <b>animations.</b> Starting from an initial population of L-system-defined objects, the computer proposes iteratively new populations based on fitness value that are determined by the designers' creative or functional criteria. Moreover, automatic optimization of L-System-defined objects/animations is possible if an appropriate fitness function can be found for a given problem. We present a concept to integrate optimization by genetic algorithms into an L-system based animation system. Typical examples, such as automatic function optimization and creative interactive design of objects, illustrate our work...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for creating deformable <b>object</b> <b>animations.</b> A deformable <b>object</b> can be represented as a discrete lattice of particles, and transforming those particles defines a new state for the represented object. By applying shape matching techniques, {{we are able to}} adapt traditional mesh based animations to this representation. We then allow these particles to take place in a soft body physics simulation. By making the particles track positions defined in the animation, soft body tracking of user created animation has been made possible. by Mark A. Sullivan III. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|We {{present an}} {{interactive}} animation editor for complex deformable <b>object</b> <b>animations.</b> Given an existing animation, the artist directly manipulates the deformable body {{at any time}} frame, and the surrounding animation immediately adjusts in response. The automatic adjustments are designed to respect physics, preserve detail in both the input motion and geometry, respect prescribed bilateral contact constraints, and controllably and smoothly decay in spacetime. While the utility of interactive editing for rigid body and articulated figure animations is widely recognized, a corresponding approach to deformable bodies has not been technically feasible before. We achieve interactive rates by combining spacetime model reduction, rotation-strain coordinate warping, linearized elasticity, and direct manipulation. This direct editing tool can serve {{the final stages of}} animation production, which often call for detailed, direct adjustments that are otherwise tedious to realize by re-simulation or frame-by-frame editing...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the application of, {{and the challenges}} created by, {{a new class of}} objects in virtual environments: deformable <b>objects.</b> <b>Animation</b> techniques are examined to determine their relevance to the physically-based needs of virtual environments. Simulation techniques for one-, two- and three-dimensional objects are compared, with emphasis laid on the real-time solution for deformation. The problems inherent in applying a deformable object model to a virtual environment are discussed. Graphical models typically involve temporally and topologically invariant objects, with deformation computed as a series of still frames, which are then visualised by a standard renderer. However, within a virtual environment, temporally variant effects such as creep and flow become more important, since the object is being displayed in real-time. Computer graphics and virtual environments have different requirements for a deformable object model: virtual environments need real-time user interac [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for facilitating the use of physically based models by animators. The idea is to let the user guide motion {{at a high level}} of control by giving approximate desired trajectories and synchronization constraints between the objects over time, while a simulation module computes the final motion, dealing with collision detection and response, and enhancing realism. The objects, which are either isolated or components of an articulated structure, are guided through the specification of key-position and orientations, defined in a referential that can be fixed or relative to another <b>object.</b> The <b>animation</b> sequence is scripted by specifying a graph of synchronization constraints between objects over time.

50|$|Kali Yuga (2000, {{pixilation}} and <b>object</b> <b>animation)</b> Directed, {{produced and}} animated by Joanna Priestley. Kali Yuga was a performance and animation collaboration with filmmaker Joanna Priestley, composer Joseph Waters and contemporary classical ensemble, Fear No Music. It included physical performances by the musicians (playing {{upside down in}} wooden contraptions, dropping a bowling ball {{from the top of}} a ladder into a vat of pennies) with projected animation. The pixillation of yogi Diane Wilson was shot over six months in the forests and parks near Portland, Oregon. The <b>object</b> <b>animation</b> was an experiment using household tools, bolts, screws and nails. Kali Yuga is a modern score in the style of classic 1940s cartoons. It placed virtuosic demands on the performers, with 150 synchronization points.

5|$|The {{original}} Macintosh {{version of}} Myst {{was constructed in}} HyperCard. Each Age was a unique HyperCard stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and HyperTalk scripts, with image and QuickTime movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, Myst functions {{as a series of}} separate multimedia slides linked together by commands. As the main technical constraint that impacted Myst was slow CD-ROM drive read speeds, Cyan had to {{go to great lengths to}} make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible. Images were stored as 8-bit PICT resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression. Animated elements such as movies and <b>object</b> <b>animations</b> were encoded as QuickTime movies with Cinepak compression; in total, there were more than 66minutes of Quicktime animation. This careful processing made the finished graphics look like truecolor images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500kB to around 80kB.|$|R
