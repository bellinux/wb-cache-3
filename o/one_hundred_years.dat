5|$|Like the Patriarch in García Márquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch, Bolívar was an {{absolute}} dictator. The Patriarch is never identified by name; Bolívar, too, is identified chiefly by his title. Bolívar also invites comparison with Colonel Aureliano Buendía in <b>One</b> <b>Hundred</b> <b>Years</b> of Solitude: both characters believe the wars they have waged have been fruitless and overwhelming, and both face numerous attempts on their lives, but eventually die of natural causes. In his belief that life is controlled by fate, the General resembles Buendía in <b>One</b> <b>Hundred</b> <b>Years</b> of Solitude and Santiago Nasar in Chronicle of a Death Foretold.|$|E
