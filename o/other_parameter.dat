2500|$|... (At a {{time when}} there were no {{powerful}} digital computers), Karl Pearson accurately computed further boundaries, for example, separating the [...] "U-shaped" [...] from the [...] "J-shaped" [...] distributions. The lower boundary line (excess kurtosis + 2 − skewness2 = 0) is produced by skewed [...] "U-shaped" [...] beta distributions with both values of shape parameters α and β close to zero. [...] The upper boundary line (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is produced by extremely skewed distributions with very large values of one of the parameters and very small values of the <b>other</b> <b>parameter.</b> [...] Karl Pearson showed [...] that this upper boundary line (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is also the intersection with Pearson's distribution III, which has unlimited support in one direction (towards positive infinity), and can be bell-shaped or J-shaped. His son, Egon Pearson, showed [...] that the region (in the kurtosis/squared-skewness plane) occupied by the beta distribution (equivalently, Pearson's distribution I) as it approaches this boundary (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is shared with the noncentral chi-squared distribution. [...] Karl Pearson (Pearson 1895, pp.357, 360, 373–376) also showed that the gamma distribution is a Pearson type III distribution. Hence this boundary line for Pearson's type III distribution is known as the gamma line. (This can be shown {{from the fact that the}} excess kurtosis of the gamma distribution is 6/k and the square of the skewness is 4/k, hence (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is identically satisfied by the gamma distribution regardless of the value of the parameter [...] "k"). Pearson later noted that the chi-squared distribution is a special case of Pearson's type III and also shares this boundary line (as it is apparent from the fact that for the chi-squared distribution the excess kurtosis is 12/k and the square of the skewness is 8/k, hence (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is identically satisfied regardless of the value of the parameter [...] "k"). This is to be expected, since the chi-squared distribution X ~ χ2(k) is a special case of the gamma distribution, with parametrization X ~ Γ(k/2, 1/2) where k is a positive integer that specifies the [...] "number of degrees of freedom" [...] of the chi-squared distribution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accompanying}} plot shows {{these two}} solutions as surfaces {{in a space}} with horizontal axes of (sample excess kurtosis) and (sample squared skewness) and the shape parameters as the vertical axis. The surfaces are constrained by the condition that the sample excess kurtosis must be bounded by the sample squared skewness as stipulated in the above equation. [...] The two surfaces meet at the right edge defined by zero skewness. Along this right edge, both parameters are equal and the distribution is symmetric U-shaped for α = β < 1, uniform for α = β = 1, upside-down-U-shaped for 1 < α = β < 2 and bell-shaped for α = β > 2. [...] The surfaces also meet at the front (lower) edge defined by [...] "the impossible boundary" [...] line (excess kurtosis + 2 - skewness2 = 0). Along this front (lower) boundary both shape parameters approach zero, and the probability density is concentrated more at one end than the other end (with practically nothing in between), with probabilities [...] at the left end x = 0 and [...] at the right end x = 1. [...] The two surfaces become further apart towards the rear edge. [...] At this rear edge the surface parameters are quite different from each other. [...] As remarked, for example, by Bowman and Shenton, sampling {{in the neighborhood of}} the line (sample excess kurtosis - (3/2)(sample skewness)2 = 0) (the just-J-shaped portion of the rear edge where blue meets beige), [...] "is dangerously near to chaos", because at that line the denominator of the expression above for the estimate ν = α + β becomes zero and hence ν approaches infinity as that line is approached. [...] Bowman and Shenton [...] write that [...] "the higher moment parameters (kurtosis and skewness) are extremely fragile (near that line). However the mean and standard deviation are fairly reliable." [...] Therefore, the problem is for the case of four parameter estimation for very skewed distributions such that the excess kurtosis approaches (3/2) times the square of the skewness. [...] This boundary line is produced by extremely skewed distributions with very large values of one of the parameters and very small values of the <b>other</b> <b>parameter.</b> [...] See section titled [...] "Kurtosis bounded by the square of the skewness" [...] for a numerical example and further comments about this rear edge boundary line (sample excess kurtosis - (3/2)(sample skewness)2 = 0). [...] As remarked by Karl Pearson himself [...] this issue may not be of much practical importance as this trouble arises only for very skewed J-shaped (or mirror-image J-shaped) distributions with very different values of shape parameters that are unlikely to occur much in practice). [...] The usual skewed skewed-bell-shape distributions that occur in practice do not have this parameter estimation problem.|$|E
