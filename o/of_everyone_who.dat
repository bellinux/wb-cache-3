[...] This section covers things like modern Bohemianism, drug addictions and overdoses, lack of education, familial obligations, physical abuse, and the concept of personal responsibility for choices made. Then, in the section [...] "Grimmer Theory", he [...] "shows that the twentieth century's intellectuals have provided members of the underclass with a battery of rationalizations by which they can shift the blame for their misery away from their actions and attitudes and can unleash their hatred <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> challenges their outlook.". Focusing on ideas more than events, this section considers the concepts of relativism, determinism, and egalitarianism, and how each idea, in their creation by the bourgeoisie intellectuals, adversely affects the underclass.|$|E

[...] He also opined that Kirshner's portrayal of Jenny's [...] "vanity and chameleon-like qualities" [...] was perhaps too convincing.

Gilbert concluded that in early seasons, when writers wanted the audience's sympathy with Jenny's journey of self-realization, he [...] "wanted her to leave The Planet for good."

500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s an {{estimated}} 50 million cases of smallpox {{occurred in the}} world each year. To eradicate smallpox, each outbreak had to be stopped from spreading, by isolation of cases and vaccination <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> lived close by. This process is known as [...] "ring vaccination". The key to this strategy was the monitoring of cases in a community (known as surveillance) and containment. The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases, as many cases {{did not come to}} the attention of the authorities. The fact that humans are the only reservoir for smallpox infection, and that carriers did not exist, played a significant role in the eradication of smallpox. The WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. Early on, donations of vaccine were provided primarily by the Soviet Union and the United States, but by 1973, more than 80 percent of all vaccine was produced in developing countries.|$|E

[...] A Capcom representative stated that the credits, a pre-rendered movie, had the Clover Studio logo within it, and they had [...] "no legal right to use the Clover logo in a game they were not involved with directly". Since they also lacked the source to the credits, they opted to remove them entirely from the game. Ready at Dawn's co-founder Didier Malenfant also claimed that the Wii version of Ōkami took up much more space on the game media than the PlayStation 2 version, and that the movie was cut in order to fit everything on a single game disk, however despite these claims, the credit sequence was restored in the Japanese release of the Wii version and revealed that the port was co-developed by Tose, having provided additional planners, designers, programmers and test players.
