50|$|Cooling load {{profiles}} for UFAD {{systems and}} overhead systems are different, mainly {{due to the}} thermal storage effect of the lighter-weight raised floor panels compared to the heavier mass of a structural floor slab. The mere presence of the raised floor reduces {{the ability of the}} slab to store heat, thereby producing for the system with a raised floor higher peak cooling loads compared to the system without a raised floor. In the OH system, particularly in perimeter zones, part of the incoming solar heat gain is stored in the floor slab during the day, thus reducing peak zone cooling loads, and released at night when the system is off. In a UFAD system, the presence of the raised flooring transforms the solar absorbing massive floor slab into a lighter weight material, leading to relatively higher peak zone cooling loads. A modeling study based on EnergyPlus simulations showed that, generally, UFAD has a peak cooling load 19% higher than an <b>overhead</b> <b>cooling</b> load and 22% and 37% of the total zone UFAD cooling load goes to the supply plenum in the perimeter and interior, respectively.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simplified calculation method for design cooling loads in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems. The simplified design tool is able to account for key differences between UFAD and traditional mixing overhead (OH) systems. These include: (1) difference between design day cooling load profiles, (2) impact of a thermally stratified environment for UFAD vs. well-mixed for OH, and (3) impact of heat transfer (temperature gain) in underfloor air supply plenums. The new design tool allows the use of a familiar load calculation procedure for OH mixing systems as input to the UFAD design tool. Based on 87 EnergyPlus simulations, four regression models have been developed to transform the OH cooling load into the UFAD cooling load, and then to split this total load between the supply plenum, zone (room), and return plenum. The regression models mainly depend on floor level, and position (interior or perimeter) and orientation of the zone under analysis. Although considered in the analysis, supply air temperature, window-to-wall ratio, internal heat load, plenum configuration, climate, presence of the carpet and structure type do not strongly influence the developed models. The results show that, generally, UFAD has a peak cooling load 19 % higher than an <b>overhead</b> <b>cooling</b> load and 22 % and 37 % of the total zone UFAD cooling load goes to the supply plenum in the perimeter and interior, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of cloud computing {{has created a}} demand for more datacenters, which in turn, {{has led to the}} substantial consumption of electricity by computing systems and cool-ing units. Although recently built warehouse-scale datacen-ters can nearly completely eliminate <b>cooling</b> <b>overhead,</b> small to medium datacenters, which still spend nearly half of their power on cooling, still labor under heavy <b>cooling</b> <b>overhead.</b> Often overlooked by the cloud computing community, these types of datacenters are not in the minority: They are respon-sible for more than 70 % of the entire electrical power used by datacenters. Thus, to tackle the cooling inefficiencies of these datacenters, we propose ambient temperature-aware capping (ATAC), which maximizes power efficiency while minimizing overheating. ATAC senses the ambient tempera-ture of each server and triggers a new performance capping mechanism to achieve 38 % savings in cooling power and 7 % savings in total power with less than 1 % degradation in performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a closed (or semi-closed) {{greenhouse}} {{that is used to}} harvest solar energy can be attractive to reduce the fossil fuel input or for an increment of water use efficiency. To examine the concept, a 550 m 2 greenhouse was built in The Netherlands and experiments were carried out with a pepper crop. This paper reports only on the water balance during the summer period of such a greenhouse and examines the energy partitioning of the solar radiation in the greenhouse. Results show that the percentage of drainage out of the irrigation changed significantly among the days but was on average 34 %. The major water input to the greenhouse came from irrigation and only a small fraction was due to fogging in some of the days. The remainder of irrigation minus drainage was transpired by the plants. On average, 15 % of the water was lost from the greenhouse by exchange of vapor with the outside air. This was partly by leakage, but also deliberately when the greenhouse was ventilated with outside air to remove a moisture excess during night. The rest condensed, mainly on the heat exchangers of the cooling units, but partly on the roof and side walls as well. Thus, roughly 85 % of water used for irrigation was recaptured. The results further show that the global radiation inside the greenhouse was on average 0. 57 ± 0. 06 of the outside radiation. The heat load on the greenhouse was mainly removed by the <b>overhead</b> <b>cooling</b> units who removed sensible and latent heat with an average sensible to latent ratio of 0. 62. This ratio changed among the days and increased approximately linearly with solar radiation. The energy extracted by the coolers was about 0. 73 ± 0. 18 of the solar radiation entering the greenhouse, which means that it was 42 % on average of the outside solar radiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} {{improvement of}} today's computer systems is usually accompanied by increased chip power consumption and system temperature. Modern CPUs dissipate {{an average of}} 70 - 100 W power while spatial and temporal power variations result in hotspots with even higher power density (up to 300 W/cm^ 2). The coming years will continue to witness {{a significant increase in}} CPU power dissipation due to advanced multi-core architectures and 3 D integration technologies. Nowadays the problems of increased chip power density, leakage power and system temperatures have become major obstacles for further improvement in chip performance. The conventional air cooling based heat sink has been proved to be insufficient for three dimensional integrated circuits (3 D-ICs). Hence better cooling solutions are necessary. Micro-fluidic cooling, which integrates micro-channel heat sinks into silicon substrates of the chip and uses liquid flow to remove heat inside the chip, is an effective active cooling scheme for 3 D-ICs. While the micro-fluidic cooling provides excellent cooling to 3 D-ICs, the associated <b>overhead</b> (<b>cooling</b> power consumed by the pump to inject the coolant through micro-channels) is significant. Moreover, the 3 D-IC structure also imposes constraints on micro-channel locations (basically resource conflict with through-silicon-vias TSVs or other structures). In this work, we investigate optimized micro-channel configurations that address the aforementioned considerations. We develop three micro-channel structures (hotspot optimized cooling configuration, bended micro-channel and hybrid cooling network) that can provide sufficient cooling to 3 D-IC with minimum cooling power overhead, while at the same time, compatible with the existing electrical structure such as TSVs. These configurations can achieve up to 70 % cooling power savings compared with the configuration without any optimization. Based on these configurations, we then develop a micro-fluidic cooling based dynamic thermal management approach that maintains the chip temperature through controlling the fluid flow rate (pressure drop) through micro-channels. These cooling configurations are designed after the electrical parts, and therefore, compatible with the current standard IC design flow. Furthermore, the electrical, thermal, cooling and mechanical aspects of 3 D-IC are interdependent. Hence the conventional design flow that designs the cooling configuration after electrical aspect is finished will result in inefficiencies. In order to overcome this problem, we then investigate electrical-thermal co-design methodology for 3 D-ICs. Two co-design problems are explored: TSV assignment and micro-channel placement co-design, and gate sizing and fluidic cooling co-design. The experimental results show that the co-design enables a fundamental power-performance improvement over the conventional design flow which separates the electrical and cooling design. For example, the gate sizing and fluidic cooling co-design achieves 12 % power savings under the same circuit timing constraint and 16 % circuit speedup under the same power budget...|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] Pyrus communis ‘Rosemarie’, a potentially lucrative blushed pear cultivar, poor fruit colour has been ascribed to pre-harvest red colour loss during periods of high temperature. High temperatures combined with high irradiances also lead to sunburn on pome fruit. The use of pulsed <b>overhead</b> evaporative <b>cooling</b> (EC) to improve red colour and reduce sunburn in two blushed pear cultivars was evaluated over four seasons (2000 / 01 to 2003 / 04) in Stellenbosch, South Africa. ‘Rosemarie’ fruit blush was usually but not always improved under EC, with a late application (starting two weeks before harvest) yielding the best improvement. Peel anthocyanin concentrations were increased under EC. Incidence of sunburn was reduced during some years, but increased in EC-treated fruit during 2003 / 04 due to system failure on a hot day. EC initiated early in fruit development initially led to larger fruit with a lower TSS concentration and firmness, but this effect was gradually eliminated following reductions in EC water use. EC {{had no effect on}} ‘Forelle’ pear fruit colour or mass, but reduced firmness and TSS when started early in the season. Sunburn was only recorded in EC-treated fruit during 2002 / 03 due to system failure on a warm day. Though EC could be used to improve ‘Rosemarie’ fruit colour in warm production areas, its effect was relatively small compared to colour change in response to fluctuating temperature. The increased risk of sunburn during system ‘downtime’ highlights the requirement for a highly reliable system...|$|R
5000|$|The {{model is}} focused on the energy {{transformation}} to usable heat and flexible deployment where heat is required in a larger scale, with constant heat demand. The micro data centers optimally don't require any <b>overhead</b> installations for <b>cooling</b> or no-break systems. The cooling of the servers is facilitated by sourcing cold water from the heat user, thus creating a synergy between different industries.Due to the minimised overhead, these nodes can be deployed in large quantities near or within network hubs for urban or office areas or even as part of a non-data center facility which can directly benefit from the reusable heat. This allows for fast network access and simple energy reuse.The micro edge nodes (10-100 kW) function as forward locations of the core data centers. The edge nodes provide services like data processing for IoT systems, data caching for digital content (YouTube, Netflix, etc.) and fast access to cloud services. The edge nodes are continuously replicated with the core datacenters and several strategic other edge nodes. This provides constant availability through geo-redundancy.|$|R

40|$|Pronounced non-uniformities in {{combustor}} exit {{flow temperature}} (hot-streaks), which arise because of discrete {{injection of fuel}} and dilution air jets within the combustor and because of end-wall cooling flows, affect both component life and aerodynamics. Because {{it is very difficult}} to quantitatively predict the affects of these temperature non-uniformities on the heat transfer rates, designers are forced to budget for hot-streaks in the cooling system design process. Consequently, components are designed for higher working temperatures than the mass-mean gas temperature, and this imposes a significant overall performance penalty. An inadequate cooling budget can lead to reduced component life. An improved understanding of hot-streak migration physics, or robust correlations based on reliable experimental data, would help designers minimise the <b>overhead</b> on <b>cooling</b> flow that is currently a necessity. A number of recent research projects sponsored by a range of industrial gas turbine and aero-engine manufacturers attest to the growing interest in hot-streak physics. This paper presents measurements of surface and end-wall heat transfer rate for an HP nozzle guide vane (NGV) operating as part of a full HP turbine stage in an annular transonic rotating turbine facility. Measurements were conducted with both uniform stage inlet temperature and with two non-uniform temperature profiles. The temperature profiles were non-dimensionally similar to profiles measured in an engine. A difference of one half of an NGV pitch in the circumferential (clocking) position of the hot-streak with respect to the NGV was used to investigate the affect of clocking on the vane surface and end-wall heat transfer rate. The vane surface pressure distributions, and the results of a flow-visualisation study, which are also given, are used to aid interpretation of the results. The results are compared to two-dimensional predictions conducted using two different boundary layer methods. Experiments were conducted in the Isentropic Light Piston Facility (ILPF) at QinetiQ Farnborough, a short duration engine-size turbine facility. Mach number, Reynolds number and gas-to-wall temperature ratios were correctly modelled. It is believed that the heat transfer measurements presented in this paper are the first of their kind.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] (Pyrus communis), a late season blushed pear cultivar grown in South Africa, requires a minimum of 12 -weeks cold storage (- 0. 5 °C) to ripen evenly. Mealiness, a dry texture disorder, may develop at this time. In contrast to other pear cultivars, longer cold storage periods result in less mealiness. This {{could be related to}} insufficient total ACC build up and ethylene production, during the first 12 weeks of cold storage, for juicy texture development, during ripening. ‘Forelle’ pears were stored for 3 weeks at - 0. 5 °C, treated with ethylene (100 μL L- 1, 24 h, 20 °C), stored at 20 °C for 2 days and thereafter 3 weeks at - 0. 5 °C. Ethylene treatment led to an increase in mealiness after this period. However there were no differences in treated and control fruit following further ripening at 15 °C for 7 days. Mealiness could not be linked to insufficient ethylene during shorter storage periods. Harvest maturity, a factor known to influence mealiness, was tested by harvesting fruit 2 weeks prior to commercial harvest, during commercial harvest, and 2 and 4 weeks after commercial harvest. Mealiness occurred at all harvest dates after 6 weeks at - 0. 5 °C and 7 days at 15 °C. Storage temperature was also tested as another factor influencing mealiness. Fruit were stored at - 0. 5 °C, 4 °C and 7. 5 °C for 6 weeks and ripened for 7 days at 15 °C. Fruit stored at 4 °C and 7. 5 °C ripened with 0 and 8 % mealiness, respectively, in contrast to 70 % in control fruit. Results could, however, not be confirmed in 2002 and 2003 as all treatments exhibited low mealiness levels (< 4 %). As high temperatures prior to harvest may influence mealiness, <b>overhead</b> evaporative <b>cooling</b> was applied during 2003 from early fruit development or from 2 weeks prior to harvest.

First, the simplicity and nanoscale dimensions of these detectors make it possible to easily operate multiple elements and to closely space these elements such that the active area of an array is essentially identical to that of a single element. This ability to eliminate seam-loss between elements, as well as the performance advantages gained by using multiple smaller elements, makes the multi-element approach an attractive way to increase the general detector performance (detection efficiency and maximum counting rate) as well as to provide new capabilities (photon-number, spatial, and spectral resolution). Additionally, in contrast to semiconductor-based single-photon detectors, SNSPDs have a negligible probability of spontaneously emitting photons during the detection process, eliminating a potential source of crosstalk between array elements. (cont.) However, the SNSPD can be susceptible to other forms of crosstalk, such as thermal or electromagnetic interactions between elements, so it was important to investigate the operation and limitations of multi-element SNSPDs. This thesis will introduce the concept of a multi-element SNSPD with a continuous active area and will investigate its performance advantages, its potential drawbacks and finally its application to intensity correlation measurements.
