Sequence-based algorithms require only the sequence of two proteins {{in order to create}} an alignment. Sequence methods are generally fast and suitable for searching whole genomes for circularly permuted pairs of proteins. Structure-based methods require 3D structures of both proteins being considered. They are often slower than sequence-based methods, but are able to detect circular permutations between distantly related proteins with low sequence similarity. Some structural methods are topology independent, meaning that they are also able to detect more complex rearrangements than circular permutation.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type <b>of</b> <b>input</b> (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E

25|$|A {{parallel}} {{phenomenon has}} appeared involving {{the increased use}} <b>of</b> <b>input</b> methods to write Chinese characters {{and the difficulty of}} remembering such a large set of characters. The use of word processors allows the user to write using characters that the user does not remember how to write by hand. This resulted in the reappearance in the 1980s in Japan of complex older characters which had been removed from the official lists. The number of characters available for use on a word processor far exceeds the number of characters a person can readily remember how to write by hand. While many have blamed the use <b>of</b> <b>input</b> methods for difficulty remembering how to write the characters by hand, widespread use <b>of</b> <b>input</b> methods may be responsible for a reversal in the decline of kanji use in Japan.|$|E

30|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the relevance of}} these scores in the input–output network, we develop the concepts in the context. First suppose production of sector j increases due to a shock on final demand. This initiates two chains of effects. On the one hand, sector j increases its demand for inputs. This demand is matched {{by an increase in}} the supply <b>of</b> <b>inputs</b> <b>of</b> j’s suppliers. In {{order to be able to}} increase supply <b>of</b> <b>inputs,</b> j’s suppliers had to increase production, which in turn, means an increase in demand <b>of</b> <b>inputs,</b> including the output of sector j, and so on. On the other hand, other chain of effects starts because there is more output available to be used as inputs after sector j increased it demand. This means that sector j increases its supply <b>of</b> <b>inputs</b> for other sectors. With more inputs available, the other sectors purchase more inputs and increase production. This increase in production, in turn, increases the supply <b>of</b> <b>inputs,</b> and so on.|$|R

40|$|At present, {{almost all}} model order {{reduction}} methods assume single-input single-output (SISO) systems or systems {{with a small}} number <b>of</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs. Few methods can deal with systems {{with a large number}} <b>of</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems appear for example in modeling of integrated circuits. The number <b>of</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs sometimes is very large, even close to the number of state variables. In this paper we propose a novel model reduction technique which can efficiently perform model reduction for linear systems with a large number <b>of</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs. Motivated by the superposition property of linear systems, model order reduction is performed separately with respect to each column <b>of</b> the <b>input</b> matrix. Then, the output response of the original multi-input system is approximated by the summation of the output responses of the reduced-order single-input systems corresponding to each column <b>of</b> the <b>input</b> matrix. The proposed method applies to both multi-input single-output system...|$|R
30|$|Constraint (11) {{ensures that}} the value {{for each of the}} {{category}} <b>of</b> <b>inputs</b> for DMU_ 1 is not greater than 1. Constraints (12) through (14) guarantee that the efficiency score of each DMU is lesser than or equal to 1. In other words, these constraints are imposed to ensure that no DMUs and no category <b>of</b> <b>inputs</b> exceed the maximum efficiency level, which has been set equal to 1. Constraint (15) implies that the total value of the category <b>of</b> <b>inputs</b> <b>of</b> DMU_j is equal to 1. Constraint (16) ensures that each of the value <b>of</b> the <b>input,</b> category <b>of</b> <b>inputs,</b> and output variables, are strictly non-negative. This condition guarantees that the solution set in these variables are non-negative since the model cannot detect inefficiency when the values for the input and output variables are negative integers. The generated value for each DMU will determine whether the department is performing efficiently or not. If the efficiency score is equal to 1, it implies that the DMU is efficient, otherwise, it is inefficient. The results from the MODEA approach will also present the efficiency score of each of the category <b>of</b> <b>inputs</b> pertaining to a particular DMU.|$|R
