5|$|The dwarfs {{return to}} their cottage and find Snow White {{seemingly}} dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>in</b> the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince, who had previously met and {{fallen in love with}} Snow White, learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.|$|E

25|$|The next {{sighting}} {{between any}} of the participants was on 9 August, when Taeping and Fiery Cross exchanged signals some 12° north of the Equator, in the Atlantic. Winds were light and variable, so they remained in company until 27 August, when a breeze sprang up which carried Taeping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>in</b> four or five hours, whilst Fiery Cross suffered the enormous misfortune to remain becalmed for another 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|LGV {{may begin}} as a self-limited painless genital ulcer that {{occurs at the}} contact site 3–12 days after {{infection}}. Women rarely notice a primary infection because the initial ulceration where the organism penetrates the mucosal layer is often located <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> <b>in</b> the vaginal wall. In men fewer than 1/3 of those infected notice {{the first signs of}} LGV. This primary stage heals in a few days. Erythema nodosum occurs in 10% of cases.|$|E
25|$|There {{were those}} who {{preferred}} Britannicus over Nero, such as Claudius' freedman Narcissus. Unfortunately for his cause, Narcissus was away in Campania when the emperor was poisoned, while Britannicus and his sisters, Octavia and Antonia, were kept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>in</b> their rooms by Agrippina. That way none could challenge Nero's succession. If one thought that Britannicus' claim should take precedence, the response was that Nero too {{was the son of}} Claudius, with Agrippina linking him back to Augustus. It didn't help that many were convinced that Britannicus was no longer in the line of succession, a direct effect of the propaganda against him by Agrippina. Nero spoke the eulogy at the emperor's funeral and took sole power. Claudius' new will, which either granted joint-rule to Britannicus and Nero or just Britannicus, was suppressed by the new emperor's men in the senate.|$|E

25|$|The Apex Building was {{the last}} to be {{constructed}} and dedicated. A major impetus for the building's construction came in June 1935, when the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) headquarters at C Street NW and 21st Street NW was razed {{to make way for the}} Federal Reserve Board Building. The FTC petitioned the Commission on Fine Arts to permit it to occupy the Apex Building. Testing for the foundation began in September 1936, and was completed shortly thereafter. With design work long completed and President Roosevelt expressing his wish that the structure be built, a $3.1 million contract for the building was signed on December 29, 1936. Using the George Washington trowel, President Roosevelt laid the cornerstone for the building on July 12, 1937. The building's $3.665 million cost was paid for out of Public Works Administration funds, and officials estimated it would be ready for occupation by January 1, 1938. Demolition of the old foundation for the unbuilt Washington Memorial occurred in July 1937, and much of the Apex Building's steel superstructure was rising by then as well. The great depth of the building's foundation meant that the crane operator lifting the steel beams into place was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>in</b> the basement, and a series of telephone links from observers on the street relayed instructions to him. By December 1937, the building was two months ahead of schedule.|$|E

The fire was too hot for her cargo to be salvaged when Hyacinths crew approached the stranded ship. The Germans, however, were able to salvage a great deal of her cargo after the fire had burnt out.|$|E

The allies were trapped in the wedge between the Rhine and Neckar Rivers. Backed up against the rivers, the allied army prepared for battle. For recognition, they wore a badge of oat straws while the Palatine warriors wore hazel leaves on their helmets. Frederick marshaled his army in an echelon formation with his vanguard and men-at-arms in the center. On either side of the central mass was a double line of mounted crossbowmen.

2500|$|In early 1985, Models started {{recording}} {{material for}} their next album, Out of Mind, Out of Sight, produced by Mark Opitz, Reggie Lucas and Nick Launay.

It was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US. Models then went on a national tour with I'm Talking in July 1985.

2500|$|During the Great Siege, the British {{garrison}} of Gibraltar faced a French and Spanish army entrenched {{on the low}} {{ground of}} the isthmus that links Gibraltar with Spain. The British controlled the high ground of the Rock of Gibraltar, which reaches a height of [...] at its north end. Although this was a major advantage for the British gunners, as it gave them an increased range and {{a clear view of}} the enemy, it also posed significant problems. Enemies close to their positions could not be targeted as existing gun carriages would not allow the amount of vertical depression required to hit such a close target. Gunners tried to deal with this by propping up the rear of the carriages, but this was a clumsy solution that fixed the guns in position. It consequently exposed them to severe danger as they had to load the guns in full view of enemy counter-fire, rather than <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> <b>in</b> an embrasure or battery.|$|E

2500|$|The NVA {{never took}} part in {{full-scale}} combat, although it participated in a support role in {{the suppression of the}} Prague Spring of 1968, and NVA officers often served as combat advisers in Africa. Some of the first NVA advisors went to the Republic of the Congo in 1973. During the 1980s at various times the NVA had advisors in Algeria, Angola, Ethiopia, Guinea, Iraq, Libya, Mozambique, South Yemen, and Syria. When the Soviet Union prepared to occupy Czechoslovakia in 1968, the GDR government committed the 7th Panzer Division and the 11th Motorised Infantry Division to support the intervention (assigned to 20th Guards Army and 1st Guards Tank Army respectively), becoming the first deployment of German troops outside Germany {{for the first time since}} the Second World War.

2500|$|On {{the drive}} back to Portsea, Holt {{suggested}} that the group stop at Cheviot Beach for a swim – it was about 12:15 p.m., {{and he wanted to}} cool down and work up an appetite before lunch. He knew the area well and had swum there many times before, in 1960 even salvaging a porthole from the SS Cheviot, the shipwreck that had given the beach its name. Holt did not hesitate in entering the water, despite a large swell and visible currents and eddies. Alan Stewart was the only other swimmer, as the others considered it unsafe. Stewart stayed close to shore, and even in the shallows felt a strong undertow. However, Holt swam into deeper water and was dragged out to sea. The others called out to him, but he did not raise his arms or cry for help. He soon slipped under the waves and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> <b>in</b> a manner which Marjorie Gillespie described as [...] "like a leaf being taken out [...] so quick and final".|$|E
