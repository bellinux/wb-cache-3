5000|$|The alarm {{was raised}} at around 10:30, {{with the first}} crews {{arriving}} within five minutes. A serious fire was seen to be in progress, and a [...] "Make Pumps 10" [...] message was sent to control almost immediately (additional appliances required, which {{in addition to those}} already there would total 10). As part of this request for reinforcements, a [...] "Persons Reported" [...] message was sent, indicating persons were requiring urgent assistance and rescue. 70 firemen attended to fight the fire, with water poured onto the building from turntable ladders. It was found that efforts at rescue were futile due to the intense heat, and the difficulties in entering the building.Escape from the building had been prevented due to fire on the stairs, caused by polyurethane foam, and the escape doors from the first and second floors to the fire escape were found to have been locked from the inside. Eventually, no persons were seen at the windows, and any hopes of rescue for those inside ended when the roof of the building collapsed. Many attempts were made to enter the building where the employees were believed to be, but intense heat drove back the firemen. The Glasgow Fire Service personnel eventually gained access to the building, by cutting through the steel doors using <b>oxy-propane</b> <b>cutting</b> gear. The dead were found inside the factory to have died due to the inhalation of smoke, the burning of polyurethane foam resulting in poisonous fumes, fatal when inhaled.|$|E
