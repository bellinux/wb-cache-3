These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, posed {{a threat to the}} station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage {{to other parts of the}} station, such as the solar arrays. Micrometeoroids also posed a risk to spacewalking cosmonauts, as such objects could puncture their spacesuits, causing them to depressurise. Meteor showers in particular posed a risk, and, during such storms, the crews slept in their Soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should Mir be damaged.|$|E
5|$|Bosniak {{scholars}} {{object to}} the ostensibly negative portrayal of Muslim characters in Andrić's works. During the 1950s, his most vocal Bosniak detractors accused him <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> plagiarism to being a Serb nationalist, and made remarks insinuating that he was homosexual. Some {{went so far as}} to call for his Nobel Prize to be taken away. Most Bosniak criticism of his works appeared in the period immediately before the breakup of Yugoslavia and in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. In early 1992, a Bosniak nationalist in Višegrad destroyed a statue of Andrić with a sledgehammer. Twenty years later, in 2012, filmmaker Emir Kusturica and Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik unveiled another statue of Andrić in Višegrad, this time as part of the construction of an ethno-town called Andrićgrad, sponsored by Kusturica and the Government of Republika Srpska. Andrićgrad was officially inaugurated in June 2014, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.|$|E
5|$|The skyrocketing {{prices were}} {{driven by the}} high {{salaries}} paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money. The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could {{not keep up with}} the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow Cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover rate of more than 1,000 percent. Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, Lathrop High School ran in two shifts: one in the morning and the other in the afternoon to teach students who also worked eight hours a day. More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services. Waiting in line became a fact of life in Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks McDonald's became No. 2 in the world for sales—behind only the recently opened Stockholm store. Alyeska and its contractors bought in bulk from local stores, causing shortages <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> cars to tractor parts, water softener salt, batteries and ladders.|$|E

In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport, initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand.

500|$|British cinema in the Second World War {{marked the}} {{evacuation}} of children from London with social comedies such as Those Kids from Town (1942) where the evacuees go to stay with an earl (a country nobleman), while in Cottage to Let (1941) and Went the Day Well? (1942) the English countryside is thick with spies. Gasbags (1941) offered [...] "zany, irreverent, knockabout" [...] comedy making fun <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> barrage balloons to concentration camps.

500|$|The {{importance}} of bread as a daily staple meant that bakers {{played a crucial}} role in any medieval community. Bread consumption was high in most of Western Europe by the 14th century. Estimates of bread consumption from different regions are fairly similar: around [...] of bread per person per day. Among the first town guilds to be organized were the bakers', and laws and regulations were passed to keep bread prices stable. The English Assize of Bread and Ale of 1266 listed extensive tables where the size, weight, and price of a loaf of bread were regulated in relation to grain prices. The baker's profit margin stipulated in the tables was later increased through successful lobbying from the London Baker's Company by adding the cost <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> firewood and salt to the baker's wife, house, and dog. Since bread was such a central part of the medieval diet, swindling by those who were trusted with supplying the precious commodity to the community was considered a serious offense. Bakers who were caught tampering with weights or adulterating dough with less expensive ingredients could receive severe penalties. This gave rise to the [...] "baker's dozen": a baker would give 13 for the price of 12, to be certain of not being known as a cheat.|$|E

Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News said that during her music career, Selena [...] "merges Tejano's infectious cumbia rhythm with street-savvy R, old-school soul, dancehall reggae, sizzling salsa, and trippy, loopy funk". Selena's recordings expressed [...] "love and pain, as well as strength and passion", according to Charles Tatum. She also recorded independently driven, female-empowerment-themed compositions; [...] "Si La Quieres", [...] "¿Qué Creías?", [...] "Ya Ves" [...] and [...] "Ya No", which centered around inappropriate relationships and recovery from domestic violence. Peter Watrous of The New York Times said Selena's voice [...] "sometimes quivered", and that she [...] "roughed it up a bit". He continued, [...] "t its best, it had a coolness, a type of unadorned passion". Ilan Stavans called her music [...] "cursi-melodramatic, cheesy, overemotional, {{not too far from}} Juan Gabriel and a relative of Iglesias". Richard Corliss of Time magazine said her songs [...] "are perky, cheerful rather than soulful", and that earlier recordings, [...] "with their tinny, Tijuana Brass charts, and keyboards that evoke calliopes, are ideal for the fairground or merry-go-round". Corliss calls Selena's singing an [...] "expert mimicry <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> Édith Piaf's melodramatic contralto to the coloratura riffs of Mariah Carey.

[...] Most of her singing career was spent performing in concert and recital in major music venues and with famous orchestras throughout the United States and Europe between 1925 and 1965. Although offered roles with many important European opera companies, Anderson declined, as she had no training in acting. She preferred to perform in concert and recital only.
