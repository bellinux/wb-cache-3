5|$|According to {{accounts}} from his life, he preached {{the importance of}} realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> <b>and</b> criticized love towards perishable things. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to the God and guru. He {{stressed the importance of}} surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic in the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self,</b> <b>and</b> his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|Zhu Xi {{was one of}} {{many critics}} who argued that {{government}} schools did not sufficiently encourage personal cultivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> molded students into officials who cared only for profit and salary. Not all social and political philosophers in the Song period blamed the examination system as {{the root of the problem}} (but merely as a method of recruitment and selection), emphasizing instead the gentry's failure to take responsibility in society as the cultural elite. Zhu Xi also laid emphasis on the Four Books, a series of Confucian classics that would become the official introduction of education for all Confucian students, yet were initially discarded by his contemporaries. After his death, his commentary on the Four Books found appeal amongst scholar-officials and in 1241 his writings were adopted as mandatory readings for examination candidates with the support of Emperor Lizong (r. 1224–1264).|$|E

25|$|If {{we accept}} pains as special qualia known {{absolutely}} but exclusively by the solitary minds that perceive them, {{this may be}} taken to ground a Cartesian view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> consciousness. Our consciousness, of pains anyway, would seem unassailable. Against this, one might acknowledge the absolute fact of one's own pain, but claim skepticism {{about the existence of}} anyone else's pains. Alternatively, one might take a behaviorist line and claim that our pains are merely neurological stimulations accompanied by a disposition to behave.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{model of}} {{philosophical}} practice {{is closest to}} those philosophers who sought to form {{a view of the}} whole of reality, and to do so by using and resisting the specialized knowledge of their time. It has been read as a form of pragmatism, but also as an attempt to disengage ideas and experiences that developed in the West under the influence of Christianity from the categories of Greek philosophy. His thought has been called the inverse of Schopenhauer's philosophy, affirming the supreme value of life and the reality and depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> eschewing fecklessness.|$|E
25|$|In neurologically normal subjects, Blanke {{and colleagues}} then {{showed that the}} {{conscious}} experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> body {{being in the same}} location depends on multisensory integration in the TPJ. Using event-related potentials, Blanke and colleagues showed the selective activation of the TPJ 330–400 ms after stimulus onset when healthy volunteers imagined themselves in the position and visual perspective that generally are reported by people experiencing spontaneous OBEs. Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the same subjects impaired mental transformation of the participant's own body. No such effects were found with stimulation of another site or for imagined spatial transformations of external objects, suggesting the selective implication of the TPJ in mental imagery of one's own body.|$|E

25|$|Since Descartes's {{proposal}} of dualism, {{it became a}} general consensus that the mind had {{become a matter of}} philosophy and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness- that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness. Antonio Damasio and Gerald Edelman are two neuroscientists that have led the move to neural correlates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> of consciousness. Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation {{play a critical role in}} high level cognition, and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook. The current problem consciousness researchers face involves explaining how and why consciousness arises from neural computation. In his research on this problem, Edelman has developed a theory of consciousness, in which he has coined the terms primary consciousness and secondary consciousness.|$|E
25|$|The Fard Salah {{are all of}} the {{compulsory}} Muslim prayers - {{the five}} daily prayers, {{as well as the}} Friday prayer (Salat al-Jumu'ah) and the Eid prayers (Eid prayers). Non-performance of any these prayers renders one a non-Muslim according to the stricter Hanbali madhhab of Sunni Islam, while the other Sunni madhhabs simply consider doing so a major sin. However, all four madhhabs agree by consensus that denial of the compulsory status of these prayers invalidates the faith of those who do so, rendering them non-Muslim. Fardh prayers (as with all fard actions) are further classed as fard al-ayn (obligation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self)</b> <b>and</b> fard al-kifayah (obligation of sufficiency). Fard al-Ayn are actions considered obligatory on individuals, for which the individual will be held to account if the actions are neglected. Fard al-Kifayah are actions considered obligatory on the Muslim community at large, so that if some people within the community carry it out no Muslim is considered blameworthy, but if no one carries it out, all incur a collective punishment.|$|E
500|$|The {{philosophical}} {{premises of}} Yajnavalkya and Patanjali are different, according to Richard Rosen.

Yajnavalkya accepts the Advaita Vedanta premise of non-dualism, [...] "essential oneness of self and nature", and defines yoga as path to intense interconnectedness between Jiva and Paramatman, where the union of self and supreme self is realized.|$|E

500|$|Most of Godwin's {{works are}} based on themes or events taken from her own life. The characters, {{settings}} and narratives vary from novel-to-novel, but common topics have included family, the position of women in society and relationships, a woman's artistic and career pursuits, {{and the role of}} religious faith. According to The Intellectual in Twentieth-Century Southern Literature, Godwin's characters [...] "struggle intellectually to navigate the mazes of race, class, gender, family, faith and religion." [...] According to Contemporary Literary Criticism, [...] "she writes about issues pertaining to women - male-female roles, marriage, family, personal freedom, self-concept, and self-actualization." [...] Author Jane Hill said Godwin's books are about co-existing with authorities, the role of decision-making in life, careers as an artist, and the consequences of thwarted ambition. Much of her emphasis is on the concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> one's struggles with society.|$|E
500|$|Romanticism {{has been}} seen as [...] "the revival of the life and thought of the Middle Ages", {{reaching}} beyond Rationalist and Classicist models to elevate medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval, in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth, urban sprawl and industrialism, embracing the exotic, unfamiliar and distant. It is also associated with political revolutions, beginning with those in Americana and France and movements for independence, particularly in Poland, Spain and Greece. It is often thought to incorporate an emotional assertion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>self</b> <b>and</b> of individual experience along with a sense of the infinite, transcendental and sublime. In art there was a stress on imagination, landscape and a spiritual correspondence with nature. It has been described by Margaret Drabble as [...] "an unending revolt against classical form, conservative morality, authoritarian government, personal insincerity, and human moderation".|$|E
