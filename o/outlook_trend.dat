40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a model for}} computing the trend output and the structural budget deficit in Austria. The calculation of trend output {{is based on a}} production function approach within a small macroeconomic model of the Austrian economy. A decomposition of public budgets into cyclical and structural components shows responsiveness to business cycle variations, and allows a better assessment of the sustainability of the budget balance. The model will be used in future forecasting rounds and links macroeconomic and budgetary variables of the WIFO Economic Outlook to estimates for trend output and the structural budget deficit. Until now, such decomposition has not been part of the regular WIFO forecast. Austria, WIFO forecast, WIFO Economic <b>Outlook,</b> <b>trend</b> output, structual budget balance...|$|E

The blog posts of these executives are often in the nature of individual opinions. The executives also provide actionable tips on various topics and products on their blog. While the blogs score high in the interactivity category and do reasonably well in the usability category, most suffer from poor connectivity in terms of providing links to other blogs and websites in the blogroll.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the sources of}} recent U. S. productivity growth using both aggregate and industry-level data. The paper confirms {{the central role of}} information technology in the productivity revival during 1995 - 2000 and shows that it played a significant, although smaller, role after 2000. Productivity growth after 2000 appears to have been boosted by industry restructuring and cost cutting in response to profit pressures, an unlikely source of future strength. In addition, the incorporation of intangible capital into the growth accounting framework somewhat diminishes estimates of labor productivity's performance since 2000 and makes the gain during 1995 - 2000 look larger than in the official data. Finally, the paper examines the <b>outlook</b> for <b>trend</b> growth in labor productivity; the resulting estimate, which is subject to much uncertainty, is centered at 2 1 / 4 percent a year, faster than the lackluster pace that prevailed before 1995 but somewhat slower than the 1995 - 2000 average. macroeconomics, productivity growth, labor productivity...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{technological}} and economic developments {{have led to}} widespread availability of multi-core CPUs and specialist accelerator processors such as graphical processing units (GPUs). The accelerated computational performance possible from these devices can be very high for some applications paradigms. Software languages and systems such as NVIDIA's CUDA and Khronos consortium's open compute language (OpenCL) support a number of individual parallel application programming paradigms. To scale up the performance of some complex systems simulations, a hybrid of multi-core CPUs for coarse-grained parallelism and very many core GPUs for data parallelism is necessary. We describe our use of hybrid applica- tions using threading approaches and multi-core CPUs to control independent GPU devices. We present speed-up data and discuss multi-threading software issues for the applications level programmer and o er some suggested areas for language development and integration between coarse-grained and ne-grained multi-thread systems. We discuss results from three common simulation algorithmic areas including: partial di erential equations; graph cluster metric calculations and random number generation.
