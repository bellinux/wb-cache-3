5|$|Lazard {{turns to}} Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help. She tells them of Michelle's claims {{that a man}} had {{attacked}} Barbala, {{even though she was}} the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room when the detective was killed. The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite; the computer seemingly glitches, displaying a face that Michelle identifies as the killer. The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris — who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit. Mulder speaks to Michelle's psychiatrist, Dr. Braun, who tells him that she habitually mutilated dolls in a uniform manner during their sessions together, removing the same eye and arm each time; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris' death.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August, at 2:40 pm, Pym led {{an attack}} on Duperré's {{squadron}} without waiting for Iphigenia and Magicienne, entering the channel {{that led to the}} anchorage at Grand Port. He was followed by Nereide, but Willoughby had refused to allow Pym to embark the harbour pilot: the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British squadron who knew the passage through the reefs. Without guidance by an experienced pilot, Sirius was aground within minutes and could not be brought off until 8:30 am on 23 August. Nereide anchored nearby during the night to protect the flagship. At 10:00 am, Iphigenia and Magicienne arrived and at 2:40 pm, after a conference between the captains as to the best course of action, the force again attempted to negotiate the channel. Although the squadron was now guided by Nereides pilot, Sirius again grounded at 3:00 pm and Magicienne 15 minutes later after over-correcting to avoid the reef that Sirius had struck. Nereide and Iphigenia continued the attack, Iphigenia engaging Minerve and Ceylon at close range and Nereide attacking Bellone. Long-range fire from Magicienne was also directed at Victor, which was firing on Nereide.|$|E
25|$|Under King Carl XVI Gustaf, king since 1973, {{the plain}} triple-tailed flag has flown at the Royal Palace only once. This {{occurred}} on 2-3 July 1988, when the King {{went on a}} private visit to Wuppertal, Germany; at the same time, the Duke of Halland, his uncle and the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of succession, was on a private visit to Sainte-Maxime, France. The Government therefore ordered the Speaker of the Riksdag, Ingemund Bengtsson, to serve as Regent ad interim for two days.|$|E

25|$|Stubbs later quit {{to pursue}} a more serious career, and in 1994 Bailey {{performed}} Rock at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with Sean Lock, a show about an ageing rockstar and his roadie, script-edited by comedy writer Jim Miller. It was later serialised for the Mark Radcliffe show on BBC Radio 1. The show's attendances were not impressive and on one occasion the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience was comedian Dominic Holland. Bailey almost gave up comedy {{to take up a}} telesales job.|$|E
25|$|Sheikh Rasheed and Raja Zafarul Haq, {{were the}} first people to propose the tests, while, Sartaj Aziz who was the Treasure Minister that time, was the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meeting who opposed the tests on {{financial}} grounds due to the economic recession, the low foreign exchange reserves of the country and the effect of inevitable economic sanctions which would be imposed on Pakistan if it carried out the tests. When it comes to voting, the prime minister did not oppose or propose the tests. The remainder spoke in favour of conducting the tests.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his music, Wang also acted in several films, including Ang Lee's Lust, Caution, Jackie Chan's Little Big Soldier and Michael Mann's Blackhat. He is an environmental activist, and his album Change Me was dedicated to raising eco-awareness among Chinese youth. Wang {{was one of the}} first torchbearers for the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, and performed in the Olympics' closing ceremony in Beijing. He was again a torchbearer for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, making him the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mandarin pop circle to have taken part in the event twice.

25|$|On 23 February 2008, Eduardo {{suffered}} a broken left fibula {{and an open}} dislocation of his left ankle in a match against Birmingham City, following a tackle by Martin Taylor, for which Taylor was sent off. Eduardo was immediately taken to Selly Oak Hospital, where he underwent surgery. Gilberto Silva was the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity who spoke both Portuguese and English {{and was able to}} translate communication between Eduardo and the medical team. Eduardo's injury was so graphic that Sky Sports, which was broadcasting the game live, decided not to show replays of the incident. Arsène Wenger initially called for a lifetime ban for Taylor, but retracted his comments later. Taylor claimed to have visited Eduardo in hospital and that an apology was accepted; Eduardo, however, could not remember Taylor's visit or even the tackle. Some cite the incident as a cause of Arsenal failing to maintain their lead in the Premier League title race that season.|$|E
25|$|Brenda, still {{distressed by}} the fact that Dylan chose Kelly, began the fourth season in Minnesota, where she had decided to enter university. However, hearing about the break between Dylan and Kelly and realizing that she and her old friends from Minnesota have little in common, she decides to return to Beverly Hills and {{continue}} her studies at University of California. After her return, she met a rich young man named Stuart (whom Dylan knew of as a drug dealer in the past), and soon fell in love with him. The couple get engaged even in the first few weeks of their encounter and choose Las Vegas, forcing Dylan and his friends to come and try to stop them. They succeed by using reverse psychology, pretending that they are in favor of a marriage between the two young people. Brenda's life also took a few shots during the season. When Donna and Brenda find a puppy on the street, they learn that he escaped from an animal testing laboratory and are helpless when the puppy dies. Brenda then falls into a group of animal rights activists and participates with them in the ransacking of a number of laboratories until she is arrested (Donna decides at the last minute not to join the group). After her arrest, the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group who supported her was Dylan; David Silver questioned her judgment, Andrea was angry that she had damaged laboratories that did not test animals and Kelly told her that Dylan was no longer her boyfriend and that Brenda could not go and look for help whenever she had a problem. It turned out that one of the activists was an FBI agent who offered Brenda a deal not to jail because she had not supported vandalism.|$|E
25|$|Inspector Davies and Poirot meet back at Fernley. The call to Dr. Sheppard {{has been}} traced. It {{was made from}} the local railway station, {{a few minutes before}} the late-night express train for Liverpool left. He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that they will find only the dead man's prints on the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers seen in the past week – the only one he can recall was a young representative from a firm of Dictaphone manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found a scrap of starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that it came from the dress of Bourne who is the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that he means to find the truth.|$|E
60|$|The parish church {{stood back}} from the street, {{protected}} by gates and railings, and surrounded by a space of open ground. Shaking off his father's hold, Bashwood the younger made straight for the vestry.

500|$|... "Fishsticks" [...] is {{the fifth}} episode of the thirteenth season of the American {{animated}} television series South Park. The 186th overall episode of the series, it was originally broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on April 8, 2009. In the episode, Jimmy writes a joke that becomes a national sensation, and Cartman tries to steal the credit while rapper Kanye West is the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country who fails to get the joke, but cannot admit {{that he does not}} get it because he believes himself to be a genius.|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} there more than nine months, and had {{developed}} from an active youth into an athletic young man of eighteen, when an important conversation took place {{between him and his}} principal.

[...] The video features large balloons in different colours, a swing hanging from the sky and a tree with multi-colored lights. Rihanna's outfits include a mohair sweater, a floral miniskirt and a white-bra-and-boyshorts two-piece.|$|E
500|$|By 1700, Anne {{had been}} {{pregnant}} at least seventeen times; twelve times, she miscarried or {{gave birth to}} stillborn children, and two of their five children born alive died within a day. The {{only one of the}} couple's children to survive infancy—Prince William, Duke of Gloucester—died in July 1700 at the age of 11. With Gloucester's death, Anne was the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of succession to the throne, as established by the [...] "Glorious Revolution". To extend the line and secure the Protestant succession, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which designated William and Anne's nearest Protestant cousins, the House of Hanover, as the next in line after Anne.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{began with}} {{three weeks of}} [...] "cryptic" [...] messages designed to create interest in the promotion. Herb was mentioned in newspaper advertisements, on banners at football games, and in flyers distributed to the public. On November 24, 1985, the first commercials were aired on CBS, NBC, and ABC. The premise of the commercials was that Herb was the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States who had not eaten a burger from Burger King. The advertising agency created a fictional biography for the character, claiming that {{he was raised in}} Wisconsin, had worked in a cheese factory, and had also sold decoy ducks. The character is commonly referred to as [...] "Herb the Nerd".|$|E

500|$|The working {{title for}} the episode was [...] "New Girl", which changed to the current [...] "Day One" [...] by the {{beginning}} of October 2006. Head writer Chris Chibnall, who wrote the episode, found that writing the second episode was hard, as there was a challenge to demonstrate how Torchwood works, and set the formula {{for the rest of the}} series. He wanted to write an episode that would centre on Gwen about her [...] "first day in hell", and show the audience that Torchwood is unlike any normal job, as one small mistake can have major ramifications on the city. The scene where Gwen accidentally opens the meteor was meant to [...] "extend the metaphor of breaking the photocopier on your first day at work". It is also set to show the separate dynamic between the team and Gwen. Series creator Russell T Davies stated that as the rest of the team are for the aliens, science, technology and mythology, Gwen is for [...] "the people"; she's the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team who cares about what happens to Carys. Eve Myles also noted in the episode's audio commentary that throughout the episode, it added a mix between her domestic life and the science fiction.|$|E
500|$|James Montogomery from MTV commented: [...] " [...] all pulsing sirens, wobbly {{bass and}} four-on-the-floor beat, with an {{expansive}} electro chorus {{that sounds like}} a truckload of Nintendo Entertainment Systems exploding in unison (only sexier)." [...] Frase McAlpine from BBC gave the song three out five stars and said: [...] "I can't be the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world who is slightly disappointed that this song isn't a jaunty '80 syn-disco rave up, in which Madge skips around in a big pink wig, like she used to in the olden days." [...] He went on to add that [...] "Celebration" [...] is a decent dance track for Madonna to play on her tours. Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork Media complimented the song, calling it [...] "personality-driven pop" [...] in which Madonna has never sounded more convincing. Deusner added that the track sounds like [...] "it's conjuring several of Madonna's younger selves" [...] in its modest goal to just make people move. Sarah Crompton from The Daily Telegraph said that the song is infinitely forgettable. Popjustice named the song one of the best 100 singles of 2009. Louis Virtel of The Backlot included the song at number sixty-five on his list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs," [...] referring to the track as a [...] "rollicking dance jam" [...] that is a [...] "perfect companion piece to [...] other testament to celebration, Holiday.” At the 52nd Grammy Awards, the song received a nomination in the Best Dance Recording category.|$|E
500|$|Straczynski viewed [...] "sitting {{down and}} ferreting out [...] story" [...] as {{a return to}} his journalistic roots. He also drew on his {{experience}} writing crime drama for the procedural elements of the plot. Straczynski said he had gathered so much information about the case {{that it was difficult}} to work out how to tell it. To let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts he wanted to tell. He described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: [...] "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You start with her, and her story gets broader and broader and begins having impact from all kinds of places. The overlay on that was an upside down triangle with the base on top, which is the panorama of Los Angeles at that time—1928. And it begins getting narrower and narrower toward the bottom, bearing down on her." [...] Once Straczynski saw this structure, he felt he could write the story. He chose to avoid focusing on the atrocities of the Wineville murders in favor of telling the story from Collins' perspective; Straczynski said she was the <b>only</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story without a hidden agenda, and it was her tenacity—as well as the legacy the case left throughout California's legal system—that had attracted him to the project. He said, [...] "My intention was very simple: to honor what Christine Collins did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} is the {{wonderful}} news?" [...] said Mrs. Meyrick, who was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> other <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room. [...] "Anything about Italy--anything about the Austrians giving up Venice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was useless}} to make inquiries; they only seemed to irritate him. [...] "I am better already, {{now you have}} come to me." [...] He said that, {{and led the way}} to a {{sheltered}} seat among <b>the</b> trees. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> later evening-time the Square was almost empty. Two middle-aged ladies, walking up and down (who considerately remembered their own youth, and kept out of the way), and a boy rigging a model yacht (who was too closely occupied to notice them), were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> enclosure besides themselves.|$|R
