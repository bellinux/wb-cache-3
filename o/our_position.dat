5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, <b>our</b> <b>position</b> in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E
5|$|Wartime proved hard on {{the film}} business. On September 23, 1915, Famous Players {{informed}} McKernan that “On account of the boat Hesperian having been torpedoed by a German submarine, {{it will be necessary}} to skip two Weeklies (short films), these having come forward to ourselves from our London representative via this boat. Regretting this occurrence, and trusting you will appreciate <b>our</b> <b>position</b> on this...”. McKernan’s supply of new films was decreased as the war dragged on, and McKernan advertised less and less frequently. Further complicating things, parts for the theatre’s Edison and Simplex projectors were difficult to come by at the best of times, and the complex machines proved difficult to maintain. McKernan did not live to see business pick up. He contracted Spanish Influenza and pneumonia in rapid succession, and died on February 18, 1919.|$|E

25|$|Everyone {{was crushed}} into our room, people were {{shouting}} or laughing, expressing indignation, protesting, {{getting up to}} all sorts of antics, they were pushing each other out of the way to get in, those who approved and defended <b>our</b> <b>position</b> and those who condemned it argued with each other... Room 41 was always full.|$|E
25|$|Some 200 {{yards in}} advance of <b>our</b> <b>position,</b> which we were holding at a terrible cost, was a fence built high and strong. The troops in advance had tried to scale the fence and reform under that hell of fire. They were {{actually}} torn in shreds and wedged into the fence. The cry came to us for volunteers to pull down the fence. Instantly there sprang from the long line, fast being shortened as the ranks closed up over the dead, seventy-six volunteers. We ran straight for the fence amid a hail of iron and lead, the dead falling all about us, but to reach the fence was our only thought. A part of the force reached it, and, as one would grasp a rail it would be sent flying {{out of his hands}} by rifle-shots. The fence leveled, we made the attempt to return, and it was as hot for us on the retreat, as it had been on the advance. Few escaped death or wounds. I had almost regained my regiment, when I was hit. The line then successfully pressed on, and the 'Sunken Road,' or ' Bloody Lane,' as it is now known, was within our lines.|$|E
500|$|Zooropa {{finished}} in 9th {{place on the}} [...] "Best Albums" [...] list from The Village Voices 1993 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. At the 36th Annual Grammy Awards, it won the award for Best Alternative Music Album. In his acceptance speech, Bono sarcastically mocked the [...] "alternative" [...] characterisation the album received and used a profanity on live television: [...] "I think I'd like to give {{a message to the}} young people of America. And that is: We shall continue to abuse <b>our</b> <b>position</b> and fuck up the mainstream." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Later in the day, the Germans {{attempted}} to retake the hill with one heavy assault gun (est 105mm) [...] {{and a few}} infantry men and succeeded in penetrating <b>our</b> <b>position.</b> From 100 yards he knocked out two light tanks. However, the advance of [...] "A" [...] company's tanks concentrated so much fire on him and held their ground so effectively that he lost his nerve and retired from the fight, with his supporting troops, {{if he had any}} left. The 37mm gun on the Light Tanks did no appreciable damage to the German self-propelled weapon, although over 100 direct hits were placed on him from ranges varying from 75 to 500 yards." ...|$|E
500|$|The Defence Policy Committee, {{chaired by}} the Prime Minister and {{consisting}} of the senior Cabinet [...] members, considered the political and strategic implications on 1 June, and concluded that [...] "we must maintain and strengthen <b>our</b> <b>position</b> as a world power so that Her Majesty's Government can exercise a powerful influence in the counsels of the world." [...] Churchill informed Cabinet of the decision on 7 July 1954. The Cabinet, particularly the Lord Privy Seal, Harry Crookshank, were not happy about not being consulted. Cabinet debated the matter that day and the next, before postponing a final decision. On 27 July 1954, the Lord President of the Council, the Marquess of Salisbury, raised the matter, {{although it was not}} on the agenda, stressing the need for a decision. This time Cabinet agreed to proceed with the development of thermonuclear weapons.|$|E
500|$|The Lieutenant Governor of Virginia at the time, Tim Kaine, joined Republican {{lawmakers in}} calling for a House Ethics Committee {{investigation}} into the loan, saying that Moran had made [...] "an error in judgment" [...] by accepting it. In his own defense, Moran said that {{the timing of the}} legislation's introduction was coincidental and {{had nothing to do with}} the loan. MBNA spokesman Brian Dalphon said that the bank had offered the mortgage package not knowing that Moran was a member of Congress, and that the loan [...] "made good business sense" [...] because with the mortgage loan, [...] "we improved <b>our</b> <b>position</b> by getting security for an unsecured loan.... He had credit cards with us, he was having financial difficulties; this put him in a better position to be able to pay us back from a cash-flow standpoint." ...|$|E

500|$|Morton {{once again}} {{called for a}} series of reforms, repeating those from 1840, and {{including}} a proposal to transfer the tax burden from real to personal property. [...] He was criticized by the Whigs for omitting any mention of slavery in his inaugural address. [...] During his term the leaders of the various Democratic factions squabbled over executive and party appointments, and the death of President William Henry Harrison shortly after taking office brought on further party divisions as potential presidential nominees canvassed the state for support. [...] As a consequence, much of the reform agenda was either not implemented at all, or only minimally, despite a nominally working Democratic-Liberty coalition majority in the legislature. [...] George Bancroft bemoaned the lost opportunity: [...] "Never had a party a better opening than we have in Massachusetts, if all would but profit by <b>our</b> <b>position.</b> [...] But they will not." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{successful}} {{nuclear test}} of a British atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane in October 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement. Britain became the world's third nuclear power, reaffirming the country's status as a great power, but hopes that the United States would be sufficiently impressed to restore the nuclear Special Relationship were soon dashed. In November 1952, the United States conducted the first successful {{test of a}} true thermonuclear device or hydrogen bomb. Britain was therefore still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology. The Defence Policy Committee, chaired by Churchill and consisting of the senior Cabinet members, considered the political and strategic implications in June 1954, and concluded that [...] "we must maintain and strengthen <b>our</b> <b>position</b> as a world power so that Her Majesty's Government can exercise a powerful influence in the counsels of the world." [...] In July 1954, Cabinet agreed {{to proceed with the}} development of thermonuclear weapons.|$|E
500|$|Between April 1877 and February 1878, she {{threatened}} {{five times}} to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli {{to act against}} Russia during the Russo-Turkish War, but her threats had {{no impact on the}} events or their conclusion with the Congress of Berlin. Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. [...] "If we are to maintain <b>our</b> <b>position</b> as a first-rate Power", she wrote, [...] "we must... be Prepared for attacks and wars, somewhere or other, CONTINUALLY." [...] Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: [...] "It is not in our custom to annexe countries", she said, [...] "unless we are obliged & forced to do so." [...] To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister. When Disraeli died the following year, she was blinded by [...] "fast falling tears", and erected a memorial tablet [...] "placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend, Victoria R.I." ...|$|E

500|$|When night {{began to}} fall, we climbed into our boats and floated down the Danube and crossed {{over to the}} other side several miles below the place where Vlad's army was stationed. There we dug {{ourselves}} trenches, so that cavalry could not harm us. After that we crossed back {{over to the other}} side and transported other janissaries over the Danube, and when the entire infantry had crossed over, then we prepared and set out gradually against Vlad's army, together with the artillery and other equipment that we had brought with us. Having halted, we set up the cannon, but not in time to stop three hundred janissaries from being killed ... Seeing that our side was greatly weakening, we defended ourselves with the 120 guns which we had brought over and fired so often that we repelled the prince's army and greatly strengthened <b>our</b> <b>position</b> ... Vlad, seeing that he could not prevent the crossing, withdrew. After that the emperor crossed the Danube with his entire army and gave us 30,000 coins to be distributed among us.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} morning, 1 September, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion went on {{the offensive}} again, while a force of seven Kittyhawks attacked the Japanese headquarters around Waga Waga. By this time, the Japanese had abandoned the objective of reaching the airfields and instead sought only to hold off the Australians {{long enough to be}} evacuated. This information was not known by the Allies, however, who were in fact expecting the Japanese to undertake further offensive action. In this regard, the 2/9th, initially with orders to join the 2/12th's counterattack, was delayed an extra day after an erroneous intelligence report from MacArthur's headquarters warning Clowes of a renewed Japanese attack forced him to briefly adopt a more defensive posture. The attack did not occur and, as a result, on 2 September the 2/9th was moved by barge up to the KB Mission. The next day it took over from the 2/12th and led the Australian advance. With the Japanese position at Milne Bay close to collapse, on 2 September Yano sent a radio message to the headquarters of the 8th Fleet which stated: [...] "e have reached the worst possible situation. We will together calmly defend <b>our</b> <b>position</b> to the death. We pray for absolute victory for the empire and for long-lasting fortune in battle for you all".|$|E
500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Soviet {{leadership}} headed by Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and the Politburo, were {{not eager to}} send troops to Afghanistan. The Soviet Politburo decisions were guided by a Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Yuri Andropov the KGB Chairman, Andrei Gromyko the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, and Boris Ponomarev, {{the head of the}} International Department of the Central Committee. The Politburo was opposed to the removal of Taraki and his subsequent murder. According to Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, [...] "Events developed so swiftly in Afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in them. Right now our mission is to determine our further actions, so as to preserve <b>our</b> <b>position</b> in Afghanistan and to secure our influence there." [...] Although Afghan–Soviet relations deteriorated during Amin's short stint in power, he was invited on an official visit to Moscow by Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, because of the Soviet leadership's satisfaction with his party and state-building policy. Not everything went as planned, and Andropov talked about [...] "the undesirable turn of events" [...] taking place in Afghanistan under Amin's rule. Andropov also brought up the ongoing political shift in Afghanistan under Amin; the Soviets were afraid that Amin would move Afghanistan's foreign policy from a pro-Soviet position to a pro-United States position. By early-to-mid December 1979, the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with Babrak Karmal and Assadullah Sarwari.|$|E
50|$|All is {{not going}} well, Arnold: the ray-rods are {{emptying}} fast, and our attack upon the lower level of the wing has failed. Sanson has placed a ray-gun there. All depends on the air-scouts, and we must hold <b>our</b> <b>positions</b> until the battle-planes arrive.|$|R

Nobody can say in Ghana we discriminate against homosexuality, there is no witch-hunting on homosexuality ... that is their own problem so we only listen and move on. The secretary general has made his views known and we have also made our views known so the value is the same.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pose estimation {{approach that is}} resilient to typical sensor failure and suitable for low cost agricultural robots. Guiding large agricultural machinery with highly accurate GPS/INS systems has become standard practice, however these systems are inappropriate for smaller, lower-cost robots. <b>Our</b> <b>positioning</b> system estimates pose by fusing data from a low-cost global positioning sensor, low-cost inertial sensors and a new technique for vision-based row tracking. The results first demonstrate that <b>our</b> <b>positioning</b> system will accurately guide a robot to perform a coverage task across a 6 hectare field. The results then demonstrate that our vision-based row tracking algorithm improves {{the performance of the}} positioning system despite long periods of precision correction signal dropout and intermittent dropouts of the entire GPS sensor...|$|R
