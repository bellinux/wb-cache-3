5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts <b>of</b> <b>beer,</b> water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

5|$|Beer {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked {{about the quality of}} barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production <b>of</b> <b>beer,</b> did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.|$|E

5|$|In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, {{adopted the}} Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality {{regulation}} {{still in use}} in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> are water, hops and barley-malt. Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant {{by the end of}} the 19th century. The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, {{sales of}} spirits {{increased}} 9% {{over the previous}} year. Whiskey and vodka were the top sellers, while tequila had the largest percentage increase. Oregonian's top buy was Jack Daniel's, with 412,000 bottles sold. This was during a national spirits trend where manufacturers introduced new products and advertising aimed at young drinkers. Again in 2007, Oregon's 2.6 million adults on average drank 32 gallons <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> each, versus 4 gallons of wine and 2 gallons of spirits, but sales <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> hadn't increased like sales of spirits.

5|$|There are two {{distinct}} wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental {{region in the}} northeast of the country, especially Slavonia, is capable of producing premium wines, particularly whites. Along the north coast, Istrian and Krk wines {{are similar to those}} produced in neighbouring Italy, while further south in Dalmatia, Mediterranean-style red wines are the norm. Annual production of wine exceeds 140million litres. Croatia was almost exclusively a wine-consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive production and consumption <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> started; the annual consumption <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> in 2008 was 83.3litres per capita which placed Croatia in 15th place among the world's countries.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons <b>of</b> <b>beer,</b> 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or distill any amount of hard liquor.|$|E
