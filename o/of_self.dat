5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation <b>of</b> <b>Self</b> in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the social construction <b>of</b> <b>self,</b> social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E

40|$|Classical {{theory on}} mating system {{evolution}} suggests that simultaneous hermaphrodites should either outcross {{if they have}} high inbreeding depression (ID) or self-fertilize if they have low ID. However, a mixture <b>of</b> <b>selfing</b> and outcrossing persists in many species. Previous studies with the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus have found worms to self-fertilize some of their eggs despite ID. The probability for selfing to spread depends on the relative fitness of selfers, {{as well as the}} genetic basis for ID and whether it can be effectively purged. We bred S. solidus through two consecutive generations <b>of</b> <b>selfing</b> and recorded several fitness correlates over the whole life cycle. After one round <b>of</b> <b>selfing,</b> ID was pronounced, particularly in early-life traits, and the conservatively estimated lifetime fitness <b>of</b> <b>selfed</b> progeny was only 9 % that of the outcrossed controls. After a second generation <b>of</b> <b>selfing,</b> ID remained high but was significantly reduced in several traits, which is consistent with the purging of deleterious recessive alleles (the estimated load of lethal equivalents dropped by 48 %). Severe ID, even if it can be rapidly purged, likely prevents transitions toward pure selfing in this parasite, although we also cannot exclude the possibility that low-level selfing has undetected benefits...|$|R

5|$|After {{the fall}} of France, the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the {{effectiveness}} of the German campaign against the French and British forces.

The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the mass-production for such a weapon, and the M3 half-track was coming into production. After some debate, the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 half-track chassis, which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by placing it in a welded box riveted to the chassis behind the driver's compartment. It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941.|$|E
5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware <b>of</b> <b>self</b> or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>selfing</b> in hermaphrodites {{to reveal the}} demographic conditions that lead to intermediate selfing rates. Using a demographic model based on Ricker-type density regulation we first assume that independent of population density, inbred individuals survive less well than outbred individuals and, second, that inbred and outbred individuals differ in their competitive abilities in density-regulated populations. The evolution <b>of</b> <b>selfing,</b> driven by inbreeding depression {{and the cost of}} outcrossing, is then analyzed for three fundamentally different demographic scenarios: stable population densities, deterministically varying population densities (resulting from cyclical or chaotic population dynamics), and stochastic fluctuations of carrying capacities (resulting from environmental noise). We show that even under stable demographic conditions evolutionary outcomes are not confined to either complete selfing or full outcrossing. Instead, intermediate selfing rates arise under a wide range of conditions, depending on the nature of competitive interactions between inbred and outbred individuals. We also explore the evolution <b>of</b> <b>selfing</b> under deterministic and stochastic density fluctuations to demonstrate that such environmental conditions can evolutionarily stabilize intermediate selfing rates. This is the first study to consider in detail the effect of density regulation on the evolution <b>of</b> <b>selfing</b> rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>selfing</b> from outcrossing is {{a common}} transition, yet {{little is known about}} the mutations and selective factors that promote this shift. In the mustard family, single-locus self-incompatibility (SI) enforces outcrossing. In this study, we test whether mutations causing self-compatibility (SC) are linked to the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus) in Leavenworthia alabamica, a species where two selfing races (a 2 and a 4) co-occur with outcrossing populations. We also infer the ecological circumstances associated with origins <b>of</b> <b>selfing</b> using molecular sequence data. Genealogical reconstruction of the Lal 2 locus, the putative ortholog of the SRK locus, showed that both selfing races are fixed for one of two different S-linked Lal 2 sequences, whereas outcrossing populations harbor many S-alleles. Hybrid crosses demonstrated that S-linked mutations cause SC in each selfing race. These results strongly suggest two origins <b>of</b> <b>selfing</b> in this species, a result supported by population admixture analysis of 16 microsatellite loci and by a population tree built from eight nuclear loci. One selfing race (a 4) shows signs of a severe population bottleneck, suggesting that reproductive assurance might have caused the evolution <b>of</b> <b>selfing</b> in this case. In contrast, the population size of race a 2 cannot be distinguished from that of outcrossing populations after correcting for differences in selfing rates. Coalescent-based analyses suggest a relatively old origin <b>of</b> <b>selfing</b> in the a 4 race (; 150 ka ago), whereas selfing evolved recently in the a 2 race (; 12 – 48 ka ago). These results imply that S-locus mutations have triggered two recent shifts to selfing i...|$|R

5|$|Short story {{fiction and}} tales were also popular during the Tang, {{one of the}} more famous ones being Yingying's Biography by Yuan Zhen (779–831), which was widely {{circulated}} in his own time and by the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) became the basis for plays in Chinese opera. Timothy C. Wong places this story within the wider context of Tang love tales, which often share the plot designs of quick passion, inescapable societal pressure leading to the abandonment of romance, followed by a period of melancholy. Wong states that this scheme lacks the undying vows and total self-commitment to love found in Western romances such as Romeo and Juliet, but that underlying traditional Chinese values of inseparableness <b>of</b> <b>self</b> from one's environment (including human society) served to create the necessary fictional device of romantic tension.|$|E
40|$|Is it {{possible}} {{for there to be}} a fruitful dialogue between Søren Kierkegaard and Buddhists regarding the understanding <b>of</b> the <b>self?</b> In this paper, I explore the possibilities for such a dialogue by first discussing the rejection of substantialism shared by Kierkegaard and Buddhists. Next, although many Buddhists accept a reductionist account of the kind found in the Abhidharma tradition, Madhyamaka thinkers such as Nāgārjuna and Candrakīrti are well-known for offering an account <b>of</b> the <b>self,</b> based on the notion of emptiness (śūnyatā), which resembles in some ways the account <b>of</b> the <b>self</b> that is proposed by Kierkegaard’s pseudonym Anti-Climacus in The Sickness Unto Death. Third, I discuss Jonardon Ganeri’s performativist theory <b>of</b> the <b>self</b> and his suggestion that this view, originally developed by Candrakīrti, informs the view <b>of</b> the <b>self</b> which is developed by Kierkegaard’s pseudonym Johannes Climacus in the Concluding Unscientific Postscript.
