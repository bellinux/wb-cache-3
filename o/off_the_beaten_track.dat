40|$|The parochial {{church of}} Santa Águeda in Sotillo de la Ribera, {{located in the}} {{province}} of Burgos, Spain is the object of the works of graphical documentation using different methods of survey, which provide a material with different levels of precision, here analysed and confronted. The value of documentation of buildings never surveyed before, enables a much more thorough formal analysis and offers the possibility of contrasting cases with similar features within the territory. The supplementary value added by the knowledge of measures of ancient architectures means a useful tool for their study and, along with formal and historic studies supplies enough elements to obtain a revalorization of a patrimony far <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>tracks...</b>|$|R

500|$|Tourism {{developers}} have marketed Tana Toraja as an exotic adventure—an area rich in culture and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>track.</b> Western tourists {{expected to see}} stone-age villages and pagan funerals. Toraja is for tourists who have {{gone as far as}} Bali and are willing {{to see more of the}} wild, [...] "untouched" [...] islands. However, they were more likely to see a Torajan wearing a hat and denim, living in a Christian society. Tourists felt that the tongkonan and other Torajan rituals had been preconceived to make profits, and complained that the destination was too commercialised. This has resulted in several clashes between Torajans and tourism developers, whom Torajans see as outsiders.|$|E

40|$|Mobile tourist guides shall help {{tourists}} to discover sights <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>tracks</b> and therewith spread {{them over the}} destination more equally. Mobile information systems complement more traditional means of information provision, e. g. printed maps, guide booklets or simply signage at the destination. The most important question is: “How are mobile information systems accepted by ordinary tourists??” In case of a yes the next question is: “How does an information system impacts the visit of the tourists?” These questions were studied in a field study with real tourists {{in the city of}} Görlitz in August. A control group received a GPS logger whereas the other two groups received mobile devices with two different mobile information systems. All three groups explored the city on their own. The first mobile application displays the current location of the tourist and attractions in a map. The tourist can request multi-media information about each attraction. The second application elicits the generic preferences of the tourist, ranks the attractions, computes a tour, supports the execution via audio navigation instructions and adapts the tour plan as necessary. For each group some basic data was collected before the tour, e. g. computer literacy. During the tour the positions and interactions were logged and after the tour a questionnaire gathered additional data. The spatial behaviour and interaction logs was analysed to determine the impact of a mobile information system on the behaviour of tourists during a city tour...|$|R

5000|$|... 1722 - De Effectu Excommunicatinis ("On the Effect of Excommunication"); {{unnumbered}} {{back to back}} folios, {{and marked}} as MS. 32B#4 at the National Library of Malta. This is an interesting work. It is not a commentary of Thomas Aquinas, as one might expect, but rather an original study by Hagius. Though the method used is clearly that common to Scholasticism, Hagius ventures to break <b>off</b> from <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>track</b> and explore themes which were usually not dealt with very frequently by Scholastics. The work {{is a collection of}} nine ‘Books’. An alternative title to the composition, entered {{at the head of the}} manuscript, is De quarto effectu Excommunicationis ("On the Four Effects of Excommunication").|$|R
5000|$|Created in 1993, Quartier Éphémère’s {{mission is}} to invest in 'in situ' {{projects}} within vacant or abandoned Montreal industrial buildings and to reach a diverse public, <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>beaten</b> <b>track</b> of contemporary art. The Darling Foundry, which is a former metalworking factory, is one of QE’s projects. By turning buildings which {{were about to be}} demolished into artistic place, the association saved a total of 3500 square meters in the Faubourg des Recollets’s area. The Darling Foundry visual arts centre started its activity by opening its exhibition area in 2002. In 2006, the association inaugurated 12 artists studios {{in the second part of}} the building. The building is classified as an [...] "exceptional heritage value building" [...] in the Montreal Built Heritage great repertoire. Its transformation from a foundry into an art center was one of the first industrial heritage recycling success.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{followed}} {{in the same year}} by Released with appearances from Allan Price on drums, and guest saxophonist Dave Conners. Here Jade Warrior sharpened their rock edge ("Three Horned Dragon King", [...] "Minnamato's Dream", the fifteen-minute rock jam [...] "Barazinbar"), their quieter side represented by pieces like [...] "Yellow Eyes" [...] and [...] "Bride of Summer". According to critic Peter Thelen, [...] "where the first album featured an array of sonic possibilities, this is an album that highlighted the contrasts within that sound". [...] "If Jade Warrior's second album has any overwhelming flaw, it is that its predecessor traveled so far <b>off</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>beaten</b> <b>tracks</b> of early-'70s prog that anything less than absolute reinvention could only be regarded as a rerun of past glories", AllMusic argued years later. [...] "…There is little here that Jade Warrior itself did not predict, but the unerring delivery of those predictions is a marvel in itself", critic Dave Thompson concluded.|$|R
2500|$|Walter Bonatti ( [...] ; 22 June 1930 in Bergamo – 13 September 2011 in Rome) was an Italian {{mountain}} climber, explorer and journalist.

Artists also congregated there to paint the ivy-covered porch. At the back of the house were bedrooms, to which the fishermen would make their way in the small hours of a summer morning, arguing to the last as they stumbled upstairs. One of these bedrooms, larger than the others, had been converted into a gymnasium for the use of mine host's brother.
