5|$|Being one of {{the tallest}} {{buildings}} in Singapore in the early 20th century, the Great Southern Hotel was an important landmark of Chinatown. Designed by Swan and Maclaren, the architectural style of the Nam Tin Building {{was that of the}} Modern Movement. The building was designed to be strictly functional. The grey-coloured façade of the Great Southern Hotel seemed to consist only of the bare essentials, with ordinary designs like strong horizontal lines with angular arches and simple cornices. The building was fitted with steel frame windows, with metal railings and grills, which were considered fashionable in the 1930s. The loggia on the uppermost floor was a little lighter in colour with the use of cast iron balustrades and brackets, and there was extensive use of green glass. The building was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>in</b> Singapore to be built as an integral structure of reinforced concrete slab and beam with infill brick wall.|$|E

5|$|Southampton Castle {{was located}} {{in the town of}} Southampton in Hampshire, England. Constructed after the Norman conquest of England, it {{was located in}} the north-west corner of the town {{overlooking}} the River Test, initially as a wooden motte and bailey design. By the late 12th century the royal castle had been largely converted to stone, playing an important part in the wine trade conducted through the Southampton docks. By the end of the 13th century the castle was in decline, but the threat of French raids in the 1370s led Richard II to undertake extensive rebuilding. The result was a powerfully defended castle, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>in</b> England to be equipped with cannon. The castle declined again in the 16th century and was sold off to property speculators in 1618. After being used for various purposes, including the construction of a Gothic mansion in the early 19th century, the site was flattened and largely redeveloped. Only a few elements of the castle still remain visible in Southampton.|$|E
