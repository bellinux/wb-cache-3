40|$|The role of {{big game}} in human {{foraging}} economies, and subsistence specialization on such resources, {{are issues that}} have received considerable attention in anthropological literature. The Northwest Plains of North America is one area where historic specialization on bison is well known and this economy has been projected <b>onto</b> prehistory. <b>My</b> research outlines alternative economic and subsistence strategies for the prehistoric inhabitants of the region. These strategies are outlined {{through the development of}} a broad spectrum model of forager subsistence in the western Black Hills, a portion of the Northwest Plains culture area. The investigation begins with foraging theory, a consideration of the available resources, and ecological principles constraining their exploitation. The spatial organization of technology is used to evaluate the model. Specifically, attributes of chipped stone, ground stone, and pottery are analyzed with respect to spatial distribution, co-occurrence and relationships to environmental variables. The point of departure in this analysis of technological organization is the use of spatially expansive data from widely distributed surface recorded sites, rather than the more commonly used spatially constricted excavated site data. The results suggest that the Northwest Plains technological organization is consistent with a generalized subsistence economy, and that prehistoric Plains populations were broad spectrum foragers, rather than specialists. ...|$|R
40|$|Lucius Outlaw {{claims that}} the notion of Race contradicts the {{philosophical}} commitment to Modernity. Race and Modernity are incongruent in regard to their conceptual frameworks for what constitutes people. While Modernity asserts a unity between people such that everyone is fundamentally the same, the concept of Race attempts to organize people into hierarchical groups. This contradiction requires that the two notions undergo some kind of revision. There are three possibilities for revising the incompatibility: to revise Race to work within the Modern framework, revise the framework of Modernity to include a coherent notion of Race, or revise both Race and Modernity. Outlaw revises both Race and Modernity. He treats Race and its constitutive parts as linguistic concepts that exist as a function of human cognition or recognition of them and change according to historical recognition. While the Modern view examines concepts as representing kinds that exist in the world, post-Modernism examines concepts as historically evolving and linguistic. Therefore Outlaw examines Race through a post-Modern framework. However, Outlaw’s post-Modern examination is not necessary if Race is a physically manifest and intuitively understood concept that takes on projected significance from complex social interactions. Hume’s discussion of causality provides an illustrative example of separating an observation from the projection put onto it. I will use Hume’s fundamentally Modern examination of and framework for causality to establish a parallel framework for separating the essential features of the concept of Race from projections put <b>onto</b> it. <b>My</b> framework for Race is compatible with Modernity and brings up the question of whether an accurate conception of Race requires a rejection of Modernity...|$|R

40|$|Ian Rumfitt has {{proposed}} systems of bilateral logic for primitive speech acts of assertion and denial, {{with the purpose}} of `exploring the possibility of specifying the classically intended senses for the connectives in terms of their deductive use' (Rumfitt (2000) : 810 f). Rumfitt formalises two systems of bilateral logic and gives two arguments for their classical nature. I assess both arguments and conclude that only one system satisfies the meaning-theoretical requirements Rumfitt imposes in his arguments. I then formalise an intuitionist system of bilateral logic which also meets those requirements. Thus Rumfitt cannot claim that only classical bilateral rules of inference succeed in imparting a coherent sense <b>onto</b> the connectives. <b>My</b> system can be extended to classical logic by adding the intuitionistically unacceptable half of a structural rule Rumfitt uses to codify the relation between assertion and denial. Thus there is a clear sense in which, in the bilateral framework, the difference between classicism and intuitionism {{is not one of the}} rules of inference governing negation, but rather one of the relation between assertion and denial...|$|R

The test audiences were confused about the original ending, they thought Jason Ritter’s character was becoming Freddysic. You can see it in the deleted scenes, that is why they decided to reshoot the ending. Originally I was being considered for playing the role of Jason in the entire film. It was actually between me and Ken. When they took the film to Canada, I was out of luck. There was no way they were going to pay for my flight and hotel stay when Ken was a local. Also, Ken is older than me and he was a lot more established in the business than I was at the time." [...] Describing the scene, Tait said [...] "I was on the film for a couple days. The water sequence took a lot of preparation. They realized that when I got wet, I looked too skinny in the clothes, so they had to bulk me up with pads and extra clothing so it would look like I was still big. Being with all this extra weight, one eye covered, a machete in one hand, Freddy’s head in another hand, and being totally submerged in water, made that scene very difficult. Also, Ronny Yu wanted me to walk like I was walking on land. He wanted it to look like I could walk through the water without it making me rise to the surface. To do this effect, they had a rope tied under water that I held <b>onto</b> with <b>my</b> left hand (with Freddy’s severed head in it also), and I held myself down on the ground so I could pull myself and walk forward." ...|$|R

It was there that I learned a lot of the basics of the narrative art, that it has as much (if not more) to do with being a writer as opposed to merely the technique of writing. I learned a lot that semester, and it provided me with a base which I continued to develop through ENG 407 (the other fiction writing course offered by Ball State) and into the present day. This creative project is a demonstration of how far I've come as a writer. It includes the first story I wrote for ENG 405, as well as a rewrite of that piece.
