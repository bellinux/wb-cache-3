25|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>Stick</b> Work is {{the first}} work in which Gerrard {{integrated}} human figures into his portraits of architectural subjects. In <b>Oil</b> <b>Stick</b> Work, the character Angelo Martinez paints one square of his barn in <b>oil</b> <b>stick</b> crayon every day. It takes the whole day, from dawn till dusk, to complete this action. To complete the task will take the entire thirty years of the piece – from 2008 to 2038 (towards {{the end of the}} artist's own lifespan, as he notes in an interview.) <b>Oil</b> <b>Stick</b> Work was later shown for one full calendar year in Canary Wharf as part of Art on the Underground and has subsequently been exhibited in institutions globally.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>stick,</b> oil bar, or oilstick, {{is an art}} medium. It is {{produced}} in a stick form {{similar to that of}} a crayon or oil pastel. It is distinguished from oil pastel, to which it may appear similar, in that the oil used is comparatively volatile, causing a skin to develop on exposed surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Aboudia depicts fevered {{landscapes and}} street scenes {{populated}} by childlike figures. “Assassin” powerfully demonstrates Aboudia’s trademark “nouchi” style. Rendered in <b>oil</b> <b>sticks,</b> acrylics and collage, his works are noted for brutal lines of color applied to heavily layered background collages, details of {{newspaper and magazine}} cutouts ingeniously encircled by drawings fall {{in and out of}} focus. The resulting composition suggests current events cohering through the imagination into a provocative vision.|$|R
5000|$|Besner’s unique {{style has}} been {{credited}} to his architectural training and, in particular, to urban architect Aldo Rossi’s merger of {{interior and exterior}} space. Using a mixed-media technique of acrylics, <b>oils,</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>sticks</b> on canvas as well as structural mortar, china marker and aerosol paint on canvas, Besner energizes aristocrats, horses, bulls, or cityscapes with overlapping lines, patterns and planes. Parcours editor Robert Bernier notes Besner’s ”tremendous capacity to renew contemporary artistic expression while remaining deeply embedded in artistic transition ...”.|$|R
50|$|By the 1970s Mason had {{abandoned}} white backgrounds and began his work by painting black {{over the entire}} canvas or sheet of paper, then proceeding {{with the rest of}} his painting. This process gave the desired pop to the brilliant acrylic colors he was using. The artist began chopstick drawings on black grounds and followed with drawings of softer colors during the Squeeze Bottle period. Mason's drawing at this time took on a different feel also, as he began testing with <b>oil</b> <b>sticks</b> washing his marks with turpentine and smudging them to create a filmy watercolor feel.|$|R

50|$|Whitfield Lovell (born October 2, 1959, Bronx, New York) is a {{contemporary}} African-American artist {{who is known}} primarily for his drawings of African-American individuals from {{the first half of}} the 20th century. Lovell creates these drawings in pencil, <b>oil</b> <b>stick,</b> or charcoal on paper, wood, or directly on walls. In his most recent work, these drawings are paired with found objects that Lovell collects at flea markets and antique shops.|$|E
50|$|Oil sticks are {{oil paint}} in solid form. Oil sticks {{are made by}} {{compressing}} wax and oil until it forms into an <b>oil</b> <b>stick.</b> The same basic pigments and drying oils {{that are used in}} the formulation of tube paint are combined with wax and rolled into a crayon. Oil sticks can be used to produce drawings, paintings, and sketches. It is not a common medium nor a much used medium however is highly effective in art.|$|E

50|$|Contractors from Houston, Texas, were {{initially}} {{involved in the}} search, and their efforts were later augmented by the Toulon-based Institut Français de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER). In October 1994, a modified drilling ship (Drillship was the FlexLD, formerly Sedco 445 and later Peregrin VII and now Deepwater Navigator), carrying a 50-ton video-equipped grab designed by IFREMER, sailed {{to the location of}} the John Barry. By early November, much of the ship had been excavated, revealing vintage U.S. Army trucks, tanks, and military equipment. Soon after, the first sign of silver was seen (though initially the video feed was clouded by the ship's <b>oil</b> <b>sticking</b> to the camera lens). Over the next five days, the grab brought up 1.3 million Saudi riyals weighing 17 tons and showered them onto the drill-ship's deck. The purported Indian/Soviet silver was nowhere to be found, although the salvagers were unable to access all the locations they suspected the silver might rest. While some plans have surfaced to relaunch the recovery effort, none have come to fruition.|$|R
