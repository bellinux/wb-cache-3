25|$|The front covers {{featured}} {{images of}} the narrating Animorph undergoing the various stages {{of one of the}} morphs from the story, with a few exceptions (noted in each book's article). Behind the morphing character were images of clouds and skies, which became more colorful and elaborate as the series progressed. All the covers of the regular series books had a small cutout over part of the full morph's anatomy, revealing a computer-generated illustration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>page,</b> which was printed on glossy paper. The illustration shared the image of the full morph with the front cover, but placed within an environment from the story. The book spines repeated the narrating character's face from the front cover, and the spine color changed with every new episode, resulting in a very colorful collection when viewed from any angle. A small excerpt from one of the book's chapters was printed on the inside of every front cover.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} innovation of Roslin {{in regards}} to ornaments within canon tables is the addition of bust portraits. In the Gospel of 1262 (MS No. 2660), Eusebius and Carpianus are represented as full figures standing in the outer margins of the Letter of Eusebius. Roslin also represented prophets such as David, Moses and John the Baptist. This system was highly unusual for canon table decoration, for although portraits of prophets had been represented next to canon tables {{as early as the}} 6th-century Syriac Rabbula Gospels, their relationship to the gospels was not made explicit through the quotation of their messianic prophecies. New zoomorphic creatures are also added to the usual repertoire of winged sphinxes and sirens such as dog or goat headed men carrying branches of flowers along with various quadrupeds and birds. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>page</b> of each gospel and the beginning of pericopes floral as well as zoomorphic letters are formed utilizing peacocks or other creatures.|$|E
