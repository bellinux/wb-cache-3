5|$|Despite NeXT's limited {{commercial}} success, {{the company}} had a wide-ranging impact on the computer industry. <b>Object-oriented</b> programming and graphical user interfaces became more common after the 1988 release of the NeXTcube and NeXTSTEP, when other companies started to emulate NeXT's <b>object-oriented</b> system. Apple started the Taligent project in 1989, {{with the goal of}} building a NeXT-like operating system for the Macintosh, with collaboration from Hewlett-Packard and IBM.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, work began on adding object-orientation {{in the next}} full {{revision}} of COBOL. <b>Object-oriented</b> features were taken from C++ and Smalltalk.|$|E
5|$|Perl {{does not}} enforce any {{particular}} programming paradigm (procedural, <b>object-oriented,</b> functional, or others) or even require the programmer {{to choose among}} them.|$|E
5|$|The class statement, which executes a {{block of}} code and {{attaches}} its local namespace to a class, for use in <b>object-oriented</b> programming.|$|E
5|$|The {{language}} {{is intended to}} be a simple, modern, general-purpose, <b>object-oriented</b> programming language.|$|E
5|$|C# is a general-purpose, <b>object-oriented</b> {{programming}} language. Its development team {{is led by}} Anders Hejlsberg. The {{most recent}} version is C# 7.1, which was released in 2017 along with Visual Studio 2017 Update 3.|$|E
5|$|Methods on {{objects are}} {{functions}} {{attached to the}} object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, {{in contrast to the}} implicit self (or this) in some other <b>object-oriented</b> programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{announced}} the Cairo project in 1991; the Cairo specification included similar <b>object-oriented</b> user interface features for a coming consumer version of Windows NT. Although {{the project was}} ultimately abandoned, some elements were integrated into other projects. By 1994, Microsoft and NeXT were collaborating on a Windows NT port of OpenStep; the port, however, was never released.|$|E
5|$|Python {{features}} a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including <b>object-oriented,</b> imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It {{has a large}} and comprehensive standard library.|$|E
5|$|Python is a multi-paradigm {{programming}} language: <b>object-oriented</b> {{programming and}} structured programming are fully supported, and many language features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{estimate}} {{was to have}} this revision completed by 1997, and an ISO Committee Draft (CD) was available by 1997. Some vendors (including Micro Focus, Fujitsu, and IBM) introduced <b>object-oriented</b> syntax based on drafts of the full revision. The final approved ISO standard was approved and published in late 2002.|$|E
5|$|This {{situation}} improved as COBOL adopted more features. COBOL-74 added subprograms, giving programmers {{the ability}} to control the data each part of the program could access. COBOL-85 then added nested subprograms, allowing programmers to hide subprograms. Further control over data and code came in 2002 when <b>object-oriented</b> programming, user-defined functions and user-defined data types were included.|$|E
5|$|During the game's development, {{the team}} lacked artists. The art {{director}} at Epic Games, Shane Caudle, and the artists at Digital Extremes {{could not make}} enough new textures because {{of the amount of}} diversity in characters and maps. In order to supplement the skin and texture production, Epic turned to contract artist Steve Garofalo. The game's level and content management program, UnrealEd, was written in Visual Basic and considered buggy, but no one had time to fix it. The game engine had an <b>object-oriented</b> design, and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered to be more like Java. The modularity of the <b>object-oriented</b> design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee and Peter Hajba.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 2004, PHP 5 was released, {{powered by}} the new Zend Engine II. PHP 5 {{included}} new features such as improved support for <b>object-oriented</b> programming, the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension (which defines a lightweight and consistent interface for accessing databases), and numerous performance enhancements. In 2008 PHP 5 became the only stable version under development. Late static binding had been missing from PHP and was added in version 5.3.|$|E
5|$|The {{interpreter}} has an <b>object-oriented</b> architecture. All of {{the elements}} of the Perl language—scalars, arrays, hashes, coderefs, file handles—are represented in the interpreter by C structs. Operations on these structs are defined by a large collection of macros, typedefs, and functions; these constitute the Perl C API. The Perl API can be bewildering to the uninitiated, but its entry points follow a consistent naming scheme, which provides guidance to those who use it.|$|E
25|$|The Windows API (Win32) {{is focused}} {{mainly on the}} {{programming}} language C in that its exposed functions and data structures are described in that language in recent versions of its documentation. However, the API may be used by any programming language compiler or assembler {{able to handle the}} (well-defined) low-level data structures along with the prescribed calling conventions for calls and callbacks. Similarly, the internal implementation of the API's function has been developed in several languages, historically. Despite the fact that C is not an <b>object-oriented</b> programming language, the Windows API and Windows have both historically been described as <b>object-oriented.</b> There have also been many wrapper classes and extensions (from Microsoft and others) for <b>object-oriented</b> languages that make this <b>object-oriented</b> structure more explicit (Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC), Visual Component Library (VCL), GDI+, etc.). For instance, Windows 8 provides the Windows API and the WinRT API, which is implemented in C++ and is <b>object-oriented</b> by design.|$|E
25|$|C# has {{direct support}} for <b>object-oriented</b> programming.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>object-oriented</b> versions: Haskell++, and Mondrian.|$|E
25|$|For the <b>object-oriented</b> {{programming}} language, see Gello Expression Language.|$|E
25|$|C# {{provides}} type-safe <b>object-oriented</b> function pointers in {{the form}} of delegates.|$|E
25|$|Scala, an <b>object-oriented</b> and {{functional}} programming language, has a Scala-to-JavaScript compiler.|$|E
25|$|Cocoa is Apple's native <b>object-oriented</b> {{application}} programming interface (API) {{for their}} operating system macOS.|$|E
25|$|GraphTalk is a {{proprietary}} implementation of Warren's Abstract Machine, with additional <b>object-oriented</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|Fully formed <b>object-oriented</b> {{programming}} in the Smalltalk programming language and integrated development environment.|$|E
25|$|The Squeak {{programming}} {{language is a}} dialect of Smalltalk. It is <b>object-oriented,</b> class-based, and reflective.|$|E
25|$|Coloring may be {{performed}} manually with photo-editing software, or semi-automatically with dedicated software using feature-detection or <b>object-oriented</b> segmentation.|$|E
25|$|Oblog is a small, portable, <b>object-oriented</b> {{extension}} to Prolog by Margaret McDougall of EdCAAD, University of Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|Flora-2 is an <b>object-oriented</b> {{knowledge}} representation and reasoning {{system based on}} F-logic and incorporates HiLog, Transaction logic, and defeasible reasoning.|$|E
25|$|Prototypes: JavaScript uses prototypes {{where many}} other <b>object-oriented</b> {{languages}} use classes for inheritance. It {{is possible to}} simulate many class-based features with prototypes in JavaScript.|$|E
25|$|Classes are {{fundamentals}} of an <b>object-oriented</b> language such as C#. They {{serve as a}} template for objects. They contain members that store and manipulate data in a real-lifelike way.|$|E
25|$|Logtalk is an <b>object-oriented</b> logic {{programming}} language that can use most Prolog implementations as a back-end compiler. As a multi-paradigm language, it includes support for both prototypes and classes.|$|E
25|$|Already {{present at}} this stage of {{development}} were many of the features familiar in later releases of Ruby, including <b>object-oriented</b> design, classes with inheritance, mixins, iterators, closures, exception handling and garbage collection.|$|E
25|$|Octave {{programs}} {{consist of}} a list of function calls or a script. The syntax is matrix-based and provides various functions for matrix operations. It supports various data structures and allows <b>object-oriented</b> programming.|$|E
25|$|According to its creator, Ruby was {{influenced}} by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, <b>object-oriented,</b> and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.|$|E
25|$|Three-dimensional GUIs {{appeared}} in science fiction literature and films {{before they were}} technically feasible or in common use. For example; the 1993 American film Jurassic Park features Silicon Graphics' three-dimensional file manager File System Navigator, a real-life file manager for Unix operating systems. The film Minority Report has scenes of police officers using specialized 3d data systems. In prose fiction, three-dimensional user interfaces have been portrayed as immersible environments like William Gibson's Cyberspace or Neal Stephenson's Metaverse. Many futuristic imaginings of user interfaces rely heavily on <b>object-oriented</b> user interface (OOUI) style and especially <b>object-oriented</b> graphical user interface (OOGUI) style.|$|E
25|$|The Common Lisp Object System, CLOS, is an {{integral}} part of ANSI Common Lisp. CLOS descended from New Flavors and CommonLOOPS. ANSI Common Lisp was the first standardized <b>object-oriented</b> programming language (1994, ANSI X3J13).|$|E
