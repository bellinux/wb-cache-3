5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on September11.

5|$|Aetosaur fossil remains {{are known}} from Europe, North and South America, parts <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> India.

5|$|Diocletian {{replaced}} the prefect of Rome with his consular colleague Bassus. Most officials {{who had served}} under Carinus, however, retained their offices under Diocletian.

Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus, but confirmed him in both roles. He later gave him the proconsulate <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> the post of urban prefect for 295.

He was named after Henry Morton Stanley, the journalist and explorer famous for his exploration <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> for his search for David Livingstone.

5|$|In 1943, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon {{suggested}} that Sturnus-like species could have arrived in Africa, and {{given rise to}} the wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea) and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of Sturnus, rather than the glossy starlings (Lamprotornis) <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> the Madagascan starling (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds. A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.|$|E

5|$|In early June 1989, a {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from the}} west coast <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> traversed the Atlantic Ocean, eventually crossing into the eastern North Pacific. Initially, several centers of circulation {{were associated with the}} system. Continuing organize, the storm is estimated to have attained tropical depression status at 0000 UTC on June 18. The depression was broad and lacked substantial thunderstorm activity. However, it did have respectable outflow and banding.

The spacecraft was operated by NigComSat and the Nigerian Space Agency, NASRDA. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after {{running out of}} power because of an anomaly in its solar array. It {{was based on the}} Chinese DFH-4 satellite bus, and carries a variety of transponders: 4 C-band; 14 Ku-band; 8 Ka-band; and 2 L-band.

5|$|On August 11, 2007, a {{tropical}} wave moved off {{the west coast}} <b>of</b> <b>Africa,</b> <b>and,</b> encountering favorable conditions, quickly developed into Tropical Depression Four about 520miles (835km) west-southwest of Cape Verde on August 13. The depression moved briskly westward, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean at 1500UTC on August 14. The storm's intensity continued to build although dry air and cooler air inflow from the north were slowing structural development. Ragged bands formed on August 15 {{and the formation of}} a partial eyewall was observed later that day.|$|E

5|$|On August 22, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} <b>of</b> <b>Africa,</b> <b>and</b> it moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without developing significantly. On September 1 the wave axis entered the Gulf of Mexico, and upon doing so convection steadily organized around a low-level center of circulation. The system moved northward and developed into Tropical Depression Twelve on September 3 while located about 300miles (480kilometers) west of Tampa, Florida. Embedded within a slow mid-latitude trough, the depression moved eastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri on September 5.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} <b>of</b> <b>Africa</b> <b>and</b> tracked westward.
