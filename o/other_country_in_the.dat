5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{received}} more European settlers during its colonial era than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Americas. Between 1500 and 1760, about 700,000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil, compared to 530,000 European {{immigrants in the}} United States.|$|E

25|$|A {{long period}} of {{political}} instability has resulted in depressed economic activity, deteriorating social conditions, and increased macroeconomic imbalances.

25|$|Taiwan {{has more}} racing pigeon events than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, and {{can point to}} between two and three million birds. Nearly 500,000 people race pigeons on the island, and each year, prize money for races reaches the billions of NT dollars.|$|E
25|$|The Robotics {{industry}} {{is more important}} in Japan than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Japan employs {{over a quarter of}} a million industrial robot workers.

25|$|The United States was {{the only}} country in the Americas to carry out executions in 2015. The only <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Americas to have {{performed}} an execution since 2003 is Saint Kitts and Nevis, in 2008. The countries in the Americas that most recently abolished the death penalty are Suriname (2015), Argentina (2009), and Bolivia (2009). Guatemala abolished the death penalty for civil cases in 2017.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} The Taichung Airport did spark a spat of {{partisan}} controversy about being incomplete and safety concerns were raised.

This is nearly twice as many sites as the next two countries, France (58) and Japan (55), combined. Construction of U.S. nuclear facilities peaked between the 1970s and 1980s, during which time, these facilities were granted 20–40 year operational permits.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{spends a}} higher {{proportion}} of its GDP on healthcare (19%) than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, except for East Timor (Timor-Leste). The number of employers who offer health insurance is declining. Costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising rapidly: since 2001, premiums for family coverage have increased 78%, while wages have risen 19% and prices have risen 17%, according to a 2007 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation.|$|E
25|$|Italy {{has more}} UNESCO World Heritage Sites (53) than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, and has rich {{collections}} of art, culture and literature {{from many different}} periods. The country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other places during the Italian diaspora. Furthermore, the nation has, overall, an estimated 100,000 monuments of any sort (museums, palaces, buildings, statues, churches, art galleries, villas, fountains, historic houses and archaeological remains).|$|E

25|$|Any type {{of sexual}} {{activity}} outside a heterosexual marriage is forbidden. Transsexuality in Iran is legal if accompanied by a gender confirmation surgery, with Iran carrying out more gender realignment operations than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world after Thailand. These surgeries are typically partially funded by the state – there have been claims that some homosexual men may have been pressured to undergo them both by government and society. Transsexuals still report societal intolerance as in other societies around the world.|$|E
25|$|Solitary {{confinement}} {{is widely}} used in US prisons, yet it is underreported by most states, while some don't report it at all. Isolation of prisoners has been condemned by the UN in 2011 {{as a form of}} torture. At over 80,000 at any given time, the US has more prisoners confined in isolation than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. In Louisiana, with 843 prisoners per 100,000 citizens, there have been prisoners, such as the Angola Three, held for as long as forty years in isolation.|$|E
25|$|In a 2000 {{review article}} of twentieth century Finnish architecture, Frédéric Edelmann, arts {{critic of the}} French {{newspaper}} Le Monde, suggested that Finland has more great architects {{of the status of}} Alvar Aalto in proportion to the population than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Finland's most significant architectural achievements are related to modern architecture, mostly because the current building stock has less than 20% that dates back to before 1955, which relates significantly to the reconstruction following World War II and the process of urbanisation which only gathered pace after the war.|$|E

25|$|A further {{financial}} burden was {{imposed on the}} new post-apartheid government through its obligation to provide antiretroviral (ARV) treatment to impoverished victims of the HIV/AIDS epidemic sweeping the country. South Africa had the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS compared to any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, with 5,600,000 people afflicted by the disease and 270,000 HIV-related deaths were recorded in 2011. By that time, more than 2,000,000 children were orphaned due to the epidemic. The provision of ARV treatment resulted in 100,000 fewer AIDS-related deaths in 2011 than in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Constitution {{guarantees}} free, {{universal health}} care for all its citizens. In practice, however, free health care is partially restricted because of mandatory registration. While Russia has more physicians, hospitals, and health care workers than almost any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world on a per capita basis, since the dissolution of the Soviet Union the health of the Russian population has declined considerably as a result of social, economic, and lifestyle changes; the trend has been reversed only in the recent years, with average life expectancy having increased 5.2 years for males and 3.1 years for females between 2006 and 2014.|$|E
25|$|The UAE {{spends more}} than any <b>other</b> <b>country</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world to {{influence}} U.S. policy and shape domestic debate, and it pays former high-level government officials who worked with it {{to carry out its}} agenda within the U.S. The largest expatriate presence in the UAE is Indian. Following British withdrawal from the UAE in 1971 and the establishment of the UAE as a state, the UAE disputed rights to a number of islands in the Persian Gulf against Iran. The UAE {{went so far as to}} bring the matter to the United Nations, but the case was dismissed. The dispute has not significantly impacted relations because of the large Iranian community presence and strong economic ties.|$|E
