5|$|The {{restaurant}} had 37 {{locations in}} 2002, 65 in 2003, and 142 by 2007. The company started franchising in 2003 and by 2007, 22 of its stores were franchises. The restaurants were redesigned in 2004 with lighter colors, new packaging, {{a greater emphasis}} on carryout orders and a floorplan that emphasized an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen,</b> where the saute line was visible to customers.|$|E
5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E

25|$|Starting in the 1980s, the {{perfection}} of the extractor hood allowed an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> again, integrated more or less with the living room without causing the whole apartment or house to smell. Before that, only a few earlier experiments, typically in newly built upper-middle-class family homes, had open kitchens. Examples are Frank Lloyd Wright's House Willey (1934) and House Jacobs (1936). Both had open kitchens, with high ceilings (up to the roof) and were aired by skylights. The extractor hood {{made it possible to}} build open kitchens in apartments, too, where both high ceilings and skylights were not possible.|$|E
25|$|On 13 September 2017, Collins Foods {{announced}} that Taco Bell {{would return to}} the Australian market, with their first store being situated in the Brisbane suburb of Annerley in Queensland using a refurbished Sizzler restaurant which had closed earlier that year. The Annerley store opened on Saturday 4 November 2017 with about 50 people camping out overnight to be first to try the store. The store has 96 seats in indoor and outdoor settings and has an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> so diners can see their food being prepared. There is also a drive-through. The menu appears to be a subset of the USA menu based on food tasting research undertaken by the company. The Annerley store does not have a breakfast menu, but offers beers and margaritas similar to their Mexican food competitors in the Australian market.|$|E
500|$|In August 2017, {{the company}} began to pilot a new design concept at seven remodeled {{locations}} (three in Kansas City, three in San Antonio, one in Selma, TX), branded as Chuck E.

These locations feature more upscale decor with a [...] "muted" [...] interior color scheme, an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen,</b> the [...] "Play Pass" [...] card system to replace arcade tokens, and the animatronic stage show replaced by a dance floor area. These changes, along with expansions to food offerings, are intended to help the chain provide an experience that can appeal better to adult visitors, and encourage family dining as opposed to primarily parties.|$|E

500|$|The Whopper Bar is {{a concept}} from the company that upends its {{traditional}} fast food operations with a newer high end concept designed to compete with fast casual and casual dining restaurants. The new format is described by the company as a more [...] "playful" [...] variation on the standard Burger King location. The locations feature an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> with a semi-circular metal counter top designed to allow customers to watch as its [...] "Whopperistas" [...] put together the order. The exposed kitchen concept allows customers to view the preparation of their foods. Decoration of the new locations is limited to plasma televisions playing looped videos of open flames. The concept {{is similar to the}} McCafe concept from rival McDonald's, and like the McCafe locations they are designed to go into malls, airports and casinos and other areas with limited amounts of space.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{established}} {{as one of}} the show's primary settings, Monica's large Greenwich Village apartment has since {{become one of the most}} famous and iconic television sets in history. Steffani Cameron of BuildDirect wrote that Monica's [...] "apartment was unlike anything else on TV. It was full of color, clutter, and personality. It was a space cobbled together of kitsch and class, and it was just magic", citing its windows, color and openness among her favourite things about the apartment. Harper's Bazaar magazine ranked it among the [...] "12 Best Apartments on TV". Chloe Daley of Refinery29 joked that the apartment serves as both [...] "a lesson in how to decorate with purple" [...] and [...] "a lesson in how not to". Based on its total number of bedrooms, <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> concept, large living space and balcony, real estate agent Sydney Blumstein estimates that the apartment would be worth approximately 2.3million in 2015. In terms of its size and affordability, the apartment has frequently been the subject of scrutiny; critics constantly question how Monica, a chef, and Rachel, a waitress, were able to afford such a luxurious home based on their relatively low incomes, often dismissing the show's explanation that this is due to an illegal sublet courtesy of Monica's late grandmother. Hollywood.com's Abbey Stone ranked it television's 10th [...] "most ridiculous" [...] apartment, while The Village Voice placed it at number four in a similar article.|$|E

I am looking to create a space which mimics the studio environment – not only that – because I would be in the centre of the dancefloor so I can monitor everything around me and be at the same level – eye-level with the presumed dancer. This way it makes it easy for me to create the atmosphere and the rhythm suitable for the individual dancefloor. Kind of like an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> in a restaurant – it’s an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> in a club bringing the food to the people instantly – as soon as it’s produced it’s already on the dancefloor.

2500|$|In July 2014, De Laurentiis {{opened her}} first {{restaurant}}, called GIADA, inside The Cromwell in Las Vegas, Nevada.

50|$|In restaurants, flattop grills are {{sometimes}} used for display, or “front-of-house” cooking, where diners can see, hear {{and smell the}} food being cooked in front of them. Unlike butane burners or induction hobs which require additional equipment, the flattop grill {{can be used as}} a standalone cooking platform. Display cooking is a notable trend in commercial foodservice, where <b>open</b> <b>kitchens</b> are becoming part of the dining experience, and watching a meal being prepared live-action has become entertainment.|$|R

2500|$|He painted three known color {{advertisements}} for General Electric's all-steel [...] "Monitor Top" [...] refrigerator in 1930. The {{first and most}} elaborate featured two boys running a lemonade stand, with their mother looking on through the <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> window. It appeared as a full-page ad in many different magazines {{at roughly the same}} time. It's also shown in a video slideshow, which salutes the first affordable model for residential use (though at a hefty price). His other [...] "Monitor Top" [...] credits were of a girl playing with blocks (that spell out the company's initials), and two dressed-up girls listening to an enthusiastic sales boy.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reason for}} the trend back to open kitchens (and a {{foundation}} of the [...] "kitchen object" [...] philosophy) is changes in how food is prepared. Whereas prior to the 1950s most cooking started out with raw ingredients and a meal had to be prepared from scratch, the advent of frozen meals and pre-prepared convenience food changed the cooking habits of many people, who consequently used the kitchen less and less. For others, who followed the [...] "cooking as a social act" [...] trend, the <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> had the advantage {{that they could be}} with their guests while cooking, and for the [...] "creative cooks" [...] it might even become a stage for their cooking performance.|$|E
2500|$|The block kitchen (or island) is a {{more recent}} development, {{typically}} found in open kitchens. Here, the stove or both the stove and the sink are placed where an L or U kitchen would have a table, in a free-standing [...] "island", separated from the other cabinets. In a closed room, this does not make much sense, but in an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen,</b> it makes the stove accessible from all sides such that two persons can cook together, and allows for contact with guests or {{the rest of the}} family, since the cook does not face the wall any more. Additionally, the kitchen island's counter-top can function as an overflow-surface for serving buffet style meals or sitting down to eat breakfast and snacks.|$|E

2500|$|By 1980, Alice Waters' Chez Panisse and {{its head}} chef, Jeremiah Tower, had already invented California cuisine, a {{combination}} of French and Italian techniques and presentation with fresh local ingredient-focused flavors. Waters was a long-time fan of Tommasso's Italian restaurant in San Francisco's North Beach, which had installed the West Coast's first wood-fired pizza oven {{when it opened in}} 1935. [...] After traveling to Italy, Waters decided to make an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> featuring a Tomasso's-style pizza oven the focus of the new cafe she was opening above her main dining room. [...] Although prepared in classic fashion, her chefs added exotic fine ingredients to their single-serving pizzas and calzones, such as goat cheese and duck sausage. [...] Her cafe, and its pizzas in particular, were an instant success, attracting wide attention among food critics.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{at the end}} of the Diele {{near the}} back of the farmhouse, was the Flett, an <b>open</b> <b>kitchen</b> and dining area that took up the entire width of the house. The open fireplace, about 1.5 metres across, was located in the middle of the Flett and was ringed with fieldstones. It was not like a hearth in other regions. Many types of cooking were not {{possible}} in this environment (*). Pots had to be high enough, in effect cauldrons, and were hung over the fire with pothooks attached to a wooden frame (Rahmen) hanging over the fireplace, often decorated with horses heads. At night an iron grid was pulled over the fire to prevent sparks, a practice known by the English term curfew. Well-to-do families had a candle arch (Schwibbogen) of masonry instead of a wooden frame. Smoke escaped through an opening in the roof on the gable, the Uhlenloch (also Eulenloch, literally: [...] "owl hole"). The open fireplace meant that such buildings were considered as a particular fire risk by early fire insurance firms. The open fire also provided some heat to the stalls and living quarters of the Hallenhaus. In this way, hay stored in the loft could be dried out and protected from vermin by the smoke. When the farmer's family and farm hands gathered for meal times, the best places were between the fireplace and the rooms. Because there was no partition between Diele and loft, winter temperatures in the Flett never rose above 12°C.|$|E
