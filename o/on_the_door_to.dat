The raid team did not {{coordinate}} their action with the local police department as required by mutual agreement, nor did they did not obtain a warrant or knock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> announce their presence. They raided the house with explosive devices and with firearms drawn. During the course of the raid, they shot and killed the Calvo family's two pet Labrador retriever dogs.|$|E
5|$|The Special Boat Section {{was founded}} in July 1940 by a Commando officer, Roger Courtney. Courtney became a {{commando}} recruit in mid-1940, and {{was sent to the}} Combined Training Centre in Scotland. He was unsuccessful in his initial attempts to convince Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes and later Admiral Theodore Hallett, commander of the Combined Training Centre, that his idea of a folding kayak brigade would be effective. He decided to infiltrate , a Landing Ship, Infantry anchored in the River Clyde. Courtney paddled to the ship, climbed aboard undetected, wrote his initials <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the captain's cabin, and stole a deck gun cover. He presented the soaking cover to a group of high-ranking Royal Navy officers meeting at a nearby Inveraray hotel. He was promoted to captain, and given command of twelve men, the first Special Boat Service/Special Boat Section.|$|E

[...] Fisher knew that the FBI's use of his rank could have only come from Häyhänen. Fisher said nothing to the FBI and, after spending twenty-three minutes staring at Fisher, the FBI agents called in the waiting Immigration and Naturalization Service officers who arrested Fisher and detained him under section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.|$|E

500|$|Shepard was {{designated}} Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963. He thereby became responsible for NASA [...] astronaut training. This involved {{the development of}} appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment {{to be used by}} astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary had several head shot photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> his private office, with a sign which said [...] "Mood of the Day". Visitors could then look at the photo to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him. Tom Wolfe characterised Shepard's dual personalities as [...] "Smilin' Al" [...] and the [...] "Icy Commander". [...] "Inside his locker", Wolfe wrote, [...] "he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!" ...|$|E

That being said, he did serve as Priori in the Signoria in 1402, 1408 and 1411 and as Gonfaloniere, for the statutory two-month period, in 1421.

It is also worth noting that in Fey's original script for 30 Rock, Lemon's first name was [...] "Lisa". The character's middle name, [...] "Miervaldis," [...] is a Latvian masculine name. Fey has said that, while Lemon's ethnic background is unknown, [...] "Latvian seems to make sense.". She has also, more recently, been suggested to have German ancestry, and speaks {{at least a little}} of the language. The character's last name, [...] "Lemon," [...] is apparently intended to imply an acerbic personality and possibly also to make her full name alliterative. Fey has stated that she wanted Liz to have a good last name since she knew the character would often be called by it.|$|E

5000|$|In 1963, Gorman {{approved}} and enforced {{a new policy}} to increase the role of enlisted women in the American military. The plan included special dispensations for female soldiers based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> demands of currently enlisted women. These changes included increased security in living environments, and designated living spaces accessible only by female personnel. Female personnel had also requested locks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> their private dormitories, and Gorman's plan provided these. Through the policy, female soldiers were also permitted to decorate and personalize some areas of their living space. Between 1962 and 1966, reports showed that Gorman's policy had increased enlistment around 12% new enlistees.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{initially}} stated by police that Menezes was shot {{five times in}} the head. Mark Whitby, a passenger on the train Menezes had run onto, said: 'one of [...] was carrying a black handgun—it looked like an automatic—He half tripped… they pushed him to the floor, bundled {{on top of him}} and unloaded five shots into him.' Another passenger, Dan Copeland, said: 'an officer jumped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> my left and screamed, [...] "Everybody out!" [...] People just froze in their seats cowering for a few seconds and then leapt up. As I turned out the door on to the platform, I heard four dull bangs.' Menezes's cousin Alex Pereira, who lived with him, asserted that Menezes had been shot from behind: 'I pushed my way into the morgue. [...] They wouldn't let me see him. His mouth was twisted by the wounds and it looked like he had been shot {{from the back of the}} neck.' Later reports confirmed that Jean Charles de Menezes was shot a total of eight times: seven times in the head and once in the shoulder.|$|E
2500|$|In 'January' , the Fellowship of the Ring {{travelled}} through Moria {{on the way}} to Mount Doom. They {{were attacked}} in the Chamber of Mazarbul by Orcs. The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when the wizard Gandalf the Grey tried to place a [...] "shutting spell" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber {{on the other side and}} cast a [...] "terrible" [...] counterspell. Gandalf spoke a word of Command to stay the door, but the door shattered and the chamber collapsed. Gandalf was severely weakened by this encounter. The company fled with him, but the Orcs and the Balrog, taking a different route, caught up with them at the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Elf Legolas instantly recognized the Balrog and Gandalf tried to hold the bridge against it. As Gandalf faced the Balrog he proclaimed, [...] "You cannot pass, flame of Udûn!", and broke the bridge beneath the Balrog. As it fell, the Balrog wrapped its whip about Gandalf's knees, dragging him to the brink. As the Fellowship looked on in horror, Gandalf cried [...] "Fly, you fools!" [...] and plunged into the darkness below.|$|E

Its refrigerators are designed with a 24 in depth and can be installed flush with kitchen cabinets of the same standard depth to provide an integrated look.
