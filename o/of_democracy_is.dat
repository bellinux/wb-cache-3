5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E

The issue <b>of</b> internal <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> particularly relevant for a multifaceted and heterogeneous movement which has denounced the democratic deficits of decision-making processes and {{stressed the need for}} radical democratic reforms. In addition, and in part as a response to these demands for greater levels of citizen participation, experiments in participatory and deliberative forms <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>are</b> underway. Taking an empirical perspective, this collection investigates the development of new conceptions and practices <b>of</b> <b>democracy,</b> integrating research into approximately 250 European and transnational social movement organizations...|$|R
25|$|For Aristotle the {{underlying}} principle <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> freedom, since {{only in a}} democracy the citizens can have a share in freedom. In essence, he argues {{that this is what}} every democracy should make its aim. There are two main aspects of freedom: being ruled and ruling in turn, since everyone is equal according to number, not merit, {{and to be able to}} live as one pleases.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that a basic feature <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully {{in the life of}} their society. With its emphasis on notions of social contract and the collective will of all the voters, democracy can also be characterised as a form of political collectivism because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variants}} of democracy exist, {{but there are}} two basic forms, both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One form <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> direct democracy, in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the political decision making, for example voting on policy initiatives directly. In most modern democracies, the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives; this is called a representative democracy.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{the case}} of India, the authors deny an {{equivalence}} between inclusive political institutions and electoral democracy. Electoral democracy is the de jure system adopted by a country while political institutions refer to the de facto structure and quality of political system of a certain country. For example, India's political system has long been dominated by the Congress Party; the provision of public goods is preyed upon by political Patrimonialism; various members of Lok Sabha (the Indian legislature) face criminal charges; and caste-based inequality still exists. The quality <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> very poor and thus the political institutions are flawed in India, which explains why economic institutions are equally poor and economic growth is stymied.|$|E

[...] After the regions are defined, they are further divided into 12 sectors after the same principle <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> applied. [...] While sectors of the same region are defined as having equal numbers of inhabitants, the regions themselves may have different levels of population, which would be proportional to its voting power.|$|E
500|$|A {{key idea}} <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> that [...] "people may consent {{to be governed}} by laws made by ... democratically elected representatives". Judges are {{required}} to interpret statutes {{in a manner that}} gives [...] "effect to the intent and will of Parliament". By interpreting statutes according to Parliament's intention, the judiciary upholds the notion of representative democracy as it makes sure that the people are ruled accurately by the laws made by their elected leaders. Thus, the role of judges in interpretation is essential to democracy.|$|E
40|$|An earlier {{discussion}} paper proposed elevating the significance <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> regarding eligibility for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) funding. The argument <b>is</b> that promotion <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> has <b>been</b> a long-standing goal of U. S. foreign policy, and <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> also both a means {{and end of}} economic development. This paper extends that argument, and proposes that participation in the Community <b>of</b> <b>Democracies</b> <b>be</b> a criterion for MCA funding eligibility. The U. S. is an active supporter of the Community <b>of</b> <b>Democracies,</b> and linking the MCA and Community <b>of</b> <b>Democracies</b> stands to yield significant policy benefits. First, it will explicitly link democracy promotion and economic development assistance, sending a signal about the importance <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> for development. Second, it will provide an incentive for countries to seek and maintain participation in the Community <b>of</b> <b>Democracies,</b> thereby strengthening the initiative. Third, participation in the Community <b>of</b> <b>Democracies</b> <b>is</b> a robust comprehensive indicator with excellent statistical properties. When paired with control of corruption, it creates a simple transparent eligibility screen that simplifies and improves the selection process. This simplified screen has numerous technical and policy advantages...|$|R
40|$|Justifications <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> rest {{in large}} part on {{unacknowledged}} empirical assumptions regarding the cognitive, informational, and behavioral capacities of individuals and voting populations. The goal of this project was to identify those assumptions and examine them in light of data from the social sciences. To the extent that these assumptions are undermined by empirical evidence, the normative legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> as a system of rule <b>is</b> weakened. Theories <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>were</b> organized along a continuum from purely instrumental to purely intrinsic or procedural, and a representative sample of theories from along this spectrum were analyzed in order to identify their core empirical assumptions. Interest-based, deliberative, and egalitarian theories <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>were</b> each demonstrated to be predicated on substantive empirical assumptions which were contradicted by the available evidence. A sophisticated hybrid account incorporating aspects from along the spectrum of available theories was likewise demonstrated to be predicated on unsubstantiated assumptions regarding human capacities. A concluding analysis of the circumstances which undermine the assumptions of democratic theory demonstrated the limited tractability of these circumstances, leading to my assertion that a new conception <b>of</b> what <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> and what purposes it should serve is warranted, and that in the interim, contemporary attempts to justify the dissemination <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>are</b> undermined...|$|R

2500|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy in his dissenting opinion, {{joined by}} Justices Alito, Thomas and Sotomayor, {{expressed}} concern about the implications of the Supreme Court ruling, noting that voter initiatives existed precisely for when voters felt the State was insufficiently responsive to their concerns or as a way for the people to assert their rights, and that elected officials should not have the ability to nullify such laws simply by choosing not to defend them. Kennedy wrote: [...] "In the end, what the Court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the initiative process. And it is this.

He claims that the two main forms of democracy, socialist democracy (proletarian democracy) and capitalist democracy (bourgeoisie democracy) are both diametrically opposite; socialist democracy allows the people to master their own affairs while capitalist democracy, Wang contends, [...] "guarantees the freedom of capital to exploit and suppress [...] ". The use of qualifiers {{in front of the}} word <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> important as to highlight the class nature of the different forms of democracy Wang contends, and concludes that [...] "One sort of pure democracy, common democracy or 'universal democracy' that all of humanity identifies with has never existed in human societies".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article reconsiders the {{argument}} that civil society promotes democracy. Both the independent variable of civil society and the dependent variable <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>are</b> disentangled. Several hypotheses on what characteristics of civil society organizations (CSOs) promote what aspects <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>are</b> tested using survey data including 500 CSOs in post-communist Latvia. The regression analysis shows that organizational characteristics (such as the fi eld of activity, extent of political activities, and number of members) have a stronger effect on democracy than have relational characteristics (such as the degree of open recruitment and autonomy). Certain characteristics of CSOs can be supportive of some democratic functions but constitute obstacles to other aspects <b>of</b> <b>democracy.</b> It <b>is</b> possible to distinguish between an advocacy civil society, which is vital for the institutional aspects <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> through performing the functions of interest articulation and checking state power, and a recreational civil society, which may strengthen democracy through the fostering of support for democratic values and increasing individual capacity for political participation...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{presents the}} basic concept for the <b>Democracy</b> Ranking <b>of</b> the Quality <b>of</b> <b>Democracy</b> and positions this approach in context of academic discourses about {{democracy and the}} quality <b>of</b> <b>democracy.</b> Key dimensions <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>are</b> freedom, equality and control. Quality-of-democracy models commonly emphasize a <b>democracy</b> understanding that <b>is</b> broader than earlier concepts <b>of</b> primarily electoral <b>democracies.</b> Different global democracy and democratization measurement initiatives (Freedom House, Polity IV, Vanhanen’s Index <b>of</b> <b>Democracy,</b> and the Economist Intelligence Unit's Index <b>of</b> <b>Democracy)</b> <b>are</b> reviewed and compared. The Democracy Ranking underscores a conceptualization of the Quality <b>of</b> <b>Democracy</b> = Quality <b>of</b> Politics + Quality of Society. The conceptual formula for the Democracy Ranking (see Figure 5 in Chapter 5), therefore, may be summarized as: quality <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> = (freedom + other characteristics of the political system) + (performance of the nonpolitical dimensions). This formula offers an opportunity for creating regularly conducted indicator-based rankings of countries, based on the quality <b>of</b> their <b>democracy.</b> " (author's abstract...|$|R

In 2011, Hadlaq warned against a unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, which he says will shatter the idea of real peace in the region. According to Al-Hadlaq, Israel has in the past made strategic concessions for peace, in Sinai, the Gaza Strip and South Lebanon, proving her desire for peaceful negotiations, but the response she earned was a hail of rockets from the [...] "terrorists of Hizballah and Hamas".|$|E
