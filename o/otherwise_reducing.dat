After these moulds did he saw and cut his boat's timbers, making, in each instance, duplicates. When the ribs and floors of his craft were ready, he set them up in the vacancies, and secured them, after making an accurate fit with the pieces left standing. On knocking away the deal portions of his work, Mark had the frame of his boat complete. This was much the most troublesome part of the whole job; nor was it finished, when the young man was obliged, by the progress of the seasons, to quit the ship-yard for the garden.|$|E

The random parameters logit model offers a means of avoiding the IIA assumption as well as greater heterogeneity among agents, recreational anglers or beachgoers in the current application. A problem often encountered in the estimation of random utility models with many alternatives is the necessity of sampling alternatives or <b>otherwise</b> <b>reducing</b> the number of choices. Research has shown that in the random utility model, such changes in choice set still lead to consistent parameter estimates.

40|$|Abstract. Developing a {{distributed}} application for mobile resource constrained devices {{is a difficult}} and error-prone task that requires awareness of several system-level details (e. g., fault-tolerance, [...] .). Several mobile middleware solutions addressing these issues have been proposed. However, they rely on either significant changes in application structure, ex-tensions to the programming language syntax and semantics, domain specific languages, cumbersome development tools, {{or a combination of}} the above. The main disadvantages of these approaches are lack of transparency and reduced portability. In this paper we describe our work on enabling transparent integration between applications and middleware without changing application structure, extending the programming language or <b>otherwise</b> <b>reducing</b> portability. We used the OBI-WAN middleware but our solutions are general. To achieve this goal we employ program analysis and transformation techniques for extending application code with hooks for calling middleware services. Application code extension is per-formed automatically at compile-time by a code extension tool integrated with the development environment tool set. We describe the implementation of our. NET and Java prototypes and discuss evaluation results. Key words: distributed mobile applications, fault-tolerance, incremental ob-ject replication, transparent middleware integration, program transformation, aspect-oriented programming, integrated development environment...|$|E

The present thesis focuses on carrying out an experimental study of VOCs removal using a non-­thermal plasma technology.

While plasma was assisting thermal oxidation reactions, the toluene removal efficiency was investigatedin terms of initial concentration of the pollutant, voltage of the discharges and gas ratio. Moreover, in further experiments the gas flow mixture was ignited in order to study the combined effect of plasma and combustion on toluene removal efficiency.

40|$|Lymphedema, {{regardless}} of etiology, is essentially incurable but different therapy approaches exist which serve to contain swelling. The objectives of treatment are to reduce swelling, restore shape, and prevent inflammatory episodes, eg, recurrent cellulitis. There are essentially three main approaches to lymphedema treatment: physical therapy, drug therapy, and surgery. Any edema arises from an imbalance between capillary filtration and lymph drainage. The principle of physical therapy is to a) reduce excessive capillary filtration and b) improve drainage of interstitial fluid and macromolecules from congested regions to normally draining lymph node sites. This is achieved {{through a combination}} of compres-sion, exercise, and if possible, massage. Control of recurrent inflammatory episodes can only be achieved through diabetic type skin care, a reduction in swelling, and if necessary, prophylactic antibiotics. Drug therapy comprises diuretics or the coumarin/flavonoid group of drugs. The use of diuretics for pure lymphedema is physiologically unsound but may be of use in edema of mixed origin and in palliative (cancer) circumstances. Coumarin/flavonoids have been shown to reduce swelling in all types of lymphedema. Surgery is indicated at an early stage for facial swelling, where vision is compro-mised, or genital lymphedema, where genitourinary function is affected. <b>Otherwise,</b> <b>reducing</b> operations should only be performed when alternative therapy has failed. Microsurgery for certain forms of lymphedema continues to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Over {{evolutionary}} history, conifers {{have faced}} {{a myriad of}} threats from phloem- and xylem-feeding insects, defoliating insects, and fungal pathogens. Among the trees ’ defenses, terpenoids appear {{to play a major}} role by harming, disabling, deterring, repelling, or <b>otherwise</b> <b>reducing</b> the fitness of potential invaders. Each of the three classes of terpenoids in conifers, monoter-penes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes, are composed of a large number of rep-resentative compounds. In most cases, the presence of a particular terpenoid compound in the oleoresin or volatile emissions from a specific conifer can be accounted for by the expression of one of many committed terpene syn-thase (TPS) genes. However, while each TPS may produce one or a few major products, many produce a variety of minor products with relatively constant component ratios in the product blends. TPS genes exist in conifers in large and functionally diverse, yet monophyletic, gene families. Within these gene families, new biochemical functions of TPS appear to have evolved by gene duplication and changes in the amino acid sequence of the enzyme’s active site. In addition, TPS genes may be differentially expressed prior to, during, and following attack by insects or pathogens. Thus, while the production of any particular terpenoid is hardwired into a conifer’s genome, these trees have the capacity to change the mixture of terpenoids in oleoresin secretions and volatil...|$|E

Furthermore, we investigated vertical distributions of AOB and NOB in the infaunal burrow walls and the bulk sediments by real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assay. The AOB and Nitrospira-like NOB-specific 16 S rRNA gene copy numbers in the burrow walls were comparable with those in the sediment surfaces.

40|$|In {{the last}} years the concept of Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) has been {{developing}} and spreading in the scientific community. The work presented in this thesis has been largely developed {{in the context of}} the International Energy Agency (IEA) joint Programme Solar Heating and Cooling (SHC) Task 40 and Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems (ECBCS) Annex 52 : Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings. It is known that the energy consumption in Europe for residential and commercial buildings is around 40 % of the total production. It is then extremely important to optimize both the implementation of energy efficiency measures and the usage of renewable resources that can be harvested on site. When energy efficiency measures are successfully combined with on-site renewable energy sources, and the energy consumption is equal (or nearly) to the energy production, then the output achieved can be referred to as ―near net zero energy ―or ―net zero-energy building‖. In Chapter 2 a description of the main typologies of NZEB is carried out, revealing that the most important ones are the following: site-ZEB and source-ZEB depending on where the energy balance is calculated. After a brief description of the NZEB most common definitions and classifications many examples have been examined, analyzing their features in relation to the climate in which they are, in order to show different solutions and approaches to the problem of reaching net zero energy balances (Chapter 3). In this thesis an Italian case-study has been examined: the Leaf House (LH) located in Ancona, Italy. The Leaf House is one of the best case studies of the IEA/SHC/ECBS/Task 40 Programme, in terms of thermo-physical characteristics of the building envelope, thermal plant, building automation system and energy monitoring. In Chapter 5 the Leaf House case-study is described in detail as well as the model implemented into the TRNSYS software (Chapter 6), reproducing the energy production system, the thermal features of the building and comparing simulated with monitored data. Particular attention has to be paid to the Leaf House monitoring system, which allows the assessment of the building energy balance. A careful analysis of monitored data brings to search some improving strategies to reach the zero energy target. After the simulation of the real building systems (through the software TRNSYS-Chapter 6), several scenarios have been investigated to improve energy performances of the building. Moreover the implemented model has been properly calibrated. The study proposes a detailed analysis of the case-study in order to show the possible energy savings that an NZEB can achieve in comparison with a non-net zero energy building. The re-design options are then proposed and the results evaluated by TRNSYS are described in detail. The monitored situation shows an energy consumption of 37 MWh for the year 2009; although around 6 MWh are wasted in the monitoring equipment the energy production is lower than this value. A simple solution, to reach the NZEB status is moving towards a higher production: e. g. the substitution of the PV panels with higher efficient others. In this way the energy balance reaches ―zero‖ during the year. Nevertheless the problem can be solved <b>otherwise,</b> <b>reducing</b> the energy needs. In this direction, the Geothermal Heat Pump and its energy needs have been analyzed in detail. It has been verified that the COP of the machine is way lower than the declared 4. 6 and that an effective 4. 6 COP could lead to significant energy savings. The idea of reaching higher efficiencies led to the proposal of a different plant scheme with the exclusion of a heat exchanger to reduce as much as possible energy losses. While it is possible to obtain the NZEB status simply making a substitution of the PV panels, the investigation on further energy savings has been continued. Finally the Italian case study allow to identify the strategies to improve the energy performances of the a Near Net Zero Energy building to reach the NZEB target. It represents also an Italian reference for others who wish to build NZEBs in the Italian context. At last two annexes to this work are shown, the first shows objectives and activities of the Task 40 ECBS Programme while the second shows the Building description file created into TRNBUILD environment, in order to describe the Leaf House building envelope features...|$|E

40|$|Data-driven {{research}} {{approaches are}} becoming increasingly popular in {{a growing number of}} scientific disciplines. While a data-driven research approach can yield superior results, generating the required data can be very costly. This frequently leads to small and complex data sets, in which it is impossible to rely on volume alone to compensate for all shortcomings of the data. To counter this problem, other reliable sources of information must be incorporated. In this work, domain knowledge, as a particularly reliable type of additional information, is used to inform data-driven analysis methods. This domain knowledge is represented as constraints on the possible solutions, which the presented methods can use to inform their analysis. It focusses on spatial constraints as a particularly common type of constraint, but the proposed techniques are general enough to be applied to other types of constraints. In this thesis, new methods using domain constraints for data-driven science applications are discussed. These methods have applications in feature evaluation, route database repair, and Gaussian Mixture modeling of spatial data. The first application focuses on feature evaluation. The presented method receives two representations of the same data: one as the intended target and the other for investigation. It calculates a score indicating how much the two representations agree. A presented application uses this technique to compare a reference attribute set with different subsets to determine the importance and relevance of individual attributes. A second technique analyzes route data for constraint compliance. The presented framework allows the user to specify constraints and possible actions to modify the data. The presented method then uses these inputs to generate a version of the data, which agrees with the constraints, while <b>otherwise</b> <b>reducing</b> the impact of the modifications as much as possible. Two extensions of this schema are presented: an extension to continuously valued costs, which are minimized, and an extension to constraints involving more than one moving object. Another addressed application area is modeling of multivariate measurement data, which was measured at spatially distributed locations. The spatial information recorded with the data can be used as the basis for constraints. This thesis presents multiple approaches to building a model of this kind of data while complying with spatial constraints. The first approach is an interactive tool, which allows domain scientists to generate a model of the data, which complies with their knowledge about the data. The second is a Monte Carlo approach, which generates a large number of possible models, tests them for compliance with the constraints, and returns the best one. The final two approaches are based on the EM algorithm and use different ways of incorporating the information into their models. At the end of the thesis, two applications of the models, which have been generated in the previous chapter, are presented. The first is prediction of the origin of samples and the other is the visual representation of the extracted models on a map. These tools can be used by domain scientists to augment their tried and tested tools. The developed techniques are applied to a real-world data set collected in the archaeobiological research project FOR 1670 (Transalpine mobility and cultural transfer) of the German Science Foundation. The data set contains isotope ratio measurements of samples, which were discovered at archaeological sites in the Alps region of central Europe. Using the presented data analysis methods, the data is analyzed to answer relevant domain questions. In a first application, the attributes of the measurements are analyzed for their relative importance and their ability to predict the spatial location of samples. Another presented application is the reconstruction of potential migration routes between the investigated sites. Then spatial models are built using the presented modeling approaches. Univariate outliers are determined and used to predict locations based on the generated models. These are cross-referenced with the recorded origins. Finally, maps of the isotope distribution in the investigated regions are presented. The described methods and demonstrated analyses show that domain knowledge can be used to formulate constraints that inform the data analysis process to yield valid models from relatively small data sets and support domain scientists in their analyses. Datengetriebene Forschungsansätze werden für eine wachsende Anzahl von wissenschaftlichen Disziplinen immer wichtiger. Obwohl ein datengetriebener Forschungsansatz bessere Ergebnisse erzielen kann, kann es sehr teuer sein die notwendigen Daten zu gewinnen. Dies hat häufig zur Folge, dass kleine und komplexe Datensätze entstehen, bei denen es nicht möglich ist sich auf die Menge der Datenpunkte zu verlassen um Probleme bei der Analyse auszugleichen. Um diesem Problem zu begegnen müssen andere Informationsquellen verwendet werden. Fachwissen als eine besonders zuverlässige Quelle solcher Informationen kann herangezogen werden, um die datengetriebenen Analysemethoden zu unterstützen. Dieses Fachwissen wird ausgedrückt als Constraints (Nebenbedingungen) der möglichen Lösungen, die die vorgestellten Methoden benutzen können um ihre Analyse zu steuern. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf räumlichen Constraints als eine besonders häufige Art von Constraints, aber die vorgeschlagenen Methoden sind allgemein genug um auf andere Arte von Constraints angewendet zu werden. Es werden neue Methoden diskutiert, die Fachwissen für datengetriebene wissenschaftliche Anwendungen verwenden. Diese Methoden haben Anwendungen auf Feature-Evaluation, die Reparatur von Bewegungsdatenbanken und auf Gaussian-Mixture-Modelle von räumlichen Daten. Die erste Anwendung betrifft Feature-Evaluation. Die vorgestellte Methode erhält zwei Repräsentationen der selben Daten: eine als Zielrepräsentation und eine zur Untersuchung. Sie berechnet einen Wert, der aussagt, wie einig sich die beiden Repräsentationen sind. Eine vorgestellte Anwendung benutzt diese Technik um eine Referenzmenge von Attributen mit verschiedenen Untermengen zu vergleichen, um die Wichtigkeit und Relevanz einzelner Attribute zu bestimmen. Eine zweite Technik analysiert die Einhaltung von Constraints in Bewegungsdaten. Das präsentierte Framework erlaubt dem Benutzer Constraints zu definieren und mögliche Aktionen zur Veränderung der Daten anzuwenden. Die präsentierte Methode benutzt diese Eingaben dann um eine neue Variante der Daten zu erstellen, die die Constraints erfüllt ohne die Datenbank mehr als notwendig zu verändern. Zwei Erweiterungen dieser Grundidee werden vorgestellt: eine Erweiterung auf stetige Kostenfunktionen, die minimiert werden, und eine Erweiterung auf Bedingungen, die mehr als ein bewegliches Objekt betreffen. Ein weiteres behandeltes Anwendungsgebiet ist die Modellierung von multivariaten Messungen, die an räumlich verteilten Orten gemessen wurden. Die räumliche Information, die zusammen mit diesen Daten erhoben wurde, kann als Grundlage genutzt werden um Constraints zu formulieren. Mehrere Ansätze zum Erstellen von Modellen auf dieser Art von Daten werden vorgestellt, die räumliche Constraints einhalten. Der erste dieser Ansätze ist ein interaktives Werkzeug, das Fachwissenschaftlern dabei hilft, Modelle der Daten zu erstellen, die mit ihrem Wissen über die Daten übereinstimmen. Der zweite ist eine Monte-Carlo-Simulation, die eine große Menge möglicher Modelle erstellt, testet ob sie mit den Constraints übereinstimmen und das beste Modell zurückgeben. Zwei letzte Ansätze basieren auf dem EM-Algorithmus und benutzen verschiedene Arten diese Information in das Modell zu integrieren. Am Ende werden zwei Anwendungen der gerade vorgestellten Modelle vorgestellt. Die erste ist die Vorhersage der Herkunft von Proben und die andere ist die grafische Darstellung der erstellten Modelle auf einer Karte. Diese Werkzeuge können von Fachwissenschaftlern benutzt werden um ihre bewährten Methoden zu unterstützen. Die entwickelten Methoden werden auf einen realen Datensatz angewendet, der von dem archäo-biologischen Forschungsprojekt FOR 1670 (Transalpine Mobilität und Kulturtransfer der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft erhoben worden ist. Der Datensatz enthält Messungen von Isotopenverhältnissen von Proben, die in archäologischen Fundstellen in den zentraleuropäischen Alpen gefunden wurden. Die präsentierten Datenanalyse-Methoden werden verwendet um diese Daten zu analysieren und relevante Forschungsfragen zu klären. In einer ersten Anwendung werden die Attribute der Messungen analysiert um ihre relative Wichtigkeit und ihre Fähigkeit zu bewerten, die räumliche Herkunft der Proben vorherzusagen. Eine weitere vorgestellte Anwendung ist die Wiederherstellung von möglichen Migrationsrouten zwischen den untersuchten Fundstellen. Danach werden räumliche Modelle der Daten unter Verwendung der vorgestellten Methoden erstellt. Univariate Outlier werden bestimmt und ihre möglich Herkunft basierend auf der erstellten Karte wird bestimmt. Die vorhergesagte Herkunft wird mit der tatsächlichen Fundstelle verglichen. Zuletzt werden Karten der Isotopenverteilung der untersuchten Region vorgestellt. Die beschriebenen Methoden und vorgestellten Analysen zeigen, dass Fachwissen verwendet werden kann um Constraints zu formulieren, die den Datenanalyseprozess unterstützen, um gültige Modelle aus relativ kleinen Datensätzen zu erstellen und Fachwissenschaftler bei ihren Analysen zu unterstützen...|$|E

For instance, a client-server application can defer inessential work and <b>otherwise</b> <b>reduce</b> communication when {{the quality of}} connection to the server is poor. This paper describes an approach to application adaptation which differs from the usual mode-based technique. It also discusses two implementations of modeless adaptation: ATP, a library for bandwidth-aware communication, and MFS, a cache manager for a distributed file system. ...|$|R
40|$|In theory, new mineral wealth {{should offer}} governments {{a chance to}} boost {{economic}} growth and reduce inequality. 1 In practice, it often leads to a type of inequality trap: mineral production produces heightened inequalities, which lead to violent confl ict; violent confl ict tends to scare off investment outside the minerals sector, which might have <b>otherwise</b> <b>reduced</b> inequali-ties. As a result, countries become lodged in an inequality trap, unable to diversify the economy in ways that could reduce inequalities and lower th...|$|R
50|$|The simple, rounded fins {{are small}} with the {{exception}} of the broad, fan-like pectorals, which actually extend ventrally. The first of the two dorsal fins is spinous, with 4-8 spines; in some species, this fin is completely overgrown with skin and therefore not visible. While the lateral line in lumpsuckers is <b>otherwise</b> <b>reduced</b> or absent, it is well developed in the head; some species even have tubular, whisker-like external projections of the opercular canal, which is a part of the cranial lateral line system.|$|R
5000|$|A. harrisii {{has a high}} body {{temperature}} of 97-107 degrees Fahrenheit (36.7 - 41.6 °C) [...] In order to protect itself from {{the heat of the}} Sonoran Desert, A. harrisii carries their tails over their bodies in order to provide shade. A. harrisii also participates in a heat reduction method where individuals move into shaded positions and lie spread eagled against the ground. This is referred to as [...] "heat dumping". They are active during the day, and do not sweat but <b>otherwise</b> <b>reduce</b> temperature by salivating.|$|R
