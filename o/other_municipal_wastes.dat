30|$|The {{spatial and}} {{seasonal}} variations in metal concentrations in water, sediment and Lemna minor were found {{due to the}} regular inputs of contaminants from natural and anthropogenic activities around the lake. Although all sampling sites showed the presence of all heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Cd and Pb), the concentration of metals at sites S 1, S 3 and S 4 was higher than at site S 5. The trend followed was site S 4 (near SKIMS institute) highly polluted followed by site S 1 (near agricultural fields), site S 3 (near plantation) and lowest at site S 5 (lake centre), which {{could be attributed to}} enhanced anthropogenic activities at the sites recording the highest concentrations. Metal concentration at most of the sites followed the order as Lemna minor >sediments>water. The water quality of Anchar lake has deteriorated considerably due to illegal encroachment {{along the banks of the}} lake, dumping of the sewage and <b>other</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>wastes</b> from different parts of the Srinagar city into the lake. Direct discharge of the human wastes from the nearby settlements into the lake has further aggravated the nature and extent of the pollution. Human encroachments and siltation combined with the other anthropogenic activities reduced the open water quantity within the lake. The elevated levels of heavy metals at different locations of the lake are of utmost concern due to their environmental threats as this lake is the harbour of many water birds, fish and grasses. Therefore, a strategy to control both the point and non-point sources of pollution around the lake should be developed for better protection of the lake.|$|E
40|$|Industrial and {{commercial}} enterprises, administration facilities and service companies generate waste that is jointly disposed with household refuse. This waste from {{all kinds of}} work places is similar to household refuse. It is collected both together with, as well as separately from household refuse. Usually a difference is made between industrial, commercial and institutional (IC and I) waste, collected with household refuse, and IC and I waste, similar to household refuse, but collected separately. Until now there were only incomplete data about quantity and composition, above all because available statistics did not include all work places in a district or because waste quantities were not recorded separately from <b>other</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>wastes.</b> Aim of the nation-wide industrial, commercial and institutional waste study (Bundesweite Gewerbeabfalluntersuchung- BWGU) was to determine quantity, composition and statistical characteristics of both kinds of IC and I waste. In 15 German districts (all belonging to the 'former' Federal Republic of Germany, meaning prior to German reunification in 1989) IC and I waste was inspected or sorted and compared, according to trade sector and size (number of employees) of the work places. The study was rounded off by a thorough questionnaire of the work places analysed and by an evaluation of the 1987 national work place census. The resulting statistical characteristics describe the waste quantity, the waste composition and the densities of the waste fractions, according to trade sector clusters (formed by cluster analysis {{on the basis of a}} three-digit trade key). With these values waste calculations for the whole of (former) Germany were carried out. (orig.)

The principle is that costs paid for the removal and <b>other</b> disposal of <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> are supposed to be equivalent to a number of inhabitants living in a town.

Bioethanol, {{which is the}} major alternative fuel for spark ignition engines, is the most widely known and produced bioalcohol. Bioalcohols can be produced {{from a wide range}} of biomass, including crops, lignocellulosic crops or residues, and food waste. The first generation bioalcohols are produced from crops, which sometime creates food versus fuel debate and other issues. The second generation bioalcohols are produced from lignocellulosic biomass, such as forestry or agricultural residues. While the first generation bioalcohols is successful in technology development, the cost and efficiency of the second generation bioalcohols still needs to be optimized to overcome the high recalcitrance to enzymatic hydrolysis.

40|$|This report {{continues}} {{and further}} advances the work {{conducted by the}} JRC {{in the field of}} sustainable management of food waste, which resulted in the publication of the 2015 report “Improving Sustainability and Circularity of European Food Waste Management with a Life Cycle Approach”. It focuses on the broad European waste management context and, in particular, provides insight and analysis on the sustainability of food waste prevention strategies. Among <b>other</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> streams, food waste gained prominence in the political debate in light of the recent Circular Economy (CE) package. In fact, the CE Action Plan included food waste within the so-called “priority areas”, i. e. areas that should be carefully considered to strengthen the circularity of the European economy. Against this background, this report analyses and evaluates the efficacy of some selected strategies for food waste prevention implemented at Member States’ and regional levels. A streamlined ‘stakeholder analysis’ is also developed in order to identify the most relevant stakeholders along the food supply chain and analyse their influence/relation with the mechanisms that lead to food wastage. Moreover, the report presents a novel and straightforward life cycle based methodology that helps identifying sustainable targets for food waste prevention in different contexts. The analysis of food waste prevention strategies being implemented by Member States and presented in this report seems to indicate that reducing food waste generation is a very complex to achieve in practice. The key reasons for this are the complexity of the food supply chain and the fact that a variety of integrated and well-coordinated measures that involve all stakeholders along the food supply chain need to be adopted to effectively tackle the problem. Moreover, sometimes the lack of reliable and coherent data is posing a threat to the successful identification of the most appropriate measures. It is also noted that food waste prevention measures are often set without considering how their implementation will influence the sustainability performance of food waste management. On the other hand, this report stresses that the definition of food waste prevention targets should follow the definition of the desired improvement of the overall sustainability performance. Towards this goal, the methodology presented in this report tries to identify environmentally sustainable targets for food waste prevention that allows achieving a given reduction of the environmental impacts along the food supply chain.

A first-step, simplified waterbalance assuming steady state conditions (with errorɛ = I + P − Q − ETc) showed that inputs were much lower than outputs in all years (average ɛ = − 577 mm yr− 1 or − 33 % closingerror). A second-step, improved waterbalance with the inclusion of <b>other</b> inputs (<b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> waters, canal releases and lateral surface runoff) and the estimation of crop's actual evapotranspiration (ETa) through a daily soil waterbalance reduced the average closingerror to − 13 %. Since errors were always higher during the irrigated periods, when canals are full of water, a third-step, final waterbalance considered canal seepage (CS) as an additional input. The change in water storage in the system (ΔW) was also included in this step. CS and ΔW were estimated through a monthly soil–aquifer waterbalance, showing that CS was a significant component in VID. With the inclusion of CS and ΔW in the waterbalance equation, the 1998 – 2008 annual closingerrors were within ± 10 % of total water outputs.
