40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} two large-scale natural field experiments that tested {{the effect of}} social norm messages on tax compliance. Using administrative data from more than 200, 000 individuals in the United Kingdom, we show that including social norm messages in standard reminder letters increases payment rates for <b>overdue</b> <b>tax.</b> This result offers a rare example of social norm messages affecting tax compliance behavior in a real world setting. We find no evidence that loss framing {{is more effective than}} gain framing. Descriptive norms appear to be more effective than injunctive norms.

40|$|The ‘standard’ Allingham-Sandmo-Yitzhaki (ASY) {{model of}} tax evasion predicts effects on {{compliance}} which {{depend on the}} perceived probability of detection, tax rate and penalty for evasion. Compliance effects of detection probabilities and tax rates have been extensively tested empirically, but penalty effects are rarely tested explicitly. This paper examines the effects of late payment penalties on tax compliance based on an experiment involving New Zealand goods and service tax (GST) ‘late payers’. Firstly, based on an ASY-type model of tax late payments in which the probability of enforcement, rather than detection, is central, we develop a number of testable hypotheses. Secondly, based on a field experiment involving a specific compliance intervention, we examine how taxpayers respond when given different penalty information. The experiment also allows us to consider differences between taxpayers’ stated intentions to comply and subsequently observed compliance. Results suggest that differences in penalty information given to taxpayers and reductions in penalty rates both affect taxpayers stated intentions to comply (pay <b>overdue</b> <b>tax</b> and penalties) as predicted. However, subsequently observed responses generally appear unresponsive to penalties. Nevertheless, various individual taxpayer characteristics are identifiable that affect both compliance intentions and actual behaviour...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how {{the design of}} messages affects {{the extent to which}} individuals comply with requests or requirements from public actors. More specifically, it presents results from seven field experiments on changing messages sent to the public and professionals as part of routine public sector activities: issuing requests for <b>overdue</b> <b>tax</b> payments, sending reminders for upcoming hospital appointments, and providing antibiotic prescribing feedback to general practitioners. These are all cases where non-compliance can create harm or inconvenience to others. The trial messages are constructed to test the two main approaches to increasing compliance: one, ‘deterrence’, sees individuals as utility maximizers who are concerned solely with advancing their private interests, and who respond only to the threat of sanctions; the other, ‘non-deterrence’, claims that compliance is influenced by factors such as social norms, perceptions of fairness, ethical concerns, and the provision of public goods. I attempt to increase the impact of both approaches by applying concepts from behavioural science, such as framing effects and the omission bias. The results indicate that deterrence-based messages consistently increase tax compliance, sometimes to a substantial extent. Non-deterrence messages also can increase compliance with both healthcare and taxation policies, although the effects are sometimes small. The largest effect sizes for non-deterrence approaches came from social norm messages. Non-deterrence approaches may be more effective for populations who had previously been compliant. Importantly, I provide evidence that both deterrence and non-deterrence messages can be enhanced through the application of concepts from behavioural science. These trials strengthen the limited evidence base on the real-world effects of messages intended to increase policy compliance. They demonstrate that compliance may depend on specific choices about how messages are constructed and delivered. In the process, they show how behavioural science offers a useful framework for governments making these important choices. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Payment of tax by a tax payer is {{more complex}} that one might expect. To assume that payment of the tax results from a proper {{construction}} o f {{the idea of a}} tax obligation would be an undue simplification. A reasonable tax payer who needs to assume a certain conduct must take into account the existence o f legal regulations that will force him to fulfil his tax obligation. Those legal solutions, {{due to the nature of}} tax obligations, have a feature o f a sanction, since it is possible to effect the tax due before it falls due and before a decision imposing it has been issued, (article 33 o f the tax law.). Tax not paid on time becomes <b>overdue</b> <b>tax</b> (art. 51) which means that penalty interest may be calculated as provided for in the rates arising from art. 56. Having regard to the entire binding legislation, the tax payer makes a conscientious decision. It is a choice of a particular behaviour, which at the same time governs that behaviour. In other words, a tax payer makes a decision on the basis o f the causal links (understood properly or wrongly) between a certain behaviour and its legal consequences. Although the contents of art. 59 § 1 p. 1 is properly formulated from the linguistic and logical point o f view, the issue of a tax obligation becoming extinct upon its payment must be seen in a wider context. And so, the expiry o f tax obligations in the form provided for in art. 59 § 1 p. l o. p., cannot be treated separately, but the causal relationship, together with those provisions of the tax law which, taking the contents of art. 59 § 1 p. 1 as a starting point, constitute a solution which is defined as a tax institution. Therefore, the principle o f clara non sunt interpretanda may not be a premise for believing that construction and performance o f the process of interpretation is unnecessary since it does not suffice to understand the fragment o f the legal text referred to in art. 59 § 1 p. l, but it must be understood in conjunction with art. 70 § 1. Payment of a tax obligation may be an effective form o f releasing oneself from a tax obligation. It leads to the extinction of the tax obligation. In such a case, a tax obligation cannot become extinct for the second time on grounds o f having become a time-barred claim. However, a direct copy of the content of the norm contained in art. 59 § 1 p. 1 and in art. 70 § 1 of tax law does not offer an unambiguous answer when such solutions are being analysed, and in particular, when relationships between the norms within the tax law are taken into consideration. In fact, in some specific cases it is justified to construe the text of art. 59 § 1 p. l differently. The payment of a tax must be in respect of,,a concrete amount of a tax obligation resulting from a final tax decision”. And so, the payment provided for in art. 59 § 1 p. 1 of tax law is a payment of the tax due. It will become extinct on the premise of its effective assessment. While tax extinction applies only to properly assessed tax amount, the tax obligation will not become extinct merely because it has not been assessed. Consequently, payment of tax following a tax decision that has not been final and that has been appealed against by the tax payer does not render the tax obligation extinct...|$|E

Lord Mengchang was not completely happy, but allowed the matter to drop. A few years later, when Lord Mengchang was forced to flee from the Qi, these people of Xue welcomed him with flowers and food. He was so touched that he turned to Feng Xuan and thanked him for “buying” him benevolence and righteousness. Feng replied he was just doing his job, and while having rényì on one's side is good, it was not enough.|$|R

50|$|Usually {{a lender}} obtains a {{security}} interest from a borrower who mortgages or pledges an asset {{like a house}} to secure the loan.

Therefore, through the process of foreclosure, the lender seeks to foreclose (in plain English, immediately terminate) the equitable right of redemption and take both legal and equitable title to the property in fee simple.
