50|$|A {{number of}} {{surgical}} techniques {{may be used}} if conservative management and simple procedures fail. All surgical treatments are associated {{with some degree of}} complications including bleeding, infection, anal strictures and urinary retention, due to the close proximity of the rectum to the nerves that supply the bladder. Also, a small risk <b>of</b> fecal incontinence <b>occurs,</b> particularly <b>of</b> <b>liquid,</b> with rates reported between 0% and 28%. Mucosal ectropion is another condition which may occur after hemorrhoidectomy (often together with anal stenosis). This is where the anal mucosa becomes everted from the anus, similar to a very mild form of rectal prolapse.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{previous}} work carried on pool {{boiling heat transfer}} during heating <b>of</b> various <b>liquids</b> and commodities categorized as refrigerants and dielectric fluids, pure liquids, nanofluids, hydrocarbons and additive mixtures, as well as natural and synthetic colloidal solutions. Nucleate pool boiling is an efficient and effective method of boiling because high heat fluxes are possible with moderate temperature differences. It {{is characterized by the}} growth of bubbles on a heated surface. It <b>occurs</b> during boiling <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> for excess temperature ranging from 5 to 30 Â°C in various processes related to high vaporization <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> for specific purposes like sugarcane juice heating for jaggery making, milk heating for khoa making, steam generation, cooling of electronic equipments, refrigeration and etcetera. In this review paper, pool boiling method during heating <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> for specific purpose is depicted. It is inferred that enhancement in pool boiling heat transfer is a challenging and complex task. Also, recent research and use of various correlations for natural convection pool boiling is reviewed...|$|R
50|$|Column {{separation}} {{is a phenomenon}} that can occur during a water-hammer event. If the pressure in a pipeline drops below the vapor pressure <b>of</b> the <b>liquid,</b> cavitation will <b>occur</b> (some <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> vaporizes, forming a bubble in the pipeline, keeping the pressure close to the vapor pressure). This {{is most likely to}} occur at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope). When subcooled liquid flows into the space previously occupied by vapor the area of contact between the vapor and the liquid increases. This causes the vapor to condense into the liquid reducing the pressure in the vapor space. The liquid {{on either side of the}} vapor space is then accelerated into this space by the pressure difference. The collision of the two columns <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> (or <b>of</b> one <b>liquid</b> column if at a closed end) causes a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure. This pressure rise can damage hydraulic machinery, individual pipes and supporting structures. Many repetitions of cavity formation and collapse may occur in a single water-hammer event.|$|R
40|$|Vortexing <b>occurs</b> during {{draining}} <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> from tanks. We {{studied the}} critical height <b>of</b> a <b>liquid</b> being drained from tank, that is, the liquid height {{at the moment}} when the air-core vortex reaches to the drain port. We firstly performed some experiments for determining the critical height, and then based upon the information obtained from the experiments; a simple analytical expression was derived to predict the critical height. The experimental results show that the vortex suppressor, which is suggested in the present paper, could effectively reduce the strength of vortex and consequently reduce the critical height. The results also show that the new analytical expression can predict the critical height with less than 20 % error when vortex suppressor is used. To the best of our knowledge, draining from tanks with bell-mouth drain ports has not been paid attention to by other authors...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the project at large was to experiment with new methods for bioremediation of carbon tetrachloride plumes in the soils at the Hanford Site in Richland, WA. Traditionally, biostimulation <b>occurs</b> via pumping <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> nutrient solution into the vadose zone, however an alternate methodology utilizes the introduction of gaseous nutrients, specifically nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon sources. The movement <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> through the vadose zone tends to disperse contaminant plumes, and/or cause biofouling (excessive microbial growth) {{in the vicinity of}} injection wells. Alternatively, gas-phase nutrient introduction yields greater dispersion of molecules and little to no displacement of target plumes. Once vapor-phase molecules solubilize into soil water, they become bioavailable and should thus encourage colonization and degradation. The feasibility of this method of nutrient delivery was studied in an experimental laboratory system, the goal of which was to observe, in situ, microbial colonization in response to gaseous nutrient injection. It was hoped that these observations would aid in predictive modeling of microbial behavior in field scale bioremediation...|$|R
5|$|Promethium is {{the only}} {{lanthanide}} and {{one of only two}} elements among the first 83 that has no stable (or even long-lived) isotopes. This is a result <b>of</b> a rarely <b>occurring</b> effect <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> drop model and stabilities of neighbor element isotopes; it is also the least stable element of the first 84. The primary decay products are neodymium and samarium isotopes (promethium-146 decays to both, the lighter isotopes generally to neodymium via positron decay and electron capture, and the heavier isotopes to samarium via beta decay). Promethium nuclear isomers may decay to other promethium isotopes and one isotope (145Pm) has a very rare alpha decay mode to stable praseodymium-141.|$|R
2500|$|The {{mouthparts}} of {{bees are}} of a chewing and lapping-sucking type. Lapping is a mode of feeding in which liquid or semiliquid food adhering to a protrusible organ, or [...] "tongue", is transferred from substrate to mouth. In the honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Apis mellifera), the elongated and fused labial glossae form a hairy tongue, which is surrounded by the maxillary galeae and the labial palps to form a tubular proboscis containing a food canal. In feeding, the tongue is dipped into the nectar or honey, which adheres to the hairs, and then is retracted so the adhering liquid is carried into {{the space between the}} galeae and labial palps. This back-and-forth glossal movement <b>occurs</b> repeatedly. Movement <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> to the mouth apparently results from the action of the cibarial pump, facilitated by each retraction of the tongue pushing liquid up the food canal.|$|R
40|$|Rapid and {{sensitive}} detection {{of chemical and}} biological warfare agents, including nerve gases, is of great interest especially after the tragic events of September 11, 2001. All nerve agents belong chemically to the organophosphorus compound group, which {{is among the most}} toxic of known substances. 1 The nerve agent, either as a gas, as an aerosol, or as a liquid, enters the body through inhalation or through the skin. Poisoning may also <b>occur</b> through consumption <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> or foods contaminated with nerve agents. If a person is exposed to a high concentration of nerve agent, for example, 200 mg sarin/m 3, death may occur within a couple of minutes when the agent is absorbed through the respiratory system.

40|$|The glass {{transition}} GT is usually {{thought of as}} a structural arrest that occurs during the cooling <b>of</b> a <b>liquid,</b> or sometimes a plastic crystal, trapping a metastable state of the system before it can recrystallize to stabler forms 1. This phenomenon <b>occurs</b> in <b>liquids</b> <b>of</b> all classes, most recently in bulk metallic glassformers 2. Much theoretical interest has been generated by the dynamical heterogeneity observed in cooling <b>of</b> fragile <b>liquids</b> 3, 4, and many have suggested that the slow-down is caused by a related increasing correlation length 5 - 9. Here we report both kinetics and thermodynamics of arrest in a system that disorders while in its ground state, exhibits a large !Cp on arrest (!Cp = Cp,mobile - Cp,arrested), yet clearly is characterized by a correlation length that is decreasing as GT is approached from above. We show that GT kinetics in our system, the disordering superlattice Fe 50 Co 50, satisfy the kinetic criterion for ideally 'strong' glassformers 10, and since !Cp behavior through Tg also correlates 10, we propose that very strong liquidsand very fragile liquids exist on opposite flanks of an order-disorder transition - one that is already known for model systems...|$|R

Two cases are used: A numerical analysis on the capillary instabilities and breakup processes <b>of</b> a cylindrical <b>liquid</b> column and a moving liquid sheet in a moving gaseous medium to analyze the dynamics and breakup <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> sheet. The problem, composed of the Navier-Stokes systems associated with surface tension forces, is solved by the Volume of Fluid (VOF) technique with a Continuum Surface Force (CSF) to artificially smooth the discontinuity present at the interface. The results show that before disintegration <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> the capillary waves become unstable {{and the source of}} making the wave unstable is inherently developed by the system. The investigation <b>of</b> moving <b>liquid</b> sheet showed that the two modes <b>of</b> forces for <b>liquid</b> stretching exists: shear force causing the stretching <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> by shear velocity and drag force causing the stretching <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> by gas velocity ahead of the tip <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> sheets.
