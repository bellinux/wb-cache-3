5000|$|Moral {{legitimacy}} {{is dependent}} upon whether the actions of an organization or institution are judged to be moral. In other words, if the constituency believe the organization is breaking {{the rules of the}} political or economic system for immoral reasons, then this can threaten moral legitimacy. Suchman breaks moral legitimacy down into four sub-sections: consequential legitimacy, procedural legitimacy, structural legitimacy, and personal legitimacy. Consequential legitimacy relates to what an <b>organization</b> <b>has</b> <b>accomplished</b> based on criteria that is specific to that organization. Procedural legitimacy can be obtained by an organization by adhering to socially formalized and accepted procedures (e.g. regulatory oversight). [...] In the case of structural legitimacy, people view an organization as legitimate because its structural characteristics allow it to do specific kinds of work. [...] Suchman refers to this organization as being the [...] "right organization for the job."

40|$|The author uses a {{framework}} developed by J. Victor Baldridge (Power and Conflict in the University, John Wiley, New York, 1971) {{to present a}} case study of equal opportunity programs in the United States Navy. The study is presented {{in the context of a}} complex systems change effort. ^ For organizations attempting to create a healthy EO climate the author suggests that the most important part of any strategy for long term effect is to identify the primary means of power and control in the organization and to address EO through that channel, secondly she suggests that EO is a political phenomenon and must take into account the political dynamics of the organization. In addition she recommends attention to the following; organization culture and environment; systems perspective; on going assessment and strategic planning; long term planning; historical patterns of change in the organization; the need for strong leadership; and defining EO to include selection and inclusion assimilation and integration into the mainstream of the organization. Finally she concludes that an <b>organization</b> <b>has</b> <b>accomplished</b> an EO climate when it has spanned the 2 ̆ 2 program 2 ̆ 2 stage and EO efforts are replaced by efforts of good management. ...|$|R
40|$|The year of IEA’s 45 th anniversary {{seems an}} {{appropriate}} {{time to reflect on}} what IEA, as an <b>organization,</b> <b>has</b> <b>accomplished.</b> Such reflection also seems appropriate at IEA’s first research conference, which has as its focus the secondary analysis of data generated by the IEA studies. My brief, when I was asked to give this keynote address, was to reflect on the impact of the research that has been conducted under the auspices of IEA on education (broadly considered) since its foundation. The question of impact raises, of course, the issue of how one might judge impact, and what evidence can be used and is available to judge it. In effect, the question that needs to be answered is how effective has IEA been as an organization? As a research organization focused on education it is reasonable to expect that the work of IEA should contribute to our understanding of teaching and learning, to the educational policy debate within countries and internationally, and, ideally, to research practice itself. In this address, I therefore would like to consider these impact-related questions by taking into account some of the broader historical changes and other imperatives that have occurred over the last 45 years, and the influence that these have had on the work of the IEA...|$|R
40|$|Banking reform since China's {{accession}} to the World Trade <b>Organization</b> (WTO) <b>has</b> <b>accomplished</b> unprecedented positive results, but its long-term success rests {{on whether the}} state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) can continue to improve their asset quality and corporate governance. To reach this end, the central government has to further diminish its influence on the operation of SOCBs and allow the state banks to be governed by market discipline. Current reforms may not be full-fledged enough to sustain China's future economic development, reflected by the noticeable capital constraints facing small and medium-size private enterprises, particularly those in rural areas. The commercialization of specialized banks (SBs) in 1994, which paved the way to China's WTO accession, will be briefly examined along with {{an evaluation of the}} effectiveness of China's post-WTO banking reforms, concluding with a description of the challenges facing China's banking sector. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of properly securing an organization’s information and computing resources has become paramount in modern business. Since {{the advent of}} the Internet, securing this organizational information has become increasingly difficult. Organizations deploy many security mechanisms in the protection of their data, intrusion detection systems in particular have an increasingly valuable role to play, and as networks grow, administrators need better ways to monitor their systems. Currently, many intrusion detection systems lack the means to accurately monitor and report on wireless segments within the corporate network. This dissertation proposes an extension to the NeGPAIM model, known as NeGPAIM-W, which allows for the accurate detection of attacks originating on wireless network segments. The NeGPAIM-W model is able to detect both wired and wireless based attacks, and with the extensions to the original model mentioned previously, also provide for correlation of intrusion attacks sourced on both wired and wireless network segments. This provides for a holistic detection strategy for an <b>organization.</b> This <b>has</b> been <b>accomplished</b> with the use of Fuzzy logic and neural networks utilized in the detection of attacks. The model works on the assumption that each user has, and leaves, a unique footprint on a computer system. Thus, all intrusive behaviour on the system and networks which support it, {{can be traced back to}} the user account which was used to perform the intrusive behavior...|$|R
