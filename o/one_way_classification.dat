40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{problem of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether graduate students in education (the experimentals) participating in a counseling practicum would demonstrate a change in self-actualization which would be significantly different when compared with other graduate students in education (the comparisons) who were not participating in the above program. The investigation was designed to test the following null hypotheses: 1. There will be no significant differences in mean post-test scores between the experimental group and the comparison group as measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory. 2. There will be no significant differences in mean growth toward self-actualization between the experimental group and the comparison group as measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory. 3. There will be no significant differences in mean growth toward self-actualization in the experimental group as measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory. 4. There will be no significant differences in mean growth toward self-actualization in the comparison group as measured by the Personal Orientation Inventory. The sample consisted of 44 graduate education candidates enrolled in graduate education courses at Oregon State University, during the fall term of the 1972 school year. The experimental group (Group I) was comprised of 21 graduate students enrolled in the counseling practicum. The course provided supervised experience which included the following: working with a variety of counselees; weekly critique sessions for the purpose of evaluating video tapes of the counseling sessions; participation in weekly interpersonal-relations groups and weekly counseling by a doctoral candidate. The comparison group (Group II) was comprised of graduate students who had not taken the practicum and were in Research Procedures, a required course for all graduate students in education. The Personal Orientation Inventory was the instrument utilized for the measurement of growth toward self-actualization. The instrument was administered, under pre and post-test conditions, to both groups during the fall quarter. The I (Inner-directed) scale of the Personal Orientation Inventory was utilized as the measure of self-actualization for the testing of the statistical hypotheses. Hypothesis I was tested by an analysis of covariance in a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> design with pre-test mean scores, age, sex and, sex and age serving as covariates. Hypothesis II was also tested by an analysis of covariance in a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> design on pre-test and post-test mean scores with sample, age, sex, and sex and age serving as covariates. An analysis of variance in a two way classification design was used in analyzing hypotheses III and IV. The. 05 level of significance was selected as the acceptable level of statistical significance. The results of analysis did yield a significant difference at the. 05 level for hypotheses I and II in favor of the experimental group (Group I), those participating in the counselor practicum. In other words, the experimental group was shown to be significantly more selfactualized on the pre-test and post-test mean scores and also showed a more significant mean growth toward self-actualization than the comparison group (Group II). The results of analysis did not yield a significant difference at the. 05 level for hypotheses II/and IV. This is to say that there was no significant difference in mean growth toward selfactualization between pre-test and post-test mean scores of the sample and the comparison group (Group II). The comparison group showed nonsignificant negative mean growth toward self-actualization. In essence, the results of this investigation support the discriminatory power of the Personal Orientation Inventory and the position that a counseling practicum does have a significant impact on the personal development of participants...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Bayes rule is {{the optimal}} {{classification}} rule if the underlying {{distribution of the}} data is known. In practice {{we do not know}} the underlying distribution, and need to “learn ” classification rules from the data. <b>One</b> <b>way</b> to derive <b>classification</b> rules in practice is to implement the Bayes rule approximately by estimating an appropriate classification function. Traditional statistical methods use estimated log odds ratio as the classification function. Support vector machines (SVMs) are one type of large margin classifier, and the relationship between SVMs and the Bayes rule was not clear. In this paper, it is shown that the asymptotic target of SVMs are some interesting classification functions that are directly related to the Bayes rule. The rate of convergence of the solutions of SVMs to their corresponding target functions is explicitly established in the case of SVMs with quadratic or higher order loss functions and spline kernels. Simulations are given to illustrate the relation between SVMs and the Bayes rule in other cases. This helps understand the success of SVMs in many classification studies, and makes it easier to compare SVMs and traditional statistical methods...|$|R

The data were statistically analyzed by <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> of completely randomized design (CRD) for body weight gain, feed consumption, feed conversion, protein and energy intake, and efficiency of using protein and energy for body weight gain. The mean different was tested by Duncan’s multiple range of test. The results showed that body weight gain was only significantly different (P≥ 0. 001) at 2 nd and 3 rd week of ages and then it was statistically no difference any more up to 12 weeks old of age. Weekly and cumulative feed consumption and feed conversion showed a highly significant different (P≥ 0. 001). A lower feed consumption and feed conversion were found in a high protein-energy concentration and the higher in a low protein-energy concentration treatment. The best efficiency energy and protein (P≥ 0. 001) was found in the treatment of medium and low protein-energy concentrations and the lowest one in the high protein-energy concentration. The conclusions was that the medium protein-energy concentration ration (protein 18 % and 2690 kcal/kg ME) was the best ration for the first four weeks of age and then the low and the medium could be fed up to 12 weeks of age without different effect on body weight gain. The high protein-energy ration was not recommended, because of using protein and energy for body weight gain had a lower efficiency.

40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to analyze the effect of seaweed Gracilaria edulis in the diets {{on the performance of}} pullet. One hundred and twenty six Lohmann Brown Strain pullets of 14 weeks old were divided into seven seaweed diet treatments. The treatment diets were R 0, R 1, R 2, R 3, R 4, R 5, and R 6 contentaining 0. 00; 2. 50; 5. 00; 7. 50; 10. 00; 12. 50 and 15. 00 of seaweed, there was three replications, six pullets of each. The collected data were feed consumption, weights and ages of sexual maturity, feed conversion ratio, weight of egg and Iodine content in the egg. The collected data were analyzed by analysis of variance of <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification,</b> followed by Duncan’s New Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The results showed that the treatments had not significant differences on feed consumption, body weight at sexual matuarity, feed conversion ratio, but significans (P< 0. 05) on ages at sexual matuarity and egg yolk color (P< 0. 01). Feed consumption were 80. 94 g/chicken/day; 81. 02 g/chicken/day; 80. 95 g/chicken/day; 81. 43 g/chicken/day; 81. 69 g/chicken/day; 82. 25 g/chicken/day and 82. 72 g/chicken/day, body weight at sexual matuarity 1898. 56 g; 1977. 78 g; 1947. 78 g; 1947. 78 g; 1949. 78 g; 1981. 67 g; 1949. 44 g, FCR 5. 78; 5. 35; 5. 45; 5. 08; 5. 57; 5. 86 and 6. 25, egg yolk color 10. 23; 11. 27; 11. 83; 12. 11; 12. 44; 12. 44 and 12. 83 for R 0, R 1, R 2, R 3, R 4, R 5, and R 6 respectively. Egg weights were 51. 25 g; 54. 50 g; 50. 89 g; 51. 66 g; 51. 36 g; 51. 36 g and 50. 83 g, for R 0, R 1, R 2, R 3, R 4, R 5, and R 6 repectively. There had not significant differences on content of egg yolk iodine were 0. 47 ppm; 0. 48 ppm; 0. 50 ppm; 0. 52 ppm; 0. 55 ppm; 0. 56 ppm and 0. 60 ppm. It was concluded that the use of seaweed Gracilaria edulis until 15. 00 % in the diet did not decrease the performance of pullet phase and increased egg yolk color, also did not increase iodine in the yolk.

40|$|Duck farming {{was one of}} the {{alternatives}} {{that can be used to}} support nutritious food in the need of society. Duck tough, flexible, ranncid, fatty, high cholesterol and less preferable for consumers. Garlic leaf had phitochemical that have funtion to reduce fat, cholesterol and can increase protein of duck, so it was approprieted for local male feed duck additives. This research was conducted to determine the effect of garlic leaf (Allium sativum) meal supplementation of against abdominal fat percentage, fat content of meat and meat protein content of local male duck. This research held in a mini farm located at Jatikuwung Village, Gondangrejo, District of Karanganyar. Department of Animal Husbandry, Faculty of Agriculture, Sebelas Maret University. This reseach done during the fourth weeks on Desember 5 th 2009 - January 2 th 2010 with 80 local male ducks the two months old. The experimental design used Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> consists of five treatments, two replication and each replication us four ducks. The data were analyzed with analysis of variance. If there were have significant different, then further tested by Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT). Variables that researched were slaughter weight, abdominal fat percentage, fat content of meat, and protein content of meat. Rations used yellow corn, rice bran, concentrates BR 1 from PT. Japfa Comfeed, top mix and garlic leaf meal (GLM). This research used five treatment, they are P 0 (basal ration without garlic leaf meal), P 1 (basal diet + 2 percent garlic leaf meal), P 2 (basal diet + 4 percent garlic leaf meal), P 3 (basal diet + 6 percent garlic leaf meal) and P 4 (basal ration + 8 percent garlic leaf meal). Ration was given twice in one day and water were given by ad libitum. The results of research showed that an average of five kinds of treatment that is P 0, P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4 respectively to slaughter weight of 1388, 5; 1405, 5; 1420; 1456, 5; 1411 gram, abdominal fat were 1, 37; 0, 99; 0, 85; 0, 66; 0, 78 percent, meat fat content 2, 27; 1, 81; 1, 45; 1, 30; 1, 46 percent and meat protein content 4, 47; 4, 75; 5, 92; 6, 20; 5, 36 percent.

To reduce the cost of feed on the sheep farm need to find of alternative feed. Cassava waste is agricultural waste that still has the contents of protein and carbohydrates and is still limit ed in their use, so it needs to feed processing technology. The purpose of this study to determine the influence of cassava waste steamed and supplementation MHA i n the ration to performance of local male sheep. This research held for 12 weeks starting on 11 th August – 2 nd November 2009 in a mini -farm Department of Animal Hu sbandry, Faculty of Agriculture, Sebelas Maret University located at the Jatikuwung village, Gondangrejo, Karanganyar District. Research materials include 12 male sheeps with an average weight 10, 44 ± 0, 875 kg. Experimental design used was Complete ly Randomized Design (CRD) with <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>classification</b> consists of three treatments and four replications, which each replication using a local male sheep. The feed used was forage, cassava was te and MHA with forage and cassava waste ratio 60 : 40. Treatment will include P 0 (king grass + without cassava waste steamed), P 1 (king grass + cassava waste steamed) and P 2 (king grass + cassava waste steamed +MHA). Observed variables included feed consump tion (DM), protein consumption, average daily gain, feed conve rsion, protein efficiency ration and feed cost per gain. The results showed that the average of three treatments at P 0, P 1 and P 2 for feed consumption (DM) was 1007, 52; 1170, 30; 1144, 90 (g/head/ day). Protein consumption was 144, 57; 167, 93; 158, 91 (g/head/day). Average daily gain was 50, 51; 57, 65 and 54, 59 (g/head/day). Feed conversion was 20, 47; 20, 51 and 21, 18. Protein efficiency ration was 0, 351; 0, 344; 0, 344 while the feed cost per gain was Rp. 15. 303. 29; Rp. 15, 425. 19; Rp. 1 6, 080. 27. Analysis of variance showed significantly different results for feed and protein consumption (P > 0. 05), and no significant different to the efficiency of protein ration and feed conversion, whereas covariance analysis showed no significant different results on the average daily gain (P< 0. 05). Conclusions can be taken in this study was cassava waste steamed and supplementation MHA i n the ration did not increase average daily gain and decrease of feed conversion, but increased feed consumption, protein consumption and demonstrate the efficiency of low-protein rations, as well as providing a feed cost per gain rate economical in steaming treatment without MHA supplementation.
