40|$|AbstractA proper {{understanding}} of spontaneous oxidation and combustion tendency of sulfide ores {{is of great}} importance for the assessment and mitigation of possible spontaneous mine fire in practice. Series of test study for typical sulfide ores under temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) conditions were presented in this conference paper, {{with the aim of}} correlating the spontaneous combustion tendency and the measurements of total oxygen uptake and starting temperature of self-heating. Also relevant nitrogen adsorption properties, including specific surface area and pore- size distributions, for the same set of sulfide <b>ore</b> <b>samples</b> were determined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the Barret-Joyner-Hallender (BJH) method, respectively. The test results demonstrate that for the sulfide <b>ore</b> <b>samples</b> collected from a spontaneously combusting mine, The total consumptions of oxygen during TPO test were relatively larger in comparison with those sample from a mine without spontaneous fire record in history. Also it is shown that the microstructural surface features of the <b>ore</b> <b>samples</b> may {{have an effect on the}} oxygen consumption response during TPO test...|$|R

50|$|In mineral exploration, salting is {{the process}} of adding gold or silver to an <b>ore</b> <b>sample</b> to change the value of the ore with intent to deceive {{potential}} buyers of the mine. In the US state of Arizona it is a class 6 felony.

40|$|Abstract Niobium {{metallurgical}} recovery measures {{how much}} of the metal content in the ore is separated in the concentrate after the mineral processing stages. This information can be obtained through laboratory tests with <b>ore</b> <b>samples</b> obtained during drilling. Thereunto, representative <b>ore</b> <b>samples</b> are subjected to tests mimicking the ore concentration processing flow, but these experiments are time consuming and costly. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop a more efficient way to obtain the metallurgical recovery information from <b>ore</b> <b>samples.</b> Based on the development of chemometrical studies, the chemical components currently analyzed in the ore with correlation to the metallurgical recovery were identified. These correlated variables were used to build a nonlinear multivariate regression model to explain the response variable, i. e. metallurgical recovery. The Principal Component Analysis was used in this work to define which chemical variables contribute most to explain the metallurgical recovery phenomenon. The Second order regression equation (Response Surface) was the most suitable methodology to explain the metallurgical niobium recovery and was created by the interaction of the five most important chemical variables. After the exclusion of outliers, the linear regression coefficient between the metallurgical recovery calculated and the metallurgical recovery analyzed was 82. 59 %. The use of the second order regression equation contributes to reduce the amount of experimental analysis to assess the geometallurgical niobium ore response, promoting the reduction of costs for metallurgical characterization of the <b>ore</b> <b>samples.</b> The methodology proposed proved to be efficient, maintaining an adequate precision in the forecasted response...|$|R

50|$|Although {{native copper}} was the {{dominant}} ore mineral, chalcocite (copper sulfide) was sometimes present, and, {{especially in the}} Mohawk mine, copper arsenide minerals such as mohawkite and domeykite. Gangue minerals included calcite, quartz, epidote, chlorite, and various zeolites. A number of copper mines also contained a notable amount of silver, both in native form and naturally alloyed with the copper. Halfbreed is the term for an <b>ore</b> <b>sample</b> that contains the pure copper and pure silver in the same piece of rock; it is only found in the native copper deposits of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.|$|E
50|$|Fusion: {{the process}} {{requires}} a self-generating reducing atmosphere, {{and so the}} crushed <b>ore</b> <b>sample</b> is mixed with fluxes and a carbon source (e.g. coal dust, ground charcoal, flour, etc.) mixed with powdered lead oxide (litharge) in a refractory crucible. In general, multiple crucibles will be placed inside an electric furnace fitted with silicon carbide heating elements, and heated to between 1000-1200 °C. The temperature required, {{and the type of}} flux used, are dependent on the composition of the rock in which the precious metals are concentrated, and in many laboratories an empirical approach based on long experience is used.|$|E
40|$|A local geochemical {{soil survey}} {{was carried out}} for the {{exploration}} of uranium deposits {{in the area of}} north – east Vogelkop Irian Jaya, Indonesia. The study explores the use of trace elements associations as an indicator for the possible presence of uranium deposits. This selective association of trace elements is useful since radon, helium or any other gaseous daughter product of uranium can not be used, as there are no known uranium deposits in the area. Hence no local <b>ore</b> <b>samples</b> are available to establish the inter-elemental association as a guide. To establish the trace elements association in ores, known uranium deposits from {{different parts of the world}} are investigated. Fifteen <b>ore</b> <b>samples</b> are analyzed by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) for their total metal content. The comparative study of elemental association, established for these 15 <b>ore</b> <b>samples</b> with the elemental association shown by the soil is non-representative of the ore types that could be expected in such a geological environment. This study does not indicate the accurrence of local ore, however the geological set up in the area provides the environments in which granitic uranium deposits can occur...|$|R
