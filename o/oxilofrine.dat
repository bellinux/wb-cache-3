2500|$|Powell {{had tested}} {{positive}} for the drug <b>oxilofrine</b> in 2013 and withdrew from the 2013 World Athletics Championships as a result. Powell and fellow Jamaican Sprinter, Sherone Simpson had taken the supplement Ephiphany D1 as part of their training regimen, not knowing it contained <b>oxilofrine.</b> It was later revealed that Acacia was substituted with <b>oxilofrine,</b> and not revealed by the manufacturer. The duo sued the company that sold the supplement, Dynamic Life Nutrition (DLN), in order to clear their names. [...] Both Powell and Simpson reached an out of court settlement for an undisclosed amount in September 2015. After the settlement, Simpson released a statement stating: [...] "Both Asafa and I are happy {{that we were able to}} settle this out of court." [...] In April 2014, the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission announced that he would be suspended for 18 months over doping charges, expiring in December that year.

40|$|In {{two groups}} of volunteers {{pharmacological}} parameters of the antihypotensive drug midodrine have been investigated. The first group of 12 male healthy volunteers received 2. 5 mg midodrine hydrochloride intravenously, as drinking solution or as tablet according to a randomized cross-over design. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed for midodrine and its main metabolite ST 1059 by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean maximum concentration in plasma for midodrine was 10 ng/ml 20 - 30 min after oral administration, for ST 1059 5 ng/ml after 1 h. Midodrine was eliminated with a terminal half-life of 0. 5 h, ST 1059 with a half-life of 3 hrs. The mean area under the plasma-level vs. time curve (AUC) of ST 1059 after administration of 2. 5 mg midodrine i. v. was 28. 7 ng x h/ml, and similar for the other formulations which {{are considered to be}} bioequivalent. In a second group of 15 volunteers with postural hypotension midodrine (M) as alpha-sympathomimetic drug and <b>oxilofrine</b> (O) as beta-sympathomimetic drug was given i. v. in a randomized double blind study against placebo (P). Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and circulating catecholamines (CA) were determined before and after injections of the drugs as well as before and during 10 min of tilting. Echocardiographic parameters were obtained at rest before and after the administration of the drugs. Blood pressure remained unchanged at rest and during orthostasis after all agents injected. After oral administration of midodrine heart rate was decreased and systolic blood pressure increased significantly and dose-dependently. M lowered circulating noradrenaline.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the therapeutic value of various antihypotensive agents we investigated amezinium (AMZ; CAS 30578 - 37 - 1), dihydroergotamine (DHE; CAS 511 - 12 - 6), midodrine (MDD; CAS 42794 - 76 - 3), and <b>oxilofrine</b> (OXF; CAS 365 - 26 - 4) in volunteers during passive orthostasis in a randomized double-blind study against placebo (PCB). Blood pressure, heart rate, and circulating catecholamines were determined {{before and after}} i. v. injections of the mentioned agents before and during 10 min of passive orthostasis. Echocardiographic and venous plethysmographic data were obtained during resting {{before and after the}} administration of the drugs. Resting heart rate decreased after injection of PCB, AMZ, DHE, and MDD. During tilting no significant changes in heart rate could be observed. Blood pressure remained unchanged at rest and during orthostasis after all agents injected. DHE and MDD lowered circulating noradrenaline. Echocardiographic parameters were changed after administration of AMZ (increase in stroke volume index (SVI) and ejection fraction (EF)), MDD (increase in enddiastolic volume index and SVI), and OXF (increase in SVI, EF, and cardiac index). The venous capacity of the lower left leg was only significantly decreased after injection of DHE, indicating an increased venous tone of the leg veins. The observed changes in sympathetic and cardiovascular parameters are in agreement with their sympathomimetic actions and allow a differential therapeutic classification: DHE and MDD are suitable agents for patients with sympathotonic orthostatic reaction; if asympathotonic orthostatic reaction occurs MDD, AMX and OXF should be recommended to those patients...|$|E
