5|$|After the battle, Richard's corpse {{was taken}} to Leicester and buried without pomp. His {{original}} tomb monument {{is believed to have}} been removed during the English Reformation, and his remains were lost for more than five centuries, believed to have been thrown into the River Soar. In 2012, an archaeological excavation was commissioned by the Richard III Society <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> council car park on the site once occupied by Greyfriars Priory Church. The University of Leicester identified the skeleton found in the excavation as that of Richard III as a result of radiocarbon dating, comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance, and comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of Richard III's eldest sister, Anne of York. Richard's remains were reburied in Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Hall opened {{soon after}} the city's {{founding}} in 1859 and staged many plays for eager settlers. In the 1880s Horace Tabor built Denver's first opera house. After {{the start of the}} 20th century, city leaders embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> beautification program that created many of the city's parks, parkways, museums, and the Municipal Auditorium, which was home to the 1908 Democratic National Convention and is now known as the Ellie Caulkins Opera House. Denver and the metropolitan areas around it continued to support culture. In 1988, voters in the Denver Metropolitan Area approved the Scientific and Cultural Facilities Tax (commonly known as SCFD), a 0.1% (1 cent per $10) sales tax that contributes money to various cultural and scientific facilities and organizations throughout the Metro area. The tax was renewed by voters in 1994 and 2004 and allows the SCFD to operate until 2018.|$|E
5|$|As both Birmingham City and Manchester City were First Division clubs, {{they entered}} the {{competition}} in the third round. Manchester City's cup run started with a home tie against Blackpool. The visitors took the lead after only 10seconds (their fastest goal ever), but midway through the match, fog enveloped Maine Road. The match was abandoned during the second half, immediately after City had scored an equalising goal, and replayed the following Wednesday; City won 2–1. In the fourth round Manchester City faced Southend United at Roots Hall. The Essex club's ground had only opened five months previously, and was suffering from drainage problems. Torrential rainfall meant that in {{the week before the}} match a trench was dug across the pitch, and sand added. Though Southend were a Third Division team, their familiarity with the uneven pitch meant the match was closely contested. Southend pressured the Manchester City goal, requiring Bert Trautmann to make several saves, but Joe Hayes scored the only goal of the game <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>City</b> counter-attack to earn a fifth-round tie against Liverpool.|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} involvement {{of state and}} local governments in the professional sports industry over the last quarter of a century, the debate has arisen over whether the luring of a professional sports franchise or the construction of a stadium for a professional sports franchise provides any type of significant economic stimulus to <b>a</b> <b>city.</b> There are those who have engaged in this debate who believe the potential impact of these events to be significant and positive for <b>a</b> <b>city.</b> There are others who believe the potential impact of these events to be insignificant and/or negative for <b>a</b> <b>city.</b> The goal of this thesis is to add to the debate by presenting an econometric analysis of whether or not introducing a professional sports franchise and/or constructing a stadium for a professional sports franchise has any effect <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>citys</b> employment level. Our research based on taking data {{for each of the four}} major professional sports (Basketball, Baseball, Football, and Hockey) for various cities from 1979 to 1999 provides some very interesting results. The results of our econometric analysis suggest that building a new football stadium in <b>a</b> <b>city</b> or luring <b>a</b> basketball or hockey franchise into <b>a</b> <b>city</b> has <b>a</b> negative impact <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>citys</b> employment growth rate. However, our results also indicate that building a new basketball or hockey arena in <b>a</b> <b>city</b> for <b>a</b> current franchise or attracting a new football franchise to <b>a</b> <b>city</b> has <b>a</b> positive impact <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>citys</b> employment growth rate. Our research concludes that depending on the professional sport and the event involved the impact <b>on</b> employment in <b>a</b> <b>city</b> may be positive, negative, or not significant at all. Results that to a certain degree contradict previous econometric studies on the subject. iii ACKNO [...] ...|$|R

In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map. At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: the île Saint-Louis, the île de la Cité; a third one is the 1827 artificially created île aux Cygnes.|$|E

They decided on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, relatively early <b>on,</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> that Cubby Broccoli had visited on holiday, and a team was sent to that city in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the Carnival festival, which featured in the film.|$|E

King was arrested during this campaign, which concluded with a United States District Court ruling in Browder v. Gayle that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{tests the}} effect of {{financial}} knowledge spillovers on agglomeration in China's financial services industry and examines the external effects on cities' economies. The authors apply hierarchical linear modeling to examine a data set that comprises 276 Chinese cities and draw the following conclusions. Firstly, they find that agglomeration in the financial services industry and the Jacobs spillovers of industry diversification both promote financial knowledge spillovers in terms of industry specialization. Secondly, agglomeration in this studied industry has a significant positive influence <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>city's</b> economic growth, while financial knowledge spillovers have a significant but negative effect <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>city's</b> economic growth. Thirdly, the tendency towards agglomeration in the financial services industry in <b>a</b> few major <b>cities</b> is clear and the clustering significantly influences cities' boundaries. Finally, China's financial services industry is limited by a serious degree of regulation and {{is dominated by the}} main banking institutions...|$|R

Aldermen applauded. Shiller again joined in unanimous support for Daley's 2001, 2002, and 2003 budgets. In the 2001 redistricting of Chicago wards, Daley tried to deprive Shiller of her most committed supporters, but failed when none of the aldermen in adjacent wards wanted to contend with Shiller's supporters. Shiller and Daley, however, reached an understanding: the mayor supported her in the 2003 elections and also pushed forward development of Wilson Yard, a Chicago Transit Authority facility destroyed by fire, into affordable housing and a Target store, using the Wilson Yard Tax Increment Financing District and the $26.5 million it generated. Subsequently, Shiller consistently voted {{in support of the}} mayor's agenda.|$|E

Scully learns that Skinner had been receiving treatment for a sleep disorder, in which he apparently had dreams about being suffocated in bed by an old woman. She fears that Skinner may have unwittingly killed Sayles in his sleep. However, Mulder believes that Skinner may be having visions of a succubus, a female demon, with the mention of similar symptoms of people's bad dreams they've experienced.|$|E

Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry.

As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

The half-segmental arch, blocked by the submerged tower which, in turn, bisects the facade into a near duality, and the violent adjacencies of rectangles, squares, lunettes, and diagonals of contrasting sizes, compose a building seemingly held up by the buildings next door: it is an almost insane short story of a castle <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>city</b> street.|$|E
