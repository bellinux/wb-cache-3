Th e handlers described in questionnaires what emo-tions {{they chose to}} associate with their daily life and therapeutic work. Th ey described their emotional condition before and after therapeutic sessions, giving analogous descriptions for their dogs. Handlers collected saliva samples from themselves and their dogs (6 non-therapeutic con-trol days) during 3 months of therapeutic work) to measure cortisol concentrations using an enzyme-immunoassay. Handlers chose different emotions from the questionnaires for them-selves and their dogs, differing from the cortisol sampling results. Handlers and dogs had increased cortisol concentrations on therapy days compared to control days. Handlers had significantly higher concentrations immediately before therapeutic sessions. In handlers, cortisol concentrations increased steadily with the duration of sessions; in dogs, {{with the number of}} ses-sions per week. Further study of the effects <b>of</b> <b>recreation</b> <b>periods</b> during therapy work days or of more days scheduled without therapy will help clarify what conditions for delivering animal-assisted service best safeguard the welfare of dog and dog handler teams...|$|R

Teoretickými východisky práce jsou koncept volného času, ROH a odborových rekreací, a to včetně všech jejich typů (výběrové domácí a zahraniční rekreace, závodní rekreace, pionýrské tábory ROH). Práce získává své poznatky jednak z archivních pramenů a rozhovorů s pamětníky, jednak na základě studia sekundární literatury. Práce popisuje odlišnosti mezi jednotlivými typy rekreací a představuje jejich proměny v čase. Zároveň celou problematiku odborových rekreací vztahuje ke konceptu volného času, jakožto předpokladu pro vznik odborových rekreací. Detailně se také věnuje roli ROH v samotném organizování rekreací. Cílem práce je zpracovat základní trendy, směry a změny odborových rekreací a jejich typologii.

40|$|The {{rotating}} workforce scheduling problem, {{which is}} an important factor in improving worker productivity, involves the construction of an efficient sequence <b>of</b> work and <b>recreation</b> <b>periods</b> spanning over a number of weeks. This schedule must satisfy the workforce requirements during the various time periods and conform to all the other conditions imposed on the work/recreation periods and their sequence. We consider the modelling of the rotating workforce scheduling problem as a network flow problem. All the conditions enforced on the problem are incorporated in the network itself, except for the staff-covering constraints which are treated as side constraints. The optimal solution to the problem is a path in the network and is identified using a dual-based approach. The model deals with the three issues <b>of</b> <b>recreation</b> <b>period</b> identification, work/recreation period sequencing and shift scheduling simultaneously, and is designed to handle multiple shifts with time varying demands. A software package which includes the network model along with the solution technique is developed. To illustrate its use, the procedure, which is capable of solving large-scale problems, is applied to three well-known problems in rotating workforce scheduling. The computational results presented indicate that this procedure provides us with a useful method of solving large-scale complex problems in workforce scheduling. ^ The general model developed can also be applied to other problems in sequencing and scheduling. To illustrate this feature, we consider a particular aspect of the examination timetabling problem where the objective is to assign blocks of examinations to time periods such that the number of students having back-to-back conflicts is minimized. The time periods are defined in such a way that the last period of any day and the first period of the following day are not considered to be back-to-back. The problem is modelled as a network flow problem where the solution to the problem is the shortest path in the network subject to side-constraints. A dual based approach followed by a K-shortest path enumeration technique is employed to identify this optimal path. The procedure is tested on a variety of test problems including a real problem faced by a large university. ...|$|R

50|$|The Bath Grounds {{get their}} {{name from the}} Ivanhoe Baths, a Neo-classical Spa {{building}} designed by Robert Chaplin and built by the 1st Marquis of Hastings. The spa opened in 1822 and was named after the Sir Walter Scott novel Ivanhoe which mentions the local area. The land {{to the east of}} the Baths was laid out as an area of fashionable ‘greensward’ for the benefit of visitors to the Baths. This landscaped area consisted of a carriage drive and walks, used for sedate and genteel recreation. By {{the turn of the century}} a more formal <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>recreation</b> was reflected in the establishment of tennis courts, a croquet lawn and a bowls green and use of the area by the Ivanhoe Archery club and Deer’s Leap Gun Club. By 1926 the Grounds had become an established venue for hockey and cricket clubs.The adjacent Royal Hotel, opened in 1827, was originally built to accommodate the rapidly increasing number of visitors to the spa. The Ivanhoe Baths were closed on 22 March 1884, caused by falling visitor numbers due to the new preference for seaside resorts over spa resorts. The buildings remained unused and gradually decayed, eventually being demolished almost 60 years later for health and safety reasons. The Royal Hotel remained, standing to the West of the Bath Grounds, and was granted a grade 2 listed building status in 1950.Remnants of the spa buildings are still visible within the Bath Grounds, including stone fragments from the columns, pediments and cornices.|$|R

40|$|The logical {{conclusion}} of the short analysis of criteria on natural resource planning and management in situ and ex situ (scale, number, intraspecific variability, ecology of communities, policy, economy, <b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> research, <b>recreation),</b> referring to active biological protection of trees, is as follows: biological resources of trees in situ and ex situ should be large, diverse and geographically and ecologically distributed throughout the country. Their number and scale depend on our potentials. At {{the beginning of the}} new century, we have to create an active (functional) strategy of the protection of tree biology, especially endemic and relic species. Accordingly, the biologists interested in tree resource protection should already exercise their influence in solving these issues (<b>organisation</b> <b>of</b> active protection, more or less directed reproduction, of economically significant species, etc). The biological protection of trees has an intensive development in the developed countries of the world, while the developing countries are trying to follow the trend, depending on their material sources, culture and attitude of their state government Biological protection of trees is an open, new, and very wide area of further research in already set aside natural resources in situ and ex situ. This is a new field of research, without a long tradition. Along with the scientific value of this approach of the systematic and systemic solution of more or less directed tree reproduction, we also need an economic stimulation. The scope and the complexity of this field of research requires further scientific work of a greater number of teams, some of which should be supported by forestry profession and the society in general The introduction of the model of tree recombination system enables a completely new approach to quality control of the successive generations of trees. This means that all current and planned measures in the model must be clearly scientifically defined, integrally (ecosystem) understood and, most importantly, efficiently realized. Also, their definition and realisation must be synchronised and continual both in case of short-term and long-term measures, which are interdependent and inter-conditioned...|$|R
