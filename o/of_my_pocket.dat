[...] But the corset cover, a [...] "boxlike armour of whalebone and pink cordage," [...] poked out from under gown, and this time she called Marie, her personal maid. She told her, [...] "Bring me two <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> handkerchiefs and some pink ribbonâ€¦ And bring the needle and thread and some pins." [...] She fashioned the handkerchiefs and ribbon into a simple bra.|$|E
60|$|I flushed furiously, and {{it seemed}} to burn me through the lining <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then I took {{a little}} book out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> it was my {{favourite}} copy of the Ingoldsby Legends--and began to read.|$|E
60|$|Lefty {{advanced}} {{and began to}} tap me scientifically in the neighbourhood <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b> He grunted morosely the while. I suppose, at this close range, the temptation to 'hand me one' was almost {{more than he could}} bear.|$|R
60|$|I {{have only}} once in my life picked a pocket, and then (perhaps through some absent-mindedness) I picked my own. My act can really with some reason be so described. For in taking things out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket</b> I {{had at least one}} of the more tense and quivering {{emotions}} of the thief; I had a complete ignorance and a profound curiosity as to what I should find there. Perhaps it would be the exaggeration of eulogy to call me a tidy person. But I can always pretty satisfactorily account for all my possessions. I can always tell where they are, and what I have done with them, so long as I can keep them out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b> If once anything slips into those unknown abysses, I wave it a sad Virgilian farewell. I suppose that the things that I have dropped into <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> are still there; the same presumption applies to the things that I have dropped into the sea. But I regard the riches stored in both these bottomless chasms with the same reverent ignorance. They tell us that on the last day the sea will give up its dead; and I suppose that on the same occasion long strings of extraordinary things will come running out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b> But I have quite forgotten what any of them are; and there is really nothing (excepting the money) that I shall be at all surprised at finding among them.|$|R
60|$|MANGAN. Not a penny out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket.</b> The {{syndicate}} {{found the}} money: {{they knew how}} useful I should be {{to them in the}} Government.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} her, {{and she looked}} at me. Then I took the double-barrelled pistol out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> and gave it to her.|$|E
60|$|I took ten cents out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> {{and held}} it where the light could glitter from every point of its surface full in his face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' {{said the}} doctor, {{leaning back in}} his chair, 'I always take 'em out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> before I eat. My pockets are rather tight. Ha, ha, ha!' ...|$|E
60|$|To {{keep up the}} circulation, I {{ran around}} the island a dozen times or so, and clambered across its rocky {{backbone}} as many times more-- all of which was of greater service to me, as I afterward discovered, than merely to warm me up. In {{the midst of this}} exercise I wondered if I had lost anything out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> while rolling over and over in the sand. A search showed the absence <b>of</b> <b>my</b> revolver and pocket-knife. The first Yellow Handkerchief had taken; but the knife had been lost in the sand.|$|R
60|$|My {{answer to}} the beggars was a {{reference}} to my attendant, backed by the simple action <b>of</b> turning <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> inside out; and, whilst he was battling with the beggars, I proceeded to cast my first coup-d'oeil upon the Rauzah.|$|R
6000|$|The {{vice-consul}} {{was against}} it. [...] "I would rather lend {{him the money}} out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket.</b> How {{are you going to}} get along yourself, if you let him have so much?" ...|$|R
60|$|Away went Mr. Batterbury {{to finish}} his walk {{for the sake of}} his health, and away went I to visit my {{publisher}} for the sake <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "'Perhaps {{you will}} first read the document.' I drew it out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> {{gave it to}} him, and retired. He should be alone while he read it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take the {{handcuffs}} out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b> This side. Go over to Gorsech with them. Gorsech, snap those irons on Snell's wrists. Now, Snell, {{back here to}} the right of me." ...|$|E
50|$|Jimmy Squarefoot is {{also the}} name <b>of</b> Monster in <b>My</b> <b>Pocket</b> #80 {{as well as a}} {{character}} in the 2007 PlayStation 3 video game Folklore.|$|R
5000|$|TMJ were sued by Bozo the Clown for {{including}} a sample {{taken from a}} Bozo the Clown album in the intro to the song [...] "Clowns" [...] on the independent release of Son of Sam I Am. The five-second sample ("I found something in one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b> It was about as big as your shoe, but it was shaped like a rocket!") was pulled from the track when the album was re-released by Warner Bros. Records. [...] The song [...] "Clowns" [...] went on {{to be used in}} the soundtrack to the movie Shakes the Clown (also without the sample).|$|R
6000|$|Lov. You {{are in the}} right, I {{have not}} a cross at present, as I am a sinner; an you will not believe me, I'll turn <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> inside outward--Ha! What's the meaning <b>of</b> this? <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> heavy! has <b>my</b> small officer put in {{counters}} to abuse me?--How now! yellow boys, by this good light? sirrah, varlet, how came I by this gold? Ha! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Must {{have slipped}} out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> in the smash-up," [...] he thought. [...] "Well, I'll {{have to make}} the best of it, only I don't want to carry off another person's property." ...|$|E
60|$|Instinctively I {{let go of}} the pistol, {{snatched}} {{my right}} hand out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> and brought it up in a belated parry, and then let out with my left full in his chest.|$|E
60|$|To wait, {{listening}} again, in {{the darkness}} of that unknown region, was more than I had courage for. The moment I was down on the floor, I pulled the lantern out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> and raised the shade.|$|E
60|$|These {{first three}} {{paragraphs}} I did not read to Ethelbertha. Fortunately they just filled the first sheet, which I took an opportunity <b>of</b> slipping into <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> unobserved.|$|R
60|$|I {{runs around}} to {{the light of the}} big blaze, and pulls the Handbook out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> inside <b>pocket.</b> I kind of laughed when I felt it in my hands --I reckon I was some daffy with the {{sensation}} of excitement.|$|R
60|$|MITCHENER. Ive {{subscribed to}} the {{regiment}}al band all my life. I bought two sarrusophones for it out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket.</b> When I sang Tosti's Goodbye for Ever at Knightsbridge in 1880, the whole regiment wept. You {{are too young}} to remember that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take them lil' silver bottle out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> {{and pull}} the top off him," [...] he said very slowly; and when Amadu had done so he gulped down a draught of lukewarm brandy before he spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, girls," [...] said I, {{pulling a}} paper out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> [...] "you {{must know that}} your father is getting to be famous by means of these 'House and Home Papers.' Here is a letter I have just received:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is another}} thing to consider," [...] {{continued}} Dave. [...] "It wouldn't be right to let Doctor Clay stand for the expense of that broken window. I think I'll send him {{the price of the}} glass out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{have been}} willin' {{to give a}} good deal more'n that right out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket,</b> poor as trade has been, than to lose the snuggest lodgin'-place in this town. We'll never find anythin' that {{will come up with}} that shed." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a moment's silence. I {{drew the}} piece <b>of</b> paper from <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> as though by accident, {{and read it}} to myself. There {{were only a few}} hastily scrawled lines:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Larks and {{starlings}} chiefly, {{but there}} were other kinds amongst 'em. Why, sir, they flew about my head and round the lantern like clouds of snowflakes. I was sittin' on the lantern just as Shales is sittin' now, and the birds came so thick that I had to pull my sou'-wester down over my eyes, and hold up my hands sometimes before my face to protect myself, for they hit me all over. I snapped at 'em, and caught 'em as fast as I could use my hands--gave their heads a screw, and crammed 'em into <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b> In a short time the pockets were all as full as they could hold--coat, vest, and trousers. I had to do it so fast that many of 'em wasn't properly killed, and some came alive agin, hopped out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> and flew away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] said Mr. Deane, {{glancing at}} the reward of merit in the decanter. [...] "But what do you want?" [...] he added, {{pinching}} the dimpled chin fondly,--"to coax some more sovereigns out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> for your bazaar? Eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|The blowing of the coach-horn in {{the yard}} was a seasonable diversion, which made me get up and hesitatingly inquire, in the mingled pride and diffidence of having a purse (which I took out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket),</b> if there were {{anything}} to pay.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{having nothing}} to meet a balance of some twenty or thirty {{thousand}} dollars of unpaid debt is what you call low water, the tide is out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> certainly. But, I shall not despair; I am young, and have a noble, manly profession." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2010, {{he played}} Captain Shipshape in the CBeebies second series <b>of</b> Grandpa In <b>My</b> <b>Pocket</b> {{and starred in}} the film Belle. After that, he played Henry Tizard in Castles in the Sky.|$|R
6000|$|... "One," [...] he said, [...] "is to New York, one to The Hague, {{and one to}} London. There {{was plenty}} <b>of</b> money in <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b> Perhaps you will find it and pay for these." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thirteen hundred <b>of</b> the best, <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> Croesus," [...] was the jubilant reply. [...] "To-morrow {{you shall}} have your pony back--not to-night. Your money brings me luck, Jacob. It's the stuff I've been looking for." ...|$|R
