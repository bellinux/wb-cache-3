5|$|Liz becomes furious when Jack {{decides that}} Tracy {{should be the}} number one {{priority}} on The Girlie Show. Jenna fears that Tracy will begin to overshadow her, but Tracy is quite pleased with his new job on the show. Liz and Jenna become more aggravated when Jack decides to {{change the name of}} The Girlie Show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, without consulting either of them. Jack has Tracy and Jenna appear in a promotion for the show, in which Tracy angers Jenna by forgetting her name and by not letting her speak. After the promotion, Liz tries to re-assure Jenna by telling her that nobody on the show likes Tracy and that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> he is on the show is because of Jack. Liz finds out that Jenna's microphone was still on, and everyone in the studio heard her say terrible things about Jack and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|Various {{forms of}} divine command theory have been {{presented}} by philosophers including William of Ockham, St Augustine, Duns Scotus, and John Calvin. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts that good actions are morally good {{as a result of}} their being commanded by God, and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.|$|E
25|$|The {{other type}} of {{exchange}} {{is known as a}} bike-to-bike exchange. The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> a team would use this type of exchange is if the team members are not all approximately the same height. More often than not, it is because one member of the team is shorter than the rest because most cyclists in the race are fairly tall. This exchange is far simpler than the other. The first rider only has to come in and tap the next rider's shoulder or arm and then the other racer can begin. While this is much easier than the other exchange, it is significantly slower because the second racer is starting from a dead stop, while riders performing the man-to-man exchange have some forward momentum.|$|E

The relevance criterion requires that one who presents {{an argument for}} or against a position should attempt to set forth <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> {{are directly related to}} the merit of the position at issue. Fallacies such as appeal to tradition, appeal to force, or genetic fallacy fail to meet the argumentative demands of relevance.|$|R

25|$|People {{often say}} that {{machines}} enslave man and that technology dehumanises society, {{but they are}} wrong! It is the manufacturer that enslaves man. It is to the manufacturer that man is condemned to a life sentence of forced labour. The manufacturer enslaves man, but robots free us. The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> technology is dehumanising society is because humans still {{have to work with}} the machines used for forced labour, or because they must clock in to where the forced labour takes place. That is the problem, humans and machines should not be mixed together. Humans are designed to spend their time in places of fulfilment, while machines are designed to function in the workplace, under the supervision of robots and computers.|$|E
25|$|As soon as White was arrested, he gave {{back the}} $5,500 he had saved in an {{envelope}} that he kept in his room. He was forced to miss the last few games of the season, {{and at that time}} he was averaging 27.7points per game and was the nation's leading scorer. He was only 77total points from setting the new NCAA single season scoring record. When his career came to an abrupt halt, White had scored 1,435points. On February 19, 1951—the day before his arrest—White was named The Sporting News Player of the Year. The <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> he was still able to accept the honor was because The Sporting News had already mailed out their newest issue and {{it was too late to}} recall the magazine. Although he had been a Consensus Second Team All-American the year before, and was on track to be named a Consensus First Team All-American (and, probably, the Consensus National Player of the Year) as a senior, the NCAA refused to allow any awards or recognition to be bestowed upon any of the schools, players and coaches found to be involved in the match-fixing scandal that rocked college basketball in the late 1940s into 1951. LIU shut down its entire athletic program from 1951 to 1957 as a result of the scandal.|$|E

500|$|However, some {{scenes in}} the episode gained unintentional significance. The Boston Red Sox won the World Series {{for the second time}} in three years after the episode was written, which {{prompted}} the question [...] "Is it possible Lapidus is actually from 2008?" [...] due to his annoyed reply. Likewise, the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Elsa and Naomi had similar bracelets was that it would serve as an [...] "emotional touchstone" [...] for Sayid. After the episode, the producers received several emails about both issues.|$|E
500|$|Convocation {{was not the}} <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{students}} visited Rutherford's home: he had {{a wealth}} of both knowledge and books on Canadian subjects, and welcomed students to consult his private library. This library eventually expanded beyond the room in his mansion devoted to it, to encompass the house's den, maid's sitting room, and garage as well. After his death, the collection was donated and sold to the University's library system; it was described in 1967 as [...] "still the most important rare collection in the library".|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} escalated to {{the point}} where death threats were sent to Time-Warner executives, and stockholders threatened {{to pull out of the}} company. Finally, Ice-T decided to remove [...] "Cop Killer" [...] from the album of his own volition, a decision which was met by criticism from other artists who derided Ice-T for [...] "caving in to external pressure." [...] In an interview, Ice-T stated that [...] "I didn't want my band to get pigeon-holed as that's the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> record sold.

500|$|Landy was {{initially}} hired to treat Brian Wilson by Wilson's wife Marilyn in 1975. Wilson publicly rebelled against the program, {{saying that the}} <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> he {{went along with it}} was so {{that he would not be}} committed to a psychiatric facility. Beach Boys road manager Rick Nelson later claimed that Landy had attempted to exert unwelcome artistic control over the group. During the recording of 15 Big Ones (1976), group meetings were supervised by Landy, and discussions over each song for the record were reported to last for up to eight hours. Another report suggested that Landy had asked for a percentage of the band's income. At the command of Landy, Wilson appeared on Saturday Night Live, choosing to perform a solo piano rendition of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] which received mixed feedback. Landy stood off-camera holding signs for Wilson that read [...] "smile". He said that critics misapprehended his motives, elaborating that Wilson's performance [...] "was a terrible thing" [...] as a one-shot, but if he continued making appearances, then he would have gradually overcome his stage fright.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{felt that}} the story and {{dialogue}} were weak, while the visuals were spectacular. Kenneth Turan's review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, [...] "What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, {{it is not even}} close.", and later claimed that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the film won Oscars was because of its box office total. Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, [...] "The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [...] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say." [...] Also, filmmaker Robert Altman called it [...] "the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life". In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, [...] "Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered".|$|E
500|$|Two {{years later}} against Plum Warner's MCC team, there were further calls for Marsh to be {{selected}} for the Test team as Australia fell 1–2 behind in the Ashes. Marsh had taken 5/55 against the Englishmen in a match at Bathurst, delivering a mixture of fast bowling and off spin. His victims included George Hirst and Warner himself. No formal complaint about Marsh's bowling was lodged by the English but his bowling did raise eyebrows. The general consensus among the English touring party was that Marsh's bowling was unfair, with Warner describing him as a [...] "shier", a 19th-century term for a thrower. Warner asserted that no English umpire would tolerate such a bowling action. Despite this, the English players described him as the best bowler that they had faced on the tour. Warner and Noble were confident that Crockett would no-ball Marsh out of the match if the Australian Test selectors picked the bowler. As a result, Marsh was effectively excluded from the Australian side and his first-class career was limited to just six matches in which he took 34 wickets {{at an average of}} 21.47. The Australian Test batsman and captain Warren Bardsley rated Marsh alongside Fred Spofforth and England's Sydney Barnes. The comparison to Barnes was praise indeed; Barnes was the only bowler in Test history with over 120 wickets to have a bowling average under 20, with 189 wickets at an average of just 16.43. Bardsley said that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Marsh was [...] "kept ... out of big cricket was his color". Jack Pollard said that Marsh [...] "was clearly the best Australian bowler of his time but unfortunately that was a period when the White Australia policy prevailed. Marsh's name was scratched from the list of players ... by an official who was simply carrying out the racist customs of the day." ...|$|E

Another stir up came from Jon Huntsman saying that Mitt Romney's attitude is one that is dividing this nation. Huntsman said that after he had been criticized by Romney for being Obama's ambassador to China. Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney also got into an argument about the Super PAC advertisements that each had been putting out.|$|E
2500|$|Rémond {{said that}} {{preventing}} the minimalist coup {{would have taken}} at most 50 guards, and that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the Sublime Porte had been defenseless was because Kâmil Pasha wanted to call the bluff of any real threat the CUP, which he had sidelined politically, posed to his government. After the coup, Rémond said, he found the capital Istanbul to be quiet and devoid of public opinion, whether about the coup or the ongoing First Balkan War, noting an air of [...] "indifference" [...] among not only the populace, but the statesmen involved themselves.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Confidence and Paranoia" [...] (1988), Lister {{believes}} that the <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Rimmer {{became a part of}} the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a concussion. Lister, {{with the help of a}} solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by Craig Ferguson), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1943, Royal Air Force Squadron Leader Roger Bushell {{conceived}} a {{plan for}} a mass escape from the North Compound, which occurred on the night of 24/25 March 1944. He was being held with the other British and Commonwealth airmen and he was in command of the Escape Committee that managed all escape opportunities from the north compound. Falling back on his legal background to represent his scheme, Bushell called a meeting of the Escape Committee to advocate for his plan.

These, according to the Famine Commission, made the [...] "material and psychological repercussions of war more pronounced" [...] in Bengal than elsewhere in India. [...] War-related construction, in addition, was carried out in Bengal on a larger scale, causing acute inflationary pressures. Increased employment brought increased labor militancy to Calcutta and its environs between August 1942 and June 1944. According to scholar S.

The Backstreet Boys [...] "took a shot" [...] at Pearlman by titling their 2000 album Black & Blue. Meanwhile, the title No Strings Attached was announced in September 1999, during when the legal battle was still ongoing. NSYNC's member, Chris Kirkpatrick, revealed that the title and the album's cover art have a personal meaning to them. According to him, the album was designed to show that they felt they were puppets stranded in strings, which alludes to their destiny being controlled. In an interview, he further explained the relationship of the strings to the album:We enjoyed working on this album with the producers, and the <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> the strings are still attached on the album is so people can get the whole feel of the vibe of, you know, No Strings Attached. That's what we mean by the strings, so they'll understand that we're not puppets.|$|R
