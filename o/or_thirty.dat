5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebuilding}} and remodelling {{occurred in the}} late Middle Ages. A chantry chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was founded in 1271 by the merchants Thomas Blount and John de Bucham, who endowed it with lands around Old and New Sleaford, and several surrounding villages. The chapel {{is located on the}} north aisle, and the chaplain was instructed to pray there for the founders at his daily mass. The chantry priest's house is recorded in the 1440s as one of the oldest buildings in Sleaford; located in the churchyard, it became the Vicarage. The tower was probably accompanied by a nave of a similar date, which was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style in the mid to late 14th century; the transept followed twenty <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> years later, according to Trollope. A clerestory was added in around 1430 and the chancel was remodelled at this time.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, Montgomery opposed {{increases}} {{requested by}} the new Davis administration in the salaries of elected and appointed state officials instead of pay hikes for the lower-income state workers. That same year, he supported legislation to make the dumping of litter or trash along roads in the state or parish road systems a crime punishable by fines of up to $100 <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> days in jail.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the more}} grandiose Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments found {{elsewhere}} in Scotland, the recumbent stone circles of Aberdeenshire {{do not appear}} to have been intended to overshadow or overawe other more modest works. Even considering their geographical clustering, they are also well-spread out. Clive Ruggles and Aubrey Burl suggest that this indicates that they were constructed to serve as local ritual centres for groups of subsistence farmers each inhabiting territories of about , living on an egalitarian basis without powerful leaders and possibly numbering no more than about twenty <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> people per group.|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew {{calendar}} is a lunisolar calendar, {{meaning that}} months {{are based on}} lunar months, but years are based on solar years. The calendar year features twelve lunar months of twenty-nine <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> days, with an intercalary lunar month added periodically to synchronize the twelve lunar cycles with the longer solar year. (These extra months are added seven times every nineteen years. See Leap months, below.) The beginning of each Jewish lunar month {{is based on the}} appearance of the new moon. Although originally the new lunar crescent had to be observed and certified by witnesses, the moment of the true new moon is now approximated arithmetically as the molad, which is the mean new moon to a precision of one part.|$|E
25|$|Murphy, then {{faced with}} the {{charging}} gang members, raised the rifle toward them and took aim. Gang member W. H. Jackson pointed his revolver at Tanner, who testified that Jackson was “possibly twenty <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> feet” away. Tanner was unarmed and could do nothing. Jackson probably noticed Murphy was aiming his now-dead boss' rifle in his direction. This, coupled with the fast-approaching men from the Citizen's Committee, who prematurely ended their meeting {{with the sound of}} gun fire, perhaps convinced Jackson not fire his pistol at Tanner. Someone yelled out towards the men who were with Smith, “They have killed Soapy, and if you don’t clear out quick they will kill you too.” Not wanting to engage in a gun battle in which they were vastly outnumbered, the gang fled.|$|E

25|$|The Guaraní, the Cario, Tapé, Itatine, Guarajo, Tupí, {{and related}} subgroups, were generous people who {{inhabited}} an immense area {{stretching from the}} Guyana Highlands in Brazil to the Río Uruguay. The Guaraní were surrounded by hostile tribes, and were frequently at war. They believed that permanent wives were inappropriate for warriors, so their marital relations were loose. Some tribes practiced polygamy intended {{to increase the number}} of children. Chiefs often had twenty <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> concubines, whom they shared freely with visitors, yet they treated their wives well. At the same time, they often punished adulterers with death. Like the area's other tribes, the Guaraní were cannibals. As part of a war ritual, they ate their most valiant foes captured in battle in the hope that they would gain the bravery and power of their victims. The Guaraní accepted the arrival of Spaniards and looked to them for protection against fiercer neighboring tribes. The Guaraní also hoped the Spaniards would lead them against the Incas.|$|E
25|$|There were 15 guests (at Poutrincourt's table), {{each of whom}} in his turn, became steward and caterer of the day. At the dinner, the steward, with napkin on shoulder, {{staff of}} office in hand, and the collar of the order round his neck, led the van. The other guests in {{procession}} followed, each bearing a dish. After grace in the evening, he resigned the insignia to his successor, and they drank {{to each other in}} a cup of wine. It was the steward's duty, to look to supplies, and he would go hunt or fish a day or two before his turn came, and add some dainty to the ordinary fare. During the winter they had fowl and game in abundance, supplied by the Indians and by their own exertions. These feasts were often attended by Indians of all ages and both sexes, sometimes twenty <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> being present. The Sagamore, or chief, Membertou, the greatest Sagamore of the land, and other chiefs, when there, were treated as guests and equals.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Strachan {{wrote that}} it is a cliché that the armies marched in 1914 expecting a short war, because many {{professional}} soldiers anticipated a long war. Optimism is a requirement of command and expressing a belief that wars can be quick and lead to a triumphant victory, can be an essential aspect of a career as a peacetime soldier. Moltke (the Younger) was realistic about the nature of a great European war but this conformed to professional wisdom. Moltke (the Elder) was proved right in his 1890 prognostication to the Reichstag, that European alliances made a repeat of the successes of 1866 and 1871 impossible and anticipated a war of seven <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> years' duration. Universal military service enabled a state to exploit its human and productive resources to the full but also limited the causes for which a war could be fought and Social Darwinist rhetoric made the likelihood of surrender remote. Having mobilised and motivated the nation, states would fight until they had exhausted their means to continue.|$|E

He made a valuable 38 when South Africa beat England by one wicket in the 1905-06 series.|$|R

Juror No. 872 had begun discussions about sensitive details of the case with the other two jurors outside of the court on at least two occasions. Two days later, Holmes's attorneys requested the dismissal of a fourth juror after her brother-in-law was shot during a robbery the previous day, and other jurors had seen her crying. Judge Carlos Samour responded that he would consider it, and agreed to the motion by dismissing her on June 15. On June 17, a fifth juror was dismissed after Judge Samour was advised that she personally knew a wounded victim of the shooting.|$|R

500|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater (Caligavis chrysops) is a medium-small {{bird in the}} honeyeater family, Meliphagidae. [...] It takes {{both its}} common name and {{scientific}} name from the distinctive yellow stripes {{on the sides of}} its head. Its loud clear call often begins twenty <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and south eastern Australia, in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and woodlands along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants such as Banksia and Grevillea, and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as gleaning them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.|$|E
500|$|Baxter {{notes that}} Barry Lyndon was the film which made Kubrick notorious for paying scrupulous {{attention}} to detail, often demanding twenty <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> retakes {{of the same}} scene to perfect his art. Often considered to be his most authentic-looking picture, [...] the cinematography and lighting techniques that Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott used in Barry Lyndon were highly innovative. Most notably, interior scenes were shot with a specially adapted high-speed f/0.7 Zeiss camera lens originally developed for NASA {{to be used in}} satellite photography. The lenses allowed many scenes to be lit only with candlelight, creating two-dimensional, diffused-light images reminiscent of 18th-century paintings. Cinematographer Allen Daviau states that the method gives the audience a way of seeing the characters and scenes as they would have been seen by people at the time. Many of the fight scenes were shot with a hand-held camera to produce a [...] "sense of documentary realism and immediacy".|$|E

Stoll offered Robey a lucrative contract in 1916 to appear in the new revue The Bing Boys Are Here at the Alhambra Theatre, London. Dividing his time between three or four music halls a night had become unappealing to the comedian, and he relished the opportunity to appear in a single theatre.
