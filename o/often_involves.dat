5|$|Mimicry {{may involve}} {{numerous}} species; many harmless {{species such as}} hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended species such as wasps, while many such well-defended species form Mullerian mimicry rings, all resembling each other. Mimicry between prey species and their predators <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> three or more species.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{is often}} aerial and <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> pheromones. Butterflies then {{land on the}} ground or on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple {{photoreceptor}} cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.|$|E
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris {{does not mean that the}} whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E

5|$|Since {{irreversible}} inhibition <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> {{the initial}} {{formation of a}} non-covalent EI complex, it is sometimes possible for an inhibitor to bind to an enzyme {{in more than one}} way. For example, in the figure showing trypanothione reductase from the human protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, two molecules of an inhibitor called quinacrine mustard are bound in its active site. The top molecule is bound reversibly, but the lower one is bound covalently as it has reacted with an amino acid residue through its nitrogen mustard group.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{their school}} years, {{children}} {{continue to build}} their vocabulary. In particular, children begin to learn abstract words. Beginning around age 3–5, word learning takes place both in conversation and through reading. Word learning <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> physical context, builds on prior knowledge, takes place in social context, and includes semantic support. The phonological loop and serial order short-term memory may both {{play an important role}} in vocabulary development.|$|E
5|$|While Jesus {{is portrayed}} as an impassioned person for his love for all (even for shopping), Buddha tends to be calm and thrifty, and also likes manga. The comedy <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> visual gags and puns, as well as jokes in {{reference}} to elements of Christianity and Buddhism; for example, Jesus creates wine from water in a public bath and Buddha shines when excited.|$|E

5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive condition {{due to a}} mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. For a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent. Diagnosis may be difficult and <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> a combination of blood tests, urine tests, and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing {{may be used to}} screen family members of those affected.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarian sexual {{reproduction}} <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies) a larva swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally {{into a series}} of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have gonads in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into the water in the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the Multinational Staged Improvement Program (MSIP) was {{conducted}} to evolve the F-16's capabilities, mitigate risks during technology development, and ensure the aircraft's worth. The program upgraded the F-16 in three stages. The MSIP process permitted the quick introduction of new capabilities, at lower costs and with reduced risks compared to traditional independent upgrade programs. In 2012, the USAF had allocated $2.8 billion to upgrade 350 F-16s {{while waiting for the}} F-35 to enter service. One key upgrade has been an auto-GCAS (Ground collision avoidance system) to reduce instances of controlled flight into terrain. Onboard power and cooling capacities limits the scope of upgrades, which <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> the addition of more power-hungry avionics.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2003, {{the tournament}} format was a Limit Hold'em tournament, but in 2004, No-Limit Hold'em became the standard. The 2006 tournament, with 1,232 entrants, {{was the largest}} field ever for the event. Since its inception, with the {{exception}} of 2008, the Casino Employees event has started {{on the first day of}} the WSOP. Much of the drama encountered at the Casino Championship <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> informal rivaliries between dealers and proposition players. Proposition players are people hired to play poker, with their own money, at casinos to get games started or to ensure that they do not die out. Thus, while both the prop and dealer are casino employees, they sit on opposite sides of the table.|$|E
5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates {{to respond to}} changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.|$|E

5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{must first}} pass out of organelles and cells into blood {{circulation}} via amino acid transporters, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, {{occurring in the}} liver and kidneys, <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> deamination by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often {{the same as those}} used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the seven}} books is set {{over the course of}} one school year. Harry struggles with the {{problems}} he encounters, and dealing with them <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes {{a matter of life and}} death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E
5|$|The {{selective}} breeding of crop plants <b>often</b> <b>involves</b> selection against the plant's intrinsic resistance strategies. This makes crop plant varieties particularly susceptible to pests unlike their wild relatives. In breeding for host-plant resistance, {{it is often}} the wild relatives that provide the source of resistance genes. These genes are incorporated using conventional approaches to plant breeding, but have also been augmented by recombinant techniques, which allow introduction of genes from completely unrelated organisms. The most famous transgenic approach is the introduction of genes from the bacterial species, Bacillus thuringiensis, into plants. The bacterium produces proteins that, when ingested, kill lepidopteran caterpillars. The gene encoding for these highly toxic proteins, when introduced into the host plant genome, confers resistance against caterpillars, when the same toxic proteins are produced within the plant. This approach is controversial, however, due {{to the possibility of}} ecological and toxicological side effects.|$|E
