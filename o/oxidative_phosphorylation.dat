5|$|<b>Oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylation</b> (or OXPHOS in short) is the {{metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylation.</b> This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{released}} by <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylation</b> is high, compared with the amount produced by anaerobic fermentation. Glycolysis produces only 2 ATP molecules, but somewhere between 30 and 36 ATPs are produced by the <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylation</b> of the 10 NADH and 2 succinate molecules made by converting one molecule of glucose to carbon dioxide and water, while each cycle of beta oxidation of a fatty acid yields about 14 ATPs. These ATP yields are theoretical maximum values; in practice, some protons leak across the membrane, lowering the yield of ATP.|$|E
5|$|The main {{difference}} between eukaryotic and prokaryotic <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylation</b> is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under {{a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In E. coli, for example, <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylation</b> can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The midpoint potential of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.|$|E
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the {{different}} mechanisms involved in the adjustment of mitochondrial ATP production to cellular energy demand. The <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> steady state at constant mitochondrial enzyme content can vary in response to energy demand. However, such an adaptation is tightly linked to a modification in both <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> yield and phosphate potential and is obviously very limited in eukaryotic cells. We herein describe the three main mechanisms involved in mitochondrial response to energy demand. In heart cells, a short-term adjustment can be reached mainly through metabolic signaling via phosphotransfer networks by the compartmentalized energy transfer and signal transmission. In such a complex regulatory mechanism, calcium signaling participates in an activation of matricial dehydrogenases {{as well as of}} the mitochondrial ATP synthase. These processes allow a large increase in ATP production rate without any important modification in thermodynamic forces. For a long term adaptation two main mechanisms are involved: the modulation of the mitochondrial enzyme content as a function of energy demand and/or kinetic regulation by covalent modifications (phosphorylations) of some respiratory chain complexes subunits. Regardless of the mechanism involved (kinetic regulation by covalent modification or adjustment of the mitochondrial enzymatic content), the cAMP signaling pathway plays a major role in the molecular signaling leading to the mitochondrial response. We will discuss the energetic advantages of these mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAfter {{studying}} {{the effects of}} almitrine, {{a new kind of}} ATPase/ATP synthase inhibitor, on two kinds of isolated mammalian mitochondrion, we have observed that: (1) Almitrine inhibits oligomycin-sensitive ATPase; it decreases the ATP/O value of <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> without any change in the magnitude of delta mu H+. (2) Almitrine increases the mechanistic H+/ATP stoichiometry of ATPase as shown by measuring either (i) the extent of potassium acetate and of potassium phosphate accumulation sustained by ATP utilisation, or (ii) the electrical charge/ATP (K+/ATP) ratio at steady-state of ATPase activity. (3) Rat liver mitochondria are at least 10 -times more sensitive to almitrine than beef heart mitochondria. (4) The change in H+/ATP stoichiometry induced by almitrine depends on the magnitude of the flux through ATPase. The inhibitory effect of almitrine on ATPase/ATP synthase complex, as a consequence of such an H+/ATP stoichiometry change, is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the many}} studies {{concerned}} with the phenomenon of induced "tolerance or resistance " to normally lethal stress (such as endotoxemia or trauma), {{it has not been}} clearly established whether the adaptive process is associated with alterations in energy metabolism. Those parameters of metabolism which have been explored appear to be unchanged in tolerant animals (1 - 4). Differences between normal and adapted animals become apparent only following exposure to challenge. Endotoxin- and drum-tolerant animals do not develop either the marked changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism or the impairment of <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations,</b> exhibited by normal animals when challenged. Most investigators have assumed that altered release of mediating hormones such as cortisone (5) and epinephrine (6) or readjustment of circulatory dynamics (4) were sufficient to explain the observed differences.

5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress.

Renal diseases in mitochondrial cytopathies are {{a group of}} rare diseases that are characterized by frequent multisystemic involvement and extreme variability of phenotype. Most frequently patients present a tubular defect {{that is consistent with}} complete De Toni-Debré-Fanconi syndrome in most severe forms. More rarely, patients present with chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, cystic renal diseases, or primary glomerular involvement. In recent years, two clearly defined entities, namely 3243 A>G tRNALEU mutations and coenzyme Q 10 biosynthesis defects, have been described. The latter group is particularly important because it represents the only treatable renal mitochondrial defect. In this paper, the physiopathologic bases of mitochondrial cytopathies, the diagnostic approaches, and main characteristics of related renal diseases are summarized. 1. The Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Mitochondria exert multiple roles in cells; in addition to ATP synthesis through <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> (OXPHOS), they are at the crossroad of numerous metabolic pathways, contribute to heat production, and control cell-cycle/apop-tosis and regulation of several anaplerotic reactions [1, 2]...|$|R
40|$|The brown {{adipose tissue}} (BAT) {{is the site}} of {{thermogenesis}} in the neonatal and the hibernating mammal. In the neonatal rabbit, cold exposure induces an increase in oxygen uptake and heat production by the BAT (Dawkins & Hull, 1964). BAT is a strongly innervated tissue (Cottle & Cottle, 1970) and its noradrenaline content is high (Sidman et al. 1962). In neonatal rabbits, noradrenaline infusion produces the same effect as cold exposure (Dawkins & Hull, 1964). It has therefore been concluded that noradrenaline is the physiological mediator of the cold. Noradrenaline induces lipolysis and the increase in intracellular free fatty acids leads to uncoupling of the <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> and to a subsequent heat production (Hittelman & Lindberg, 1970; Wojtczak, 1974). The aim of our study was to assess the maturation of the BAT during the last days of foetal development, by mimicking in vitro the effects of cold exposure with the βadrenergic agent isoprenaline. © 1978 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

40|$|Mitochondrial biogenesis and {{metabolism}} {{have recently}} emerged as important actors of stemness and differentiation. On the one hand, the differentiation {{of stem cells}} is associated with an induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and a shift from glycolysis toward <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> (OXPHOS). In addition, interfering with mitochondrial biogenesis or function impacts stem cell differentiation. On the other hand, some inverse changes in mitochondrial abundance and function are observed during the reprogramming of somatic cells into {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs). Yet although great promises in cell therapy might generate better knowledge of the mechanisms regulating the stemness and differentiation of somatic stem cells (SSCs) - which are preferred over embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs because of ethical and safety considerations - little interest was given to the study of their mitochondria. This study provides a detailed characterization of the mitochondrial biogenesis occurring during the hepatogenic differentiation of bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). During the hepatogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs, an increased abundance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is observed, as well as an increased expression of several mitochondrial proteins and biogenesis regulators, concomitant with increased OXPHOS activity, capacity, and efficiency. In addition, opposite changes in mitochondrial morphology and in the abundance of several OXPHOS subunits were found during the spontaneous dedifferentiation of primary hepatocytes. These data support reverse mitochondrial changes in a different context from genetically-engineered reprogramming. They argue in favor of a mitochondrial involvement in hepatic differentiation and dedifferentiation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{density is}} a {{parameter}} measured for glioma grade and invasiveness diagnosis. The {{characterization of the}} cellular density can be performed, non invasively, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), since, this technique displays a good resolution. Nevertheless MRI sensitivity is critical. Development of smart contrast agents appears useful to increase MRI {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR). Tumor invasiveness is correlated with high expression of integrins that can be targeted by RGD motif. In this study, MRI contrast agents or fluorescent probes linked to RGD-peptides were used, in a glioma model, to assess the relation between RGD uptake/signal improvement/cell density and consequently tumor invasiveness. Experi-ments were performed in vitro with U 87 -MG glioma cells. Flow cytometry and microscopy experiments with RGD and iRGD-alexa 488 demonstrated that cell internalization was dependent on cell density. The internalization involved a clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Cytoskeleton and particularly the microtubules were concerned. Actin filaments played a minor role. The internalization was also dependent on the glycolysis and the <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations.</b> The cellular density modulated the importance of the endocytosis pathways and of the metabolism but not the cytoskeleton contribution. The internalization of the RGD-peptide associated to gadolinium chelate increased the SNR of U 87 cells. Moreover, following the cell density augmentation, the SNR increased with a low amplitude but a trend was clearly determined.

We previously reported that prenatal exposure to a low-protein diet (LP) leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in pancreatic islets from adult rodent offspring that could relate physiological and cellular alterations due to early diet. We aim to determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction could be a common consequence of prenatal nutritional unbalances. Pregnant Wistar rats received either a global food restriction (GFR), consisting in the reduction by 50 % of the normal daily food intake, or a high-fat diet (HF) throughout gestation. GFR or HF diet during pregnancy leads to a lack of increase in insulin release and ATP content in response to glucose stimulation in islets from 3 -month-old male and female offspring. These similar consequences originated from impairment in either glucose sensing or glucose metabolism, {{depending on the type of}} early malnutrition and on the sex of the progeny. Indeed, the glucose transport across β-cell membrane seemed compromised in female HF offspring, since GLUT- 2 gene was markedly underexpressed. Additionally, for each progeny, consequences downstream the entry of glucose were also apparent. Expression of genes involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle and <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> was altered in GFR and HF rats in a sex- and diet-dependent manner. Moreover, prenatal malnutrition affected the regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, namely, PPAR coactivator 1 alpha (PGC- 1 α), since its expression was higher in islets from GFR rats. In conclusion, programming of mitochondrial dysfunction is a consequence of maternal malnutrition, which may predispose to glucose intolerance in the adult offspring...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{hydrothermal}} Pompeii worm Alvinella pompejana lives {{very close}} to the walls of black smokers and is therefore exposed to high-temperature venting fluid containing high concentrations of sulphides and metals. The highly aerobic metabolism of these annelids, together with these extreme physico-chemical conditions, theoretically accelerates redox processes in and around the worm, potentially increasing oxidative threat by reactive oxygen species (ROS). This prompted us to analyse activity of antioxidant enzymes in A. pompejana tissues and investigate whether they are adjusted to the endogenous production of ROS by <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> and/or to the environmental conditions. This was investigated by comparing antioxidant and metabolic enzyme activities in gills, head, body wall, pygidium and guts of A. pompejana collected at different vent sites of the East Pacific Rise. The antioxidant defence arsenal of A. pompejana is peculiar, showing very low catalase (CAT) activity and very high superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in most tissues. It is very likely that CAT is not expressed in A. pompejana, as this haemic enzyme could be inhibited by the high sulphide concentrations prevailing in the worm's environment. A. pompejana does not compensate for the low hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity of CAT by higher glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity levels. This latter enzyme correlates well with cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase in most tissues, suggesting that oxidative metabolism represents the main source of peroxides managed by GPX. On the contrary, SOD shows no correlation with any metabolic enzyme and is likely adjusted to respiration-independent ROS generation. Source variations in enzyme activities are mainly observed in the animal's gills and gut, possibly reflecting differences in the vent fluid thermal regime and/or chemistry...|$|R

PD 98059 (inhibitor of MAP 2 K 1, also known as MEK- 1, upstream of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases MAPK 3 / 1, also known as ERK 1 / 2), wortmannin (inhibitor of PIK 3 C 2 A, also known as PI 3 K), and rapamycin (inhibitor of FRAP 1, also known as mTOR, upstream of RPS 6 KB 1) each significantly decreased insulin and oxidative stress-induced proliferation of theca-interstitial cells. The greatest inhibition was observed {{in the presence of}} rapamycin; this effect occurred without a significant change in cell viability. Phosphorylation of AKT was stimulated by insulin only, while phosphorylation of MAPK 3 / 1 and RPS 6 KB 1 was increased by insulin and oxidative stress. Insulin-induced and <b>oxidative</b> stress-induced <b>phosphorylation</b> of RPS 6 KB 1 was partly inhibited by wortmannin and partly by PD 98059; the greatest inhibition was observed {{in the presence of a}} combination of wortmannin plus PD 98059.

40|$|The K+ {{permeability}} of {{pancreatic islet}} cells was studied by monitoring the efflux of 86 Rb+ (used as tracer for K+) from perifused rat islets and measuring the uptake of 42 K+. Glucose markedly and reversibly decreased 86 Rb+ efflux from islet cells and this effect was antagonized by inhibitors of the metabolic {{degradation of the}} sugar, i. e. mannoheptulose, iodoacetate, glucosamine and 2 -deoxyglucose. Among glucose metabolites, glyceraldehyde reduced the K+ permeability even more potently than did glucose itself; pyruvate and lactate alone exhibited only a small effect, but potentiated that of glucose. Other metabolized sugars, like mannose, glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine, also decreased 86 Rb+ efflux from islet cells. Fructose was effective only {{in the presence of}} glucose. Non-metabolized sugars like galactose, 2 -deoxyglucose and 3 -O-methylglucose had no effect. The changes in K+ permeability by agents known to modify the concentrations of nicotinamide nucleotides, glutathione or ATP in islet cells were also studied. Increasing NAD(P) H concentrations in islet cells by pentobarbital rapidly and reversibly reduced 86 Rb+ efflux; exogenous reduced glutathione produced a similar though weaker effect. By contrast, oxidizing nicotinamide nucleotides with phenazine methosulphate or Methylene Blue, or oxidizing glutathione by t-butyl hydroperoxide increased the K+ permeability of islet cells. Uncoupling the <b>oxidative</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> with dicumarol also augmented 86 Rb+ efflux markedly. In the absence of glucose, but not in its presence, methylxanthines reduced 86 Rb+ efflux from the islets; such was not the case for cholera toxin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Glucose and glyceraldehyde had no effect on 42 K+ uptake after a short incubation (10 min), but augmented it after 60 min; the effect of glucose was suppressed by mannoheptulose and not mimicked by 3 -O-methylglucose. The results clearly establish the importance of the metabolic degradation of glucose and other substrates for the control of the K+ permeability in pancreatic islet cells and support the concept that a decrease in the K+ permeability represents a major step of the B-cell response to physiological stimulation...|$|R

A MEK inhibitor, PD 98059, or a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) inhibitor, LY 294002, abolished the survival effect of prosaposin on the oxidative stress-induced cell death. Furthermore, prosaposin blocked the <b>oxidative</b> stress-induced <b>phosphorylations</b> of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p 38 stress-activated protein kinase.

In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the mitochondrion (to reduce mitochondrial NAD) by mitochondrial shuttles, such as the malate-aspartate shuttle.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that reactive oxygen species are critical components of cell signaling pathways, in particular regulating protein phosphorylation events. Here, we show that oxidative stress in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment of human epithelial cells induces robust tyrosine phosphorylation on multiple proteins. Using an anti-phosphotyrosine purification and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach, we have identified many of these H 2 O 2 -induced tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Importantly, we show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src are the primary upstream kinases mediating these events through their redox activation. The finding that many of the identified proteins have functions in cell adhesion, cell-cell junctions, and the actin cytoskeleton prompted us to examine stress-induced changes in adhesion. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that H 2 O 2 alters cell adhesion structures and the actin cytoskeleton causing loss of adhesion and apoptosis. Remarkably, these cellular changes could be attenuated by inhibition of EGFR and Src, identifying these kinases as targets to block oxidative damage. In summary, our data demonstrate that EGFR and Src together {{play a central role in}} <b>oxidative</b> stress-induced <b>phosphorylation,</b> which in turn results in loss of adhesion, morphological changes, and cell damage in epithelial cells.
