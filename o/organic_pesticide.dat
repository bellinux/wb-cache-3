One of the key genetic factors linked to this condition is α-synuclein, and the α-synuclein protein is pathologically associated with idiopathic cases. However, α-synuclein pathology is also present in presymptomatic, clinically “normal” individuals suggesting that environmental factors, such as Parkinson's disease-linked agricultural pesticides, may be required to precipitate Parkinson's disease in these individuals. In this context, the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the behavioural and neuropathological impact of exposing rats with a subclinical load of α-synuclein to subclinical doses of the <b>organic</b> <b>pesticide,</b> rotenone. Rats were randomly assigned to two groups for intra-nigral infusion of AAV 2 / 5 -GFP or AAV 2 / 5 -α-synuclein. Post viral motor function was assessed at 8, 10 and 12 weeks in the Corridor, Stepping and Whisker tests of lateralised motor function. At week 12, animals were performance-matched to receive a subsequent intra-striatal challenge of the <b>organic</b> <b>pesticide</b> rotenone (or its vehicle) to yield four final groups (Control, Rotenone, AAV 2 / 5 -α-synuclein and Combined). Behavioural testing resumed one week after rotenone surgery and continued for 5 weeks. We found that, when administered alone, neither intra-nigral AAV-α-synuclein nor intra-striatal rotenone caused sufficient nigrostriatal neurodegeneration to induce a significant motor impairment in their own right. However, when these were administered sequentially to the same rats, the interaction between the two Parkinsonian challenges significantly exacerbated nigrostriatal neurodegeneration which precipitated a pronounced impairment in motor function. These results indicate that exposing rats with a subclinical α-synuclein-induced pathology to the pesticide, rotenone, profoundly exacerbates their Parkinsonian neuropathology and dysfunction, and highlights the potential importance of this interaction in the etiology of, and in driving the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease...|$|E
