25|$|In 2008, {{a report}} on the amount of public benefit {{hospitals}} returned to the community, released by the Montana Attorney General's office, said that Benefis ranked eighth out of 11 hospitals in the state. The report said Benefis received $7.5 million in tax breaks in 2006, but donated less than $4.7 million in charity care. Benefis disagreed with the report, noting that the document says the company broke even <b>on</b> <b>Medicaid</b> but that the hospital actually lost $3.2 million on providing the service. If the correct figure were used, Benefis officials said, the health system would have ranked fifth.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} 2003 {{emergency}} revision budget, Medicaid funding, which {{was responsible for}} more than one-fourth of all state spending and which had been growing rapidly, was targeted for cuts in the 2004 budget. In addition to proposing reductions in payments to hospitals and nursing homes for care of Medicaid patients, and restrictions <b>on</b> <b>Medicaid</b> patients' access to prescription drugs and eligibility for nursing homes admission, Romney proposed that the low-income Medicaid patients be charged monthly fees {{for participation in the}} program, along with co-payments for visits to doctors' offices. The 2004 budget also incorporated further cuts in funding for higher education. Public colleges and universities responded to funding cuts during Romney's tenure by raising mandatory fees 63percent. Most other areas of state government were budgeted to receive approximately 5percent less funding on average.|$|E

Using data on credit offers and pricing, we document that improvements in households' financial health led to better terms for available credit valued at $520 million per year.

2500|$|A report {{published}} by Health Canada in 2008 included statistics on self-reported wait times for diagnostic services. The median wait time for diagnostic {{services such as}} MRI and CAT scans is two weeks with 89.5% waiting less than 3 months. [...] The median wait {{time to see a}} special physician is a little over four weeks with 86.4% waiting less than 3 months. The median wait time for surgery is a little over four weeks with 82.2% waiting less than 3 months. In the U.S., patients <b>on</b> <b>Medicaid,</b> the low-income government programs, can wait three months or more to see specialists. Because Medicaid payments are low, some have claimed that some doctors {{do not want to see}} Medicaid patients. For example, in Benton Harbor, Michigan, specialists agreed to spend one afternoon every week or two at a Medicaid clinic, which meant that Medicaid patients had to make appointments not at the doctor's office, but at the clinic, where appointments had to be booked months in advance. A 2009 study found that on average the wait in the United States to see a medical specialist is 20.5 days.|$|E
2500|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, 59.3% of U.S. {{citizens}} {{have health insurance}} related to employment, 27.8% have government-provided health-insurance; nearly 9% purchase health insurance directly (there is some overlap in these figures), and 15.3% (45.7 million) were uninsured in 2007. An estimated 25 percent of the uninsured are eligible for government programs but unenrolled. About {{a third of the}} uninsured are in households earning more than $50,000 annually. [...] A 2003 report by the Congressional Budget Office found that many people lack health insurance only temporarily, such as after leaving one employer and before a new job. The number of chronically uninsured (uninsured all year) was estimated at between 21 and 31 million in 1998. Another study, by the Kaiser Commission <b>on</b> <b>Medicaid</b> and the Uninsured, estimated that 59 percent of uninsured adults have been uninsured for at least two years. One indicator of the consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study in Health Affairs that concluded that half of personal bankruptcies involved medical bills. Although other sources dispute this, it is possible that medical debt is the principal cause of bankruptcy in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for Reason {{magazine}} in February 2011, Damon Root expressed {{the opinion that}} Barbour supports farm subsidies, corporate welfare, and eminent domain. When he took office, the state of Mississippi had run a $709million budget deficit for the 2004 fiscal year. With bipartisan support, and without raising taxes, Barbour implemented a plan called [...] to cut the budget deficit in half. He accomplished this largely by reducing spending on social services, most notably Medicaid; the 2005 budget drastically reduced coverage for 65,000 individuals classified as Poverty-Level Aged and Disabled (PLAD), most of whom qualified for the federal Medicare program, and also significantly limited prescription drug coverage. However, the same budget increased the percentage of Medicaid prescriptions that are for generic drugs. In 2005, the state was budgeted to spend a total of $130million less <b>on</b> <b>Medicaid</b> {{than in the previous}} year. This trend continued in the state budget for the 2006 fiscal year. After a long special session, the legislature approved a budget that featured more social service cuts but also increased educational spending. With tax revenues higher than expected during the 2006 fiscal year, {{due in large part to}} increased sales tax revenues in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the state achieved its first balanced budget in years. In the 2008 fiscal year budget, for the first time since its enactment in 1997, the state fully funded the Mississippi Adequate Education Program.|$|E
