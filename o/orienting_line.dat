Suas publicações contribuíram para uma concepção de inteligência que vai além das capacidades lógico-matemática e verbal-lingüística. No desenvolvimento desta teoria, o autor se aprofundou nos estudos da organização {{cerebral}} a partir de achados da psicologia e da neurociência, e estabeleceu a multiplicidade das inteligências, diferenciando-as em oito potenciais: lingüístico, musical, lógico-matemático, espacial, corporal-cinestésico, intrapessoal, interpessoal e naturalista. O reconhecimento do movimento como uma manifestação de inteligência abre possibilidades de novas pesquisas e intervenções na Educação Física. Realizou-se um estudo com o objetivo de verificar quais intervenções pedagógicas contribuem para estimulação das inteligências. Os conhecimentos produzidos na psicologia e na pedagogia referentes ao processo de ensino-aprendizagem, especialmente aqueles relacionados aos princípios interacionistas, expressados nas propostas construtivista e na teoria ?Ensinar para Compreensão?, indicaram pontos importantes para as práticas pedagógicas. Nessa perspectiva, a diversidade e o aumento da complexidade dos conteúdos e o ensino por situações-problema caracterizaram-se como profícuos para estimulação das inteligências. Através de uma pesquisa de campo, com abordagem qualitativa, fez-se uma análise, no interior das escolas públicas, para verificar se os conteúdos e os métodos de ensino, desenvolvidos nas aulas de Educação Física das 5 as séries das escolas estaduais de Marechal Cândido Rondon, Estado do Paraná, estão contribuindo para a estimulação da inteligência corporal cinestésica. A técnica de observação sistemática foi utilizada para o desenvolvimento da pesquisa, seguida da descrição, redução e interpretação das informações coletadas. Chegou-se à conclusão de que os conteúdos tiveram uma diversidade e complexidade limitada, e que, embora tenham favorecido a presença de situações-problema, a intervenção dos professores foi deficitária, não garantido assim a estimulação da inteligência corporal cinestésicaThe present {{work has}} as its <b>orienting</b> <b>line</b> Howard Gardner Multiple Intelligences Theory. This author {{was one of the}} responsible persons for the intelligence concept enlargement. His publications contributed for the intelligence conception that goes beyond the logi. cal-mathematical and verbal-linguistic capacities. In this theory development, the author deepened into cerebral organization studies from Psychology and neuroscience discoveries, and established the intelligence multiplicity, differentiating them into eight potentials: linguistical, musical, logical-mathematical, spacial, corporeal-kinaesthetical, intra and interpersonal and naturalistic. The movement recognition as an intelligence manifestation, opens possibilities of new researches and interventions in Physical Education. It was performed an study with the aim of verifying which pedagogical interventions contribute for the intelligences stimulation. The knowledge produced in Psychology and Pedagogy referring to the teaching- learning process, especially those related to the interactionist principles, expressed at the Constructivist proposals and at the ?Teaching for Comprehension? theory, indicated important points for the pedagogical practices. In this perspective the diversity and increasing contents complexity and the problem-situations teaching, characterized as profitable for the intelligences stimulation. Through a field research, with qualitative approaching, it was made an analysis, in the Public Schools, to verify whether the teaching contents and methods, developed in the 5 th grades of Physical Education classes in Marechal Cândido Rondon State Schools, Paraná State, are contributing for the kinaesthetical corporeal intelligence stimulation. The systematic observation technique was used for the research development, followed by the collected informations description, reduction and interpretation. It was drawn the conclusion that the contents had a limited diversity and complexity, and that, although they had favored the problem-situations presence, the teachers intervention was deficient, so not assuring the Kinaesthetical Corporeal Intelligence stimulatio...|$|E
