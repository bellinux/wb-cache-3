40|$|Tax {{institutions}} {{should be}} construed in a rational manner, in order {{so as to}} not restrict economic turnover excessively. The regulations concerning the possibility to resign from the VAT exemption of sales of residential premises by the developer characterizes by {{the high level of}} formalism which affects in a negative manner the sales process performed by the developer. This paper is devoted to the fragment of the polish Act on the goods and services tax governing the issue of resignation from the VAT exemption of sales of residential premises, which implies in a certain extent to appeal to the regulation of exemptions stipulated in this Act. The subject matter of this analysis is to examine the correctness of transposition of the Directive 112 into polish legal system in the field of real estate exemptions from VAT, the conditions for exercising the <b>optional</b> <b>exemption,</b> as well as the benefit of the resignation from the VAT exemption by the taxpayer...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates {{whether and}} how {{managerial}} incentives influence the decision to elect <b>optional</b> <b>exemptions</b> when first adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It also examines the value-relevance of the mandatory and optional equity adjustments that must {{be recognized as a}} result of the first-time adoption of IFRS. Both questions are addressed in the context of the mandatory adoption of IFRS by French firms in 2005. Three major findings emerge from our analyses. First, managerial incentives influence the decision to strategically elect one or more <b>optional</b> <b>exemptions</b> at the transition date. Second, mandatory equity adjustments are more valued than French GAAP equity, suggesting that the first-time adoption of IFRS by French firms is perceived as a signal of an increase in the quality of their financial statements. Third, the value-relevance of optional IFRS equity adjustments depends on whether they result in the disclosure of new information...|$|R
40|$|More than 100 {{countries}} around the world currently require or permit International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) reporting in 2009. When U. S. companies convert from U. S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U. S. GAAP) to IFRS, they are faced with great challenges as well as opportunities to make choices on financial reporting policies. A survey of leading European pharmaceutical companies that used U. S. GAAP prior to the IFRS adoption was conducted to evaluate their first-time adoption of IFRS practices. The survey results are structured into three aspects and discussed in this thesis. First, IFRS 1 <b>optional</b> <b>exemptions</b> at transition date. Second, key accounting differences from IFRS to U. S. GAAP reconciliation, and the third, choices of alternative accounting methods allowed by IFRS. U. S. pharmaceutical companies can learn from these results to choose IFRS 1 <b>optional</b> <b>exemptions</b> to their best interest, to prepare reconciliation between U. S. GAAP and IFRS and to make accounting choices under IFRS for their first time adoption of IFRS. These results not only provide benchmark information, but also provide U. S. companies a cost-effective pathway i...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{include three}} essays {{regarding}} earnings forecasts, the DuPont analysis and tax expense, all using mandatory International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption in Canada as a setting. In the first essay entitled “DuPont Analysis, Earnings Persistence and Return on Equity: Evidence from Mandatory IFRS Adoption in Canada”, I propose four new models to forecast one-year-ahead {{return on equity}} and change in return on equity based on prior research in the DuPont analysis and earnings persistence. I also examine whether the persistence of return on equity has improved since Canadian companies adopted IFRS in 2011. In the second essay entitled “Information Content of Tax Expense and the Effect of IFRS Adoption on Tax Expense”, I examine the information content of tax expense about future profitability {{and the effect of}} IFRS adoption on tax expense. Prior studies (Lev and Nissim, 2004; Hanlon, 2005; Schmidt, 2006; Ayers et al., 2009) use estimated taxable income, book-tax differences and effective tax rates to investigate the relation between income taxes and future earnings. However, those estimated proxies contain measurement errors and might distort the relationship among variables. Tax expense including current, deferred and other income taxes is directly derived from a Compustat account with no estimation error. The main analysis and robustness tests show that tax expense contains more incremental information content about future profitability beyond pre-tax book income than estimated taxable income. In the third essay entitled “Impact of IFRS Adoption, Value Relevance and Industry Effects: A Canadian Study”, I propose a new comparability index to examine the impact of IFRS adoption on the financial statements of firms from different industries. The study demonstrates that deemed cost of property, plant and equipment is the <b>optional</b> <b>exemption</b> that caused the most discrepancy among first-time IFRS adopters; and that only transitional adjustments related to income accounts are value relevant...|$|E
