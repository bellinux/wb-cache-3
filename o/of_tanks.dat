5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet <b>of</b> <b>tanks</b> to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine {{and the introduction of}} a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton tactical nuclear missile launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher.|$|E
40|$|Adaptor {{proteins}} allow {{temporal and}} spatial coordination of signalling. In this study, we show SUMOylation of the adaptor protein TANK and its interacting kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK 1). Modification <b>of</b> <b>TANK</b> by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) at the evolutionarily conserved Lys 282 is triggered by the kinase activities of IjB kinase e (IKKe) and TBK 1. Stimulation of TLR 7 leads to inducible SUMOylation <b>of</b> <b>TANK,</b> which in turn weakens the interaction with IKKe and thus relieves the negative function <b>of</b> <b>TANK</b> on signal propagation. Reconstitu-tion experiments show that an absence <b>of</b> <b>TANK</b> SUMOylation impairs inducible expression of distinct TLR 7 -dependent target genes, providing a molecular mechanism that allows the control <b>of</b> <b>TANK</b> function...|$|R

5|$|On D-Day, the {{untested}} 29th Infantry Division, {{along with}} nine companies of U.S. Army Rangers redirected from Pointe du Hoc, were to assault the western {{half of the}} beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half.

5|$|The 48th Panzer Corps {{had fewer}} than 100 {{serviceable}} modern tanks to combat Soviet armor. Furthermore, they lacked fuel, and the shortage <b>of</b> <b>tanks</b> forced commanders to organize tank crews into infantry companies; the 22nd Panzer Division, which formed {{part of the}} corps, was almost completely destroyed in the fighting that ensued. The 22nd had entered the fighting with fewer than thirty working tanks, and left with a company <b>of</b> <b>tanks.</b> The Romanian 1st Armored Division, attached to the 48th Panzer Corps, engaged the Soviet 26th Tank Corps after having lost communications with their German corps commanders, and were defeated by 20 November. As the Soviets continued to advance southwards, many Soviet tank crews began to suffer from the worsening blizzard, which affected men and equipment, and blocked gunsights. It was not uncommon for tanks to lose traction on the ground, and for a crew member to have an arm broken as he was thrown around inside the hull. However, the blizzard also neutralized the German corps' coordination.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians {{proceeded}} {{to clear the}} bunkers. They utilized flamethrower teams, which had a visible psychological impact on the fort's garrison. At one point, the Egyptians, {{with the help of}} a wounded Israeli prisoner, managed to secure a bunker by convincing the panicked Israelis inside to come out and surrender. Soon after losing contact with the fort, the Israelis attempted to reach it once more. By this time, Malhov was dead. A group <b>of</b> <b>tanks</b> from Baluza advanced to Lahtzanit, but the Sa'iqa company occupying the firing ramp managed to destroy two tanks, forcing the remainder to retreat. Another group <b>of</b> <b>tanks</b> and half-tracks tried to break through the southern isolation force, but were ambushed and withdrew after losing a tank.|$|E
