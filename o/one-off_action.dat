50|$|Disaster risk {{reduction}} (DRR) is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing {{and reducing the}} risks of disaster. It aims to reduce socio-economic vulnerabilities to disaster as well as dealing with the environmental and other hazards that trigger them. Here it has been strongly influenced by the mass of research on vulnerability that has appeared in print since the mid-1970s. It {{is the responsibility of}} development and relief agencies alike. It should {{be an integral part of}} the way such organizations do their work, not an add-on or <b>one-off</b> <b>action.</b> DRR is very wide-ranging: Its scope is much broader and deeper than conventional emergency management. There is potential for DRR initiatives in just about every sector of development and humanitarian work.|$|E
50|$|Charities {{have always}} relied upon {{individuals}} {{to help raise}} money for them. These people use many methods, such as collecting cash in boxes or tins, sponsored tasks, organising events and collecting from the attendees, or visiting people at their homes and asking for a donation. Volunteers may contribute {{just a few hours}} as a <b>one-off</b> <b>action</b> or work regularly for a charity for many years. There are examples of dedicated individuals raising enormous sums for their favourite charity, just in their spare time. However, by nature this is an unreliable way for major charitable organisations to source their funds. If charities were forced to manage on spontaneous donations alone, many would have to scale down their operations considerably and some would not function at all.|$|E
40|$|Public-private {{partnership}} (PPP) projects form {{a relatively}} new dimension of funding and implementation of public services. In just a few decades since their inception in the United Kingdom, PPP projects have spread to other highly developed economies and developing countries have tried to implement this concept as well. The concept of Public-private partnership (PPP) and its benefits and potential risks are explained through literature research. From {{the study of the}} risks involved I derived demands on the institutional environment that would minimize them. Follows an assessment of the condition of the institutional environment of the Czech Republic and its comparison with other countries. The current situation in the country is so inhospitable to this type of delivery of public services that the promotion of its implementation would, with a high probability, be associated with waste of public resources and delays in the implementation. The institutional environment of the Czech Republic appears to be problematic in terms of corruption, transparency, law, the state of public finances, existence of institutions and government support. At the same time by their very nature, many of these unfavorable parameters of the institutional environment cannot be changed with any <b>one-off</b> <b>action,</b> therefore it wouldn't be useful to try to determine the potential horizon of the Czech Republic's readiness to implement the concept of Public-private partnership...|$|E
30|$|The first {{oil price}} crisis in 1973 changed the {{migration}} regime and outlook, as large-scale labor recruitment was abruptly stopped and never resumed. Furthermore, {{over the next}} 10  years or so, a number of <b>one-off</b> <b>actions</b> were initiated in some countries to induce temporary migrants to return home voluntarily. For those (and the majority) who decided to stay on, family unification became important and dominant in the migration flows. In addition, a constant flow of labor migrants continued on all corridors at a lower scale. The data indicate larger gross flows of immigration and return migration, with net flows partly negative for Austria and Germany in recent years.|$|R
40|$|This {{communication}} has a dual objective. Its first {{aim is to}} set out {{the different}} solutions by means of which we have integrated electronic records into the general record management system of the Department of Culture. The second is to calculate the savings resulting from some of these solutions. The Central Archives of the Department of Culture of the Generalitat de Catalunya (the Government of Catalonia) (illustration 1) has been employing, since 1991, a records management system (SGDA) which pursues the task of integrating the management of records, irrespective of their media or format. On {{the basis of the}} experience presented at the last Forum on machine-readable records, we have continued to develop the system and, above all, to link together individual <b>one-off</b> <b>actions</b> with the aim of achieving a genuinely integrated management system...|$|R
40|$|The Great Recession has {{severely}} {{tested the}} strength of state finances and the soundness of state budget practices. Quarterly state tax revenues have declined year-over-year for a record five quarters, from {{the fourth quarter of}} 2008 through the fourth quarter of 2009. 1 The depth of decline is also unprecedented, with a 16. 5 percent drop {{in the second quarter of}} 2009. An immediate consequence is that states are facing massive fiscal shortfalls, triggering rounds of tax increases and service cuts, plus reliance on federal stimulus money, reserves, <b>one-off</b> <b>actions,</b> and borrowing against the future. The Third District states (Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) have been similarly affected. Examining how each state is coping with the worst fiscal crisis of the last half-century sheds light on their respective fiscal practices and raises questions for further research. This report describes the scope of each state’s fiscal problems, including current and projected budget gaps, the effect of stimulus funding, and anticipated state-level policy responses. Key findings from this report include: Budget gap estimates for Third District states vary significantly on a percentage-of-budget basis. The District’s aggregate gap is virtually identical to the national aggregate in FY 2009 and FY 2010, and somewhat smaller in FY 2011 than nationally. Federal stimulus funding has reduced, but not eliminated, state budget gaps...|$|R
