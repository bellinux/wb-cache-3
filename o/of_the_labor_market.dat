5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} for the failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, {{the ranks of the}} unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{the ratio}} of female to male workers {{in the labor force}} is the {{percentage}} of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers {{as a percentage of the}} total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market</b> has low-wage {{labor markets}} characterized as monopsonistic competition wherein buyers (employers) have significantly more market power than do sellers (workers). This monopsony {{could be a}} result of intentional collusion between employers, or naturalistic factors such as segmented markets, search costs, information costs, imperfect mobility and the personal element of labor markets. In such a case a simple supply and demand graph would not yield the quantity of labor clearing and the wage rate. This is because while the upward sloping aggregate labor supply would remain unchanged, instead of using the upward labor supply curve shown in a supply and demand diagram, monopsonistic employers would use a steeper upward sloping curve corresponding to marginal expenditures to yield the intersection with the supply curve resulting in a wage rate lower than would be the case under competition. Also, the amount of labor sold would also be lower than the competitive optimal allocation.|$|E
25|$|One {{could even}} {{say that in the}} years before 1780 the {{prospects}} of the economy were improving: because of the economic growth in the German hinterland there were possibilities of growth in distributional trade in colonial commodities, and industrial products (Dutch or other European). Such possibilities were indeed realized in the 20th century, when the Netherlands again became a major distributional hub. The agricultural sector still enjoyed high productivity, whereas the nearby British markets for dairy products and produce offered opportunities for increased exports (which were indeed soon realized). Only, the high-cost structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market,</b> high taxes, structural overvaluation of the guilder, all militated against most forms of industrial production, let alone export industries. Without the necessary reforms to remedy these problems the Netherlands were unlikely to participate in the industrial renaissance that Great Britain, and later other neighboring countries, started to experience {{in the latter part of}} the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|One {{historical}} {{problem with}} the U.S. system was known as job lock, in which people become tied to their jobs for fear of losing their health insurance. This reduces the flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>market.</b> Federal legislation passed since the mid-1980s, particularly COBRA and HIPAA, has been aimed at reducing job lock. However, providers of group health insurance in many states are permitted to use experience rating and it remains legal in the United States for prospective employers to investigate a job candidate's health and past health claims {{as part of a}} hiring decision. Someone who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, for example, may face job lock not out of fear of losing their health insurance, but based on prospective employers not wanting to add the cost of treating that illness to their own health insurance pool, for fear of future insurance rate increases. Thus, being diagnosed with an illness can cause someone to be forced to stay in their current job.|$|E

500|$|The gender {{wage gap}} is a {{possible}} consequence of occupational segregation. The gender wage gap is the [...] "difference between wages earned by women and men".

Additionally, the narrowing of the gender wage gap {{may be attributed to}} a decrease in men's wages instead of an increase in women's wages. [...] "The persistent gender wage gap across regions may reflect a number of factors, including women's continued disadvantage in terms of education and skills; their lack of an organized voice and bargaining power; gender-specific constraints on their labour market mobility; and their relatively high involvement in part-time or temporary jobs."

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to examine <b>the</b> {{efficiency}} <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> for workers with different levels of educational achievement in Indonesian manufacturing plants in 1996. Specifically, the paper asks (1) are earnings for more educated workers higher than for less educated workers, and (2) do earnings differentials between more educated workers and less educated workers reflect corresponding productivity differentials? The empirical findings suggest that more educated production workers earned more than less educated workers. However, the results suggest that the earnings differentials between more and less educated workers were smaller than corresponding differentials in marginal products for production workers. This finding implies that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>markets</b> examined were not perfectly competitive.
