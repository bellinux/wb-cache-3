5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team <b>owners</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field. He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player strikes, and the modern league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
5|$|In January 1915, Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston {{agreed to}} {{purchase}} the New York Yankees of the American League. As part of the agreement, the other team <b>owners</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American League agreed to help the Yankees restock their system with prospects. One of the deals Ruppert and Huston negotiated was their purchase of Pipp. After the purchase was completed, all owners, {{with the exception of}} Frank Navin, the owner of the Tigers, broke their word. On February 4, 1915, the Tigers sold Pipp and outfielder Hugh High to the Yankees, receiving $5,000 for each player ($ in current dollar terms).|$|E

For example, the Crown Estate produced £200million in the financial year 2007–8, whereas reported parliamentary funding for the monarch was £40million during the same period.|$|E
5|$|Utica's main daily {{newspaper}} is the Observer-Dispatch; the Utica Phoenix, established in 2002, is an alternative. The city has 26 FM {{radio stations and}} nine AM stations.

5|$|A {{proposed}} {{part of the}} regeneration is {{an extension}} of the London Underground to serve the area. Although the site is close to Battersea Park and Queenstown Road stations, it appears to be considered that trains from these stations to Victoria and Waterloo respectively are already heavily loaded. The proposed 2-mile tunnelled extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea. The proposed extension would cost at least £500 million in 2008 terms before inflation and optimism bias (extra contingency amounts) and would be part funded by REO and, possibly, other significant land <b>owners</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nine Elms area. The 2010 planning consent for the site includes a phased contribution of approximately £200 million to the Underground extension, which adds another financial hurdle to the many difficulties in developing the site.|$|E

5|$|During {{the medieval}} period, {{most of the}} land was used for growing crops and raising {{livestock}} such as cattle. The produce from arable farming would have been sufficient to support the local population, but the cattle would have been sold to the ruling classes. Agriculture provided the main source of employment for Sale's residents until the mid-19th century. Industry was slow to develop in the area, as in most of what would become Trafford. This was partly because of the reluctance of the two main land <b>owners</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, the Stamfords and the de Traffords, to invest. Although weaving was common in Sale during the late 17th and early 18th century, by 1851 only 4% of the population was employed in that industry.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent {{as it did in the}} rest of Greater Manchester. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land <b>owners</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E
5|$|In 1574 {{the house}} was owned by George Perceval, the father of Richard Percivale {{who was born in}} the house and later deciphered Spanish {{documents}} for Queen Elizabeth about the Spanish Armada. Later <b>owners</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th and 17th centuries included the local member of parliament Richard Cole and Nathaniel Wade who was condemned to death for his part in the Monmouth Rebellion. After 1795 a series of owners, who never lived in the house, leased it for use as a farmhouse and it fell into disrepair. In 1906 it was bought by Charles Edward Evans who undertook a major restoration project including bringing in materials from surrounding Tudor manors. After World War II it was converted into flats and in the 1990s into five private dwellings.|$|E

5|$|Omaha {{arrived at}} Port of Spain, on 17 November 1941, with Odenwald flying the German flag on the mast with the US flag flying over it. It {{was not until}} 30 April 1947, that a case was brought by Odenwalds <b>owners</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> District Court for Puerto Rico, against the US. Their claim stated that because {{a state of war}} between the United States and Germany did not exist at the time of capture the vessel could not be taken as a prize or bounty. The court however, given the fact that Odenwald was rescued from sinking by the US crew, {{declared}} that the seizing of the ship was defined as a legal salvage operation. The US was awarded the profits that were made from Odenwald and her cargo. All the men of the original boarding party received $3,000 each, {{while the rest of the}} crewmen in Omaha and Somers, at the time, were entitled to two months' pay and allowances. The laws have since been revised, making this the last time that US Navy members received such an award.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} Turkey in March 2012, with filming {{reported}} to be continuing until 6 May. Production was expected to take three months in the country. Adana stands in for the outskirts of Istanbul in the film. A group of Turkish teenagers infiltrated a closed set in a railway sidings in Adana to film rehearsals of a fight scene {{on top of a}} train before being caught by security. The train scene depicted in trailers showed the Varda Viaduct outside Adana. Bond stunt double Andy Lister dived backwards off the 300-foot drop for the scene. A crane was set up on a train carriage to hold a safety line. Parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Grand Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—were closed for filming in April. Store <b>owners</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affected areas were reportedly allowed to open their shops, but were not allowed to conduct business, instead being paid TRY750 ($418) per day as compensation. Production faced criticism for allegedly damaging buildings while filming a motorcycle chase across rooftops in the city. Michael G. Wilson denied these claims, pointing out that the film crew had removed sections of rooftops before filming began and replaced them with replicas {{for the duration of the}} shoot; when filming finished, the original rooftops would be restored. The production team negotiated with 613 part owners of the Calis Beach in Fethiye, to film along the coastline.|$|E
