5|$|Outside their tree house, Finn and Jake snooze, while BMO (Niki Yang) and N.E.P.T.R. (Andy Milonakis) {{play out}} a spoof of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham. The two break open Finn and Jake's {{treasure}} room, pouring their massive stash of gold <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> {{as well as}} the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant (Steve Agee). BMO talks Finn into spending the money at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom. When they arrive in the town square, Jake unloads their treasure into the city's fountain. A guard scolds them for this, but they bribe him with a few shillings and a crown, freeing them from the law. Chaos follows shortly after Jake uses wealth to control the residents. When they disrespect her authority, Wildberry Princess (Maria Bamford) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and for their money to be seized and melted down. Her punishment is for them to be covered in the molten gold, but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two.|$|E
5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for {{a maximum of}} 5 hours. Inmates who worked {{seven days a week}} in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E
25|$|Having said that, {{he moves}} the log a little forward and throws a coin into the fire. The {{woman of the}} house puts a woolen blanket on the polazniks back, and seats him on a low stool by the fireplace. In {{the moment when he}} sits down, they try to pull away the stool beneath him, as if to make him fall on the floor. The polaznik goes <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> and throws grain inside a circle made with the rope with which Christmas straw has been tied, calling chickens. When they gather in the circle he catches a rooster, whose head is then cut off by him or the head of {{household}} on the house's threshold. The rooster will be roasted on a wooden spit as part of Christmas dinner. The polaznik usually stays for dinner with the family. He receives a gift {{in the form of a}} round cake with an embedded coin, and a towel, shirt, socks, or some other useful thing.|$|E
60|$|Maraton laughed {{softly as}} they passed <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Palace <b>yard.</b>|$|R
60|$|When breakfast was over, and Alvina {{had gone}} to her room, Geoffrey went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>yard,</b> where <b>the</b> {{bicycles}} stood.|$|R
6000|$|NICOLA (quickly). My {{word for}} it, Louka, the war's over. Off {{with you and}} get some fresh coffee. (He runs <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stable <b>yard.)</b> ...|$|R
500|$|In Greece, a {{large log}} was lit on the hearth on Christmas Eve and kept burning or {{smoldering}} through the Twelve Days of Christmas. This was {{done as a}} protection against the demons called Kallikantzaroi, believed to be emerging from their dens at night during that period to attack people and damage their property. The fire and smoke from the log was thought to prevent the Kallikantzaroi from entering the house down the chimney. The ritual burning of logs on the Eve was also carried out in Albania. When the buzm, as the log was called there, {{was about to be}} brought into the house, {{a member of the family}} would go <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> shout the name of the household's head, and proclaim that the buzm was coming and bringing all kinds of delicious things. The head of the household would respond by saying [...] "You are welcome!" [...] and the buzm would be ceremonially brought in, greeted by the family and treated with great respect. The log would be placed on the hearth, and often a significant part of all food and drink in the house would be put on the log and burned together with it.|$|E
2500|$|Once the badnjak {{and straw}} {{have been taken}} into the house, the Christmas Eve dinner may begin. The head of {{household}} makes the Sign of the Cross, lights a candle, and censes the whole house. In some regions it is a custom that he then goes <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> calls by name pest animals (e.g. wolves, foxes, and hawks) and his personal enemies, inviting them, [...] "Come to dinner now and again in a year, God willing." [...] This is intended to protect the household from them for a year.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{women were}} thought to be able to {{eliminate}} the danger from destructive weather. This was the case with Stana Tomić, a healer from Jarmenovci in the municipality of Topola. Her fellow villagers held her in high esteem and claimed that she saved Jarmenovci from hail many times. At the sight of hail clouds, she would place the dining table at the center of her house, before putting on it a piece of bread, salt, and the lighted candle that had been used during the celebration of the slava. She would then go <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> and shout: [...] "ORadomir, hanged man, lead the kolo around. Turn those white cattle back there, do not let them come here. Here is a bigger prodigy: a girl of seven years old bore a child, wrapped it in silken diapers, bound it with a silken ribbon. Do not let harm come to our vineyards, do not let harm come to our fruitful fields." [...] In 1956, when this was recorded, Stana had been protecting Jarmenovci in this way for thirty years. In the regions of Takovo and Užice, people claimed that some villages had never been ravaged by hail, because in each of them there was a woman that prevented it.|$|E
60|$|When I went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front <b>yard</b> I found Mr. Poplington and Jone {{sitting on}} a little stone bench, for they was tired, and I told them about that young woman and Davy.|$|R
6000|$|The San Saba {{lobby and}} its protégé {{stumbled}} awkwardly down <b>the</b> stairs and <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Capitol <b>yard.</b> Then they herded closely and gave one yell of triumph. But one of them--Buck-Kneed Summers it was--hit the key with the thoughtful remark: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] the old {{man said}} to Frank, [...] "you can take these <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>yard</b> and skin them. Then you can go to work in that back room. You will find arsenical soap, cotton wool, wires, and {{everything}} else you require there. This has been a fine cat," [...] he said, looking at the animal.|$|R
60|$|The {{two young}} men passed downstairs together, and the guardsman {{followed}} the American <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|E
60|$|With {{laughing}} {{wonder the}} women-folk flocked <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> Mescal hung back shy-eyed, roses dyeing the brown of her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|And undaunted by the blacksmith's manner, Matt marched <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> and untied Billy, who {{was covered}} with sweat, and still {{trembling}} from fright.|$|E
60|$|At {{last they}} grew sleepy, {{and the men}} went out and brought in bundles of sweet rush, and spread them against the wall, and {{prepared}} to lie down, each his weapon by his side. And when they were lain down, Hereward beckoned to him Perry and Martin Lightfoot, and went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>yard,</b> under <b>the</b> pretence of seeing to his horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll show him," [...] {{shouted the}} man with the black beard, and {{suddenly}} a steel barrel shone over the policeman's shoulder, and five bullets had followed one another <b>into</b> <b>the</b> twilight whence the missile had come. As he fired, {{the man with}} the beard moved his hand in a horizontal curve, so that his shots radiated <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> narrow <b>yard</b> like spokes from a wheel.|$|R
6000|$|On Mr. Hubbell's {{remarking}} {{that the}} cat was not tormented, [...] "she was instantly lifted from the floor to a height of five feet, and then dropped on Esther's back. [...] . I never saw any cat more frightened; she ran <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front <b>yard,</b> where she remained for the balance (rest) of the day." [...] On 27th June [...] "a trumpet was heard in the house all day".|$|R
60|$|While {{the girls}} were putting away the supper dishes, the young man lured Daddy <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> for a wrestling-match, but some others objected.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come in,' said Quilp, {{without getting}} off the desk. 'Come in. Stay. Just look <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> and see whether there's a boy {{standing}} on his head.' ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he stepped}} <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> next morning that abominable, sickening, scrawling {{advertisement}} {{was the first}} thing that claimed his glance-it blotted out the beauty of the morning.|$|E
60|$|At {{first they}} would not hear of this, and haggled and bargained with the man, but he stuck {{to what he had}} said, and the people were forced to give him the hand-mill. When the man came <b>out</b> again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> he asked <b>the</b> old wood-cutter how he was to stop the hand-mill, and when he had learned that, he thanked him and set off home with all the speed he could, but did not get there until after the clock had struck twelve on Christmas Eve.|$|R
60|$|Mark went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{house and}} ordered lunch. It {{would not have}} done to have asked any more {{questions}} or to have shown any special interest in the matter, but he felt so excited that he could not have avoided doing so had he waited longer with the ostler. After he had finished his meal he strolled <b>out</b> again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stable <b>yard.</b>|$|R
60|$|On Lightfoot struggled. At last he felt bottom {{beneath his}} feet. He {{staggered}} up through some bushes {{along the bank}} and then for an instant {{it seemed to him}} his heart stopped beating. Right in front of him stood a man. He had come <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>yard</b> of <b>the</b> home of that man. It is doubtful which was the more surprised, Lightfoot or the man. Right then and there Lightfoot gave up in despair. He couldn't run. It was all he could do to walk. The long chase by the hounds {{on the other side of}} the Big River and the long swim across the Big River had taken all his strength.|$|R
60|$|They {{lifted the}} box and carried it <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> There a number of {{visitors}} gathered around to watch proceedings, two holding up lanterns to illuminate the scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jerry," [...] said Richard, as {{they walked}} <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> {{together}} to get the Castle Richmond pony, [...] "does they often thry to make a Prothestant of you now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|After tea, Oliver and Rollo went <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> to {{feel the}} air, and judge of the {{impression}} the night would probably make upon [...] "Iceberg Castle" [...] and its inhabitants.|$|E
60|$|After firing two {{or three}} shots each, the Indians {{appeared}} {{to be of the}} same opinion, and resumed their paddles; but they had lost so much ground that the canoe they were in chase of shot <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lake fifty <b>yards</b> ahead of <b>the</b> nearest. Some more shots were fired, and then the Indians began hastily to throw the fish, with which their canoes were laden, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water. After paddling {{two or three}} hundred yards farther, Nat laid in his paddle.|$|R
50|$|McMinnimee, {{who lives}} in a cabin alone with his German Shepherd Shazah, soon learns of the wild dog and returns to his home. When a storm hit the island one evening, Shazah starts up a riot and tries to break out. The old man, armed with his rifle, opens the door to his cabin and tries to find out who is intruding onto his property. Shazah bolts <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front <b>yard,</b> but is {{suddenly}} attacked by the golden-haired mongrel and several other feral dogs. McMinnimee is too late to save his dog from the pack, though he manages to shoot and kill a collie, one of the pack members. As he tries to secure the door and windows to his house, the dogs break through one of the windows and attack the old man, killing him.|$|R
60|$|The {{great room}} was, {{as its name}} indicated, quite large, occupying a {{considerable}} portion of the lower floor of the farmer's house. There was a very spacious fireplace in one side, with a settle, which was a long seat, with a very high back, near it. The room was used both for kitchen and parlor, {{and there was a}} great variety of furniture in different parts of it. There were chairs and tables, a bookcase with a desk below, a loom in one corner by a window, and a spinning-wheel near it. Then, there were a great many doors. One led <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>yard,</b> one up stairs, one into a back room,--which was used for coarse work, and which was generally called <b>the</b> kitchen,--and one <b>into</b> a large store closet adjoining the great room.|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} door leading <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> {{explaining}} {{that he did not}} want to take chances of Mercedes's presence becoming known to neighbors. Then he went to the patio and called.|$|E
60|$|After this, Rollo took James and Nathan <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> {{to see if}} some beans {{had come}} up, {{which he had been}} {{planting}} in a sunny corner of the garden the day before.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} twelve o'clock when Rollo and Mr. George, having {{finished}} their dinner, came <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> {{of the inn}} {{for the purpose of}} setting out for the ascent of the mountain.|$|E
6000|$|All along {{there had}} been a certain love of the {{marvelous}} at the bottom of his fancy for inventions. Therefore, though he did not in the least believe in ghosts, he would [...] "investigate" [...] spiritualism, and part with innumerable guineas to mediums, slatewriters, clairvoyants, and even of turbaned rascals from the East, who would boldly offer at midnight to bring him <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back <b>yard</b> and there and then raise the devil for him. And just as his tendency was to magnify the success and utility of his patent purchases, so he would lend himself more or less to gross impostures simply because they interested him. This confirmed his reputation for being a bit of a crank; and as he had in addition all the restlessness and eccentricity of the active spirits of his class, arising from the fact that no matter what he busied himself with, it never really mattered whether he accomplished it or not, he remained an unsatisfied and (considering the money he cost) unsatisfactory specimen of a true man in a false position.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a single}} window in our cell, which {{was too small to}} admit a child. It was further defended by a thick iron bar in the centre. It was not a very {{promising}} point of escape, as you will allow, but I became more and more convinced that our efforts must be directed towards it. To make matters worse, it only led <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> exercise <b>yard,</b> which was surrounded by two high walls. Still, as I said to my sullen comrade, it is time to talk of the Vistula when you are over the Rhine. I got a small piece of iron, therefore, from the fittings of my bed, and I set to work to loosen the plaster at the top and the bottom of the bar. Three hours I would work, and then leap into my bed upon the sound of the warder's step. Then another three hours, and then very often another yet, for I found that Beaumont was so slow and clumsy at it that it was on myself only that I could rely.|$|R
2500|$|The MBTA {{also started}} [...] "splicing" [...] damaged cars together. Cars 3454 and 3478 had been {{involved}} in a high-speed, rear-end collision. The two ends of the cars that made contact were severely damaged. The MBTA's maintenance crews brought <b>the</b> two cars <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shops, and later car 3478 (consisting of 3478A and 3454B) returned to active duty. Car 3454 (consisting of the damaged 3454A and 3478B) was pushed <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dead storage <b>yard</b> for future disposition. The experience gained in this type of repair laid the ground for several other such cars being returned to revenue service. Eventually, the MBTA's maintenance staff got the active fleet to around 114 cars in the early 1980s.|$|R
