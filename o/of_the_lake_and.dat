5|$|Floating gardens, {{labelled}} the 'Rad' in tye Kashmiri {{language are}} a special {{feature of the}} lake. They basically constitute of matted vegetation and earth, but are floating. These are detached from the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> drawn to a suitable place (generally to the north west of the houseboats' location) and anchored. Given its rich nutrient properties, tomatoes, cucumbers and melons are grown with noteworthy results.|$|E
5|$|Mono Lake {{itself has}} {{its own set of}} activities, {{including}} walking tours among towers of tufa, boat tours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> <b>and</b> birdwatching opportunities. The lake is too salty to support any fish, but fishing is possible in streams that feed Mono Lake. Additional activities include hiking around and on the craters and domes, and mountain biking outside of the Scenic Area boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Bristol Airport is {{approximately}} 10miles (15km) away. The nearest major road is the A368, which {{runs along the}} southern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> provides access from Bath and Weston super Mare. The A37 and A38 are slightly further away, providing access from Bristol. Car parking {{is available at the}} visitor centre and Woodford Lodge, for which a charge is made, and a small amount of parking is available at points around the lake; some of these are restricted to those with fishing permits.|$|E
5|$|For {{safety and}} water quality reasons, the lake has {{different}} zones for different activities. The eastern extremity is zoned for primary contact water activities such as swimming and water skiing. The East and Central Basins, closer to populated areas, are zoned for secondary contact water sports such as sailing or rowing. West Lake and Tarcoola Reach, which covers the area between Commonwealth Avenue and Kurrajong Point, is the primary recreational area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> <b>and</b> both primary and secondary contact water sports are permitted. Yarramundi Reach near Scrivener Dam has a marked rowing course, and is zoned as secondary, although primary contact activities are also allowed.|$|E
5|$|Image Lake is a tarn in Glacier Peak Wilderness, in the North Cascades of Washington, United States. The lake is {{surrounded}} by Plummer Peak to the east, a lookout point to the west, the Miners Creek drainage and Glacier Peak to the south, and Canyon Lake to the north. The course of the popular Miners Ridge Trail skirts the lake.

5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing at the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> then drying out their wings {{in the same way as}} cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, {{due in part to}} the weather station being farther from the moderating influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> also because of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.|$|E
5|$|The Rajput {{rulers of}} Amber, Bundi, Bikaner and Jaisalmer made great efforts {{to restore the}} {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> its surrounding temples.

5|$|Between 1703 and 1753, reducciones were {{established}} at San José and San Andrés on Lake Petén Itzá, Santa Ana just south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> <b>and</b> at San Luis, Santo Toribio and Dolores {{in the south}} (not {{to be confused with}} Dolores del Lakandon). Each of these mission towns had its own minister who answered to the vicario general with the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo. In {{the first decades of the}} 18th century, churches were built in five colonial towns: Dolores, Remedios, San Andrés, San José and Santo Toribio. The church in Dolores was built in 1708; the construction was probably overseen by Juan Antonio Ruiz y Bustamante. In 1699 there were nine priests in Petén but thereafter there was usually a shortage of clergy in colonial Petén. In spite of the objections of the Dominicans who had been working in southern Petén, the Franciscans continued to provide clergy from Yucatán, and it was the Franciscans who oversaw the spiritual welfare of Petén during the colonial period.|$|E
5|$|During the {{campaign}} to conquer the Itza of Petén, the Spanish sent expeditions to harass and relocate the Mopan north of Lake Izabal and the Ch'ol Maya of the Amatique forests to the east. They were resettled in the Colonial reducción of San Antonio de las Bodegas on the south shore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> in San Pedro de Amatique. By {{the latter half of}} the 18th century the indigenous population of these towns had disappeared; the local inhabitants now consisted entirely of Spaniards, mulattos and others of mixed race, all associated with the Castillo de San Felipe de Lara fort guarding the entrance to Lake Izabal. The main cause of the drastic depopulation of Lake Izabal and the Motagua Delta was the constant slave raids by the Miskito Sambu of the Caribbean coast that effectively ended the Maya population of the region; the captured Maya were sold into slavery in the British colony of Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to studies and accounts {{that showed the}} bad condition of the lake, the state restored the fish population of the lake in 1978. In 1985, a study recommended ecological restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> forest, which had been overtaken by invasive species introduced during highway construction. Since then, there have been seven plans for restoring natural elements of the park, as well as three plans for park restoration. Gradual improvements began {{taking place in the}} late 1980s, including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security, as well as the restoration of playgrounds and other recreational facilities. In January 1988, NYC Parks conducted a study to determine the specific elements of the park that needed restoration. Highway structures were also reconfigured to clean runoff from these structures. An excavation in the 1990s yielded over 2,500 artifacts.|$|E
25|$|Over 100 <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds can {{be found}} within the forest varying in size and age. They all provide {{important}} habitats for numerous species of fauna and flora. Many of them are man-made with <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> them created through gravel extraction. Several were formed {{as part of a}} landscape design and a few were <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> World War II bombs and rockets. Activities allowed on the waters include angling which is permitted in 24 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds. A wide range of freshwater fish can be caught. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> <b>and</b> ponds are accessible to the public and are located on or close to forest paths.|$|R

There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75miles (1.2km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter, {{but there is a}} boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.|$|E
5|$|M-64 {{starts at}} the Wisconsin state line north of Presque Isle, Wisconsin, where it runs north as the {{continuation}} of CTHB into the state of Michigan. The trunkline runs through dense forests along the Presque Isle River {{in a rural area}} of Gogebic County; this region {{is a part of the}} Ottawa National Forest. As the highway enters the community of Marenisco, it follows Pine and Fair avenues through town. On the north side of Marenisco, M-64 turns easterly and runs concurrently with US2 for about two miles (3km) including a crossing of the Presque Isle River. East of town, M-64 separates from US2 and turns northeasterly toward the southern end of Lake Gogebic. The road turns north along the western shore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> provides access to Lake Gogebic State Park. About halfway along the lakeshore, the highway crosses into Ontonagon County and from the Central to the Eastern time zone.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of town, M-55 leaves the freeway and turns east again running through the Pere Marquette State Forest along Watergate Road. When the highway meets M-66, M-55 joins M-66 and runs north through farmland. As the two {{highways}} approach Lake City, they run along the shore of Lake Missaukee and through downtown. M-55 turns east again along Houghton Lake Road, separating from M-66 north of the central business district. This section of trunkline passes through mixed farm and wood lands that transitions to mostly forests near Merritt. The road crosses the Muskegon River and follows Lake City Road into the outskirts of Houghton Lake. M-55 passes over the US127 freeway and enters Houghton Lake Heights. There the highway runs southeasterly along the shores of Houghton Lake into downtown Houghton Lake. M-18 briefly joins M-55 through Prudenville on {{the east side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> <b>and</b> M-55 follows West Branch Road as it continues east toward Interstate 75 (I-75).|$|E
