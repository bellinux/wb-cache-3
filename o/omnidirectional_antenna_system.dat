The AM band extended, at that time, from 540 to 1600 kHz, and the theory that an antenna built on the campus of the historic Valparaiso Technical Institute would have better radiation characteristics for a 250-watt daytime station at that frequency was a planned, engineering gamble which resulted in a 312-foot <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>system.</b> Their expertise in electrical engineering of the site bore out this theory when the FCC issued the first permits for pre-sunrise operation at 9.7 watts. In 1984, the FCC issued a post-sunset license to the station for 9.7 watts and an omini-directional pattern. The radiation pattern was so efficient with 9.7 watts, that the signal from the 5/8-wavelength radiator could be heard as far away as Michigan City, Indiana and Merrillville, Indiana at night.|$|E

The program involved {{the tasks of}} antenna analyses by computer techniques, scale model radiation pattern measurements {{of a number of}} antenna systems, full-scale RF measurements, and the recommended design, including detailed drawings. A number of antenna elements were considered: the cavity-backed spiral, quadrifilar helix, and crossed-dipoles were chosen for in-depth studies. The final design consisted of a two-element array of cavity-backed spirals mounted on opposite sides of spacecraft and fed in-phase through a hybrid junction. This antenna system meets the coverage requirement of having a gain of at least minus 10 dBi over 50 percent of a 4 pi steradian sphere with the solar panels in operation. This coverage level is increased if the ground station has the capability to change polarization...|$|E

By knowing the positions of mobiles, a base station can steer the beam, direct and control {{the power of a}} beam towards a single lone mobile or a groups of mobile stations. The system can be implemented using either an adaptive or a switched beam technique. In this project, we develop, simulate and evaluate the SINR and E b /N o performances of an adaptive beam technique in the WCDMA system for downlink with and without power control algorithm.

PtMP communications are very much related to NLOS conditions and low-frequency bands (e.g., sub- 6 GHz) {{and are able to}} overcome signal obstructions. In this case, the PoP acts as a unique data sink and can be equipped with either an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> or a number of directional antennas pointing in different directions, e.g., antenna arrays with static beams, large scale <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> (LSAS) [7]. The latter solution with directional antennas enables the use of higher frequency bands and thus larger bandwidths due to the higher antenna gains, provided that LOS exists. However, the use of an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> at the PoP eases the built-in installation and coordination requirements imposed due to beamforming.|$|R

30|$|In {{most of the}} {{existing}} studies of RSS-based location estimation techniques in the literature, the channel model {{is assumed to be}} known a priori, that is, the path loss characteristics of the coverage area are considered known, either by assuming that the environment is a perfect free space or by extensive measurement and modeling prior to the deployment of location estimation systems. However, the PLE parameter is environment dependent [31, 32]. Even in the same environment, propagation characteristics may change considerably {{over a long period of}} time, e.g., due to seasonal and/or weather changes [33]. In [32], it is experimentally demonstrated in an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> that the PLE is strongly dependent on the base antenna height and the terrain category. Extension of the experimental study in [32] to directional antenna systems can be found in [34] where the authors show that antenna beamwidth has an additional gain reduction influence on the PLE. In other experimental studies that consider path loss modeling for directional antenna systems [35, 36], the authors compute different PLEs for different areas of the cell that consist of different terrains (but not different PLEs for different directional antennas of the same base station). There are also related studies that utilize single PLE for directional antenna systems [37 â€“ 39].|$|E
40|$|Relay {{communication}} systems {{have recently been}} gaining momentum {{as an alternative to}} cellular architectures because of the ability to provide cost-efficient high spectral efficiency communications. The goal of this thesis is to investigate opportunistic relay communication strategies in various network configurations. We derive the outage probability of opportunistic multi-hop multiple relay networks with nodes having single or multiple antennas. The challenge in the analysis of the outage probability are in incorporating realistic channel effects such as path loss, shadowing, and fast fading. With these effects, the outage probability depends on the energy transmitted, and also the shadow fading characteristics. We incorporate the channel dynamics in analyzing opportunistic relay selection schemes and determine the optimal selection period. As an extension of a conventional relay network, we explore a buffer-equipped relay network, where the network allows relays to delay transmission and transmit when the channel conditions are favorable. As a relay selection method, we suggest dual-timer relay selection (DTRS), which adopts the timer algorithm in reception and transmission relay selections. This algorithm reduces channel estimation overhead and solves the full-buffer problem of a reception relay and the empty-buffer problem of a transmission relay in buffer-equipped networks. We further consider a spatial reuse multi-hop relay network, and propose a full spatial reuse multi-hop (FSRM) relay communication scheme, which allows relays to transmit their data using every other time slot. With the FSRM scheme, the end-to-end rate reduction factor of a multi-hop relay communication is fixed at 1 / 2, regardless of the number of hops. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the outage probability of the proposed scheme for a directional antenna system and an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{technologies}} have gained tremendous popularity in recent years, {{resulting in a}} dense deployment of wireless devices in every indoor environment. High densities of wireless devices dramatically increase {{the severity of the}} interference problem in these indoor environments. Existing solutions to this problem, including frequency division, time division, and MIMO spatial multiplexing, all have limitations and cannot fully solve the problem. In this thesis, we show the effectiveness of another solution in mitigating wireless interference in indoor environments: increasing spatial reuse. We explore two techniques: power control and directional transmission. We show in this thesis that both techniques can significantly improve network capacity by allowing simultaneous transmissions. While both power control and directional transmission have been widely used in outdoor scenarios, different solutions are required to meet the new challenges offered by the unique characteristics of the indoor environments, i. e., both APs and clients are chaotically deployed and there are usually multiple RF paths between the AP and the client. There are two challenges in system design, choosing the appropriate power levels / antenna orientations and choosing the right MAC protocol. In this thesis, we first evaluate the benefits, i. e., spatial reuse opportunities, of both directional transmission and power control. Based on this evaluation, we present the motivation, challenges, and design of three systems: 1) Speed, a distributed directional antenna system with both directional APs and clients designed to solve the interference problem in the future due to the highest level of spatial reuse, 2) DIRC, a centralized directional antenna system with directional APs designed for enterprise networks with omnidirectional clients, and 3) an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> with power control, designed to improve spatial reuse of existing omnidirectional nodes. 1...|$|E
