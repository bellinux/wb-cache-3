The only recorded subject for discussion during the following day's meeting was the Cardinal Prefect's earnest call for the founding of a minor seminary in Scandinavia, a matter which the bishops decided to take very seriously in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> difficulties involved.|$|E

25|$|Since the 19th century, {{art historians}} have debated which {{passages}} {{are attributable to}} the little-known and obscure Hubert and which are by Jan, famous across Europe by the early 1430s. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was often assumed that Jan had found a number of random panels left behind after Hubert's death and assembled them into the current format.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of August 19, the Kentuckians reached the Licking River, near a spring and salt lick known as the Lower Blue Licks. A few Indian scouts were seen {{watching}} them from across the river. Behind the scouts was a hill around which the river looped. Todd called a council and asked Daniel Boone, the most experienced woodsman, what he thought. Boone {{said he had been}} growing increasingly suspicious because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> trail the Indians left. He felt the Indians were trying to lead them into an ambush.|$|E
25|$|An {{obvious way}} to {{generate}} permutations of n is to generate {{values for the}} Lehmer code (possibly using the factorial number system representation of integers up to n!), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires n operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> representations of the sequence as an array or a linked list, both require (for different reasons) about n2/4 operations to perform the conversion. With n likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is needed) that is not {{too much of a}} problem, {{but it turns out that}} both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better. For this reason it does not seem useful, although certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that would allow performing the conversion from Lehmer code to permutation in O(n log n) time.|$|E

500|$|Shockingly, Fischer played 29...Bxh2?, a {{move that}} few players would {{consider}} in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> 30.g3, trapping the bishop. In exchange for the lost bishop, Black is only able to obtain two pawns (see chess piece relative value). Gligorić, Kasparov and other commentators have suggested that Fischer may have miscalculated, having planned 30...h5 31.Ke2 h4 32.Kf3 h3 33.Kg4 Bg1, but overlooking that 34.Kxh3 Bxf2 35.Bd2 keeps the bishop trapped. Anatoly Karpov suggested that Spassky was afraid of Fischer and wanted {{to show that he}} could draw with the white pieces, while Fischer wanted to disprove that as the game headed for a stale draw. Owing to unusual features in the position, Fischer had good drawing chances despite having only two pawns for the bishop. However, the position became hopeless after he made at least one more bad move before the adjournment, which took place after move 40. Fischer could still have drawn the game with the correct 39th or 40th move. He resigned on move 56.|$|E

500|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> {{sources for}} Waffen-SS {{manpower}} was the nearly 40,000 {{troops of the}} SS-TV regiments, which consisted of youths below conscription age for the Wehrmacht, as well as older Allgemeine SS reservists. These regiments were under Himmler's control, and were deployed across German-occupied Europe as political police, but the security functions they carried out were clearly within {{the capabilities of the}} Orpo. In late 1940, {{in order to ensure that}} Himmler's instructions were carried out, [...] Berger established a special camp at Sennheim in occupied Alsace, where non-Reich German recruits could be brought up to physical standards and ideologically indoctrinated prior to Waffen-SS training. This was an attempt to address the concerns of some commanders about the quality of these recruits, and their ability to be integrated into units composed mostly of Reich Germans. Recruits sent to this camp included Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans from outside the Reich), Danes, Norwegians, Dutch and Flemings. Berger also created a network of offices throughout German-occupied Europe to ensure the welfare of the families of such recruits, influence the local communities to support Waffen-SS recruiting, and prepare potential recruits for indoctrination. This network and its activities was strongly resisted by the Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans ( [...] or VoMi) the Nazi Party arm responsible for guiding the ethnic German communities outside the Reich. Himmler, unhappy with the work of VoMi in supporting SS recruiting, did not abolish VoMi, he just authorised Berger to circumvent it.|$|E

2500|$|Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon {{assert that}} the {{organizing}} model has several key advantages that distinguish it from the servicing model, such {{as the fact that}} the organizing model promotes [...] "systematic," [...] proactive, and well-thought out campaigns, which help the union's goals get satisfactorily and pragmatically achieved. More broadly, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obvious</b> advantages of the organizing model is that it allows workers to actually be involved in the campaigns that most closely affect them, promoting both equity and equality. In addition, the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, provides for the union's future by broadening its support from the workers and giving them a sense of investment into the day-to-day functions of the union itself. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper, in their research about British trade unions and their use of the organizing model, state that, within the unions themselves, there was praise for the organizing model because it upheld the [...] "...core role of trade unions". This is to say that the British union members felt the organizing model adhered to what unions should be doing in regard to their members.|$|E
