40|$|To {{gain some}} insight into the {{pathogenesis}} of proliferative lupus nephritis in MRL/lpr mice we investigated the kinetics of removal <b>of</b> immune <b>complexes</b> from the circulation, the carrier state of blood cells, the uptake <b>of</b> <b>complexes</b> by the mononuclear phagocyte system, and the localization <b>of</b> <b>complexes</b> in kidneys. In nephritic MRL/lpr mice challenged with a subsaturating dose <b>of</b> radiolabelled <b>complexes</b> (2. 5 mg bovine serum albumin-anti-bovine serum albumin) liver uptake was profoundly decreased, removal <b>of</b> circulating <b>complexes</b> was delayed, and 12 -h kidney localization <b>of</b> <b>complexes</b> was enhanced 7. 3 -fold, in comparison to control mice. The findings were not encumbered by differences in complement concentration and most likely are attributable to various altered immune functions: spontaneous polyclonal activation of B cells, enhanced production <b>of</b> endogenous immune <b>complexes,</b> delayed removal <b>of</b> <b>complexes</b> from the circulation, and decreased uptake <b>of</b> <b>complexes</b> by the mononuclear phagocyte system. In concert, such altered functions contribute to prolonged circulation <b>of</b> <b>complexes</b> to result in their enhanced deposition in the microcirculation...|$|R

In this case, one of the given circles is itself a solution to the Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced by one. The third case <b>of</b> <b>complex</b> conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number of solutions is reduced by two.
