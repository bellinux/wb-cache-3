40|$|AbstractBackgroundExposure {{to mould}} <b>or</b> {{dampness}} <b>at</b> <b>home</b> {{has been associated}} with adverse respiratory effects in all age groups. This exposure has also been related to insomnia in adults. We aimed to investigate the association between exposure to visible mould <b>or</b> dampness <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and sleep problems in children. MethodsThe study population consisted of 1719 10 -year-old children from the German population-based birth cohort LISAplus with available data on current mould <b>or</b> dampness <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and sleep problems. The presence of visible mould <b>or</b> dampness <b>at</b> <b>home</b> was assessed by questionnaire. Parent-reported sleep problems of their child were analysed by four binary variables: presence of any sleep problems, problems to fall asleep, problems sleeping through the night and a 24 h sleep time of less than 9 h. Logistic regression models adjusted for study centre, sex, age and level of parental education were applied to examine the association between visible mould <b>or</b> dampness <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and sleep problems. Sensitivity analyses included a further adjustment for bedroom sharing and subgroup analyses in children without current allergic diseases. ResultsThirteen percent of parents reported visible mould <b>or</b> dampness <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> We observed increased risks for all four sleep problem variables for children exposed to visible mould <b>or</b> dampness <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> Results were significant for any sleep problems (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 77 (95 %-confidence interval (CI) : 1. 21 – 2. 60), problems sleeping through the night (OR= 2. 52 (1. 27 – 5. 00) and a short sleep time (OR= 1. 68 (1. 09 – 2. 61)). While a further adjustment for bedroom sharing and the exclusion of children with asthma or eczema led to similar results, only the association with a short sleep time was still present in children without allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. ConclusionOur data suggests that visible mould <b>or</b> dampness <b>at</b> <b>home</b> might negatively influence sleep in children. The influence of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis on this association needs to be investigated in future studies...|$|R

500|$|The {{charters}} constitute valuable {{evidence for}} prosopographical {{research and the}} study of land tenure in late Anglo-Saxon England. According to Donald A. Bullough, they also offer a window on the kind of social bonds which could be created by [...] "neighbourhood". In the 10th century, the Bishop of Worcester leased out various small estates attached to the Church in the three counties (Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Warwickshire) to several high-ranking men and women, usually for three lifespans. The pattern may be taken to suggest that this way of association served to [...] "create a network, an inter-meshing, of high-status 'neighbours' ... with its central knot in Worcester and the domus of the bishop". In the bishop's residence <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> the lessees may have come together to participate in convivial drinking, just as the Norman successors to these lands are envisaged as doing in William of Malmesbury's Life of St Wulfstan. Further, some of the thegns served in the royal army (fyrd) under the command of Bishop Oswald or his successors, which presupposes the creation of a personal warband and possibly one with the secondary purpose of protecting the bishop's properties.|$|E

Their endeavours saved lives throughout the remainder of the day and into the night, including a group of 18 men found at around 1:00am. They were the last survivors found. A total of 432 miners had died that day—although some bodies were not found until later—and 7 others died later in hospital <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> A journalist from The Times wrote: [...] "The numbers are truly awful. We talk in awed terms of the decimation of a regiment in a bloody battle, but here a great community engaged in the pursuit of a peaceful vocation is threatened with the loss of at least a quarter of its able bodied manhood". On the surface the townsfolk waited for news; a reporter for The Dundee Courier thought: [...] "the scene at Senghenydd last night was depressing in the extreme. The streets were full of silent throngs of people who moved aimlessly about or stood stolidly at the street corners." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2008, General Motors was {{concerned}} about how the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would test the Volt to determine its official fuel economy rating. The controversy centered on whether, by including a gasoline engine, the Volt should be classified as a hybrid rather than an electric car as claimed by General Motors. If tested with the same EPA tests used by other hybrids, the Volt's EPA fuel economy rating would be around [...] due to the current EPA test for hybrids disallowing vehicles from boosting their mpg rating using stored battery power. General Motors stated that the Volt is an entirely new type of vehicle which the EPA's current fuel economy tests were not suited to rate and that a new test should be devised for this emerging class of hybrid-electrics. General Motors also advocated for a more simplified mpg calculation method {{to take into account}} the range of a plug-in hybrid while running solely on electricity. Because the Volt can travel [...] on batteries alone, GM argued that most drivers with a daily commute of less than that distance would drive only in electric mode, so long as they recharged their vehicle at work <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> overnight.|$|E

They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing {{that there could be a}} secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if they see me with a camera they will take me to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E
