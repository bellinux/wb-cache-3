This is very beneficial in many countries, as it permits the operation of national single-frequency networks (SFN), where many transmitters send the same signal simultaneously over the same channel frequency.

2500|$|Building off {{previous}} work done on an Aloha model, the coverage probability {{for the typical}} user was derived for a Poisson network. The Poisson model of a cellular network proves to be more tractable than a hexagonal model. Meanwhile, this observation could be argued {{by the fact that}} a detailed and precise derivation for the channel attenuation probability distribution function between a random node and a reference base-station for a hexagonal model was explicitly derived in; and this result could be used to tractably derive the <b>outage</b> <b>probability.</b> Furthermore, in the presence of sufficiently large log-normal shadow fading (or shadowing) and a singular power-law attenuation function, it was [...] observed [...] by simulation [...] for hexagonal networks and then later mathematically proved [...] for general stationary (including hexagonal) networks that quantities like the SINR and SIR of the typical user behave stochastically as though the underlying network were Poisson. In other words, given a [...] power-law attention function, using a Poisson cellular network model with [...] constant shadowing is equivalent (in terms of SIR, SINR, etc.) to assuming large log-normal shadowing in the mathematical model with the base stations positioned according to either a deterministic or random configuration with a constant density.|$|E

5000|$|A {{crucial part}} of QoS in mobile {{communications}} is grade of service, involving <b>outage</b> <b>probability</b> (the probability that the mobile station is outside the service coverage area, or affected by co-channel interference, i.e. crosstalk) blocking probability (the probability that the required level of QoS can not be offered) and scheduling starvation.

50|$|In {{the field}} of telephony, quality of service was defined by the ITU in 1994. Quality of service {{comprises}} requirements on all the aspects of a connection, such as service response time, loss, signal-to-noise ratio, crosstalk, echo, interrupts, frequency response, loudness levels, and so on. A subset of telephony QoS is grade of service (GoS) requirements, which comprises aspects of a connection relating to capacity and coverage of a network, for example guaranteed maximum blocking probability and <b>outage</b> <b>probability.</b>|$|E

Power control algorithms are used in many contexts, including cellular networks, sensor networks, wireless LANs, and DSL modems.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{the channel}} {{capacity}} for slow-fading channel is C = log2(1 + h2 SNR), where h is the fading coefficient and SNR is {{a signal to}} noise ratio without fading. As C is random, no constant rate is available. There may be a chance that information rate may go below to required threshold level. For slow fading channel, <b>outage</b> <b>probability</b> = P(C < r) = P(log2(1 + h2 SNR) < r), where r is the required threshold information rate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formulation}} of TWDP fading upends conventional RF design by demonstrating a common physical {{scenario in which}} deep fades in received power occur more often than Rayleigh fading—often considered the [...] "worst case design" [...] scenario in fading wireless links by engineers and scientists. Thus, common performance metrics in mobile communications such as bit error rate, <b>outage</b> <b>probability,</b> diversity gains, etc. can be significantly degraded by TWDP fading. Both measurements and theoretical predictions have shown that TWDP fading becomes more common as mobile radio links increase in both frequency and density.|$|E
30|$|There are two {{fundamental}} methods for probabilistic reliability evaluation: state enumeration and Monte Carlo simulation [2, 26]. Generally, if the <b>outage</b> <b>probabilities</b> {{of most of}} the components are very small (i.e. the system is reliable) or the number of components is very small, state enumeration method is usually more efficient. When the complex operating conditions are concerned or <b>outage</b> <b>probabilities</b> {{of most of the}} components cannot be ignored, {{it is almost impossible to}} enumerate all the system states. Thus, Monte Carlo simulation is an effective alternative to obtain all the approximate system states.|$|R
30|$|The rest of {{this paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. In Section  2, a system model is introduced, where a secondary system and a relay cooperate with a primary system together. In Section  3, the transmission process of the proposed protocol is described, and the <b>outage</b> <b>probabilities</b> of the primary system and the secondary system are analyzed. Moreover, two existing protocols are reviewed for comparison. In Section  4, analytical results are verified through simulations, and effects of various parameters on <b>outage</b> <b>probabilities</b> are analyzed. Finally, some concluding remarks are made in Section  5.|$|R
30|$|A {{noteworthy}} {{observation in}} Figure 8 {{is that there}} are two different approaches for obtaining the optimum ratio. One is the analytical approach of solving the optimization problems (29) and (30), which are based on the approximated <b>outage</b> <b>probabilities</b> (20) and (23). Another observation is the results obtained from exhaustive numerical evaluations of the exact <b>outage</b> <b>probabilities</b> (19) and (22) as a function of ρ for both the BNC and NBNC- 4 schemes. Note that the results from the two approaches are almost identical. This validates the optimization problem set up in (25).|$|R
