After the last call between Green and Farrar, Farrar watched television alone in his apartment until about 12:30, when a neighbor's phone call alerted him to the fire.|$|E

5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E

25|$|On October 11, 2006, Lidle and {{his flight}} {{instructor}} crashed {{a small plane}} into a 50-story condominium tower on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Francesa and Russo quickly went on the defensive, as they were emotionally disturbed and upset {{by the death of}} Lidle, whom they had scolded on air two days prior. They also refused to take any phone calls for the first couple of days after the crash, which led many to speculate that they were afraid of what their callers would say.

50|$|Another {{simplified}} traditional {{traffic generation}} model for circuit-switched data {{as well as}} packet data, is the Poisson process, where the number of incoming packets or calls per time unit follows the Poisson distribution.

The number <b>of</b> simultaneously ongoing <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> follows the Erlang distribution.|$|R
40|$|Objectives This study {{analyzed}} the associations between mobile <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> frequency and duration with non-specific symptoms. Methods This {{study was conducted}} with a population group including 532 non-patient adults established by the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. The pattern <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> using a mobile phone was investigated through face-to-face interview. Structured methods applied to quantitatively assess health effects are Headache Impact Test- 6 (HIT- 6), Psychosocial Well-being Index-Short Form, Beck Depression Inventory, Korean-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 12 -item Short Form Health Survey where a higher score represents a higher greater health effect. Results The average daily <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> frequency showed a significant correlation with the PSS score in female subjects. Increases in the average duration <b>of</b> one <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> were significantly correlated with increases in the severity of headaches in both sexes. The mean (standard deviation) HIT- 6 score in the subgroup of subjects whose average duration <b>of</b> one <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> was five minutes or longer was 45. 98 (8. 15), as compared with 42. 48 (7. 20) in those whose average duration <b>of</b> one <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> was < 5 minutes. The severity of headaches was divided into three levels according to the HIT- 6 score (little or no impact/moderate impact/substantial or severe impact), and a logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between an increased <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> duration and the headache severity. When the average duration <b>of</b> one <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> was five minutes or longer, the odds ratio (ORs) and the 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for the moderate impact group were 2. 22 and 1. 18 to 4. 19, respectively. The OR and 95 % CI for the substantial or severe impact group were 4. 44 and 2. 11 to 8. 90, respectively. Conclusions Mobile <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> duration was not significantly associated with stress, sleep, cognitive function, or depression, but was associated with the severity of headaches...|$|R

25|$|For instance, an {{individual}} {{keeping track of}} the amount of mail they receive each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular piece of mail does not affect the arrival times of future pieces of mail, i.e., if pieces of mail {{from a wide range of}} sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number of pieces of mail received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution. Other examples that may follow a Poisson include the number <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.|$|E
25|$|A mobile phone, or cell phone, is a long-range, {{electronic}} device used for mobile voice or data communication over {{a network of}} specialized base stations known as cell sites. Early mobile FM radio telephones were in use for many years, but since the number of radio frequencies were very limited in any area, the number <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> were also very limited. To solve this problem, there could be many small areas called cells which share the same frequencies. When users moved from one area to another while calling, the call {{would have to be}} switched over automatically without losing the call. In this system, a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge number of calls. The first mobile call was made from a car phone in St. Louis, Missouri on June 17, 1946, but the system was impractical from what is considered a portable handset today. The equipment weighed 80lbs, and the AT service, basically a massive party line, cost $30 per month plus 30 to 40 cents per local call. The basic network and supporting infrastructure of hexagonal cells used to support a mobile telephony system while remaining on the same channel were devised by Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young at AT Bell Labs in 1947. Finally in 1973, Martin Cooper invented the first handheld cellular/mobile phone. His first mobile phone call was made to Joel S. Engel in April 1973.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series <b>of</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

500|$|Applications and {{the study}} of {{phenomena}} have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes.
