5|$|The {{cinematography}} by William Lubtchansky furthers Rivette's {{interest in}} visual textures. The film's colour palette is largely natural, except for certain scenes—like the initial dream sequence—that are filmed in vivid colours. In {{the scene where}} Marie is arranging the attic room, the light changes—from shadow to warm light—just as she places an oil lamp <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> to indicate that she has placed it correctly; this introduces a supernatural element that contrasts with the realism {{of the rest of}} the film.|$|E
5|$|Burial 10 is {{the tomb}} of Yax Nuun Ayiin. It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis. The tomb {{contained}} a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king. A dog was also entombed with the deceased king. Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles. Among the offerings was an incense-burner {{in the shape of}} an elderly underworld god, sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands. The tomb was sealed with a corbel vault, then the pyramid was built on top.|$|E

In her right hand she holds aloft a globe with her thumb and two fingers, while her left hand supports the infant in her lap. The Christ figure himself wears a pontifical gown and presses a book against his breast with his left hand.|$|E

Here as in the later Walk on the Beach, the parasol is already an {{important}} prop. The open parasol casts shadows on her face, which is hidden by a veil in the later image. In this picture the painter has taken a slightly elevated position, so that no background horizon line is visible. Instead of the beach in the foreground it goes directly into the waves of the sea, with no sky to be seen.|$|E

500|$|The cast {{included}} more than 100 women. Each of André 3000's parts was shot several times from different angles, and he performed the song 23 {{times during the}} course of filming. Because releasing [...] "Hey Ya!" [...] as a single was a last-minute decision, André did not have time to choreograph the parts, and all of the dancing was improvised. Ice Cold 3000's sequences were the first filmed, resulting in the character's energetic performance, and Johnny Vulture's were the last, so André, exhausted from the previous takes, sat <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> for those sequences.|$|E

The singer last performed [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing" [...] on July 27, 2003 at a free outdoor concert held in Grant Park in Chicago, filmed for the Up!

The singer donned a tan, multi-patterned halter top and black, sequined wide leg trousers, and performed sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> placed {{at the end of the}} runaway.

500|$|The show {{began with}} the video {{introduction}} [...] "The Britney Spears Experience", in which three images of Spears welcomed spectators to the show. Then, a giant metal orb was lowered onstage and lifted again to reveal Spears standing behind it, wearing a pink halter top (some shows It was orange), a side silver jacket, and glittery jeans. Spears started with two dance-oriented performances of [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] and [...] "Stronger". This was followed by [...] "What U See (Is What U Get)" [...] in which she removed her silver side jacket and she danced on a stripper pole wearing a pink cowboy hat. The act ended with Spears talking to the audience and sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> to perform [...] "From The Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] with her guitarist Skip.|$|E
500|$|On May 2, 1706, {{the county}} justices noted that while no {{particular}} act of maleficium had been alleged against Sherwood, there was [...] "great cause of suspicion". Consequently, the Sheriff of Princess Anne County took Sherwood into custody, though Sherwood could give bond for her appearance and good behavior. Maximilian Boush, a warden of Lynnhaven Parish Church, was {{the prosecutor in}} Sherwood's case. On July 5, 1706, the justices ordered a trial by ducking to take place, with Sherwood's consent, but heavy rains caused a postponement until July 10, as they feared the wet weather might harm her health. Sherwood was taken inside Lynnhaven Parish Church, placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> and ordered to ask for forgiveness for her witchery. She replied, [...] "I be not a witch, I be a healer." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{initiation}} {{ceremony for}} newly appointed privy counsellors {{is held in}} private and typically requires kneeling <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> before the sovereign and then kissing hands. According to The Royal Encyclopaedia: [...] "The new privy counsellor or minister will extend his or her right hand, palm upwards, and, taking the Queen's hand lightly, will kiss it {{with no more than}} a touch of the lips." [...] The ceremony has caused difficulties for privy counsellors who advocate republicanism; Tony Benn said in his diaries that he kissed his own thumb, rather than the Queen's hand, while Jeremy Corbyn reportedly did not kneel. Not all members of the privy council go through the initiation ceremony; appointments are frequently made by an Order in Council, although it is [...] "rare for a party leader to use such a course." ...|$|E

We examined the use of <b>an</b> ergonomic dental <b>stool</b> with mid-sternum chest support for reducing lower back muscle activation. Electromyography of lower back extensors was assessed from 30 dental students for 20  s during three conditions in random order: (a) sitting upright at 90 ° of hip flexion <b>on</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>stool,</b> (b) leaning forward at 80 ° of hip flexion <b>on</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>stool,</b> and (c) leaning forward at 80 ° of hip flexion while sitting <b>on</b> <b>an</b> ergonomic <b>stool.</b> Muscular activity of the back extensors was reduced when using the ergonomic stool compared to the standard stool, by 33 - 50 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 01).

The pair were on the show to promote their recent collaboration, Chants of India, but at host John Fugelsang's urging, Harrison accepted an acoustic guitar and performed a brief rendition of [...] "All Things Must Pass".

500|$|Despite the {{acceptance}} of the Bacon cover by Doubleday, Dystel did not like the cover, and assigned New York illustrator Roger Kastel to do a different one for the paperback. Following Bacon's concept, Kastel illustrated his favorite part of the novel, the opening where the shark attacks Chrissie. For research, Kastel went to the American Museum of Natural History, and took advantage of the Great White exhibits being closed for cleaning to photograph the models. The photographs then provided reference for a [...] "ferocious-looking shark that was still realistic." [...] After painting the shark, Kastel did the female swimmer. Following a photoshoot for Good Housekeeping, Kastel requested the model he was photographing to lie <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stool</b> in the approximate position of a front crawl. The oil-on-board painting Kastel created for the cover would eventually be reused by Universal Studios on the film posters.|$|E
