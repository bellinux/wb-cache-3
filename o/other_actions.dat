5|$|Andros was {{commissioned}} governor of New England in 1686. He had earned the enmity {{of the local}} populace by enforcing the restrictive Navigation Acts, denying the validity of existing land titles, restricting town meetings, and appointing unpopular regular officers to lead colonial militia, among <b>other</b> <b>actions.</b> Furthermore, he had infuriated Puritans in Boston by promoting the Church of England, which was rejected by many Nonconformist New England colonists.|$|E

5|$|The Nazi party's {{goal was}} to remove Jews from German {{cultural}} and economic life, and eventually to remove them from the country altogether. In addition to his propaganda efforts, Goebbels actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through pogroms, legislation, and <b>other</b> <b>actions.</b> Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin {{in the early years}} of the regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the National Forest System is very complicated.

5|$|The {{resolution}} {{requires that}} Syria eliminate its chemical stockpile and allow complete access to UN and OPCW chemical weapons inspectors. If {{it does not}} comply with either demand, the Security Council would need to adopt a second resolution regarding imposition of military or <b>other</b> <b>actions</b> against Syria under the UN Charter's Chapter VII. The vote on the resolution was delayed until 27 September because the OPCW needed to vote first on its detailed implementation plan. Syria vowed {{to abide by the}} resolution.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the end of}} the sit-in {{campaign}} {{brought a}} brief respite for civil rights activists in Nashville, institutionalized racism remained a problem throughout the city. Over the next few years, further sit-ins, pickets, and <b>other</b> <b>actions</b> would take place at restaurants, movie theaters, public swimming pools, and other segregated facilities across Nashville. These actions continued until Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited segregation in public places throughout the United States. In that year, many of the key figures of the sit-ins, including James Lawson and Kelly Miller Smith, were interviewed by Robert Penn Warren for his book Who Speaks for the Negro?, in which they reflected on their experiences.|$|E

5|$|During the race, nine riders were {{excluded}} because of, among <b>other</b> <b>actions,</b> illegal use of cars or trains. The Tour organizers were {{happy with the}} result, but the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF) started an investigation after complaints from other cyclists. Their investigative committee heard testimony from dozens of competitors and witnesses, and, in December 1904, disqualified all the stage winners and the first four finishers (Maurice Garin, Pothier, César Garin, and Aucouturier). Ten of those disqualified were banned for one year, Maurice Garin {{for two years and}} the remaining two for life. In total, 29 riders were punished.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the tropical cyclone watches and warnings, several <b>other</b> <b>actions</b> were taken as Chantal approached. More than 600oil workers were moved inland, though a man drowned while attempting to evacuate a rig south of New Orleans, Louisiana. Mayor of Port Arthur Malcolm Grant asked 800residents to evacuate Sabine Pass, due to potential coastal flooding isolating the area. Shelters were opened at various schools in Port Arthur and Beaumont. In nearby Orange, crews at emergency centers distributed sand bags. About 8,500residents of Cameron Parish, Louisiana evacuated, with at least 67people taking shelter at a school in Lake Charles. An additional 2,500people fled Grand Isle, as {{the threat of the}} only road to the island flooding loomed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>actions</b> {{taken at}} the 1st General Council {{addressed}} women in ministry. The Pentecostals who founded the Assemblies of God had no objections to women being engaged in ministry. The Pentecostal belief in personal experience, Spirit baptism as empowerment for service, {{and the need for}} evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry. What concerned some Pentecostal leaders, such as Bell, were women exercising independent authority over men. The council therefore approved of the granting of credentials to female evangelists and missionaries while restricting the office of pastor to men, and it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings. By the fall of 1914, out of 512 credential holders, 142 were female missionaries and evangelists.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1775, the British had imposed {{taxes and}} import duties on the American colonies, {{to which the}} {{inhabitants}} objected since they lacked British Parliamentary representation. In response to the Boston Tea Party and other acts of protest, 4,000 British troops {{under the command of}} General Thomas Gage were sent to occupy Boston and to pacify the restive Province of Massachusetts Bay. Parliament authorized Gage, among <b>other</b> <b>actions,</b> to disband the local provincial government (led by John Hancock and Samuel Adams). It was reformed into the Provincial Congress, and continued to meet. The Provincial Congress called for the organization of local militias and coordinated the accumulation of weapons and other military supplies. Under the terms of the Boston Port Act, Gage closed the Boston port, which caused much unemployment and discontent.|$|E
5|$|The player character's {{proficiency}} with a {{skill is}} increased by practice, training, and study. Practice involves performing the specific actions {{associated with a}} given skill, which gradually raises the character's proficiency in that skill. Raising weapon skills requires striking an enemy with the appropriate weapon; raising armor skills requires being struck while wearing the appropriate type of armor; etc. Training involves paying cash to non-player characters (NPCs) in exchange for immediate proficiency increases in that skill. Study requires reading books found in the game, some of which will immediately raise a skill when read. Weaponry skills affect the character's chance to hit. Armor skills affect the defensive strength of the armor. Other skills affect proficiency at <b>other</b> <b>actions</b> such as potion-making, running, lockpicking, etc.|$|E
5|$|Three {{camera angles}} were used during Lorne's {{scene in the}} F-302. To save costs, one of the camera angles was {{operated}} by Kavan Smith himself, who held it on his lap. Elsewhere, the producers {{wanted to make the}} control chair rotate as Sheppard flies the city to make it different than any <b>other</b> <b>actions</b> involving the control chair. A stunt {{towards the end of the}} episode was used where Weir gets thrown after the beam grazes the tower. The stunt was not originally approved by the producers. A stuntwoman doubled Higginson as Weir during the sequence. The scene was rehearsed several times before filming the actual sequence. During the actual sequence, the stuntwoman wore a plastic mask to prevent the flying glass from injuring her face.|$|E

5|$|Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, Cheney was {{primarily}} raised in Sumner, Nebraska, and Casper, Wyoming. He attended Yale {{and then the}} University of Wyoming, at the latter of which he earned a BA and an MA in Political Science. He began his political career as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger, eventually working {{his way into the}} White House during the Nixon and Ford administrations, where he later served as the White House Chief of Staff, from 1975 to 1977. In 1978, Cheney was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives representing Wyoming's at-large congressional district from 1979 to 1989; he was reelected five times, briefly serving as House Minority Whip in 1989. Cheney was selected to be the Secretary of Defense during the Presidency of George H. W. Bush, holding the position for the majority of Bush's term from 1989 to 1993. During his time in the Department of Defense, Cheney oversaw the 1991 Operation Desert Storm, among <b>other</b> <b>actions.</b> Out of office during the Clinton administration, Cheney was the Chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000.|$|E
5|$|Deus Ex: Human Revolution is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game with incorporated first-person shooter and stealth mechanics. Players take {{the role of}} Adam Jensen, a man equipped with mechanical cybernetic implants called augmentations. The game's environments, ranging from open world hubs to more scripted environments, are explored in first-person, although actions such as hiding behind cover, conversing with non-playable characters (NPCs), and some attack animations switch to a third-person view. In these environments, players can find NPCs that will advance both the main story quest and optional side quests: completing quests, along with <b>other</b> <b>actions</b> such as combat with enemies, rewards Adam with experience points, which raise his experience level. Also accessible are black market vendors which supply equipment and weapons for Credits, the in-game currency. Interactive objects within environments can be highlighted, although these options are either turned off on the hardest difficulty or can be turned off in the options menu by the player.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or <b>other</b> <b>actions</b> earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E
