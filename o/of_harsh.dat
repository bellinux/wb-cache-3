5|$|A {{variety of}} vocalizations are used and, like other corvids, grey jays may mimic other bird species, {{especially}} predators. Calls include a whistled quee-oo, and various clicks and chuckles. When predators are spotted, the bird announces a series <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> clicks to signal a threat on the ground, or {{a series of}} repeated whistles to indicate a predator in the air.|$|E
5|$|Also, cinematographic {{improvements}} that modern viewers would find relatively minor were noted in their day. In the attic scenes, for instance, Hepworth's use of arc lights was celebrated {{for being an}} early use <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> lighting conditions to create ambiance and indicate a dangerous setting. Prints have been saved both in the Library of Congress film archive, and the National Film and Television Archive of the British Film Institute.|$|E

5|$|Although it is a mimid, {{the black}} catbird {{is not known}} to imitate any other species. Its song is a mix <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> notes and clear flute-like whistles, with the phrases repeated. It builds a cup nest in low bushes or trees, and lays two bluish eggs. It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss, and has been assessed as near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|In 1600 Denmark {{controlled}} {{virtually all}} land bordering on Skagerrak, Kattegat, and the Sound. The current Swedish provinces of Skåne, Blekinge and Halland were Danish and {{the province of}} Båhuslen was Norwegian. Skåneland became the site <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> fighting, especially in the 16th, 17th and 18th century, as Denmark and Sweden confronted each other {{for control of the}} Baltic.|$|E
5|$|After {{his death}} from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his {{linguist}} friends who also worked {{to spread the}} influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he became the subject <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated {{and that they were}} based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.|$|E
50|$|The {{landscape}} and {{climate of the}} new planet where the ship crashed seems very much like that <b>of</b> <b>harsher</b> climates on Earth, such as the southwestern United States.

50|$|However, {{everything}} wasn't {{positive in}} the city. Signs <b>of</b> <b>harsher</b> times were evident. The labour market conflict of 1909 (the Swedish General Strike) was {{the culmination of}} growing tension between workers and employers. No larger encounters occurred though the strike was a huge setback for the labour movement in Sweden and even more so in Östersund.|$|R

5|$|Following the shooting, American and {{international}} politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Gun control advocates pushed for increased {{restrictions on the}} sale of firearms and ammunition, specifically high-capacity ammunition magazines. Some commentators criticized the use <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> political rhetoric in the United States, with a number blaming the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led a nationally televised memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 19th century until 1944 Guatemala was {{governed by a}} series of authoritarian rulers who sought to {{strengthen}} the economy by supporting the export of coffee. Between 1898 and 1920, Manuel Estrada Cabrera granted significant concessions to the United Fruit Company, an American corporation that traded in tropical fruit, and dispossessed many indigenous people of their communal lands. Under Jorge Ubico, who ruled as a dictator between 1931 and 1944, this process was intensified, with the institution <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> labor regulations and a police state.|$|E
5|$|Hindman set to {{work and}} issued a series <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> {{military}} edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and requisitioning supplies {{for the defense of}} the State. Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear {{that they did not have}} an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|E

50|$|In 1987, after {{a meeting}} with GLAAD, The New York Times changed its {{editorial}} policy {{to use the word}} gay instead <b>of</b> <b>harsher</b> terms referring to homosexuality. GLAAD advocated that the Associated Press and other television and print news sources follow. GLAADs influence soon spread to Los Angeles, where organizers began working with the entertainment industry to change the way LGBT people were portrayed on screen.|$|R
5|$|The {{combination}} of the humiliation of Casey, {{the deaths of the}} topmen, and the severe punishment {{of the rest of the}} sailors appears to have driven the crew to mutiny. These factors, however, were arguably the final events in a series <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> and brutal punishments by the captain. Dudley Pope, in his book The Black Ship, argues that it was not Pigot's cruelty that drove the men to mutiny but the general injustice that he showed in his favouritism to some and overly harsh punishment of others. Had Pigot remained more even-handed in his leadership, the mutiny might have been avoided.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Caligari is not {{the only}} symbol of arrogant {{authority}} in the film. In fact, he is a victim <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare {{can be seen as a}} rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066, William the Conqueror subdued {{the north of}} the country in a {{sequence}} <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> campaigns, and the north-west region became a contested border territory between the Normans and the Scottish kings. William's son, William Rufus, invaded the north-west in 1091 and built Brough Castle around 1092, placing it in the north part of the old Roman fort in order {{to make use of the}} existing earthworks, in a similar way to nearby Brougham and Lancaster. The north side of the site overlooks the River Eden. This castle appears to have been a motte and bailey design; the keep had stone foundations and a main structure built from timber, while the rest of the former fort was turned into a palisaded bailey. The village of Church Brough was created alongside the castle at around the same time, in the form of a planned settlement, part of the Norman colonisation of the low-lands in the region.|$|E

5|$|Henry quickly took {{revenge on}} his enemies after the Battle of Evesham. He {{immediately}} ordered the sequestration {{of all the}} rebel lands, triggering a wave of chaotic looting across the country. Henry initially rejected any calls for moderation, but in October 1266 he was persuaded by the Papal Legate, Ottobuono de' Fieschi, to issue a less draconian policy, called the Dictum of Kenilworth, which allowed {{for the return of}} the rebels' lands, in exchange for the payment <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> fines. The Statute of Marlborough followed in November 1267, which effectively reissued much of the Provisions of Westminster, placing limitations on the powers of local royal officials and the major barons, but without restricting central royal authority. Most of the exiled Poitevins began to return to England after the war. In September 1267 Henry made the Treaty of Montgomery with Llywelyn, recognising him as the Prince of Wales and giving substantial land concessions.|$|E
5|$|More than 100 insect species prey on H. zea, usually {{feeding on}} eggs and larvae. The {{insidious}} flower bug (Orius insidiosus), a pirate bug, feeds on the eggs of H. zea, thus {{acting as a}} biological control agent. Some plants emit a blend of chemicals in response to damage from H. zea, which attract parasitic insects. Cardiochiles nigriceps, a solitary endoparasitoid wasp, makes use of these volatile plant compounds to identify the presence of H. zea. When the wasps find damaged host plants, they hover around and then search for the host with their antennae. When the females find their prey, they use their antennae to position themselves and deposit eggs into the host. The braconid wasp Microplitis croceipes, which deposits its eggs inside a living caterpillar, {{is also an important}} parasitoid of both H. zea and the related species Heliothis virescens. When larval densities are high, a fungal pathogen, Nomuraea rileyi, can cause an outbreak of disease. However, pupal mortality is high not because of predators, but because <b>of</b> <b>harsh</b> weather conditions, collapsing pupal chambers, and disease.|$|E
