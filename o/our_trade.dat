40|$|Inflation {{pressures}} in other economies {{have important implications}} for inflation, activity and monetary policy in New Zealand. This article examines inflation trends in New Zealand’s trading partner economies over the past decade. Looking at a range of inflation measures, we observe that the low inflation seen in <b>our</b> <b>trading</b> partner economies in the mid- 1990 s has now given way to a period of higher inflation. Increases in inflation rates have been seen in all regions, with particularly notable increases in Asian economies. Higher inflation in <b>our</b> <b>trading</b> partner economies has been related to strength in global growth and the closer integration of Asia and emerging markets into the global econoy. These developments have contributed to increased demands on productive resources and strong growth in commodity prices. Such increases have been reflected in higher consumer prices and export prices in <b>our</b> <b>trading</b> partner economies. In New Zealand, these developments have contributed to a more challenging environment for monetary policy, with stronger consumer price inflation and increased headwinds for growth. ...|$|R

500|$|In mid-1899, the British {{inspector}} of Chinese maritime customs, Alfred Hippisley, {{visited the}} United States. [...] In {{a letter to}} Rockhill, a friend, he urged that the United States and other powers agree to uniform Chinese tariffs, including in the enclaves. Rockhill passed the letter on to Hay, and subsequently summarized the thinking of Hippisley and others, {{that there should be}} [...] "an open market through China for <b>our</b> <b>trade</b> on terms of equality with all other foreigners". Hay was in agreement, but feared Senate and popular opposition, and wanted to avoid Senate ratification of a treaty. [...] Rockhill drafted the first Open Door note, calling for equality of commercial opportunity for foreigners in China.|$|E
500|$|Word quickly {{spread among}} the Native American tribes of Standish's attack; many Native Americans {{abandoned}} their villages and fled the area. As noted by Philbrick: [...] "Standish's raid had irreparably damaged the human {{ecology of the}} region .... It was some time before a new equilibrium came to the region." [...] Edward Winslow reports in his 1624 memoirs Good News from New England that [...] "they forsook their houses, running to and fro like men distracted, living in swamps and other desert places, and so brought manifold diseases amongst themselves, whereof very many are dead". Lacking the trade in furs provided by the local tribes, the Pilgrims lost their main {{source of income for}} paying off their debts to the Merchant Adventurers. Rather than strengthening their position, Standish's raid had disastrous consequences for the colony, as attested by William Bradford {{in a letter to the}} Merchant Adventurers: [...] "e had much damaged <b>our</b> <b>trade,</b> for there where we had [...] most skins the Indians are run away from their habitations". The only positive effect of Standish's raid seemed to be the increased power of the Massasoit-led Wampanoag tribe, the Pilgrims' closest ally in the region.|$|E
500|$|In 1654, Oliver Cromwell {{decided to}} turn on Spain (which {{had been the first}} state to {{recognise}} the Commonwealth of England) and seize the island of Hispaniola to make it a base for English expansion in the Caribbean. To do so, two fleets were fitted out: one set out to America and another to the western Mediterranean with the ostensible objective of fighting the Barbary pirates. The fleet in the Caribbean failed to seize Hispaniola but took over Jamaica instead in May 1655. The fleet in the Mediterranean sailed off Cádiz trying to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet with no success. With the arrival of the winter, the fleet went back to England. However, Spain did not declare war on England until February 1656. Shortly after, a fleet of 49 English warships manned by 10,000 sailors and soldiers sailed through the Straits and reconnoitred Gibraltar. Although they lacked a viable landing force and took no action, Oliver Cromwell expressed interest in its capture: [...] "if possessed and made tenable by us, would it not be both an advantage to <b>our</b> <b>trade,</b> and an annoyance to the Spaniards, and enable us ... ease our own charge?" [...] In 1693, during the Nine Years' War, in which Spain and England were allies, the remnants of an English-Dutch escort squadron under the command of Admiral Sir George Rooke took refuge at Gibraltar, pursued by the French, after losing the Battle of Lagos Bay. Eleven years later, Rooke was to return to Gibraltar to capture it.|$|E
