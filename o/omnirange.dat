50|$|The Omnimover is an {{amusement}} ride system used for Disney theme park attractions. Roger Broggie and Bert Brundage developed {{the system for}} WED Enterprises, which patented Omnimover in April 1968. The term was coined by Imagineer Bob Gurr and is a portmanteau of <b>OmniRange</b> and PeopleMover. Outside of Disney, it is known as an Endless Transit System.|$|E
50|$|On 17 September 1965, Pan Am Flight 292, a Boeing 707-121B {{en route}} from Fort de France, Martinique, to St. John's struck Chances Peak on Montserrat, an island to the {{southwest}} of Antigua, killing all 30 hands aboard. The pilot mistakenly believed he was descending into Antigua. As a result, a VHF <b>omnirange</b> (VOR) transmitter was installed at the St. John's airport.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{underwater}} acoustic navigation {{method is}} proposed, which is named from Doppler Acoustic <b>Omnirange</b> Beacon (DAOB). It is {{borrowed from the}} idea of Doppler VHF <b>Omnirange</b> (DVOR) and based on the Doppler principle. The cause of Doppler effect in the received signal is the motion or position change of one or two sources. The effect of multipath is analyzed, and an improved signal form is presented to solve the rigorous multipath environment underwater. Some simulation is presented to verify the performance.    </p...|$|E
40|$|Applications of {{wide range}} {{broadcast}} procedures to improve {{air traffic control}} and make more airspace available are discussed. A combination of the Omega navigation system and the very high frequency <b>omnirange</b> (VOR) is recommended {{as a means for}} accomplishing improved air traffic control. The benefits to be derived by commercial and general aviation are described. The air/ground communications aspects of the improved air traffic control system are explained. Research and development programs for implementing the broadcast concept are recommended...|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} piloted simulation {{was conducted}} to investigate {{the effects of the}} characteristics of helicopter flight control systems on instrument flight handling qualities. This joint FAA/NASA study was motivated by the need to improve instrument flight capability. A near-term objective is to assist in updating the airworthiness criteria for helicopter instrument flight. The experiment consisted of variations of single-rotor helicopter types and levels of stability and control augmentation systems (SCAS). These configurations were evaluated during an <b>omnirange</b> approach task under visual and instrument flight conditions. The levels of SCAS design included a simple rate damping system, collective decoupling plus rate damping, and an attitude command system with collective decoupling. A limited evaluation of stick force versus airspeed stability was accomplished. Some problems were experienced with control system mechanization which had a detrimental effect on longitudinal stability. Pilot ratings, pilot commentary, and performance data related to the task are presented...|$|E
40|$|A Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) {{system for}} manned/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) concept is {{designed}} and verified in this paper. The 900 [*]MHz XBee-Pro is selected as data transponder to broadcast flight information among participating aircraft in <b>omnirange.</b> Standard Compact Position Report (CPR) format packet data are automatically broadcasted by ID sequencing under Quasi-ADS-B mechanism. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) monitoring checks the designated time slot and reallocates the conflict ID. This mechanism allows the transponder to effectively share data with multiple aircraft in near airspace. The STM 32 f 103 microprocessor {{is designed to}} handle RF, GPS, and flight data with Windows application on manned aircraft and ground control station simultaneously. Different conflict detection and collision avoidance algorithms can be implemented into the system to ensure flight safety. The proposed UAV/CD&R using Quasi-ADS-B transceiver is tested using ultralight aircraft flying at 100 – 120 [*]km/hr speed in small airspace for mission simulation. The proposed hardware is also useful to additional applications to mountain hikers for emergency search and rescue. The fundamental function by the proposed UAV/CD&R using Quasi-ADS-B is verified with effective signal broadcasting for surveillance and efficient collision alert and avoidance performance to low altitude flights...|$|E
