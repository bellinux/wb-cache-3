5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Sun is {{the star}} at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with {{internal}} convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.

5|$|The overall {{structure}} of the charted regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets.

5|$|During the Renaissance, Nicolaus Copernicus {{proposed}} a heliocentric model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> His work was defended, expanded upon, and corrected by Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler. Galileo used telescopes to enhance his observations.|$|E
5|$|Evidence from {{daughter}} {{products of}} short-lived radioactive isotopes {{shows that a}} nearby supernova helped determine the composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> 4.5billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of this system.

5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E

5|$|Over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> evolution, comets were ejected out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> by <b>the</b> gravity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> giant planets, {{and sent}} {{thousands}} of AU outward {{to form the}} Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at <b>the</b> farthest extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into <b>the</b> inner <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> <b>The</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> also {{appears to have been}} influenced by space weathering from <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> wind, micrometeorites, and <b>the</b> neutral components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interstellar medium.|$|R
5|$|Over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> {{existence}} <b>the</b> orbits <b>of</b> comets are {{unstable and}} eventually dynamics dictate that a comet must either collide with the Sun or a planet or else be ejected from <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> by planetary perturbations.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the outer planets, the inner planets are not thought to have migrated significantly over the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{is part of}} {{the iron}} group of elements, which are thought to be {{synthesized}} in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion. 53Mn decays to 53Cr with a half-life of 3.7 million years. Because of its relatively short half-life, 53Mn is relatively rare, produced by cosmic rays impact on iron. Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating. Mn–Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b> Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio, which indicates that Mn–Cr isotopic composition must result from in situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence, 53Mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> out of convenience.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> asteroids have orbital eccentricities between 0 and 0.35 with {{an average}} value of 0.17. Their {{comparatively}} high eccentricities are probably due to <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> Jupiter and to past collisions.|$|R

5|$|The Sun is a G-type {{main-sequence star}} that {{comprises}} about 99.86% {{of the mass}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of {{the stars in the}} Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to the plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> While other mechanisms have been offered {{for many of these}} peculiarities the gravitational influence of Planet Nine {{is the only one that}} explains all five. The dynamical effects of Planet Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E

50|$|The low {{temperatures}} and higher gravity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System's</b> giant planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—allow them more readily to retain gases with low molecular masses.
