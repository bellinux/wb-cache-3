500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> places ever and I did <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E

[...] He continues [...] "What makes these drawings (and the book itself) even more interesting is that Cott (1900-1987) was not just a zoologist—he was a highly skilled scientific illustrator (these are his own pen-and-ink drawings), a wildlife photographer, and a prominent British camoufleur in World War II." [...] Still in 2011, Behrens can write of Cott's way of thinking, citing his words as models of clear and accurate explanation of the mechanisms of camouflage: [...] "As he so aptly explained it, disruptive patterns work 'by the optical destruction of what is present', while continuous patterns work 'by the optical construction of what is not present.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Paul {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and raised in North Philadelphia. His love of music began at a young age, {{listening}} at home to his family's music collection.

500|$|Lawrence Tierney guest {{starred in}} the episode as Don Brodka. Another former show runner, Josh Weinstein, called Tierney's {{appearance}} [...] "the craziest guest star experience we ever had".

Weinstein said, [...] "He certainly delivered and he's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> characters we have had [...]" [...] After Tierney's death, the episode [...] "The Old Man and the Key" [...] was dedicated to him.|$|E
500|$|While {{accompanying}} Songz on 106 & Park when promoting, Ready, Drake {{explained the}} video, stating: [...] "The {{concept of the}} video {{is the fact that}} 'successful,' it applies to so many people that me and Trey just want to get the point across that we see ourselves and we see success in other individuals so really, it's a video about potential. It's a video about understanding that no matter what you do, there's a way to be successful doing it. It's one of those motivational videos. It actually ends with a quote from Barack Obama which is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> quotes I've ever read, so we decided {{to put it in the}} video. It's vivid." ...|$|E

5000|$|Andriano doesn't go into {{details as}} to the {{inspiration}} for the lyrics of this song; he simply says: [...] "It's definitely <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites</b> on the album, though, because the sentiment is real.

500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands {{out to me}} cause I vividly {{remember}} the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, {{where a lot of}} the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Ford revealed, [...] "Blade Runner is not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> films. I {{tangled with}} Ridley." [...] Apart from {{friction}} with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: [...] "When we started shooting {{it had been}} tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a [...] nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director's interests." [...] "I went kicking and screaming to the studio to record it." [...] The narration monologues were written by an uncredited Roland Kibbee.|$|E

Seeing the beauty of her face and mind, I became her ardent devotee. Sitting at home now in Encinitas, in Southern California, at the age of 88, surrounded by the beautiful greens, multi-colored flowers, blue sky, clean air, and the Pacific Ocean, I often reminisce about all the wonderful places I have seen in the world. I cherish the memories of Paris, New York, and a few other places. But Varanasi seems to be etched in my heart!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Robin Gibb said: That's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorites</b> too, It {{was a very}} {{emotional}} song, {{but a lot of}} the words just came ad-libbed. The song actually wasn't planned. We just played the record down and sang it as we felt it. We kept the original demo the way it was and laterjust added the orchestra. It's got a great feeling to it, a great atmosphere, sometimes you know you can't recapture that feeling if you keep recording something. [...] Robin Gibb ...|$|R

The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people close to me, and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally.

500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book.
