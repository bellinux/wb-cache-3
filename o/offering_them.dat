5|$|In {{response}} to the ruling, some students created web-based publications not subsidized by the school. Some individual states have also responded with laws designating student newspapers as public forums and <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> greater First Amendment protection. Experts from the Student Press Law Center say the case has meant that fewer lawsuits regarding student censorship make it to court.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013 the Sevenstone project, which {{aimed to}} {{demolish}} and rebuild {{a large part}} of the city centre, and had been on hold since 2009, was further delayed and the company developing it was dropped. The city council is looking for partners to take a new version of the plan forwards. In April 2014 the council, together with Sheffield University, proposed a plan to reduce the blight of empty shops in the city centre by <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> free of charge to small businesses on a month-by-month basis.|$|E

5|$|In early 1995, {{snippets of}} {{information}} about the world of cricket betting and match-fixing began to be reported by the media. Phil Wilkins of The Sydney Morning Herald reported that an unnamed Pakistani player had attempted to bribe Tim May, Warne and Waugh during Australia's tour of the country in late-1994, immediately after the Singer Trophy. The player was later identified as Saleem Malik, and it was revealed that the Australian trio had privately reported him for <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> money to throw matches.|$|E
5|$|In folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often {{play the}} role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most {{harmless}} case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles {{encounters}} Rouge and Eggman, who try {{to steal}} the Master Emerald. He stops them by shattering the emerald and searches for the scattered shards. Rouge, spying for the government, heads to Eggman's base and the ARK. There, Shadow shows Eggman the Eclipse Cannon, another superweapon created by Gerald, and discloses his plan: to charge the cannon with Chaos Emeralds {{and use it to}} take over the world. Rouge appears, <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> a Chaos Emerald to gain their trust.|$|E

5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans to blow up the entire universe. This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.|$|E
5|$|As {{requested}} by Walpole, George revived the Order of the Bath in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain political supporters by <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> the honour. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers {{of his own}} choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet; most of his communications were in private, and he only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, he arranged for the ratification by Great Britain, France and Prussia of the Treaty of Hanover, {{which was designed to}} counterbalance the Austro-Spanish Treaty of Vienna and protect British trade.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Amphipolis, the Chalkidian League, led by Olynthos, began to fear Philip's {{territorial}} ambitions (since Amphipolis also controlled access to Chalkidiki), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him. However, the Athenians still hoped to receive Amphipolis from Philip and so refused. Philip himself feared an alliance of the powerful Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved to reassure the Olynthians by <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> an alliance on very advantageous terms. As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of Potidea, located in {{the territory of the}} Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that time under the control of Athens, and represented a threat to the stability of the league.|$|E

5|$|In Bottomley's absence, {{his office}} {{explored}} {{the issue and}} resolved that Rhodesia could retain its representative in South Africa, but {{should not be allowed}} to appoint another in Lisbon; a consul was acceptable, they concluded, but only as part of the British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he still did nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. Only now was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> the consul within the embassy, but refusing to sanction an independent office.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E
5|$|Song was a {{spokesperson}} for Disney's environmental campaign, Disney's Friends for Change. She was featured in several commercials on the Disney Channel for the campaign.

5|$|The crisis showed Muhammad {{that many}} of his men had reached the limits of their endurance. He sent word to Ghatafan, trying to pay for their {{defection}} and <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> a third of Medina's date harvest if they withdrew. Although the Ghatafan demanded half, they eventually agreed to negotiating with Muhammad on those terms. Before Muhammad began the order of drafting the agreement, he consulted the Medinan leaders. They sharply rejected the terms of the agreement, protesting Medina had never sunk to such levels of ignominy. The negotiations were broken off. While the Ghatafan did not retreat they had compromised themselves by entering into negotiations with Medina, and the Confederacy's internal dissension had thereby been increased.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{generated}} by the Pacific electric ray can be enough to knock down an adult human. It should be treated with caution, especially at night when it is active, and {{has been known to}} charge at divers with its mouth agape if harassed. It is not known to be responsible for any fatalities, but may have been involved in several unexplained, fatal diving accidents. This species fares poorly in captivity, as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into an aquarium. Since 2000, the Aquarium of the Bay and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have had some success keeping Pacific electric rays by <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> moving food.|$|E
5|$|This plan {{required}} tacit Soviet support, and the non-aggression pact (the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, {{included a}} secret agreement to partition Poland {{between the two}} countries. Contrary to Ribbentrop's prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties, Britain and Poland signed the Anglo-Polish alliance on 25 August 1939. This, along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel, prompted Hitler to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September. Hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit {{in an effort to}} blame the imminent war on British and Polish inaction.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the prior}} three {{films in the}} series, the U.S. rating was PG-13 rather than R. An unrated version {{contained}} more strong profanity and violence not shown in the theatrical version, and {{was included in the}} DVD release.

5|$|In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began {{organizing}} {{the administration of}} Northern Dobruja, through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession {{played a part in}} the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes, <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the nationalization of land once owned by the Muhajir Balkan, and the appropriation of uncultivated plots (miriè). Kogălniceanu also advised the local administration to overrepresent existing Romanian communities in the decision-making process.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Arafat and {{his closest}} companions {{migrated}} to Syria—a country sharing a border with Israel—which had recently seceded from its union with Egypt. Fatah had approximately three hundred members by this time, but none were fighters. In Syria, {{he managed to}} recruit members by <b>offering</b> <b>them</b> higher incomes to enable his armed attacks against Israel. Fatah's manpower was incremented further after Arafat decided to offer new recruits much higher salaries than members of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), the regular military force of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which {{was created by the}} Arab League in 1964. On 31 December, a squad from al-Assifa, Fatah's armed wing, attempted to infiltrate Israel, but they were intercepted and detained by Lebanese security forces. Several other raids with Fatah's poorly trained and badly-equipped fighters followed this incident. Some were successful, others failed in their missions. Arafat often led these incursions personally.|$|E

They were back in a few days with the slaver (he didn't show fight) and a whole crowd of witnesses, and we tried him in my bedroom, and fined him properly.
