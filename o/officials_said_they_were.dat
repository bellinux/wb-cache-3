25|$|The Syrian {{government}} has {{at various times}} considered two alternative mega-projects to bring additional water to the Greater Damascus area. One plan consisted in the transfer {{of water from the}} coastal region over a distance of at least 225km and a cumulated difference in altitude of about 1000m. The water sources considered were two reservoirs in the coastal basin and even offshore springs in the Mediterranean or desalination of seawater at a total cost of more than US$1 per cubic meter including its transfer. By 2010 this plan was considered to have been abandoned. The other plan consists in building a pipeline from the Euphrates River. In 2006 Syrian <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> “pressing ahead” with a feasibility study by a Swiss company to transfer water from the Euphrates to Damascus at an estimated cost of US$2 billion. The project would involve conveying water from Lake Assad, some 441 kilometers away with pumping over an altitude of 712 meters. A capacity of 850 million m3 per annum has been envisaged, about twice the current water deficit in Greater Damascus. The cost for bulk water before distribution losses would be more than US$0.50 per cubic meter.|$|E

2500|$|With no remains found since May 3, the Corps of Engineers {{began to}} fear on June 16 {{that no more}} bodies would be found. In part {{this was due to}} the {{condition}} of the ship. Army engineers told the press that sides of the bow appeared to have blown outward, with the upper deck detaching from the ship. This caused wreckage to be strewn laterally over Havana Harbor, leaving a large debris field. The explosion was so powerful that the ship's [...] forward gun turret landed [...] away, and the vessel's port and transverse armored bulkheads were buried [...] into the mud of the harbor floor. Some armor was never found. The bow's upper deck rose into the air, turned upside-down, and landed on the central third of the Maine. The bow detached from the ship at frame 14, and the bow's keel detached from the ship at frame 18. What remained of the bow landed at the bottom of Havana Harbor at a 45 degree angle {{to the rest of the}} ship, pointing to starboard. The bow keel was bent upward in the middle by about [...] The inner shell of the ship's double-bottomed hull was thrown upward, and came to rest on top of what remained of the bow. Investigators could not determine if it was forced into that position by an exterior explosion or if it was pulled upward as the bow detached. The forward portion of what remained of the keel rested on the inner shell, with the rear portion buried deep in the mud. Again, investigators could not determine if the explosion bent the keel and forced it into this position or if the suction created by the outward-expanding hull pulled it there. As the bow settled, it listed almost onto its starboard side. The central third of the ship was devastated by the explosion and collapse of the bow's upper deck onto it, and was partially detached from the stern. The stern, however, was in remarkably good shape and seemingly undisturbed by the blast. Even the aft turret guns were still in place. Nonetheless, Corps <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> seriously considering breaking up the wreck rather than raising it. A model of the wreck was made by a naval constructor.|$|E
2500|$|The Army {{clarified}} {{that it was}} not cancelling the IC competition, {{but that}} it {{was in a position to}} conclude it. [...] Industry participants said the competition was plagued by miscommunication from the Army. [...] Gabriele de Plano, vice president of military marketing and sales for Beretta, said he knew nothing of what the Army was planning just weeks before cancellation. [...] Other companies expressed concern that they had learned the program may be cancelled through media reports rather than being informed directly. [...] Army <b>officials</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> surprised that none of the rifles submitted passed muster and maintained that there was transparency throughout the three-year competition. [...] Brigadier General Paul A. Ostrowski, head of PEO Soldier, said the Army simply did not find the capability it was after with the rifles submitted. [...] None of the weapons met minimum requirements. [...] The competition was a binary pass-or-fail venue, rather than a test-fix-test venue to improve the weapons following test results. [...] Mark Westrom, owner of ArmaLite which designed the original M16 rifle, said the competition was [...] "destined to fail" [...] because the requirements did not represent a significant advance in fighting ability. [...] The Army admitted each entrant offered marginal improvements over the M4 Carbine, but that none would substantially increase a soldier’s battlefield capability. [...] Westrom said the carbines offered incremental improvements, not any that offered a tactically superior advance to justify replacing the entire inventory. [...] There were also complaints about the ammunition used in testing. [...] The competition began while the M855 round was in use. [...] In June 2010, the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round was fielded, and the competition began using the EPR in August. [...] Army analysis found that the M855A1 may have contributed to lower than expected reliability performance. [...] Even so, the Army insists they made industry aware of the ammo change, giving them time to adjust their designs and arranging for each vendor to fire 10,000 M855A1s at a private range. [...] Westrom said ammunition and caliber conflicts had little to do with it, as neither those factors nor the rifle designs would fundamentally change the battlefield capabilities of a soldier or small unit, while previous weapon transitions advanced combat shooting doctrines and shooting tactics. [...] ArmaLite did not participate in the competition because Westrom determined their designs weren't a revolutionary improvement over the M4 weapon system, and because the published Army requirements [...] "set the bar so low" [...] that the outcome that no one would win a contract was [...] "predetermined." ...|$|E
