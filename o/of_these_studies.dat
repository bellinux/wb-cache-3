5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} may lead to incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage.

5|$|Durio {{is often}} {{included}} in Bombacaceae {{because of the}} presence of monothecate anthers, as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should actually be placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> hypothesize that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples {{from each of}} the whale populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species.

The authors of one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on data from large populations of children to study {{the relationship between the}} use of vaccines containing thiomersal, and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

The only epidemiologic research that has found a purported link between TCVs and autism has been conducted by Mark Geier, whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews.|$|E
5|$|The Platanistidae were {{originally}} thought to hold only one species (the South Asian river dolphin), {{but based on}} differences in skull structure, vertebrae and lipid composition, scientists declared the two populations as separate species in the early 1970s. In 1998, the results <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> were questioned and the classification reverted to the pre-1970 consensus. Thus, at present, two subspecies are recognized in the genus Platanista, P. gangetica minor (the Indus river dolphin) and P. g. gangetica (the Ganges river dolphin).|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} {{required}} examinations, Negus proceeded in 1909 {{to the next}} stage of his basic medical education at the nearby King's College Hospital, at that time located on Portugal Street between the Strand and Lincoln's Inn Fields. Three more years of study led to the attainment in 1912 of the MRCS and LRCP (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, known as the 'conjoint diploma'), marking his formal qualification to practice medicine. In the final year <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>studies,</b> Negus was an usher at the funeral service for Lord Lister at Westminster Abbey. Another connection with Lister's generation came when Negus worked as surgical dresser and house surgeon under Sir William Watson Cheyne, who had himself been house surgeon to Lister. The postgraduate stages of Negus's training involved specialisation in diseases of the ear, nose and throat, a direction influenced and guided by the otorhinolaryngologist St Clair Thomson (1857–1943). In the years following his qualification in 1912, Negus worked at King's College Hospital, and had started further clinical training at the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat in Golden Square, Soho, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>studies</b> give two thermoregulatory {{roles for}} the sail of Dimetrodon: {{one as a}} means of warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E
