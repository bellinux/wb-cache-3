It {{is based upon}} the analysis of the trial that is currently being conducted by the Marennes Oléron District on the Atlantic coast of France through the implementation of the Oléron Coastal Quality <b>Action</b> <b>Plan.</b> The author emphasizes three main aspects. At first, she exposes the general process that supported the emergence of the ICZM project of this district, highlighting the major role of early public participation, territorial planning and the design of <b>operational</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> She demon- strates that the implementation of coastal quality <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> can follow the integration building process of the ICZM iterative cycle, and thus support ICZM implementation. Then, she highlights the major role of science/management integration in the implementation of quality-based policies, showing in which way scientists can provide useful knowledge to practitioners at various stages of the decision-making process and contribute both to the development of public participation and success of these policies. At last, the author presents and discusses the lessons learnt from the follow up and analysis of the implementation of this <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> She emphasizes its strengths and weaknesses by putting it into the perspective of other French ICZM projects, and shows in which way the resolution of the problems faced by stake- holders in it realization contributes to the strengthening of their management capacity.

40|$|Increasing global {{competition}} within industry has forced businesses to respond by reducing costs and product development lead times {{in order to}} survive. In the automotive industry, these strategic responses include the specific exploitation of new technologies and mergers with other companies to gain economies of scale. BMW AG purchased Rover Group in 1994 but it wasn't until 1998 that competitive pressure led to {{the completion of the}} merger through the creation of a single "Group Function" structure within BMW Group. The BMW Board stated high-level objectives for the process but provided no mechanism to convert them into reality. Similarly, the BMW Group Board initiated a business process "Re-engineering" programme in 1997 / 8 and stated cost, time and other objectives {{that would have to be}} met. The technical and process changes that would help to achieve the business improvements were being largely driven from the bottom of the organisation but there were no frameworks available to guide strategic technology introduction. The principal innovations generated during the course of this research are frameworks for: • Maximising the business benefits from the creation of 'Group Functions' • Internal strategy creation for technology-based business sub-units These two new frameworks have for the first time provided management and staff with the means to develop meaningful strategies and <b>operational</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> from the corporate strategic objectives. The economic and business literature concentrates mainly on whole business strategy and merger activity, neglecting the need for guidance at the sub-corporate level. Although corporate strategy can provide the overall direction of a company, it is the managers that have to drive strategic change within the business. The frameworks were developed by the author based on an in-depth review of the literature and the specific context relating to Rapid Prototyping & Tooling (RP&T) within BMW. The frameworks were validated within the business situation and further enhanced where appropriate. The Group Function framework fills the process gap between the high-level objectives and the need for <b>operational</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> It provides a straightforward and easy to communicate structure to the process of optimising duplicated business subunits. Use of the framework led to the retention of both RP&T teams and the initiation of beneficial synergistic activities. The framework should be applicable to other similar groups in similar circumstances. The author developed a new strategy creation framework that for the first time combines a range of strategy development approaches from within the literature into a practical framework for sub-corporate strategy development. The framework was matched to the specific context of the RP&T case but could be used in other similar circumstances. The framework was used to successfully develop a new strategy for RP&T in BMW Group and includes new approaches developed by the author that reduce the impact of environmental change and uncertainty. The framework has been described in a stand alone form that can easily be more widely exploited...|$|R

40|$|As {{the impacts}} of climate change become more severe, coastal {{communities}} are required to prepare plans for adaptation to the invasive environmental changes. A well-prepared adaptation plan can effectively reduce the overall risks of coastal communities. However, a plan is not the final solution for the climate change on coastal communities. How to take the <b>plan</b> into <b>action</b> and implement it in the local communities and find the opportunities for the enhanced preparedness and development of coastal communities is the primary consideration of this thesis research. Many organizations are engaged in developing adaptation tools and guidebooks. For completing their adaptation plans, communities need to develop clear, <b>operational,</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> and discover the opportunities to enhance the sustainability of coastal communities. To make coastal communities more sustainable {{in the face of}} the changing climate, the public’s attention and community participation is critical. The purpose of this study is to develop an adaptation framework and <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> process system for coastal communities and at the same time, provide the general public with an enhanced opportunity to contribute their understanding about what is being done for their costal community around them and how to react when an event happens. The research is applied to the coastal communities of Richmond County, Cape Breton, Canada as a case study. The result of the work develops an adaptation “Action Plan” website for Richmond County. The website features the development, application, and simulation of a mobile communication “Action plan” application designed and implemented with the action website along to provide coastal community with communication options that exploit the local community network and enhance the community’s capacity for climate change adaptation.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the emergence of}} 'cultural diplomacy' within UK cultural policy to explore the policy-making process. The literature review in Chapter Two observes that instrumental cultural policies are largely discussed in philosophical and binary terms, rather than being investigated empirically or a more nuanced approach taken. Questions are raised as to the empirical grounding of cultural policy studies and a disconnection {{between theory and practice}} is identified, which proves to be a recurrent theme. The focus then shifts to an exploration of the methodological framework in Chapter Three. Based on a narrative account, the empirical process is defined, described and justified, outlining the sampling strategy, data collection methods and data analysis process. Within this, an empirical vacuum within cultural policy studies is revealed. Chapter Four argues that the written policy and strategy documents are rationales for the protection, survival and growth of the government department, agency and museum that they represent, as opposed to the <b>operational</b> <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> that they first appear or are assumed to be. Chapter Five presents the interview data to uncover the concealed mechanics of policy-making. Rather than being formalised as a written document, a new instrumental policy is created on the basis of informal verbal exchanges and social interactions between a cultural elite. This policy expands the scale and scope of existing cultural work, proving that instrumental policies can be beneficial, open, non-prescriptive and flexible, {{in stark contrast to the}} literature on the subject. The empirical data from document analysis and interviews reveal an unexpected scenario whereby the conventional power structure is subverted and the arts covertly resist top-down management. Chapter Six reflects on the case of cultural diplomacy in relation to the making of policy more generally. Drawing on a number of examples from political science, this chapter demonstrates that the findings from the empirical data are not distinct or unique, but are common features within social policy. The research concludes by calling for a better understanding of instrumental cultural policies. Recommendations are made to strengthen the empirical base of the field, reexamine key assumptions and look beyond cultural studies to ensure quality, accuracy and credibility within research. </p...|$|R

Besides economic impacts, aviation plays {{a pivotal role in}} connecting communities. The low cost flights have supported a strong demand growth. Neither reduction at source using quieter aircraft nor <b>operational</b> restrictions (noise <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> direct government regulation or voluntary airport initiatives) are delivering satisfactory mitigation. ICAO Balanced Approach to aircraft noise control consists of identifying noise problems at an airport, then analyzing various measures. Long-term measures must force the solutions at regional level: reduction of noise at source and certification; phase-out of non-certificated airplanes; noise charges; and land-use planning and management. Short-term measure must facilitate the solutions at local level, like noise abatement procedures and mitigation of aircraft operation. It is a major challenge for the future of air transport in the context of economic development linked to compliance with the conditions of people living near airports. The land use planning element of ICAO’s balanced approach is difficult to implement.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} improve the {{transition}} from an intention {{to a change in}} health behaviour, <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> is a frequently used behavioural change method. The quality of <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in terms of instrumentality and specificity is important in terms of supporting a successful change in health behaviour. Until now, little has been known about the predictors of <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> generation and the predictors of high quality <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and, therefore, the current study investigates these predictors. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted to improve physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption using a web-based computer tailored intervention. During the 8 -week intervention period, participants in the intervention arm (n[*]=[*] 346) were guided (step-by-step) to generate their own <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> to improve their health behaviours. Demographic characteristics, social cognitions, and health behaviour were assessed at baseline by means of self-reporting. Whether participants generated <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> was tracked by means of server registrations within two modules of the intervention. Results The <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> component of the intervention regarding physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption was used by 40. 9 and 20. 7  % of the participants, respectively. We found that participants who were physically active at baseline were less likely to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> concerning physical activity. With regards to generating fruit and vegetable <b>action</b> <b>plans,</b> participants with a high risk perception and a strong intention to eat fruit and vegetables on a daily basis made more use of the <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> component for this behaviour. Finally, the large majority of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> for physical activity (96. 6  %) and fruit and vegetable consumption (100  %) were instrumental and about half of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> were found to be highly specific (PA[*]=[*] 69. 6  %/FV[*]=[*] 59. 7  %). The specificity of the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> is associated with having a relationship and low levels of negative outcome expectancies. Conclusion Risk perception and intention are predictors of using the application of <b>action</b> <b>planning.</b> Increasing the motivation to change behaviour should be prioritised in interventions concerning changes in health behaviour before participants are asked to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> This would also make the intervention suitable for unmotivated people. For those participants who already perform the desired health behaviour prior to the intervention, <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> might be less relevant. Nevertheless, using a guided step-by-step approach to generate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> resulted in highly instrumental and specific <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> and might be integrated into other interventions concerning changes in health behaviour.

S cities {{in order to}} assess the degree to which climate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> are informed by such inventories and to identify choices and assumptions the inventories require that may influence climate <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> policies and proposed actions. We hope this will help planners preparing climate <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> make informed, clear, and defensible choices, as well as optimize policy development and implementation in their communities. In addition, we hope that this research will contribute to refining future GHG emissions inventory protocols and climate <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> methods...|$|R
