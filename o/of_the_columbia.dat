5|$|In the Canadian portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> Basin, {{almost half}} of {{which is part of}} the Kootenay River basin, there are 447 species of {{terrestrial}} vertebrates. Most of the Kootenay basin lies within the Columbia Glaciated ecoregion which encompasses much of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana and southern British Columbia. Fish fauna in the region are largely shared with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> Unglaciated ecoregion to the south, which has about fifty species of fish and only one endemic species. There are no endemic fish within the Columbia Glaciated region itself.|$|E
5|$|Over 70 {{percent of}} the Kootenay's {{watershed}} is in Canada while the Montana and Idaho portions occupy 23 and 6%, respectively. The Kootenay {{is one of the}} few major rivers in North America that begin in one country, cross into another, and return to the first—others include the Milk River, a tributary of the Missouri River; the Souris River, a tributary of the Assiniboine River; and the Kettle River, a tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> River. It is the third largest tributary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> by drainage basin and discharge.|$|E
5|$|The Cascades Rapids <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> River Gorge, and Kettle Falls and Priest Rapids {{in eastern}} Washington, were also major fishing and trading sites.|$|E

5|$|Ancestors of {{contemporary}} salamanders were likely able to disperse and migrate into habitats of the Rocky Mountains and surrounding areas by the Eocene. Mesic forests {{were established in}} western North America by the mid Eocene and attained their contemporary range distributions by the early Pliocene. The temperate forest valleys and montane environments of these time periods (Paleogene to Neogene) would have provided the physiographic and ecological features supporting analogs {{of contemporary}} Ambystoma macrodactylum habitats. The Cascade Range rose during the mid Pliocene and created a rain shadow effect causing the xerification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> Basin and also altered ranges of temperate mesic ecosystems at higher elevations. The rise of the Cascades causing the xerification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> Basin is a major biogeographic feature of western North America that divided many species, including A.macrodactylum, into coastal and inland lineages.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1881, {{industrialists}} proposed altering the natural channel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> to improve navigation. Changes {{to the river}} {{over the years have}} included the construction of jetties at the river's mouth, dredging, and the construction of canals and navigation locks. Today, ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver, and barges can reach as far inland as Lewiston, Idaho.|$|E

5|$|In 1825 the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) {{established}} Fort Vancouver on {{the bank}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia,</b> {{in what is now}} Vancouver, Washington, as the headquarters of the company's Columbia District, which encompassed everything west of the Rocky Mountains. John McLoughlin, a physician, was appointed Chief Factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> District. The HBC reoriented its Columbia District operations toward the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia, which became the region's main trunk route. In the early 1840s Americans began to colonize the Oregon country in large numbers via the Oregon Trail, despite the HBC's efforts to discourage American settlement in the region. For many the final leg of the journey involved travel down the lower Columbia River to Fort Vancouver. This part of the Oregon Trail, from The Dalles to Fort Vancouver, was the trail's most treacherous stretch, which prompted the 1846 construction of the Barlow Road.|$|E

In 1870, he sold two blocks of land in downtown to the City of Portland, which would become the Plaza Blocks between Third and Fourth avenues at Main Street.|$|E
