5|$|Schizophrenia affects around 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} {{at some point in}} their life, or 24million people {{worldwide}} as of 2011. It occurs 1.4times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men—the peak ages of <b>onset</b> are 25 years for males and 27 years for females. <b>Onset</b> in childhood is much rarer, as is <b>onset</b> in middle or old age.|$|E
5|$|Though {{dopamine}} agonists {{are less}} effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, {{they are usually}} effective enough to manage these symptoms {{in the first years}} of treatment. Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at <b>onset.</b> Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger <b>onset</b> PD, and levodopa is preferred for older <b>onset</b> PD.|$|E
30|$|However, {{as pointed}} out in [29], these precise {{annotations}} (raw <b>onsets)</b> do not necessarily represent human perceptions of <b>onsets</b> in spite of being musically correct. Thus, as this work addresses the human effort in the annotation/correction of <b>onsets,</b> the dataset was processed following the previous reference: all <b>onsets</b> within 30 ms were combined into one located at the arithmetic mean of their single positions. This process reduced {{the total number of}} elements to 25, 996 <b>onsets</b> (approximately, 81 <b>onsets</b> per file).|$|R
50|$|Some {{languages}} restrict <b>onsets</b> {{to be only}} {{a single}} consonant, while others allow multiconsonant <b>onsets</b> according to various rules. For example, in English, <b>onsets</b> such as pr-, pl- and tr- are possible but tl- is not, and sk- is possible but ks- is not. In Greek, however, both ks- and tl- are possible <b>onsets,</b> while contrarily in Classical Arabic no multiconsonant <b>onsets</b> are allowed at all.|$|R
30|$|<b>Onsets</b> in accompaniment: This factor {{defines the}} common {{individual}} <b>onsets</b> {{produced by the}} accompanying instrument(s) which do not occur in the track of the melody instrument w.r.t. to all <b>onsets.</b> We apply two factor levels: < 0.4 and > 0.6.|$|R
5|$|When the <b>onset</b> or coda of a root {{contains}} a consonant cluster, the consonants in this cluster must be ordered {{according to their}} sonority. The vowel constitutes a sonority peak, and the sonority must progressively rise in the <b>onset</b> and progressively fall in the coda.|$|E
5|$|A 1994 {{community-based}} {{study indicated}} that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for <b>onset</b> is 42.3 years, but <b>onset</b> can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women {{were found to be}} twice as likely to be affected as men.|$|E

40|$|The common view on {{the interplay}} between {{exogenous}} and endogenous orienting holds that abrupt <b>onsets</b> are not capable of attracting attention when they occur outside the current focus of attention. Does this also apply to sudden irrelevant auditory <b>onsets</b> and when irrelevant visual <b>onsets</b> occur far in the periphery? In addition, does focused attention also reduce the alerting effect of auditory <b>onsets,</b> or vice versa, do highly alerting stimuli distort the attentional state? Crossmodal and unimodal variants of the Posner paradigm were examined in two experiments with targets and irrelevant <b>onsets</b> occurring at 28. 3 and 19. 3 from fixation. Either centrally presented arrows indicated the forthcoming position of visual targets to be discriminated, or warning cues signaled the likely moment of target occurrence. The targets could be preceded by peripheral auditory or visual <b>onsets</b> that were to be ignored. Crossmodal and unimodal exogenous orienting effects of these irrelevant <b>onsets</b> were observed while participants focused at the relevant side. In addition, no evidence {{was found that the}} alerting effect of auditory <b>onsets</b> was dependent on focused attention. Our findings indicate that, at least under the current conditions, neither crossmodal nor unimodal orienting effects of peripheral events dissipate when attention is in a focused state...|$|R

In extreme cases, symptoms may occur before the dive has been completed.

The total duration of the set is 1 h and 42 min containing 27, 774 <b>onsets</b> with an average duration of 19 s per file (the shortest lasts 1 s and the largest one extends up to 3 min) and an average figure of 87 <b>onsets</b> per file (minimum of three <b>onsets</b> and maximum of 1132 <b>onsets).</b>|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that during visual search young and old adults' eye movements are equivalently influenced by the appearance of task-irrelevant abrupt <b>onsets.</b> The finding of ageequivalent oculomotor capture is quite surprising in light of the abundant research suggesting that older adults exhibit poorer inhibitory control than young adults on a variety of different tasks. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that oculomotor capture is age invariant when subjects' awareness of the appearance of taskirrelevant <b>onsets</b> is low, but that older adults will have more difficulty than young adults in inhibiting reflexive eye movements to taskirrelevant <b>onsets</b> when awareness of these objects is high. Our results were consistent with the level-of-awareness hypothesis. Young and old adults showed equivalent patterns of oculomotor capture with equiluminant <b>onsets,</b> but older adults misdirected their eyes to bright <b>onsets</b> more often than young adults did...|$|R
40|$|Various {{fields in}} speech {{research}} show that vowel <b>onsets</b> are perceptually {{among the most}} important phonetic events of a speech signal. An algorithm is presented that correctly detects the large majority of vowel <b>onsets</b> in running speech. It is based on the simple assumption that vowel <b>onsets</b> are characterized by the appearance of rapidly increasing resonance peaks in the amplitude spectrum. Based on the neurophysiology of the auditory nervous system, arguments are presented that identify vowel <b>onsets</b> with those speech intervals that induce a strong short-term adaptation, and point at those parts of the syllables where most of their significant information is concentrated. Implications for speech analysis are indicated...|$|R

5|$|People {{who engage}} in {{intellectual}} activities such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments, or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. This {{is compatible with the}} cognitive reserve theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the <b>onset</b> of dementia manifestations. Education delays the <b>onset</b> of AD syndrome without changing the duration of the disease. Learning a second language even later in life seems to delay getting Alzheimer disease.|$|E
30|$|The {{amount of}} <b>onsets</b> {{obtained}} by a detection algorithm {{may be defined}} as ND = NOK + NFP whereas {{the total number of}} <b>onsets</b> to be estimated can be expressed as NGT = NOK + NFN. Therefore, a user starting from the initial ND analysis should manually eliminate the NFP erroneous estimations and annotate the NFN missed <b>onsets,</b> thus requiring a total of CT = NFP + NFN corrections to obtain the correct annotation.|$|R
30|$|Finally, it must {{be pointed}} out that this {{assessment}} does not consider doubled <b>onsets</b> (two detections for a single ground truth element) and merged <b>onsets</b> (one detection for two ground truth elements) as they constitute subsets of NFP and NFN, respectively.|$|R

Xanthochromia remains a reliable ways to detect SAH several days after the <b>onset</b> of headache. An interval of at least 12hours between the <b>onset</b> of the headache and lumbar puncture is required, as it takes several hours for the hemoglobin from the red blood cells to be metabolized into bilirubin.|$|E

40|$|New episodes and new <b>onsets</b> {{of major}} {{depression}} in borderline and other personality disorders☆ Background: In {{the context of}} much literature and conjecture about the relationship of personality disorders (PD) and major Journal of Affective Disorders 111 (2008) 40 – 45 www. elsevier. com/locate/jaddepressive disorder (MDD), this paper uses longitudinal data to assess {{the frequency with which}} PD patients, and especially those with borderline personality disorder (BPD), have recurrences (for patients with lifetime histories), or new <b>onsets</b> (for patients without lifetime histories) of MDD. Methods: A sample of 478 PD patients received reliable repeated follow-up assessments over a period of 6 years. The rates of new <b>onsets</b> and recurrences of MDD in all PD patients, and in BPD patients compared to OPD patients were analyzed. Whether age, gender, GAF score, or the number and types of BPD criteria predict new <b>onsets</b> or recurrences of MDD was also examined. Results: Eighty-five percent of PD subjects had episodes of MDD during the 6 year follow-up; of those with lifetime MDD, 85 % had recurrences. Of the PD subjects without lifetime MDD, 44 % had new <b>onsets.</b> BPD subjects were significantly more likely (p=. 0036) to have recurrences of MDD but were about equally likely to have new <b>onsets</b> compared to OPD subjects. The number and types of BPD criteria were predictive of <b>onsets</b> and recurrences for all PDs, but were not more predictive for the BPD than OPD subsamples...|$|R
