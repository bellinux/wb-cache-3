2500|$|What {{would they}} do with the 50,000 civilians in the two cities… Not even Ben-Gurion could offer a solution, and during the {{discussion}} at <b>operation</b> <b>headquarters,</b> he remained silent, as was his habit in such situations. Clearly, we could not leave [...] hostile and armed populace in our rear, where it could endanger the supply route [...] advancing eastward… Allon repeated the question: What {{is to be done}} with the population? Ben-Gurion waved his hand in a gesture that said: Drive them out!… [...] "Driving out" [...] is a term with a harsh ring… Psychologically, {{this was one of the}} most difficult actions we undertook. The population of [...] did not leave willingly. There was no way of avoiding the use of force and warning shots in order to make the inhabitants march the 10 to 15 miles to the point where they met up with the legion.

2500|$|Under {{pressure}} from Winston Churchill to start raiding operations, Combined <b>Operation</b> <b>Headquarters</b> {{came up with}} Operation Collar. The objective of Operation Collar {{was to be a}} reconnaissance of the French coast and to capture prisoners. The raid was to take place just three weeks after Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk, and the French had just signed the Second Armistice at Compiègne with Germany on 22 June 1940. The newly formed British Commandos were not yet adequately trained and most units were still short of troops. So one of the independent companies which {{were in the process of}} being absorbed into the commandos was selected. The unit chosen was No. 11 Independent Company, under the command of Major Ronnie Tod of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. No. 11 Company had been raised after the other Independent Companies on [...] 14 June 1940. They were formed by asking for volunteers from the men already serving in the other companies and [...] had an establishment of 25 officers and 350 other ranks.|$|E

50|$|With {{effect from}} 1 January 2007, the EU {{will have a}} third option for commanding, from Brussels, {{missions}} and operations of limited size (that is, {{like that of a}} battlegroup: some 2,000 troops). On that date, the new EU Operations Centre (EUOC) within the EU Military Staff (EUMS) will be ready for action. Using some EUMS core staff, as well as some extra “double-hatted” EUMS officers and so-called “augmentees” from the Member States, the EU will have an increased capacity to respond to crisis management situations. So far, the EU has had two options as to how to run a military operation at the <b>Operation</b> <b>Headquarters</b> (OHQ) level. One option is, in a so-called “autonomous” operation, to make use of facilities provided by any of the five <b>Operation</b> <b>Headquarters</b> (OHQs) currently available in European Member States. A second option is, through recourse to NATO capabilities and common assets (under the so-called “Berlin plus” arrangements), to make use of command and control options such as <b>Operation</b> <b>Headquarters</b> located at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium and D-SACEUR as the Operation Commander. This is the option used in the conduct of Operation ALTHEA, where EUFOR BiH operates in Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
