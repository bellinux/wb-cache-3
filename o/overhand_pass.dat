The Wolfpack, who were not expecting the defensive adjustment, were forced to deviate and began passing the ball around just to keep the Cougars from stealing it. Houston nearly got the turnover it was looking for when Whittenburg made an errant pass to Gannon that Drexler nearly came away with before the sophomore regained control. The ball eventually found its way to Sidney Lowe, who found Bailey standing in the lower left-hand corner of the court and passed it his way so he could take the shot. Bailey, however, wanted no part of Lowe's idea as he had not had a good half shooting the ball and began looking back toward Whittenburg.

40|$|How {{impactful}} is volleyball’s ‘serve-reception game’? Its efficacy {{has been}} found to discriminate between winning and losing a match. But how does reception become (in) effective? Based on the theoretical rationale of ecological dynamics, we e hypothesized that skilled receivers in volleyball would not display ready-made responses, but rather would co-adapt action modes during serve-reception to deal with the specific, emergent constraints of service to achieve ttask goals. In order to examine this issue we investigated whether the co-adaptation of serve and reception action modes {{was a significant predictor of}} set outcome in elite volleyball performance (win or loss), analysing the first and last sets of the 2014 World League Finals matches (897 game-sequences). The power-jump and jump-float were the serving modes observed and the overhand, underhand-lateral and underhand-frontal passes were the reception modes categorized. We found that the co- adaptation of serve and reception action modes predicted set outcome in the final set of a match. Receiving the jump-float serve with an <b>overhand</b> <b>pass</b> or underhand-lateral pass increased the odds of winning the final set by 200 per cent. Results suggested that, at an expert level, mastering the <b>overhand</b> <b>pass</b> and the underhand lateral pass gives teams a competitive edge.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{teaching}} methods for beginners' volleyball class. Two {{models of the}} methods were selected through analysing various ideas to improve skills and results of our previous experimental lessons. The characteristics of two models were as follows. (1) Model A was a game-center learning. In this model, each skill of underhand pass, <b>overhand</b> <b>pass,</b> service, spike, and team play was separately learned and after every lesson games were played as an actual practice of the learning. (2) Model C was a learning centered on the offensive combination skill. In this model, team plays were mainly learned with focus on the toss-spike skill. The hours alloted for the game were {{about half of the}} model A. (3) In both models, lessons were done by "small group learning", and games were played in accordance with a special rule allowing to contact the ball a maximam of 4 times before returning it to the opposite court. Two different classes (of the model A and C), each with 20 school hours, were executed by the same teacher in the first classes of a junior high school. The learning results of both models were evaluated by the skill test, the analysis of team plays during the games, and the investigation on the attitude of students to physical education class-the attitude was substantiated by a questionary (standardized by A. Kobayashi). The major findings are as follows. (1) Personal skills were well developed in both models. But, in the model A underhand pass skill and in the model C <b>overhand</b> <b>pass</b> skill were more developed. (2) The difference of rally times in a game was not observed between two models. However, the times of hiting ball in a game were more frequent in the model C. Especially, frequency of hiting ball 3 or 4 times in the same court was significantly higher in model C. (3) Also the offensive team plays (toss-spike) were observed more frequently in the model C, but the games of the model A were mainly played by underhand pass rallys. (4) As the results of investigation on the attitude to physical education class, model A obtained the evaluation "fairly successful", but could not get good scores concerning the items of human relationship. The evaluation of model C was "very successful"...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the current status of {{accuracy}} in volleyball for the students of the faculty of physical education and sports of the University of Prishtina, all the students have successfully passed the exam in volleyball. Also, another aim was to observe whether there are significant statistical differences between both generations of students. In the study were included 70 students (35 from the second academic year and 35 from the fourth academic year). To achieve the aim, were applied standard tests of accuracy in volleyball, such as the following: <b>overhand</b> <b>pass,</b> underhand pass, as well as underhand serve on the six positions and float (tactic) serve on three positions. From the basic statistical parameters, it has been noticed that grouping of results from the students of forth academic year are more homogenous, and for this group showed that results are better than at students of first year of studying. While, in the variables is noticed that there are changes into the favour of students of fourth academic year, it has also been noticed that standard deviation is smaller with this group, which shows even more homogenous groups, for example, SFIP group 1 mean 21. 65 ± 6. 48 SD, gr. 2 mean 23. 68 ± 5. 76 SD. The obtained results from T-test shows significant statistical changes in both applied tests. The best obtained results are a derivate of continuous professional work, as well as result of “selection”, due to continuous testing and completion of both exams of hand sports and volleyball as an elective subject...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the successfulness of tactics of serve and serve {{reception}} of the national teams who participated in Pool B of European Men’s Volleyball Championship in 2015. The study included four national teams: Estonia, France, Croatia and Italy. A total of six games and 912 serves were analysed. Data were collected using the statistics program Data Volley 2007. The data were transferred to Microsoft Excel 2010, which was used for data analysis. Additional statistical analysis was performed using the program SPSS Statistics 21. For jump float serve, the most preferable service zone was zone 5. The serves from this zone were also the most dangerous. For power jump serve, the most preferable service zone was zone 1. From this zone the smallest number of faults were made at power jump serve, but also the smallest number of ace serves and serves after which the opponent could not use all attack combinations were performed. Substitute players who came game only to perform serves showed the same efficiency in jump float serve as starting players. Among the performers of power jump serves, the starting players could perform more ace serves, but there were also more serves after which the opponent could use all attack combinations. Thus, the serve efficiency was relatively similar for both types of players. Players using the power jump serve were more likely to earn a point with their first serve than the performers of jump float serve. The likeliness of earning a point with the second consecutive serve increased for players using the jump float serve, but remained the same for performers of power jump serve. At power jump serve, service faults occurred more often after timeout than in play, but good serves were hit equally after timeout and in play. At jump float serve, the number of faults was the same after timeout and in play, but good serves, both aces and serves after which was not possible to use all attack combinations, were more often hit after timeout. Underhand pass was used for receiving float serve almost twice more often than <b>overhand</b> <b>pass,</b> even though the accuracy of the latter was higher...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Study Design: Controlled Laboratory Study. Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{kinematics}} and kinetics of the overhand throwing motion while throwing a football pass and a baseball fastball pitch. Background: Though the football throw seems similar to the overhand baseball throw except for the weight of the balls [. 42 kg football versus. 14 kg baseball] the weight has been shown to affect shoulder position and stress throughout the throwing motion [6, 11]. In addition, a football quarterback is at risk of shoulder injury as is a baseball pitcher. It is often stated that football quarterbacks are at risk of shoulder injury secondary to both the throwing motion and direct contact. No matter the weight of the ball, there should still be proper kinematics and sequential activation of the kinetic chain. Previous studies have been conducted examining those individuals who played baseball pitcher versus those who were football quarterback [6]. However there has yet to be a study examining those individuals who are dual sport players, baseball pitcher and football quarterback. Therefore the {{purpose of this}} study was to examine throwing kinematics and sequential activation of the segments of the same individual while throwing both a football pass and a baseball fastball pitch. It was hypothesized that both throws would display sequentiality; however, the baseball throw would have greater segmental speeds and there would be significant differences between throwing kinematics. Methods: Kinematic analysis was performed while 12 male athletes who play dual positions of quarterback and pitcher performed the two <b>overhand</b> throws: football <b>passing</b> and baseball pitching. Data were collected and analyzed for the four major events (foot contact, maximum shoulder external rotation, ball release, and maximum shoulder internal rotation) during the overhand throwing motion. Results: A multivariate analysis of variance revealed that there were significant differences between football and baseball throwing at foot contact in the degree of elbow flexion in the throwing arm and in the velocity of hip rotation among the two throws (p 3 ̆c. 05). There was also a significant difference at maximum external rotation in the degree of elbow flexion in the throwing arm (p 3 ̆c. 05). Conclusions: This study examined overhand throwing mechanics during both a football pass and a baseball pitch. Results showed that differences existed between football and baseball throwing. Throwing mechanics of individuals who play both positions of quarterback and pitcher are similar to previous data describing the two throws. Although this study did not pinpoint specific benefits from playing both pitcher and quarterback, it appears that there are no consequences to the throwing motions of athletes who play both positions. Further study with perhaps a larger sample size could look to see if injury susceptibility was higher due to more throwing and training over the course of time.

40|$|Serve and serve-reception {{performance}} {{have predicted}} success in volleyball. Given {{the impact of}} serve-reception on the game, we aimed at understanding what {{it is in the}} serve and receiver’s actions that determines the selection of the type of pass used in serve-reception and its efficacy. Four high-level players received jump-float serves from four servers in two reception zones – zone 1 and 5. The ball and the receiver’s head were tracked with two video cameras, allowing 3 D world-coordinates reconstruction. Logistic-regression models were used to predict the type of pass used (overhand or underhand) and serve-reception efficacy (error, out, or effective) from variables related with the serve kinematics and related with the receiver’s on-court positioning and movement. Receivers’ initial position was different when in zone 1 and 5. This influenced the serve-related variables as well as the type of pass used. Strong predictors of using an underhand rather than <b>overhand</b> <b>pass</b> were higher ball contact of the server, reception in zone 1, receiver’s initial position more {{to the back of the}} court and backward receiver movement. Receiver’s larger longitudinal displacements and an initial position more to the back of the court had a strong relationship with the decreasing of the serve-reception efficacy. Receivers’ positioning and movement were the factors with the largest impact on the type of pass used and the efficacy of the reception. Reception zone affected the variance in the ball’s kinematics (with the exception of the ball’s lateral displacement), as well as in the receivers’ positioning (distances from the net and from the target). Also the reception zone was associated with the type of pass used by the receiver but not with reception efficacy. Given volleyball’s rotation rule, the receiver needs to master receiving in the different reception zones; he/she needs to adapt to the diverse constraints of each zone to maintain performance efficacy. Thus, being able to flexibly vary positioning and passing, given local (zone) constraints, can yield an advantage in high-level volleyball serve-reception. Further research needs to consider other serve modes (e. g., power-jump serve) and a full-court context of performance to support the present study’s findings...|$|E
