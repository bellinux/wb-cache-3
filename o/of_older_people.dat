40|$|OBJECTIVES: Why are <b>older</b> <b>people</b> {{perceived}} as more competent {{in some countries}} relative to others? In the current study, we investigate {{the extent to which}} national variation in perceptions <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> competence is systematically related to national variation in the extent to which <b>older</b> <b>people</b> participate in paid and volunteer work. METHOD: We used multilevel regression to analyze data from the European Social Survey and test the relationship between perceptions <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> competence and <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> participation in paid and volunteer work across 28 countries. We controlled for a number of potentially confounding variables, including life expectancy as well as the gender ratio and average education <b>of</b> the <b>older</b> population in each country. We controlled for the average objective cognitive abilities <b>of</b> the <b>older</b> population in a subsample of 11 countries. RESULTS: Older people were {{perceived as}} more competent in countries in which more <b>older</b> <b>people</b> participated in paid or volunteer work, independent of life expectancy and the average education, gender makeup, and average cognitive abilities <b>of</b> the <b>older</b> population. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> participation in paid and volunteer work is related to perceptions <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> competence independent <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> actual competence...|$|R

40|$|The senilization of {{the rural}} {{population}} and the problem <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>people</b> are not specific to Yugoslavia alone but are a corollary of modern industrial development in all developing countries. In Yugoslavia this process serves as a special indicator of the social changes and transformation {{taking place in the}} country’s rural areas. In the social strukture of the Yugoslav society, old peasant households already form a major social category with a special social position. Their common characteristic {{can be seen in the}} rapid rate at which they are dying out both biologically and productively. In this article the author discusses the results obtained by one of his investigations. He analyses the social position <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>people</b> in rural districts from the point of view of social changes in family groups, of changes in relations between the generations, and of the social insurance <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>people.</b> The author deals especially with the problem of the social insurance <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>people.</b> Social development in Yugoslavia since the war has destroyed the peasant 2 ̆ 7 s traditional form of old-age social security while a new one is not yet available, the peasant family’s protective role is nowdays seriously endangered and the social position <b>of</b> <b>old</b> persons within the family has essentially changed. Thus it is not accidental that certain sociologists regard the present generation <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>people</b> in rural districts as deprived of their rights. In conclusion the author calls for efforts on the part of the Yugoslav society to try and find a speedy and humane solution for the problem <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>people</b> in rural districts...|$|R

For the same reason, <b>old</b> <b>people’s</b> households, although possessing small farms, often lease their land or use hired labour and equipment. The article also deals with the pattern of spending both <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>people’s</b> and <b>of</b> agricultural households: generally, <b>old</b> <b>people’s</b> households appear to spend twice less and to have a less favourable structure of expenses, because they spend a comparatively larger proportion of their money on maintaining production while investing 7. 5 times less money in development and modernization than do agricultural households which have enough man-power available.

25|$|Disengagement {{theory is}} the idea that {{separation}} <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>people</b> from active roles in society is normal and appropriate, and benefits both society and older individuals. Disengagement theory, first proposed by Cumming and Henry, has received considerable attention in gerontology, but has been much criticised. The original data on which Cumming and Henry based the theory were from a rather small sample of older adults in Kansas City and from this select sample Cumming and Henry then took disengagement to be a universal theory. There are research data suggesting that the elderly who do become detached from society are those who were initially reclusive individuals and such disengagement is not purely a response to ageing.|$|E

25|$|Given the well-recognized role of {{cholesterol}} in cardiovascular disease, {{some studies have}} shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality. A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes.

The researchers attributed this phenomenon {{to the fact that}} people with severe chronic diseases or cancer tend to have below-normal cholesterol levels. This explanation is not supported by the Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Promotion Programme, in which men of all ages and women over 50 with very low cholesterol were likely to die of cancer, liver diseases, and mental diseases. This result indicates the low-cholesterol effect occurs even among younger respondents, contradicting the previous assessment among cohorts <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>people</b> that this is a proxy or marker for frailty occurring with age.|$|E
