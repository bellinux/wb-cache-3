Stereo-based models can be illumination-invariant, but often have undefined values which inevitably lead to foreground classification errors. We derive dense stereo models for object tracking using long-term, extended dynamic-range imagery, and by detecting and interpolating uniform but unoccluded planar regions. Foreground points are detected quickly in new images using pruned disparity search. We adopt a "late-segmentation" strategy, using an integrated plan-view density representation. Foreground points are segmented into object regions only when a trajectory is finally estimated, using a dynamic programming-based method. <b>Object</b> <b>entry</b> and exit are optimally determined and are not restricted to special spatial zones...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates {{fluid and}} {{floating}} object interaction using a novel {{adaptation of the}} weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (WCSPH) method by incorporating a floating object model. In particular, this paper examines the water impact, hydrody-namic forces, fluid motions, and movement of objects in the conventional case studies of <b>object</b> <b>entry</b> and exit from still water. A two-dimensional wedge drop analysis was examined, and the hydrodynamic forces show acceptable agreement with published experimental and numerical results. The movement of the object is well predicted. The velocity field of the fluid domain is also captured. Simulations for water entry and exit of a buoyant and neutral density cylinder compares well with previous experimental, numerical, and empirical studies in penetration, free surface comparisons, and object movement. These results provide a good foundation to evaluate the accuracy and stability of WCSPH for modeling the interaction between free surface flow and free moving floating objects.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{light-weight}} event-driven protocol for wireless camera networks {{to allow for}} formation and propagation of clusters of cameras {{for the purpose of}} collaborative processing during object tracking. Cluster formation is triggered by the detection of objects with specific features. Our protocol allows for simultaneous formation and propagation of multiple clusters. Cameras being directional devices, more than one cluster may track a single object since groups of cameras outside each others communication range may see the same <b>object.</b> <b>Entry</b> into a cluster and cluster membership maintenance require a sensor node to confirm the presence of features of the object being tracked. Each cluster elects its own leader among the cameras that observe the same target. When a cluster leader loses track of an object, it assigns the leadership role to another cluster member. To avoid high communication overhead among cluster members, singlehop clusters are formed, i. e., every member of a cluster is within the communication range of the cluster head. We have implemented a simple version of this protocol on a test-bed and provide an experimental evaluation. Index Terms — sensor clustering, object tracking, collaborative processing 1...|$|E

40|$|Temporarily Captured Orbiters (TCOs) are Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) {{which make}} a few orbits of Earth before {{returning}} to heliocentric orbits. Only one TCO has been observed to date, 2006 RH 120, captured by Earth for one year before escaping. Detailed modeling predicts capture should occur from the NEO population predominantly through the Sun-Earth L 1 and L 2 points, with 1 % of TCOs impacting Earth and approximately 0. 1 % of meteoroids being TCOs. Although thousands of meteoroid orbits have been measured, none until now have conclusively exhibited TCO behaviour, largely due to difficulties in measuring initial meteoroid speed with sufficient precision. We report on a precise meteor observation of January 13, 2014 by {{a new generation of}} all-sky fireball digital camera systems operated in the Czech Republic as part of the European Fireball Network, providing the lowest natural <b>object</b> <b>entry</b> speed observed in decades long monitoring by networks world-wide. Modeling atmospheric deceleration and fragmentation yields an initial mass of ~ 5 kg and diameter of 15 cm, with a maximum Earth-relative velocity just over 11. 0 km/s. Spectral observations prove its natural origin. Back-integration across observational uncertainties yields a 92 - 98 % probability of TCO behaviour, with close lunar dynamical interaction. The capture duration varies across observational uncertainties from 48 days to 5 + years. We also report on two low-speed impacts recorded by US Government sensors, and we examine Prairie Network event PN 39078 from 1965 having an extremely low entry speed of 10. 9 km/s. In these cases uncertainties in measurement and origin make TCO designation uncertain. Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomical Journa...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} WCSPH model by {{considering}} fluid entry and exit, and integrates the WCSPH method into a new, novel, particle-based Bluff Morphology Model (BMM). Using the BMM, this thesis investigates the stability, collapse and equilibrium position of soft coastal bluffs (cliffs). Fluid and floating object interaction using a novel {{adaptation of the}} WCSPH method is investigated by incorporating a floating object model. In particular, this thesis examines the water impact, hydrodynamic forces, fluid motions, and movement of objects in the conventional case studies of <b>object</b> <b>entry</b> and exit from still water. A two-dimensional wedge drop analysis was examined, and the hydrodynamic forces show acceptable agreement with published experimental and numerical results. Simulations for water entry and exit of a buoyant and neutral density cylinder compares well with the previous experimental, numerical and empirical studies. These results provide a good foundation to evaluate the accuracy and stability of WCSPH for modelling complex flows, and therefore offers a platform {{for the use of}} WCSPH in a Bluff Morphology Model. The BMM combines a multiple wedge displacement method with an adapted Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH) method. At first the wedge method is applied to compute the stability of the bluff. Once the critical failure mechanism of the bluff slope has been identified, if the Factor of Safety for the mechanism is less than 1, the adapted WCSPH method is used to predict the failure movement and residual shape of the slope. The model is validated against benchmark test cases of bluff stability for purely frictional, purely cohesive, and mixed strength bluff materials including 2 D static water tables. The model predictions give a good correlation with the expected values, with medium resolution models producing errors of typically less than 2. 0 %. In addition, the prediction of lateral movement of a surveyed cliff and the dynamic collapse of a vertical bluff are computed, and compare well with published literature. This model is further extended to then investigate the effect of two dimensional seepage on the stability and collapse of soil slopes and levees. To incorporate the seepage in the model, Darcy’s Law is applied to the interactions among neighbouring soil particles and ghost particles are introduced along the enclosed soil boundary to ensure that no fluid crosses the boundary. The contribution of partially saturated soils and matric suction, as well as the change in hydraulic conductivity due to seepage, are predicted well by this model. The predicted time evolution of slope stability and seepage induced collapse are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results for homogeneous frictional sand and multiple layered cohesive soils. Rapid drawdown over a sand soil is also investigated, and the location and time of the levee collapse occurrence are captured well. A toe erosion model is incorporated within the numerical model, and the location and quantity of erosion caused by lateral seepage is well predicted. The interplay of erosion, seepage and slope instability is examined. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
