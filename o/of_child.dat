40|$|Purpose. Parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> with {{cerebral}} palsy (CP) {{may be at risk}} from poor psychosocial well-being, compared with parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> without a long-term health condition (LTHC). However, research has produced some conflicting findings on the topic and no comparison studies have been conducted in the UK. Furthermore, studies have only used measures of negative psychosocial well-being. The aim {{of this study was to}} conduct a comparative study <b>of</b> parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> with CP and parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> without a LTHC in the UK. Method. Seventy parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> with CP and 70 parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> without a LTHC completed self-administered questionnaires, comprising measures of psychosocial distress and positive psychosocial well-being. Results. This study demonstrated that parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> with CP have significantly poorer psychosocial well-being compared with parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> without a LTHC: parents <b>of</b> <b>children</b> with CP had lower satisfaction with life and higher levels of anxious and depressed mood. Conclusions. These results suggest caring for a child with CP may put parents at risk from poor psychosocial well-being. Interventions to improve parental well-being are urgently needed. ...|$|R

Based on this model, in the current study, parents derive utility from quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> The sex composition <b>of</b> <b>children</b> in this model {{is viewed as a}} source of utility related to the quality <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> If parents are not satisfied with the sex composition <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> they {{will be more likely to}} expand their family to draw utility from quantity <b>of</b> <b>children</b> or from a more desired composition <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> Therefore, having more children is a response to dissatisfaction from the sex composition <b>of</b> the <b>children.</b>|$|R
