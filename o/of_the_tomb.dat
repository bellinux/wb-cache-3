5|$|During Microsoft's E3 2014 presentation, Rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tomb</b> Raider was {{announced}} as a sequel. At Gamescom 2014, Microsoft announced during its press briefing that Rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tomb</b> Raider would be exclusive to Xbox consoles at launch. The exclusivity is timed, with Square Enix, the game's developer, allowed {{to release the}} title to other platforms after an unspecified period of time. In December 2014, Microsoft announced {{that they would be}} publishing the title for its release on Xbox consoles. Rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tomb</b> Raider was released on 10 November 2015 for Xbox One and Xbox 360, and 28 January 2016 for Microsoft Windows. The PlayStation 4 version was released on 11 October 2016, titled the 20 Year Celebration, as it was released 20 years after the original Tomb Raider game. This version includes all of the previously released DLC.|$|E
5|$|Peribsen {{was buried}} in the tomb P of the royal {{cemetery}} at Umm el-Qa'ab near Abydos. The first excavation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> started in 1898 under the supervision of French archaeologist and Egyptologist Émile Amélineau. This first foray was followed by excavations in 1901 and 1902 under the supervision of British archaeologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie. Further exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> was undertaken in 1928 by the Swiss Egyptologist Edouard Naville.|$|E
5|$|An inscribed block {{dating to}} the later Ramesside period (1292–1077 BC) and now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, was {{uncovered}} by Lepsius {{in a house in}} Abusir and shows Menkauhor enthroned beside four other deified kings of the Old Kingdom: the name of the first, partially lost, but probably Sneferu is then followed by Djedefre, Menkaure, Menkauhor and finally Neferkare. The owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> stands before the kings, in worship. Another relief {{dating to the}} same period shows a similar scene. It was inscribed on the lintel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> chapel of Mahy buried in Saqqara North. Four deified kings of the Old Kingdom are shown, all of whom built their pyramids at Saqqara: Djoser, Teti, Userkaf and Menkauhor.|$|E
50|$|Along <b>the</b> {{eastern edge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old City, the now named Jericho Road descends into the Kidron Valley, also {{known by its}} biblical name, <b>the</b> Valley <b>of</b> Josaphat. <b>The</b> valley is <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> many tombs: <b>the</b> <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Virgin Mary, <b>the</b> Pillar <b>of</b> Absalom, <b>the</b> <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> Benei Hezir, <b>the</b> <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> Zechariah, <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Josaphat and <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Saint James.|$|R
5|$|During {{the later}} Third Intermediate Period and later periods, {{intrusive}} burials were introduced into many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open <b>tombs.</b> In Coptic times, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> {{were used as}} churches, stables, and even houses.|$|R

5|$|Burial 48 is {{generally}} accepted as {{the tomb of}} Siyaj Chan K'awil. It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis. The chamber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> was cut from the bedrock and contained {{the remains of the}} king himself together with those of two adolescents who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler. The walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457, probably the date of either the death or interment of the king. The king's skeleton was missing its skull, its femurs and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{archaeologist}} {{and historian}} Patrick Healy discovered {{the remains of}} a prehistoric wedge tomb in the woods. All the survives is the skeletal outline of the main chamber and the outer double walls. Most of the stones were removed to build the low stone wall that runs across the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|James {{was buried}} in Westminster Abbey. The {{position}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> was lost for many years until his lead coffin {{was found in the}} Henry VII vault in the 19th century, during an excavation.|$|E

50|$|Four tombs {{belonging}} to Achaemenid kings are carved out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock face at a considerable height above <b>the</b> ground. <b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> are sometimes {{known as the}} Persian crosses, after <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tombs.</b> <b>The</b> entrance to each <b>tomb</b> is at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> each cross, which opens onto to a small chamber, where the king lay in a sarcophagus. <b>The</b> horizontal beam <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb's</b> facades {{is believed to be}} a replica of a Persepolitan entrance.|$|R
5|$|The Safdarjung tomb, {{the last}} monumental tomb {{garden of the}} Mughals, was planned and built like an {{enclosed}} garden tomb {{in line with the}} style of the Humayun tomb. It was completed in 1754. The slabs from the tomb of Abdul Rahim Khankhana were used in the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|The astronomical ceiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> of Senenmut (BC) {{contains}} the Celestial Diagram depicting circumpolar constellations {{in the form}} of discs. Each disc is divided into 24 sections suggesting a 24-hour time period. Constellations are portrayed as sacred deities of Egypt. The observation of lunar cycles is also evident.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronology}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> monument's completion is {{not precisely}} known, but portions {{can be determined}} from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine notary, in 1424 (by the Florentine calendar) part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> was installed. Michelozzo's Catasto from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner {{for about two years}} ("due anni o incircha") and that three-fourths of the 800florin budget had been spent. To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Ramesses III (known as Bruce's <b>Tomb</b> or <b>The</b> Harper's <b>Tomb</b> {{due to its}} decoration) is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>tombs</b> in <b>the</b> {{valley and}} {{is open to the}} public. It is located close to the central 'rest–area', and its {{location}} and superb decoration make this one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> most visited by tourists.|$|R

5|$|The son of Seti, Ramesses the Great, {{constructed}} a massive tomb, KV7, {{but it is}} in a ruinous state. It is currently undergoing excavation and conservation by a Franco-Egyptian team led by Christian Leblanc. The tomb is vast in size, about the same length, and a larger area, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> of his father.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{suggested}} that the barrow was constructed before the chamber, {{and that it was}} used as a ramp on which to drag the large stones into position. He {{suggested that}} these megaliths were covered with sand until the capstones were placed atop the chamber, at which the sand was then cleared. In 1950, it was stated that fourteen of the stones currently survive, although following full excavation it was revealed that eighteen large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the drystone wall and pavement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{powerful}} and influential nobles {{began to be}} buried with the royal family; {{the most famous of}} these tombs is the joint tomb of Yuya and Tjuyu, KV46. They were possibly the parents of Queen Tiy. Until the discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> of Tutankhamun, this was the best-preserved of the tombs that had been discovered in the Valley.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> differs {{significantly}} from <b>the</b> other. <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Chugyedang, on <b>the</b> right, has <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> a stone lantern where <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Sayeongdang, to <b>the</b> left, has <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> a bronze temple bell.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> are {{not open}} to <b>the</b> public (18 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> visitors to KV62 {{has led to a}} separate charge for entry into <b>the</b> <b>tomb.</b> <b>The</b> West Valley has only one open tomb—that of Ay—and a separate ticket is needed to visit this <b>tomb.</b> <b>The</b> tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside <b>the</b> <b>tombs,</b> and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through <b>the</b> <b>tombs.</b> This is to minimize time in <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> and prevent <b>the</b> crowds from damaging <b>the</b> surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decoration. Photography is no longer allowed in <b>the</b> <b>tombs.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bricks {{lining the}} walls of the tombs of wealthy Han were adorned with carved or molded reliefs and painted murals; these often showed scenes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> occupant's estate, halls, wells, {{carriage}} sheds, pens for cattle, sheep, chickens, and pigs, stables for horses, and employed workers picking mulberry leaves, plowing crop fields, and hoeing vegetable patches.|$|E
5|$|Henry's burial at Reading Abbey {{is marked}} by a local cross, but Reading Abbey was slowly {{demolished}} during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. The exact location is uncertain, but the most likely location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> itself is now in a built-up area of central Reading, {{on the site of the}} former abbey choir. A plan to locate his remains was announced in March 2015, with support from English Heritage and Philippa Langley, who aided with the successful exhumation of Richard III.|$|E
5|$|Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all {{visited the}} tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula {{was said to}} have taken Alexander's {{breastplate}} from the tomb for his own use. Around AD200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> are hazy.|$|E

50|$|During the Ming dynasty <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> {{were off}} limits to commoners, but in 1644 Li Zicheng's army ransacked and set many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> on fire before {{advancing}} and capturing Beijing in April of that year.|$|R
5|$|The Nineteenth Dynasty saw {{a further}} {{standardisation}} of tomb layout and decoration. The {{tomb of the}} first king of the dynasty, Ramesses I, was hurriedly finished due {{to the death of}} the king and {{is little more than a}} truncated descending corridor and a burial chamber. However, KV16 has vibrant decoration and still contains the sarcophagus of the king. Its central location makes it one of the more frequently visited tombs. It shows the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> entrance and passage and of decoration.|$|E
5|$|The earthen mound {{that once}} covered the tomb is now visible {{only as an}} {{undulation}} approximately 46 centimetres (1 foot, 6 inches) in height. In the 19th century, the mound was higher on the western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb,</b> although during the 1920s this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath. It is probable that in the Early Neolithic, the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it, and it is inside this ditch that the kerb-stones now sit.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Mars as a wandering {{object in the}} night sky was recorded by ancient Egyptian astronomers. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the apparent retrograde motion of the planet, in which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed on the ceiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> of Seti I, on the Ramesseum ceiling, and in the Senenmut star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} maintains two cemeteries. The cemetery on {{the western}} outskirts contain both tombs and burial plots. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> are have neo-classical monuments.|$|R
25|$|Whether <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> was a decoy (one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 72 <b>tombs</b> {{mentioned}} in legend): The experts said that <b>the</b> legend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 72 <b>tombs</b> is not reliable {{as compared to}} information from historical sources, and that the legend should not be regarded seriously. They cited <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Dynasty <b>Tombs</b> in Ci County, Handan, Hebei, which were previously mistakenly believed to be <b>the</b> 72 <b>tombs.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1960 it {{was obvious}} from <b>the</b> deteriorating {{condition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> that <b>the</b> environment <b>of</b> changing heat and humidity needed to be controlled if the historic sarcophagi were to survive for future generations. The New Vault, north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tuscan, Ferdinand’s and the Franz Joseph Vault, was built by architect Karl Schwanzer, with metal doors by sculptor Rudolf Hoflehner. It added about 20% to <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crypt, and was used {{as part of a}} massive rearrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> in <b>the</b> vaults.|$|R
