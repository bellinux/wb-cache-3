Two site-specific fluorescent labels were used to distinguish between inhibitors directed to the active site, the exosite, or both binding sites of thrombin. For several well-known inhibitors of thrombin, the binding sites observed by FCS correspond to previous studies. The interaction of the recently discovered thrombin inhibitor ornithodorin from the tick <b>Ornithodorus</b> moubata with thrombin was investigated. It was found that this inhibitor, like hirudin and rhodniin, binds to both the active site and exosite of thrombin simultaneously. This study shows the feasibility of FCS as a sensitive and selective method for observing protein-ligand interactions. As an additional technique, simultaneous labeling with both fluorescent labels was successfully demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Since 2007, African {{swine fever}} has spread from the Caucasus region. To {{learn more about}} the {{dynamics}} of the disease in wild boars (Sus scrofa), we conducted experiments by using European wild boars. We found high virulence of Caucasus isolates limited potential for establishment of endemicity. African swine fever (ASF) {{is one of the most}} serious diseases affecting pigs (1). The causative agent, African swine fever virus (ASFV), is a complex DNA virus of the genus Asfi virus within the Asfarviridae family. Because of its ability to replicate in <b>Ornithodorus</b> ticks, ASFV can be classified as arthropod-borne virus (2). In domestic pigs, ASFV can cause a wide range of clinical signs, including hemorrhagic syndromes with high lethality. Little is known about ASF in European wild boars, although indications exist that the animals are highly susceptible (3). In 2007, ASF affecting domestic pigs and wild boars was reported in the Caucasus region. The virus strain involved was related to isolates of genotype II, whic...|$|E

Olfac-tion is one modality by which ticks locate a blood-meal and breath is the major vent of gaseous and volatile me-tabolites from the host that could contribute to this search. We studied the responses of a hunter tick, Ambly-omma variegatum, to diluted human breath and five of its components (acetone, CO 2, NO, isoprene and NH 3) while walking in an air stream on a locomotion compen-sator.

40|$|This {{survey was}} done to {{investigate}} the geographical distribution of ticks (Hard and Soft) in the towns of Amol, Babol and Noor in Mazandaran province, north of Iran. The study, conducted from January 2000 to October 2001, covered mostly rural districts {{and a total of}} 15 operational fields. Ticks were collected from domestic fowl nests, stables (animal shelters, floors and other places), animal bodies and rodent holes. A total number of 3897 ticks from two families (Argasidae and Ixodidae) were collected. Ticks from the Argasidae Family totaled 2049 and belonged to 2 genera: Argas and <b>Ornithodorus).</b> The proportions of different species were as follows: Argas persicus 35. 95 %, A. reflexus 0. 97 % and O. lahorensis 15. 65 %.

40|$|A {{proteomics}} {{approach was}} employed to identify proteins secreted into the hemolymph of <b>Ornithodorus</b> savignyi ticks 2 h after immune-challenge with the yeast, Candida albicans. Profiling of the proteins present in hemolymph of unchallenged ticks versus ticks challenged with heat-killed yeast revealed five proteins to be differentially expressed. The modulated protein spots were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis, but could not be positively identified. These proteins can be assigned to the immune response as they were not induced after aseptic injury. In an attempt to identify hemolymph proteins that recognize and bind to yeast cells, hemolymph obtained from both unchallenged and challenged ticks was incubated with C. albicans. Elution of the bound proteins followed by SDS–PAGE analysis indicated that three proteins (97, 88 and 26 kDa) present in both unchallenged and challenged hemolymph samples bind to yeast cells. The constant presence of these three proteins in tick hemolymph leads {{us to believe that}} they may be involved in non-self recognition and participate in yeast clearance from tick plasma. The analyzed yeast-binding proteins could also not be positively identified, suggesting that all the tick immune proteins investigated in this study are novel.

Interviews and examinations of 2, 160 townspeople and tourists were carried out, without discrimination of ethnic, sex, age, or social status, and classified for effects analyzed for four bands of age, six types of activities in the society, and two sexes. Larvae, nymphs, and adults of ticks had been identified with cases of parasitism involving six species, of the genus Amblyomma, the genus Ixodes, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Anocentor nitens, and <b>Ornithodorus</b> talaje (the first case registered in Pará), infecting human beings. Adults and agricultural workers were most frequently attacked, followed by students. A. cajennense and R. sanguineus are the species most frequent in the parasitism affecting humans, and A. cajennense is the dominant species. The statistical prevalence was largest in Cachoeira do Arari, Ilha do Marajó. In Santarém the greatest average intensity of parasitism was for R. sanguineus, {{and in the other}} locations it wasfor A. cajennense.

40|$|Steady-state and multifrequency phase fluorometry {{were used}} to {{characterize}} the conformational state and conformational dynamics of recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide (<b>Ornithodorus</b> moubata) (TAP). The TAP contains two tryptophan residues at positions 11 and 37. The fluorescence emission varies sigmoidally {{as a function of}} pH with a pK(a) of 6. 01 +/- 0. 07. This pH dependency suggests that tryptophan fluorescence is quenched by His 43 at low pH. This is confirmed by modification of the histidine with diethylpyrocarbonate. At pH 9 the fluorescence decay is well described by a sum of three exponentials (0. 52, 1. 9 and 5. 4 ns), which decrease all three at pH 4 (0. 25, 1. 61 and 4. 4 ns). From the reactivity of the fluorescence lifetimes toward N-bromosuccinimide and from the calculation of the accessibility we can attribute the long lifetime to Trp 11, the short one to Trp 37 and the middle one to both. The anisotropy decay was resolved into two components of 3. 85 ns and 0. 27 ns at pH 4 and 4. 5 ns and 0. 6 ns at pH 9. The long anisotropy decay time corresponds to the rotational correlation time of the protein, the short one to local mobility of the tryptophan residues. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Six {{species of}} rodents from Kern County, California, were inoculated subcutaneously with western equine {{encephalomyelitis}} (WEE) virus to determine their susceptibility to infection and their potential as natural hosts. Ammospermophilus nelsoni, Citellus beecheyi, Dipodomys heermanni, Dipodomys nitratoides, Peromyscus maniculatus, and Sciurus griseus were readily infected. Infection was usually fatal in Dipodomys species, C. beecheyi, and S. griseus, but was clinically inapparent in other species. Viremic responses varied greatly in magnitude and duration in different species and with different viral strains. Viremic animals that survived developed high titers of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody. Hemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies persisted at high titers for at least 8 to 58 weeks after infection, except in P. maniculatus. If animals died during or shortly after the viremic phase of infection, the virus usually was recoverable from numerous organs. Long-term survival of virus could not be demonstrated in A. nelsoni and Dipodomys species. It is concluded that A. nelsoni and P. maniculatus are not important natural hosts of WEE virus; they are susceptible to infection and develop antibodies, but serological surveys {{of the same species}} rarely reveal evidence of infection. S. griseus, D. heermanni, D. nitratoides, and possibly C. beecheyi are aberrant hosts of WEE virus since most of them died when infected. Two species of ticks that are ectoparasitic on rodents in Kern County were evaluated as vectors of WEE virus.

40|$|As obligate blood-feeding arthropods, ticks {{transmit}} pathogens {{to humans}} and domestic animals {{more often than}} other arthropod vectors. Livestock farming plays {{a vital role in}} the rural economy of Pakistan, and tick infestation causes serious problems with it. However, research on tick species diversity and tick-borne pathogens has rarely been conducted in Pakistan. In this study, a systematic investigation of the tick species infesting livestock in different ecological regions of Pakistan was conducted to determine the microbiome and pathobiome diversity in the indigenous ticks. A total of 3, 866 tick specimens were morphologically identified as 19 different tick species representing three important hard ticks, Rhipicephalus, Haemaphysalis and Hyalomma, and two soft ticks, <b>Ornithodorus</b> and Argas. The bacterial diversity across these tick species was assessed by bacterial 16 S rRNA gene sequencing using a 454 -sequencing platform on 10 of the different tick species infesting livestock. The notable genera detected include Ralstonia, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Rickettsia, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Corynebacterium, Enterobacter, and Enterococcus. A survey of Spotted fever group rickettsia from 514 samples from the 13 different tick species generated rickettsial-specific amplicons in 10 % (54) of total ticks tested.

40|$|The role of {{the ancestral}} sylvatic cycle of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) is not well {{understood}} in the endemic areas of eastern Africa. We therefore analysed the ASF infection status on samples collected from 51 free-ranging warthogs (Phacocherus africanus) and 1576 <b>Ornithodorus</b> porcinus ticks from 26 independent warthog burrows at a single ranch in Kenya. Abattoir samples from 83 domestic pigs without clinical symptoms, originating from specific locations with no recent reported ASF outbreaks were included in this study. All samples were derived from areas of central Kenya, where ASF outbreaks {{have been reported in}} the past. Infection with ASFV was confirmed in 22 % of O. porcinus pools, 3. 22 % of adult warthog serum samples and 49 % of domestic pig serum samples by using p 72 -based PCR. All of the warthog sera were positive for anti-ASFV antibodies, investigated by using ELISA, but none of the domestic pig sera were positive. Twenty O. porcinus-, 12 domestic pig- and three warthogderived viruses were genotyped at four polymorphic loci. The ASFV isolates from ticks and domestic pigs clustered within p 72 genotype X. By contrast, ASF viruses genotyped directly from warthog sera, at same locality as the tick isolates, were within p 72 genotype IX and genetically similar to viruses causing recent ASF outbreaks in Kenya and Uganda. This represents the first report of the co-existence of different ASFV genotypes in warthog burrow-associated ticks and adult wild warthogs. The data from this and earlier studies suggest transfer of viruses of at least two different p 72 genotypes, from wild to domestic pigs in East Africa...|$|E

40|$|Although the Malawi Lil 20 / 1 (MAL) {{strain of}} African {{swine fever virus}} (ASFV) was {{isolated}} from Ornithodoros sp. ticks, our attempts to experimentally infect ticks by feeding them this strain failed. Ten different collections of <b>Ornithodorus</b> porcinus porcinus ticks and one collection of O. porcinus domesticus ticks were orally exposed to a high titer of MAL. At 3 weeks postinoculation (p. i.), 90 % of the ticks by 5 weeks p. i. To further study the growth defect, O. porcinus porcinus ticks were orally exposed to MAL and assayed at regular intervals p. i. Whole-tick viral titers dramatically declined (> 1, 000 -fold) between 2 and 6 days p. i., and by 18 days p. i., viral titers were below the detection limit. In contrast, viral titers of ticks orally exposed to a tick-competent ASFV isolate, Pretoriuskop/ 96 / 4 / 1 (Pr 4), increased 10 -fold by 10 days p. i. and 50 -fold by 14 days p. i. Early viral gene expression, but not extensive late gene expression or viral DNA synthesis, was detected in the midguts of ticks orally exposed to MAL. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that progeny virus was rarely present in ticks orally exposed to MAL and, when present, was associated with extensive cytopathology of phagocytic midgut epithelial cells. To determine if viral replication was restricted only in the midgut epithelium, parenteral inoculations into the hemocoel were performed. With inoculation by this route, a persistent infection was established although a delay in generalization of MAL was detected and viral titers in most tissues were typically 10 - to 1, 000 -fold {{lower than those of}} ticks injected with Pr 4. MAL was detected in both the salivary secretion and coxal fluid following feeding but less frequently and at a lower titer compared to Pr 4. Transovarial transmission of MAL was not detected after two gonotrophic cycles. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that, when injected, MAL replicated in a number of cell types but failed to replicate in midgut epithelial cells. In contrast, ticks injected with Pr 4 had replicating virus in midgut epithelial cells. Together, these results indicate that MAL replication is restricted in midgut epithelial cells. This finding demonstrates the importance of viral replication in the midgut for successful ASFV infection of the arthropod host...|$|E
