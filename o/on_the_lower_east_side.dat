40|$|Abstract. Rates {{of ground}} radon emanation, in the Puna {{geothermal}} area <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>east</b> rift of Kilauea volcano, were measured by alpha particle sensitive cellulose nitrate films.

This type of survey was found suitable for the basaltic island environment characteristic of Hawaii and is now used in Hawaii as a routine geothermal exploration technique...|$|R
