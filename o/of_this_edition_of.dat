Pescara is {{the capital of}} Province of Pescara which is situated in the Abruzzo region. The official mascot was a Marsican brown bear, called Aua`, wearing a diving mask and flip-flops with swimfins in his hands. The Marsican brown bear is a highly threatened, unrecognised subspecies of the Brown bear, with a range restricted to the Abruzzo National Park. The mascot was unveiled by the Mediterranean Games Executive Committee during their meeting in Pescara from 24 to 28 March 2008.|$|E
25|$|The book rose to #84 on the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble bestseller lists in June 2011 {{shortly after}} its title was announced. Green promised that every pre-order would be hand-signed by him, {{requiring}} {{him to sign}} every copy of the first printing. He proposed that the general public vote on the color Sharpie he would use to sign the books, resulting in him signing the 150,000 books {{with a variety of}} Sharpie colors, each in proportion to the amount of votes received for that color. However, some people who ordered from international booksellers received unsigned copies because those bookstores, including Amazon UK, underestimated how many books they needed and ordered more after the signing was complete, but Green agreed to fix this problem, telling people with unsigned pre-orders to email him so they could be sent a signed bookplate. Many fans submitted their book cover designs to various outlets including Tumblr and Twitter, tagging Green in these posts so he could see them. The sizeable number of posts received has prompted Green's publisher Penguin to seek a fan-designed cover for a reprint of one of Green's other books, An Abundance of Katherines. The Fault in Our Stars debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Chapter Books and remained in that spot for seven consecutive weeks. A Hebrew edition of The Fault in Our Stars was published in Israel in August 2012 and more editions of the novel are forthcoming in Dutch, German, Spanish, French, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, Chinese, and Portuguese. The Fault in Our Stars has also gained places on several bestseller lists. It was #1 on The Wall Street Journal bestseller list, #1 on the Indiebound bestseller list, and #9 on The Bookseller bestseller list. The novel was also The New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice. As of January 2013, there are nearly 1 million copies of the novel in print. In December 2012, it was announced that a special edition with a silver cover and an expanded Q, dubbed the 'Exclusive Collector's Edition', would be available from Barnes and Noble.

2500|$|Michael Servetus, {{using the}} name [...] "Michel de Villeneuve" [...] during his stay in France, was Vesalius' fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, {{according}} to Johann Winter von Andernach, who taught both. In the Galenism of the Renaissance, editions of the Opera Omnia by Galen were very important. It was begun in Venice in 1541–1542 by the Guinta. There were fourteen editions of the book from that date until 1625. Just one edition was produced from Lyon between 1548 and 1551. The Lyon edition has commentaries on breathing and blood streaming that correct the work of earlier renowned authors such as Vesalius, Caius or Janus Cornarius. [...] "Michel De Villeneuve" [...] had contracts with Jean Frellon for that work, and the Servetus scholar-researcher Francisco Javier González Echeverría [...] presented research that became an accepted communication in the International Society for the History of Medicine, which concluded that Michael De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus) {{is the author of}} the commentaries <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> Frellon, in Lyon.|$|E

Veen in 1893, was designed by P. de Josselin de Jong, made after an idea of Louis Couperus and printed by printer H.C.A. Thieme (Nijmegen). <b>Of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> about 350-500 copies, in 1905 135 still remained with the publisher, who let 25 copies bind in a blue cover with red page cuts. L.J.

After he was notified Couperus wrote to Veen: If you like my poetry that much {{what would you say}} if we publish another book with verses; he wanted to include the poems called Fragment (renamed to Melancholy) Viviane, Williswinde, Ginevra, Semiramis and Fragments from the Apocapyps of John the Apostle. Veen however refused this offer because he was not interested in an enlarged reprint of Orchids. At the beginning of December 1894 Couperus informed Veen that he agreed with a reprint of Orchids and a new book {{with the rest of his}} verses for the sum of 200 guilders.|$|E

60|$|It was {{originally}} intended that Swift's writings on Religion and the Church should occupy a single volume <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> his works. They are, however, so numerous {{that it has}} been found more convenient to divide them into two volumes--the first including all the tracts, except those relating to the Sacramental Test; the second containing the Test pamphlets and the twelve sermons, with the Remarks on Dr. Gibbs's paraphrase of the Psalms, in an appendix.

Mr. Fitzgerald says: [...] "Scott's notes, subject to the corrections just given [by himself], are correct, and would serve as the base of the new edition. The additions I have given and the few given by Dr. Rowan (which are given here a little further on) will have to be inserted in their proper places and will make the whole complete."

60|$|The text <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> Bunyan's Holy War {1b} is {{a careful}} {{reproduction}} of the First Edition of 1682.

For though both in the Bodleian and the British Museum there is a copy purporting to be a second edition, and bearing date 1684, it is difficult to resist the impression that they are pirated copies, similar to those of which Nathaniel Ponder complained so bitterly in the case of The Pilgrim's Progress. For both paper and typography are greatly inferior to those of the first edition; some of Bunyan's most characteristic marginalia are carelessly omitted; Bunyan's own title--'The Holy War made by Shaddai upon Diabolus for the regaining of the Metropolis of the World'--is altered to the feebler and more commonplace form--'The Holy War made by Christ upon the Devil for the Regaining of Man'; and, further, when a new edition was issued in 1696, the alterations and omissions of 168 4 were ignored, and a simple reprint made of the first edition of 1682.|$|E
