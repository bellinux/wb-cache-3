5|$|The Ron Paul presidential {{campaign}} of 1988 began in early 1987 when former Congressman Ron Paul of Texas announced his candidacy for the 1988 presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party. He joined the third party {{after leaving the}} Republican Party over the Reagan administration's handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budget.</b> He ran on a platform that included non-interventionism in foreign conflicts, decriminalization of illegal drugs on a federal level, {{a return to the}} gold standard, the abolition of the Federal Reserve and a reduction in all government spending.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, {{which is}} an {{equivalent}} 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income {{for the federal government}} are the value-added tax (33%) and the direct federal tax (29%) and the main expenditure is located in the areas of social welfare and finance & tax. The expenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been growing from 7% of GDP in 1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and to 10.7% in 2010. While the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been growing from 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defence; from 26.5% in to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015).|$|E

The line would then turn north along Highland Avenue to Universal City and North Hollywood (a Hollywood Bowl stop {{was determined not to}} have enough year-round ridership to meet FTA formulas for Federal funding, just {{one of the reasons for}} not building a station there). The FTA approved the all subway route and funding (although broken into 2 phases rather than the original 1 phase in order to spread the cost over time making it more likely to be approved by Congress as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Budget)</b> for the line as it exists today.|$|E
25|$|Perón's {{third term}} was also marked by an {{escalating}} {{conflict between the}} Peronist left- and right-wing factions. This turmoil was fueled primarily by calls for repression against the left {{on the part of}} leading CGT figures, a growing segment of the armed forces (particularly the navy) and right-wing radicals within his own party, notably Perón's most fascist adviser, José López Rega. López Rega, appointed Minister of Social Welfare, was in practice given power far beyond his purview, soon controlling up to 30 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budget.</b> Diverting increasing funds, he formed the Triple A, a death squad that soon began targeting not only the violent left; but moderate opposition, as well. The Montoneros became marginalized in the Peronist movement and were mocked by Perón himself after the Ezeiza massacre. In his speech to the governors on 2 August 1973, Perón openly criticized radical Argentine youth for a lack of political maturity.|$|E

500|$|At {{least three}} other sites in {{downtown}} D.C. are also {{reputed to be}} haunted. The National Theatre (1321 Pennsylvania Avenue NW) opened at its current location on December 7, 1835, although the old building was torn down and replaced with the current structure in 1923. Nonetheless, some claim the theater is haunted by the ghost of actor John McCullough, who was murdered in the 1880s by a fellow thespian where the modern stage is located today. The spook was first sighted by Frederic Bond, a comic actor and friend of McCullough's, in September 1896. Bond was on the stage late at night reviewing preparations for the next day's performance when he felt a spectral presence that terrified him. He then saw a ghostly figure dressed in the traditional garb of the Shakespearean character Hamlet. Recognizing the spirit, he shouted McCullough's name and the ghost vanished. The National Building Museum (401 F Street NW), too, is allegedly haunted. Built in 1887 in order to process pensions for Civil War veterans, widows, and orphans (such pensions consumed a quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> at the time), the [...] "Pension Building" [...] (as it was originally known) contains 15 Corinthian columns made of brick and plaster and painted to imitate black onyx. Security guards and other witnesses have claimed that the swirling colors of the columns can change to form the outlines {{of people who have}} recently died, or who had ties to the building. When in use as the headquarters of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in the 1940s, night watchmen reported seeing a man on horseback on the upper floors, where horses used to be quartered during the Civil War. They also reported seeing the ghost of James Tanner, a stenographer who took down the testimony of eyewitnesses after the assassination of President Lincoln at Ford's Theater (ironically, Robert Todd Lincoln approved the plans for the Pension Building). These stories gained such prominence that mystery writer Margaret Truman mentioned them in one of her novels.|$|E
2500|$|During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, a {{combined}} {{supply and demand}} side policy was considered unconventional by the moderate wing of the Republican Party. While running against Reagan for the Presidential nomination in 1980, George H. W. Bush had derided Reaganomics as [...] "voodoo economics".

500|$|Yugoslav and Serbian {{expenditures}} {{during the}} war were even more disproportionate. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> proposal for 1992 earmarked 81 percent of funds to be diverted into the Serbian war effort. Since a substantial part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budgets</b> prior to 1992 was provided by Slovenia and Croatia, the most developed republics of Yugoslavia, a lack of federal income quickly led to desperate printing of money to finance [...] government operations.

In response, the president must submit cost-saving legislation to Congress, which must consider this legislation on an expedited basis.

50|$|Prior to the Great Depression, {{nearly all}} federal {{expenditures}} were discretionary. However, following {{the passage of}} the Social Security Act in 1935, an increasing percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> was devoted to mandatory spending. In 1947, Social Security accounted for just under five percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>budget</b> and less than one-half of one percent of GDP.
