25|$|<b>Oriental</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter</b> (Amblonyx cinereus) aquatic {{carnivore}} animal {{lives in}} the aquatic ecosystem of Sundarbans.

500|$|The {{sea otter}} is the {{heaviest}} (the giant otter is longer, but significantly slimmer) {{member of the}} family Mustelidae, a diverse group that includes the 13 otter species and terrestrial animals such as weasels, badgers, and minks. It is unique among the mustelids in not making [...] or burrows, in having no functional anal scent glands, and in being able to live its entire life without leaving the water. The only member of the genus Enhydra, the sea otter is so different from other mustelid species that, as recently as 1982, some scientists believed it was more closely related to the earless seals. Genetic analysis indicates the sea otter and its closest extant relatives, which include the African speckle-throated otter, European otter, African clawless otter and <b>oriental</b> <b>small-clawed</b> <b>otter,</b> shared an ancestor approximately 5 million years ago (Mya).|$|E

50|$|The Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea syn.
