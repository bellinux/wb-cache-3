500|$|Show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "I Do" [...] as a [...] "mini-season finale", {{as it was}} {{the last}} episode before mid-season hiatus, and would end in a cliffhanger. It also served as a climax and {{beginning}} of a closure of Jack, Kate and Sawyer's captivity on Hydra Island, with the writers saying that afterwards there would be a return to the beach and the six-episode block would be [...] "more palatable" [...] and make more sense, comparing them to the first seven episodes of season 2 where the tail section survivors are introduced. Executive producer Bryan Burk also said the pre-hiatus episodes were [...] "our season 2.5. [...] Like, this is kind of like wrapping up a lot <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were last year", considering season three would really begin in the seventh episode.|$|E
500|$|Since A Thousand Leaves was {{the first}} Sonic Youth album that was {{recorded}} in their own studio, the band had more time and freedom to work on it. As a result, the songs evolved unevenly and were recorded from {{an early stage of}} development. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, the album is [...] "a reflection <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were at the time. We weren't into making anything concise. We were just playing what we felt like playing. We really didn't feel like what we needed to be doing was producing another record like Goo." [...] The 11-minute song [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)" [...] was initially intended to be released on one of the EPs as an instrumental track, but it was ultimately included on the album with vocals. The album was co-produced by the band and Confusion Is Sex producer Wharton Tiers and mastered by Greg Calbi at Masterdisk in New York City.|$|E

500|$|Jared Leto as Nemo Nobody, both 34- and 118-year-old. Nemo is a Latin {{word meaning}} [...] "nobody". The name Nemo alludes to Captain Nemo, the main {{character}} of Jules Verne's novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. It is the false name that Odysseus in Homer's poem Odyssey gives to the cyclops Polyphemus, to deceive him and save his own life. Van Dormael said that Leto was chosen because he is [...] "an actor who could transform himself, as much physically as vocally, rhythmically, his breathing." [...] Leto described his role saying, [...] "Mr. Nobody is everyone and no one {{all at the same}} time, an illusion, the product of his own dreams. He's love, he's hope, he's fear, he's life and he's death. This is without doubt the most complex character I've ever played. It was a challenge to keep all these lives concentrated into one character {{for the duration of the}} filming without losing myself. But we had outlines and things that helped me to keep track <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were." [...] Actor Toby Regbo portrays Nemo at fifteen and Thomas Byrne Nemo at nine.|$|E
500|$|Roger Wilkins, {{a history}} {{professor}} at George Mason University who studies race in the United States, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] provided [...] "insightful, wonderful explorations on the complexities of many levels of race." [...] He also said the show [...] "really does understand how we're all caught in this culture, and we're all struggling with it. And we all bring to this jagged enterprise the limited understanding <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> came from and who we are. Being fully alive requires us to struggle with these realities. That's what the show does." [...] In his journal article about the portrayal of African American men in Homicide: Life on the Street, documentary historian Thomas A. Mascaro said the presentation of light-skinned black villains like Luther Mahoney and dark-skinned actors like the one played by James Earl Jones in [...] "Blood Ties", [...] "dispels the notion that black skin color is uniform or determinative with regard to character". Some media outlets described the Watson subplot as a racial spin on the 1996 murder of six-year-old child beauty pageant queen JonBenét Ramsey, although Tom Fontana said any similarities were not intended.|$|E
500|$|In a November 2007 {{interview}} with Paul Cashmere of the website Undercover, Middleton stated {{that a couple}} of songs they had initially written for Vulture Street [...] "were just too Odyssey Number Five based", and that the first track, [...] "Rockin' Rocks", was [...] "probably the start <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were heading" [...] with the album". Cashmere stated that the album was [...] "the toughest [...] heard Powderfinger sound". Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, he described Vulture Street as [...] "a rawer, louder" [...] album in comparison to Odyssey Number Five; it highlighted Fanning's [...] "talent as a lyricist" [...] and stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton [...] "dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut". Zuel stated that there is a [...] "real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger," [...] and described [...] "On My Mind" [...] as having [...] "AC/DC meatiness", and [...] "Love Your Way" [...] as [...] "acoustic tumbling into weaving Zeppelin lines". In his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, Zuel described it as [...] " [...] high-gloss and muscular framework," [...] and stated that that was what [...] "American radio considers serious rock." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{second album}} Death Certificate was {{released}} in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' ("a vision <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are today") and the 'Life Side' ("a vision <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> need to go"). It features [...] "No Vaseline", a scathing response to N.W.A's 100 Miles and Runnin as well as [...] "Black Korea," [...] a track regarded by some as prophetic of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, but also interpreted as racist by many. Ice Cube toured with Lollapalooza in 1992, which widened his fan base.|$|E

This work is very important because it means that Nuclear Medicine in Latin America is very vital and will prosper in the coming years. Dr. Sporn gave me the title of "Balance" for this lecture. I think as we look at life in general, that what he was referring to is that we have the component <b>of</b> life <b>where</b> <b>we</b> work, we have the component <b>of</b> life <b>where</b> <b>we</b> play, and we have the component <b>of</b> life <b>where</b> <b>we</b> are enriched by the thoughts of others and their creativity...|$|R

2500|$|In 1987, {{after two}} albums and an EP, Samhain was signed {{to a major}} label by Rubin {{and the name of}} the band was changed to Danzig to allow the band to retain its name in the event of line-up changes. Danzig {{discussed}} the reasoning behind the name change: “Rick [...] convinced me it was the way to go, and would also provide me with a lot more artistic freedom. After all, I was now in charge <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were going musically, so if I didn't want to do something, it was a lot easier to say so." [...] Danzig's intention at the time was for each album he recorded to consist of a different recording line-up, allowing him to keep working with different musicians. The original band consisted of guitarist John Christ, bassist Eerie Von, and former Circle Jerks–DOA–Black Flag drummer Chuck Biscuits.|$|E
2500|$|... (1992) {{sees the}} Avatar {{entangled}} in the plan of an ostensibly virtuous and benevolent organization named the Fellowship (inspired by Scientology) to create a gateway for the evil entity known as the Guardian to enter Britannia. Though all of the main line of Ultima games are arranged into trilogies, Richard Garriot later revealed that Ultima VII was the first game where he did any sort of planning ahead for future games in the series. He elaborated that [...] "the first three didn't {{have much to do}} with each other, they were 'Richard Garriott learns to program'; IV through VI were a backwards-designed trilogy, in the sense that I tied them together as I wrote them; but VII-IX, the story of the Guardian, were a preplanned trilogy, and we had a definite idea <b>of</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> wanted to go." [...] An expansion pack was released named Forge of Virtue that added a newly arisen volcanic island to the map that the Avatar was invited to investigate. The tie-in storyline was limited to this island, where a piece of Exodus (his data storage unit) had resurfaced. To leave the island again, the Avatar had to destroy this remnant of Exodus. In the process of doing so, he also created The Black Sword, an immensely powerful weapon possessed by a demon.|$|E
