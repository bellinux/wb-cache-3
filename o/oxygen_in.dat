5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free <b>oxygen</b> <b>in</b> the vessel.

5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} {{nitrogen fixation}} by making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes.

5|$|Dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>in</b> {{fresh water}} is {{measured}} {{to indicate the}} health {{of plant and animal}} life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>in</b> the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of Christmas, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek. Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen.|$|E
40|$|IT {{has been}} shown (Jamieson and van den Brenk, 1963 a) that when Yoshida sarcoma was grown as solid tumour in rats and the animals were placed <b>in</b> <b>oxygen</b> at {{pressures}} raised to 4 atmospheres absolute there was a rapid rise <b>in</b> <b>oxygen</b> tension <b>in</b> both the normal tissues and the tumour. A polarographic technique {{was used to measure}} <b>oxygen</b> tension. <b>In</b> the present study similar measurements have been made of <b>oxygen</b> tension <b>in</b> spontaneous tumours and normal tissues of human patients treated with megavoltage irradiation during their exposure to hyperbaric oxygen. The polarographic technique and the pressure vessel used in these clinical studies have been described previously (Jamieson, 1962; van den Brenk, 1961). Tumour oxygen tension values are of general interest in the study and treatment of neoplastic growth but particularly in relation to the " <b>oxygen</b> effect " <b>in</b> radiosensitivity.

Considerable degradation in ferroelectric and fatigue properties of the capacitors was observed when the electrode thickness was below 230 nm. <b>Oxygen</b> deficiency <b>in</b> the thin electrodes was detected through AES measurement.
