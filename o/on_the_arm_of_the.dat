25|$|Sounds are {{transmitted}} via a receiver attached from {{the arm of}} the spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull {{at the back of the}} ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectacles. The sound is passed from the receiver <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for conductive hearing losses or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.|$|E
