40|$|An obese man, age 57 years, with {{a medical}} history of {{depression}} presented to his {{primary care physician}} with three days of sudden left-sided hearing loss. He did not report pain, tinnitus, vertigo, or external auditory canal discharge. He {{said that he had}} not experienced any recent trauma, upper respiratory infection, or loud noise exposure or taken any <b>oto-toxic</b> medications. His physical examination revealed normal-appear-ing external auditory canals and tympanic membranes. The membranes exhibited good mobility with insuf-flation. Findings on the Rinne test with a 512 -Hz tun-ing fork were consistent with air conduction greater than bone conduction on the right side; the left side could not be tested because of profound hearing loss...|$|E
40|$|M. P. H. (Occupational Hygiene), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 2009 BACKGROUND Hearing {{loss from}} {{occupational}} exposures {{is a serious}} and widespread problem in underground nickel mining. This is {{a major contributor to}} compensable illnesses resulting not only in costly compensation but posing a serious threat to safety and also reducing the quality of working life. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to identify the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss amongst underground nickel miners with at least 5 years of exposure as well as describe some risk factors for noise induced hearing loss in this occupational setting. METHODS One hundred and sixty eight underground nickel miners, or one hundred percent of eligible workers’ medical records with baseline and periodic audiograms were reviewed to identify the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss and also evaluate some of the risk factors for noise induced hearing loss namely age, duration of exposure, use of <b>oto-toxic</b> agents, high ambient noise levels, hearing impairment, high pre-employment noise levels, history of acoustic trauma, history of ear injury and history of previous military, hunting or police work. One hundred underground mine workers were interviewed to give insight into their pre-employment noise exposure history, non-occupational noise exposure, perceived noise levels at work, knowledge of noise hazards and their control, and the use of hearing protection devices. One hundred and sixty eight workers were observed in their various tasks over a 14 day period and their work practices were scored to identify compliance to the use of hearing protective devices as well as confirm {{the presence or absence of}} <b>oto-toxic</b> agents like heavy metals and solvents. Data were analyzed using the EpiInfo software version 3. 4. 3 : 1997 as well as the online statistical package Vassar Stats. RESULTS A noise induced hearing loss prevalence of 27. 4...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes is {{a complex}} multisystem disease that requiresroutine {{monitoring}} for known complications affect-ing the renal, visual, and peripheral nervous systems. Re-search has hinted at an increased risk for hearing loss in diabetic patients, but confounders of noise exposure, <b>oto-toxic</b> drug exposure, presbycusis, and known syndromes that affect both glucose metabolism and cochlear function {{make it difficult to}} establish this association (1 – 5). Cur-rently, there are no formal recommendations for screening for hearing loss in diabetic patients (6). The article by Bainbridge and colleagues (7) in this issue reports on the risk for hearing loss in persons with self-reported diabetes. In a cross-sectional study, they used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to determine the relative risk for sensorineural hearing loss in a community-based random sample of patients who re...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{congenital}} anomalies which, although not possessing any inherent significance, yet are usually of some diagnostic help through their frequent association with major abnormalities, which, in their turn may not be readily obvious at the time. Thus, for example:. cafe-au-lait spots may be associated with such a variety of abnormalities such as neurofibromatosis, pulmonary stenosis, ataxia- telangiectasia, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and tuberose sclerosis. The presence of a single umbilical artery should lead to investigations to exclude congenital defects of the heart, alimentary and genito- urinary systems, and skeletal anomalies. Abnormalities of the ears are commonly associated with kidney pathology; {{it is interesting to note}} that certain drugs such as ~he aminoglycosides are both potentially nephro-and <b>oto-toxic.</b> Although published figures exist for various bodily features, (Feingold, Holmes, Smith) the question of low-lying ears poses some difficulty in that criteria for its diagnosis are not so well established. An imaginary line is usually made to run from the lateral canthus of the eye on to occipital protuberance at the back of the skull, and its relation to the ear taken as the point of reference.
