Ratings {{are based on the}} <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> a country's economy, export growth and real effective exchange rate (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has to weaken its currency without damaging its economy. As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing and able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E

This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.|$|E

5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E

5000|$|The {{dimension}} <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> {{to experience}} <b>of</b> the Five-Factor {{model has been}} criticized for not directly relating to any of the major characteristics of personality disorders {{in the same way as}} do the other four dimensions [...] It has been suggested that schizotypal and histrionic personality disorders could be partially characterized by high levels <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> to experience (in the forms <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> to ideas and feelings, respectively) , while obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizoid, and avoidant personality disorders can all be conceptualized by extremely low levels <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> [...] However, there is little to no empirical support for this hypothesis, particularly with schizotypal personality disorder. Additionally, the <b>Openness</b> scale <b>of</b> the NEO-PI-R, which is one of the most widely used measures of Big Five traits, was based on research and theory which viewed openness (such as self-actualization and personal growth) as beneficial, so measurement <b>of</b> extreme <b>openness</b> using the NEO-PI-R, is actually a marker of good mental health.|$|R

However, the results of empirical literature on the relationship between openness and growth have always been under criticism for using openness variables, which are not objective measures <b>of</b> <b>openness,</b> involve measurement errors and do not capture all dimensions <b>of</b> <b>openness.</b> To overcome these criticisms, in this article, we introduce a composite openness proxy obtained using the principle component methodology that captures all dimensions <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> and provide an objective and more reliable measure <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> for Turkey...|$|R

His idea has been taken up more widely in the British Independent School, as well as elsewhere in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy.|$|E

For example, many Pacific coastal islands off British Columbia and Alaska support either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both. In regions where both species coexist, they are divided by landscape gradients such as age of forest, elevation and <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> land. Grizzly bears tend to favor old forests with high productivity, higher elevations and more open habitats compared with black bears.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> in the {{technology}} domain. In contrast to the common notion <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> as transparent access, I define the concept as the degree of liberation or suppression of potentiality. To develop a theory <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> as potentiality, I draw on the works of Gilbert Simondon and Umberto Eco. Simondon’s theory of individuation explains the potentiality of incompatible relations between disparate domains. Resolving the incompatibilities actualizes the underlying potentiality, which is the energy source of constant, ambivalent changes in the lifeworld. Eco suggests that the semantic codes in contemporary art are unstable. They constantly oscillate between the rejection and the preservation of conventional systems. By appropriating Simondon’s and Eco’s theory {{to the realm of}} technology, I formulate a theory <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> in technology. I conclude with an inquiry on the significance <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> in practice and propose a design approach for developing open technologies...|$|R

We also investigate the external debt accumulation effect <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> in a dynamic external debt model. From Our GMM estimation we found external debt to be an increasing function <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> initially and a decreasing function <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> over time. Using logit MLE, we found the external debt accumulation effect <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> to effectively translate into increased risk of debt crisis occurrence initially but over time, openness decreases the probability of debt crisis occurrence. Our results are robust to alternative measures <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> as well as changes in the definition of external debt and debt crisis...|$|R

In order to analyze the implications <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> and growth on determinacy and learnability of worldwide rational expectations equilibria we develop a two-country New Keynesian model with growth. We analyze these issues for contemporaneous data and expectations-based monetary policy rules. Our results highlight how growth matters for the overall effect of opening an economy to more trade, as we find that (i) under the contemporaneous data policy rule the conditions for determinacy and learnability become more stringent on account <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> but less stringent on account of growth, so that growth weakens the effect <b>of</b> <b>openness,</b> (ii) under the expectations-based policy rule the conditions for determinacy and learnability also become more stringent on account <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> while on account growth the conditions for determinacy become more stringent (thus reinforcing the effect <b>of</b> <b>openness)</b> but those for learnability become less stringent (thus weakening the effect <b>of</b> <b>openness).</b> As in Bullard and Schaling (2009) the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is key to our result but within a framework {{that is consistent with}} long-run labor supply and balanced growth facts...|$|R
