5|$|This season had a {{quick start}} but a slow end. <b>Overall</b> <b>activity</b> was below average, with twelve named systems in total. Of these, five were {{tropical}} storms, seven were hurricanes, of which three were major (Category 3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale). Just one storm formed in August, {{one of the least}} active Augusts ever in the east Pacific. The season officially started May 15, 1973, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1973, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1973. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. All tropical cyclones this season formed in the eastern north Pacific Ocean, often off the coast of Mexico. As is usual in the northern hemisphere, most traveled generally westward or northwestward, and two reached as far as the waters south of the Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
5|$|<b>Overall</b> <b>activity</b> in 1991 {{was below}} normal. This was {{partially}} due to decreased tropical cyclogenesis from African tropical waves, which are troughs that {{move across the}} ocean with associated convection. In most seasons, the majority of storms develop from tropical waves. Of the season's twelve tropical cyclones, only five originated from tropical waves; in addition, {{only three of the}} eight tropical storms were from tropical waves, and none had the characteristics of a Cape Verde-type hurricane. From late April to late November, there were 73tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa. The total was higher than average, although many of them were poorly defined and had little thunderstorm activity. The waves traversed the Atlantic Ocean further south than normal, typically not becoming convectively active until moving across northern South America. Cyclogenesis was also suppressed by higher than normal wind shear, as well as low rainfall amounts across the Sahel. There were also no tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico for only the third time in the 20th century, after 1927 and 1962. The season produced twelve tropical depressions, which was the lowest in five years. The eight tropical storms was the lowest amount in four years. Four of the storms developed into hurricanes, although {{for the first time in}} over 24years, none of the hurricanes originated from tropical waves.|$|E

This does not provide true per-fixture automatic flushing, but is simple and cheap to add because only one device {{is required for the}} whole system.|$|E
25|$|After an ash {{explosion}} of September 1, 2006, a general {{decline in the}} <b>overall</b> <b>activity</b> of Mayon was established. The decrease in key parameters such as seismicity, sulfur dioxide emission rates and ground inflation all indicated a waning condition. The slowdown in the eruptive activity was also evident from the decrease in intensity of crater glow and the diminishing volume of lava extruded from the summit. PHILVOLCS Alert Level 4 was lowered to Level 3 on September 11, 2006; to Level 2 on October 3, 2006; and to Level 1 on October 25, 2006.|$|E

25|$|Of all {{the nuclear}} tests {{conducted}} in the United States, Sedan ranked highest in <b>overall</b> <b>activity</b> of radionuclides in fallout. The test released 880,000 curies (33 PBq) of radioactive iodine-131, an agent of thyroid disease, into the atmosphere. Sedan ranked first in percentages of these particular radionuclides detected in fallout: 198Au, 199Au, 7Be, 99Mo, 147Nd, 203Pb, 181W, 185W and 188W. Sedan ranked second in these radionuclides in fallout: 57Co, 60Co and 54Mn. Sedan ranked third in the detected amount of 24Na in fallout. In countrywide deposition of radionuclides, Sedan was highest {{in the amount of}} 7Be, 54Mn, 106Ru and 242Cm, and second highest in the amount of deposited 127mTe. Although not detected in fallout, in part because the explosion was well contained, gold (Au) was used in the W71 warhead, with one 1971 test {{conducted in the}} Amchitka islands off Alaska.|$|E

The Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk of severe weather for April 13 over portions of North Central, Northeast Texas, Southern Arkansas and Northern Louisiana.

He would speak of historians as [...] "elders of [...] nation", and dismissed academic specialization as a [...] "blindfold". Reflecting back on the transition, Iorga himself stated: [...] "The love for the past, for great figures of energy and sincerity,... the exact contrary of tendencies I had found existed among my contemporaries, had gripped me and, added to my political preoccupations, such awakenings served me, {{when it came to}} criticizing things present, more than any argument that is abstract, logical in nature." [...] The point of his research, Iorga explained in 1922, was to show [...] "the nation itself as a living being". According to literary historian Victor Iova: [...] " [...] <b>overall</b> <b>activity...</b> did not just seek the communication of knowledge, but also expressly sought to define the social finality of his time, its ethical sense and his own patriotic ideal." [...] The 1911 speech Două concepții istorice nevertheless provided a more nuanced outline, cautioning against a potential cult of heroes and suggesting that national histories were inextricably linked to each other: [...] "The life of a people is at all times mingled with the lives of others, existing in relation with these and at all times feeding into the others' lives." ...|$|E
