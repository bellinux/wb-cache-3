5|$|From {{the core}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 0.7 solar radii, thermal {{radiation}} {{is the primary}} means of energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Solar System {{is still}} unknown. The Sun's {{gravitational}} field {{is estimated to}} dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> two light years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud, by contrast, do not place it farther than 50,000 AU. Despite discoveries such as Sedna, the region between the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud, an area {{tens of thousands of}} AU in radius, is still virtually unmapped. There are also ongoing studies of the region between Mercury and the Sun. Objects may yet be discovered in the Solar System's uncharted regions.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, among the most active seismic areas in the Southeastern United States and one capable of producing moderately strong earthquakes, a few of which have caused damage. The frequency for non-damaging earthquakes from this zone measures <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> one per year, and it has produced many faint earthquakes recorded on seismographs. Such earthquakes have been helpful in highlighting the activity of faults below the Paleozoic detachment. Fault-plane solutions of multiple earthquakes throughout the area confirmed strike-slip faulting between two steeply declining planes. Both right and left-lateral movement occurs in the area, most movement being associated with north-to-south planes (right-lateral) and east-to-west planes (left-lateral). All of these mechanisms indicate reactivation of basement faults below more-recent faults. These basement faults probably converge on one another, and one being strong and the other being weak, produce earthquakes.|$|E

It is unknown what made Goodwin believe that his rule could be correct. In general, figures with identical perimeters do not have identical area (see isoperimetry); the typical demonstration of this fact is to compare a long thin shape with a small enclosed area (the area approaching zero as the width decreases) to one of the same perimeter that is approximately as tall as it is wide (the area approaching the square of the width), obviously of much greater area.|$|E

This occurs when gas is accumulated at large radii later in a galaxy's life space, while the gas at the core becomes exhausted. The result is a decrease in the average age of stars with increasing radius from the galaxy core.|$|E
2500|$|Until around 2012, the radial-velocity method (also {{known as}} Doppler spectroscopy) {{was by far}} the most {{productive}} technique used by planet hunters (after 2012, the transit method from the Kepler_spacecraft overtook it in number). The radial velocity signal is distance independent, but requires high signal-to-noise ratio spectra to achieve high precision, and so is generally used only for relatively nearby stars, <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 160 light-years from Earth, to find lower-mass planets. It is also not possible to simultaneously observe many target stars at a time with a single telescope. Planets of Jovian mass can be detectable around stars up to a few thousand light years away. This method easily finds massive planets that are close to stars. Modern spectrographs can also easily detect Jupiter-mass planets orbiting 10 astronomical units away from the parent star, but detection of those planets requires many years of observation. Earth-mass planets are currently detectable only in very small orbits around low-mass stars, e.g. Proxima_b.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{applications}} of the dipole antenna is the rabbit ears or bunny ears television antenna, found atop broadcast television receivers. [...] It is used to receive the VHF terrestrial television bands, consisting in the US of 52 to 88nbsp&MHz (band I) and 174 to 216nbsp&MHz (band III), with wavelengths of 5.5 to 1.4 m. [...] Since this frequency range is much wider than a single fixed dipole antenna can cover, it is made with several degrees of adjustment. [...] It is constructed of two telescoping rods that can be extended <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>about</b> 1 m length (approximately one quarter wavelength at 52nbsp&MHz). [...] Instead of being fixed in opposing directions, these elements can be adjusted at an angle in a [...] "V" [...] shape. [...] The reason for the V shape is that when receiving channels {{at the top of the}} band, the antenna elements will typically resonate at their 3rd harmonic. [...] In this mode the direction of maximum gain is no longer perpendicular to the rods, but the radiation pattern will have lobes at an angle to the rods, making it advantageous to be able to adjust them to various angles.|$|E
