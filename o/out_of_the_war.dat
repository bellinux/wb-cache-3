5|$|Had Napoleon {{succeeded in}} {{destroying}} the existing coalition forces south of Brussels {{before they were}} reinforced, {{he might have been}} able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.|$|E
5|$|Aiming {{to knock}} Turkey <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> the British {{then decided to}} stage an amphibious {{lodgement}} at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British, Indian and French forces committed to the campaign. The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC)—commanded by British general William Birdwood—subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915. Although promising to transform the war if successful, the Gallipoli Campaign was ill-conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate, without achieving its objectives. Australian casualties totalled 26,111, including 8,141 killed.|$|E

5|$|In 1862 {{he became}} brigadier general. After a brief cavalry command he was reassigned to infantry. Wounded at Cross Keys, Steuart was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> {{for almost a}} year while {{recovering}} from a shoulder injury. He was reassigned to Lee's army shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg. Steuart was captured at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and exchanged in the summer of 1864.

5|$|In February 1915, Ottoman Empire forces {{attacked}} the Suez Canal, and although some {{units of the}} 1st Division were put into the line, the 2nd Battalion was not required, {{and in the end}} the attack was turned back mainly by Indian units. Later, in an effort to open shipping lanes to the Russians and also knock the Turks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the British high command decided to land a force on the Gallipoli peninsula near the Dardanelles using mainly British, French and Indian troops along with the Australians and New Zealanders.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks. To discourage {{the spread of the}} uprising, Cass promptly invited Native Americans in the region to come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance {{that the only way to}} avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with other Native leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them to stay <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E
50|$|The old, sombre gatehouses were {{demolished}} {{because they}} impeded transport and were an outmoded form <b>of</b> defence. <b>The</b> walls were built over in places.

5|$|Louis XIV of France {{sought to}} knock Emperor Leopold <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> by seizing Vienna, the Habsburg capital, and gain a {{favourable}} peace settlement. The dangers to Vienna were considerable: the Elector of Bavaria and Marshal Marsin's forces in Bavaria threatened from the west, and Marshal Vendôme's large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger {{with a potential}} offensive through the Brenner Pass. Vienna was also under pressure from Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the Duke of Marlborough resolved to alleviate the peril to Vienna by marching his forces south from Bedburg and help maintain Emperor Leopold within the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|The V-2 rocket was one {{of several}} {{innovative}} long-range weapons developed by the Germans after the failure of the Luftwaffe to strike a decisive blow against Britain. It was a revolutionary weapon – the world's first operational SRBM – that had been developed in a secret programme begun in 1936. The German leadership hoped that a barrage of rockets unleashed against London would force Britain <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Although Adolf Hitler was at first ambivalent, he eventually became an enthusiastic supporter of the V-2 programme as Allied air forces carried out increasingly devastating attacks on German cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle has}} gone {{down in history as}} one of the turning points of the War of the Spanish Succession. Bavaria was knocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> and Louis' hopes for a quick victory came to an end. France {{suffered}} over 38,000 casualties including the commander-in-chief, Marshal Tallard, who was taken captive to England. Before the 1704 campaign ended, the Allies had taken Landau, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle in preparation for the following year's campaign into France itself.|$|E

50|$|Kanazawa flourished {{largely because}} of a {{mutually}} beneficial relationship between the daimyōs and the chōnin. The samurai relied on merchants and artisans for goods and services, while the chōnin were able to thrive because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protection that the daimyōs provided. Coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> States period, castle towns were particularly appealing because of their security and defenses, both architecturally and thanks to samurai warriors who guarded the land.|$|R
25|$|On 18 July 2003, the Transitional Government {{came into}} being as {{specified}} in the Global and All-Inclusive Agreement <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>warring</b> parties. <b>The</b> Agreement obliges the parties {{to carry out a}} plan to reunify the country, disarm and integrate <b>the</b> <b>warring</b> parties and hold elections.

5|$|The border war {{escalated}} in 1777 after British {{officials in}} Detroit began recruiting and arming Indian war parties to raid the frontier American settlements. An {{unknown number of}} American settlers in present Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania were killed during these raids. The intensity of the conflict increased in November 1777, after enraged American militiamen murdered Cornstalk, the leading advocate of Shawnee neutrality. Despite the violence, many Ohio Indians still hoped to stay <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> which proved difficult because they were located directly between the British in Detroit and the Americans along the Ohio River.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} territorial {{gains of}} the Palestine offensive {{contrasted with the}} British Expeditionary Force's offensive on the Western Front at Cambrai. Fought in Flanders from 20 to 30 November, it ended with heavy losses and no gains. The French army was still recovering from a serious mutiny, the Italians were defeated at the Battle of Caporetto, and Russia was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> following the Bolshevik Revolution. Allenby's advance by comparison made considerable territorial gains, helped secure Baghdad and the oilfields at Basra in Mesopotamia, encouraged the Arab Revolt, and inflicted irreplaceable losses on the Ottoman Army.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of {{rudimentary}} training in Australia, the first contingent of the AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on 1 November 1914. Although they were originally bound for England to undergo further training prior to employment on the Western Front, the Australians were instead sent to British-controlled Egypt in order to pre-empt any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal, and {{with a view to}} opening another front against the Central Powers. Aiming to knock Turkey <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following {{a period of}} training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British, Indian and French forces committed to the campaign. The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps—commanded by British general William Birdwood—subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915. Although promising to transform the war if successful, the Gallipoli Campaign was ill-conceived and shortly after the landing a blood stalemate developed. This ultimately lasted eight months before Allied commanders decided to evacuate the troops without having achieved the campaign's objectives.

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Austria-Hungary, Panther initially {{served with the}} main fleet. During this period, she visited Spain for the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. Starting in the mid-1890s, the ship {{spent much of her}} time abroad. From 1896 to 1898, she was stationed in China, and she sent a shore party to help United States Marines protect US civilians during a riot. She went on a cruise in the Mediterranean in 1902, and in 1905, she visited East Africa. Panther was modernized in 19091910 and received a new gun armament. At the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, the ship was assigned to the Coastal Defense Special Group; these ships provided artillery support to an Austro-Hungarian Army attack in January 1916 that knocked Montenegro <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> The next year, Panther was withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a training ship. Awarded to Britain in the postwar division of war prizes, Panther was broken up for scrap in Italy in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Alongside Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu (whom {{he succeeded}} as Premier), Tătărescu became a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} group of maverick pro-Carol politicians. After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard, the Front attempted to reunite political forces in a national government that was to back Carol's foreign policies in view of increasing threats on Romania's borders after the outbreak of World War II. In 1945, Tătărescu stressed his belief that authoritarianism benefited Romania, and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Tătărescu's second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies, but it did not draw any support from traditional parties, and, in April 1940, Carol, assisted by Ernest Urdăreanu and Mihail Ghelmegeanu, began talks with the (by then much weaker) Iron Guard.|$|E
5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
50|$|Ptolemy III Euergetes ("the benefactor") succeeded {{his father}} in 246 BC.

5|$|Despite their {{significant}} military advantage {{the allied}} armies encountered immediate setbacks. Denmark–Norway was quickly knocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> by a bold Swedish landing on Humlebæk {{resulting in the}} Peace of Travendal. After this development, the Swedish army under Charles XII was free to sail east across the Baltic sea to tackle the remaining opponents, Russia and Saxony. In response to this threat, Augustus lifted the siege of Riga and marched back across the Düna river in order to observe the Swedish movements. Charles then decided to march against Peter I of Russia, who was besieging Narva, {{with the aim of}} saving the city. Shortly later the two armies met in the battle of Narva. This ended in a decisive Swedish victory which greatly crippled the Russian army, forcing them to abandon their campaign in Swedish territory and withdraw to Russia.|$|E
5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory {{captured by the}} treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|From July to August 1764, Johnson {{negotiated}} a treaty at Fort Niagara with about 2,000 Native Americans in attendance, primarily Iroquois. Although most Iroquois had stayed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Senecas from the Genesee River valley {{had taken up}} arms against the British, and Johnson worked {{to bring them back}} into the Covenant Chain alliance. As restitution for the Devil's Hole ambush, the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British. Johnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Native Americans. This Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the Susquehanna Valley, but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired.|$|E
