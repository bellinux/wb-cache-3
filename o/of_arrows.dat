5|$|The {{precepts of}} Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force {{must be the}} last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its {{objective}} to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> is allowed, but use <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, Pausanias {{refused to}} advance because good omens were not divined in the goat sacrifices that were performed. At this point, as Greek {{soldiers}} {{began to fall}} under the barrage <b>of</b> <b>arrows,</b> the Tegeans started to run at the Persian lines. Offering one last sacrifice and a prayer to the heavens {{in front of the}} Temple of Hera, Pausanias finally received favourable omens and gave the command for the Spartans to advance, whereupon they also charged the Persian lines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Arrows {{are major}} {{components}} of diagrams, {{where they are}} typically used to facilitate the communication of spatial and temporal knowledge. An automated interpretation <b>of</b> <b>arrow</b> diagrams would be highly desirable in pen-based interfaces. This paper develops a method for deducing possible interpretations <b>of</b> <b>arrow</b> diagrams, which is composed <b>of</b> a uni-directional <b>arrow</b> symbol and one or more components. Based on {{a study of the}} use <b>of</b> <b>arrow</b> diagrams, we classify their semantics into properties, annotations, actions, and conjunctions. Then, we discuss the structural requirements <b>of</b> <b>arrow</b> diagrams for illustrating each class of semantics, as well as the structural rules for adding optional components. Finally, we investigate all possible structures <b>of</b> simple <b>arrow</b> diagrams for each class of semantics and demonstrate that knowledge about the structure <b>of</b> an <b>arrow</b> diagram reduces the ambiguity of its interpretation. ...|$|R

5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers {{to step forward}} again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off {{the ground in front}} of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 157 of Njáls saga, a {{man named}} Dörruð {{witnesses}} 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, {{and that they have}} set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the warp and weft, a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed <b>of</b> <b>arrows.</b> The women sing a song called Darraðarljóð, which Dörruð memorizes.|$|E
5|$|Kid Icarus is {{an action}} {{platformer}} with role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist Pit through two-dimensional levels, which contain monsters, obstacles and items. Pit's primary weapon is a bow with an unlimited supply <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> {{that can be}} upgraded with three collectable power items: the guard crystal shields Pit from enemies, the flaming arrows hit multiple targets, and the holy bow increases {{the range of the}} arrows. These upgrades will work only if Pit's health is high enough. The game keeps track of the player's score, and increases Pit's health bar {{at the end of a}} level if enough points were collected.|$|E

Through the formalization of the structural patterns <b>of</b> <b>arrow</b> diagrams, this paper identifies three structural properties <b>of</b> <b>arrow</b> diagrams that contribute the interpretation of arrows: (1) the assignment of the components to the three slots, (2) the semantic types of these components, and (3) {{the orientation of the}} objects. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{situation}} was now precarious and violence appeared likely as the rebels prepared to unleash a volley <b>of</b> <b>arrows.</b> Richard rode forwards towards {{the crowd and}} persuaded them to follow him away from Smithfields, to Clerkenwell Fields, defusing the situation. Walworth meanwhile began {{to regain control of}} the situation, backed by reinforcements from the city. Tyler's head was cut off and displayed on a pole and, with their leader dead and the royal government now backed by the London militia, the rebel movement began to collapse. Richard promptly knighted Walworth and his leading supporters for their services.|$|E
5|$|After {{realizing that}} no {{reinforcements}} would come, Thomas decided {{to launch a}} counter offensive. Early in {{the third week of}} September 634, Thomas drew men from all sectors of the city to form a force strong enough to break through the Gate of Thomas. He was there faced by Shurahbil with his corps of about 5,000 men. The Byzantine attack began with a concentrated shower <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> against the Muslims. The Byzantine infantry, covered by the archers on the wall, rushed through the gate and fanned out into battle formation. Thomas himself led the assault. During this action, Thomas was struck in his right eye by an arrow. Unsuccessful in breaking the Muslim lines, the Byzantines retreated back to the fortress. The wounded Thomas is said to have sworn to take a thousand eyes in return. He ordered another great sortie for that night.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, the Spanish {{expedition}} {{had to cross}} the river several times and fight at each ford against stiff opposition. The bulk of the Inca army confronted the Spaniards from a set of terraces overlooking a plain by the Urubamba River. Several Spanish assaults against the terraces failed against a shower <b>of</b> <b>arrows,</b> slingshots and boulders {{coming down from the}} terraces as well as from both flanks. To hinder the efforts of the Spanish cavalry the Incas flooded the plain using previously prepared channels; water eventually reached the horses' girths. The defenders then counterattacked; some of them used Spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords, bucklers, armor and even a horse, ridden by Manco Inca himself. In a severely compromised situation, Hernando Pizarro ordered a retreat; under the cover of darkness the Spanish force fled through the Urubamba valley with the Incas in pursuit and reached Cusco the next day.|$|E
5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A streamline {{analysis is}} a series <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine cavalry {{was armed}} with a long sword, known as the spathion. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a kontarion and a bow (toxarion) with forty arrows in a quiver, hung from a saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as skoutatoi, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the {{shoulder}} across the back and a quiver <b>of</b> <b>arrows.</b> Cavalry armor consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant, i.e. a throat-guard lined with fabric and having a fringe and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a helmet and leg armor. Light lamellar and scale armor was also used.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{was already}} {{obsolete}} {{by the time}} it had been completed, as European military design had moved beyond curved bastions, embracing the angular designs seen in the later star forts. Nonetheless, it remained operational as an artillery fort {{for the rest of the}} century, with an initial garrison in 1540 of 24 men under the command of Chute, rising to 28 men and the captain after 1542. Although it had been fitted with gunloops for handguns from the very start, the castle initially relied heavily on archers for its own protection against attack from the land. It had stocks of 140 longbows and 560 sheaves <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> in 1568, for example, probably for use by the local militia in the event of a war. Polearms were also stored there in considerable numbers, again probably for use by the militia.|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviest}} fighting {{occurred at}} the Thomas gate, where Thomas again commanded the sally in person. After intense fighting, Thomas, seeing {{that there was no}} weakening in the Muslim front, decided that continuing the attack would be fruitless and would lead to even heavier casualties among his men. He ordered a withdrawal and the Romans moved back at a steady pace, during which they were subjected to a concentrated shower <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> by the Muslims. This was the last attempt by Thomas to break the siege. The attempt had failed. He had lost thousands of men in these sallies, and could no longer afford to fight outside the walls of the city.|$|E
5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather conditions. Barrichello set the fastest time in the first practice session, at 1 minute and 41.953 seconds, which was three-tenths of a second quicker than Pedro de la Rosa <b>of</b> <b>Arrows.</b> Coulthard was third fastest despite going off the circuit at the Clark chicane. Michael Schumacher went off at the Senna chicane en route to recording the fourth quickest lap, ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Häkkinen, Montoya, Irvine, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. In the second practice session, Irvine was running quicker by setting the fastest {{time of the day}} of 1:41.424, ahead of Montoya in second. Häkkinen was third quickest, in front of Barrichello in fourth. Michael Schumacher took fifth place, running wide at the circuit's chicanes which prevented him from setting a quicker lap. de la Rosa, Coulthard, Jean Alesi, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher, who collided with the Sudkurve tyre barrier, followed in the top ten.|$|E
5|$|Montejo {{followed}} up on the victory at Cerquín by sending two companies of soldiers to the Comayagua valley, {{under the command of}} Xuárez de Ávila and Alonso de Reinoso. He sent more soldiers into the mountainous regions around San Pedro, and personally commanded forays around Gracias a Dios to eliminate any isolated pockets of resistance there. The campaign in the Comayagua valley proved difficult; the Spanish were hindered by the broken terrain, while the natives were still determined to resist and had established fortified mountaintops in a similar fashion to the Peñol de Cerquín. In spite of supplies provided by Montejo, food was scarce, and it was difficult to replenish their stocks locally in the face of native hostility. The Indians launched fierce assaults from their fortresses, then would retreat to their mountain-tops, raining showers <b>of</b> <b>arrows</b> and boulders upon the attacking Spanish. Cavalry were nearly useless in the difficult terrain, and the Spanish were forced to resort to foot soldiers supported by light artillery. In response to the difficulty of the campaign, the two Spanish expeditions under Xúarez and Reinoso joined into a combined force. Cáceres had now returned to Gracias from the Peñol de Cerquín, so Montejo sent him to Comayagua with a strong detachment of soldiers and plentiful supplies. Although the campaign in the Comayagua valley drew on into 1538 without a decisive victory, the Spanish were able to reestablish the town of Santa María de Comayagua.|$|E
5|$|Two {{pursuing}} royalist armies harried MacGregor constantly as {{he retreated}} across country, {{but failed to}} break his rearguard. With no carts and {{only a handful of}} horses, the Scotsman was forced to leave his wounded where they fell. Late on 27 July MacGregor's way east was obstructed by a royalist force at Chaguaramas, south of Caracas and {{about a third of the}} distance to Barcelona. MacGregor led his men in a furious charge that prompted a Spanish retreat back into Chaguaramas, then continued towards Barcelona. The Spanish remained in the town until 30 July, giving MacGregor two days' head start, and caught up with him only on 10 August. The Scotsman deployed his 1,200 men, mostly native archers, behind a marsh and a stream—the Spanish cavalry were bogged down in the marsh, while the archers repelled the infantry with volleys <b>of</b> <b>arrows.</b> After three hours MacGregor charged and routed the royalists. MacGregor's party was helped the rest of the way east to Barcelona by elements of the main revolutionary army. They arrived on 20 August 1816, after 34 days' march.|$|E
