40|$|International audienceGovernmental {{policies}} are encouraging companies {{to reduce the}} environmental impact of their packaging and particularly <b>overpackaging,</b> which raises a broad range of ethical considerations. However, experiments comparing an overpackaged product with a non-overpackaged product have shown that eliminating <b>overpackaging</b> may have a negative influence on brand image and consumer purchase intention. In this paper, we draw on attribution theory to examine the influence of the absence (vs. presence) of <b>overpackaging</b> on consumers' response, depending on their environmental consciousness and the absence (vs. presence) of <b>overpackaging</b> on the competing product. An experiment conducted on 218 consumers demonstrates that non-overpackaging for a target product only adversely affects purchase intention among non-environmentally conscious consumers when competing products are overpackaged. These results lead to optimistic recommendations for marketing managers and public policy makers to help them solve the ethical dilemma linked to <b>overpackaging...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Eliminating <b>overpackaging</b> is {{a central}} {{question}} in sustainable development, and poses a dilemma for retailers. Since packaging is a differentiation tool for private labels, eliminating it could limit the capacity to give those labels an equivalent image to national brands {{just as much as}} it could be a sustainable development opportunity and a positioning instrument. Drawing on the attribution theory framework, this article examines how eliminating <b>overpackaging</b> influences consumers’ perception of products sold under generic and mimic private labels, and their purchase intention. Methodology – This research uses a 2 (overpackaging: present vs. absent) x 2 (brand concept: generic vs. mimic private label) between-subjects experiment on a convenience sample of 217 French consumers. The conceptual framework was tested using ANCOVA and mediation analyses. Findings – Our experiment shows that eliminating <b>overpackaging</b> does have an influence on mimic private labels’ image, particularly on perceived quality, convenience and environmental friendliness. We also find that this influence negatively transfers to purchase intention for mimic private labels through lower perceived quality and convenience. No such effect appears for generic private labels’ image. Value – This study addresses an issue as yet unexplored in marketing – the effect of <b>overpackaging</b> on private label products – and proposes areas for managerial and societal reflection relevant to retail chains interested in eliminating <b>overpackaging...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audiencePrevious {{experiments}} underlined {{the impact}} overpack-aging elimination on brand image and purchase intention. However, these experiments {{did not consider}} the potential effects of competitors’ strategies in terms of <b>overpackaging</b> when evaluating {{the impact of a}} target brand decision to eliminate <b>overpackaging.</b> Based on context effects and attribution theory, the present paper shows that the influence of verpackaging elimination on consumers’ response may depend on the absence vs. presence of <b>overpackaging</b> on the competing product. An experiment conducted among 218 consumers reveals that eliminating verpackaging can lead to a decrease in consumers’ intention to buy the product but this negative impact is no longer true: (1) when competitors are also getting rid of overpackaging; (2) among consumers that are highly concerned about the environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} an analytical investigation of a current issue - <b>overpackaged</b> products. Theoretical part at first summarizes packages in general, especially from the environmental, legislative and consumer aspects. Afterwards is this part directly focused on <b>overpackaged</b> products issue. Results of the questionnaire surveys "The analysis relating to knowledge about <b>overpackaged</b> products by Czech consumers" and "Overpackaging at baby milk products", are besides other things discussed in the practical part of this bachelor thesis. After that are there summarized reaction of the appropriate organizations gained by an e-mail correspondence. This part of the thesis also focused on an investigation on selected commodities, which are problematic because of using much more material for packaging than is needed. The conclusion summarizes the results of my thesis and describes the possible elimination of this issue...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of waste {{management}} there is an increasing demand for the avoidance of waste. European and German regulations on packaging require a minimization of packaging waste by means of reuse, recycling, or other recovery processes. To avoid both, unnecessary <b>overpackaging</b> and product damage due to transportation loads, packaging have to be designed to the real transportation environment. Reliable and representative data of typical transportation loads within commercial distribution chains are necessary. The problem is that those data are currently not available with the required quality. In Germany, a working group on transportation loads has been reestablished within the German standardization organisation DIN. It aims to the collection, evaluation and compilation of appropriate data for the different transportation vehicles like trucks, railway trains, aircargo equipment, ships and automatic conveyers. The paper summarizes the recent developments within this group, the Europea n standardization on packaging (CEN TC 261) and other international actions with special respect to mechanical dynamical loads and test standards...|$|E
40|$|Packaging {{occupies}} {{an indispensable}} {{part of everyday}} life. Even though packaging is meant to ensure that products arrive in excellent condition, so as to satisfy required needs, more often than not, consumers, as well as industrial users {{are more interested in}} the product itself than its packaging. However, if the packaging fails, the product is potentially unfit to serve its purpose. In order {{to meet the demands of}} industry, the packaging industry in Greece has evolved, mainly through new investment. This investing has boosted the market by adding quality to the products and affects corporate efficiency in a positive way. Industrial operations are subject to environmental legislation, such as the 94 / 62 EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive, which aims at optimising the various methods used in reprocessing the packaging materials after their having been used. The literature review enables comprehension of particular issues pertinent to the discussion on packaging, since it draws attention to various kinds of paper packaging. This research explores the role and importance of paper packaging in the supply chain and in proposing improvements that may ameliorate current packaging practices. This research project explores packaging operations, as well as the issues related to the packaging supply chain, with respect to the Greek market. Moreover, it seeks to identify the occurrence of impediments, which arise as a result of inner operating discrepancies between the European Union countries, regarding the implementation of Directives such as the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94 / 62 /EC). Key issues related to packaging are thoroughly scrutinised in this research. Among them, the relation between packaging and the environment is investigated, the <b>overpackaging</b> issue, along with packaging redesign, are examined, as they are all interrelated facets of the research, regarding the endeavour to enhance packaging performance. Therefore, packaging performance is examined in relation to some major aspects such as warehousing, storage, and transportation, as well as how to improve packaging expenditure. From this point of view, the issues examined are subsequently connected to the analysis of the current environmental problems and the ways to minimise them. This study includes not only a survey of both the market and the supply chain but also of the participants in them. A detailed case study of multiple respondents’ categories was developed for this reason. The data, which were collected through a specially designed questionnaire adjusted to the various categories of the respondents, were treated and analysed in order to assist the conclusions. Following the above, this research delves deeply into issues of paramount significance, such as <b>overpackaging</b> and packaging redesign, approaching them with laboratory methods. The research applies both theoretical methods, based on the literature, and common industrial practices. Originating from industrial sources, the data give evidence to the reliability of the results, adding insight into the issues investigated. Furthermore, this research points out the potential to significantly ameliorate a company’s packaging performance through analysing and conducting crucial modifications to packaging design. Problems such as the packaging legislation and the discrepancies related to it among countries, not only of the EU but also of those not belonging to it, are thoroughly investigated, showing the unstable market circumstances created due to the rivalry among countries, which stems from inadequate legislation...|$|E
40|$|Packaging {{is not an}} {{abundant}} and luxurious thing, just good for <b>overpackaging</b> and waste, but has firstly a function in product protection. This is only to reach, if there is knowledge about the interdependence between the sensitivity of foods to the different environmental conditions and {{the properties of the}} many kinds of packaging materials and constructions. Furthermore it is an optimising operation involving scientific, technical, commercial and nowadays also ecological items. Recently these questions became actual, because the keeping quality of foods in consumer packages is no longer a more or less defined and codified declaration, {{but it has to be}} open dated. Who is engaged in this problem knows, that the discussions concerning the quality level which has to be realised not yet are finished. Sure is you cannot indicate one general date for a special product in the different types of packages. In this situation a scientist suddenly may find himself involved in the rather hard competition of the industrial companies on the market. Of importance in all these described influences and reactions is a decision as to what extent of degradation is considered to be the end of shelf-life. In many cases the data must be correlated with sensory testing of foods and voting based on a scale. Nevertheless all over the world attempts are made to use the highly sophisticated methods of modern instrumental analysis in combination with date processing in this field. However we are far away to have objective data to characterise food quality comprehensive...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to compile and {{interpret}} drop heights and drop frequencies data for small parcel packages moving through the Eastman Kodak Company global distribution network. The need for this study arose from the inclusion of drop height probability curves into Kodak 2 ̆ 7 s shipping tests for packaged product weighing less than 100 lb. Kodak packaging engineers suspected the drop heights included in the probability curves were too high in drop height and too many in frequency when compared to the actual distribution environment. The data for this study resulted from dozens of test shipments using dummy-load packages throughout the Kodak global distribution network. The test shipments were conducted in the United States, Europe, and Australia. The test packages were equipped with a drop-height recording device called a SAVER to record when a drop occurred and from what height the package was dropped. Data from the recorder was downloaded, 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 events were sorted out from events that were not true drops. Once sorting was completed, the 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 data was analyzed utilizing various statistical techniques. The results of the analysis led to the development of data-derived statistical test plans based on the actual field-measured data. The results of this experiment, when compared to the probability curve currently in use, show that the drop heights outlined in the probability curve are too high and too many are called for. This experiment will serve as the basis for new shipping tests based on actual field measurements. The field data indicates that the current test may have led to overtesting and <b>overpackaging</b> of our products. These findings identify an opportunity for waste reduction as well as an overall reduction in expenditure for packaging...|$|E
