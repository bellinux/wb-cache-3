5|$|Photons mediate {{electromagnetic}} {{interactions between}} particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron {{at a constant}} velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. This exchange <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|E
5|$|When a pair <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> {{particles}} (such as {{an electron}} and positron) is {{created in the}} vicinity of the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E

This is a challenge especially for small and medium enterprises. Still lack a model that would help to functioning <b>of</b> the <b>virtual</b> enterprise effectively. Methodology/methods: Given the nature <b>of</b> the <b>virtual</b> enterprise, {{it is very difficult}} to carry out a quantitative research, because for this purpose is needed large amount of data. For the evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>virtual</b> enterprise benefits for the initiator is created criterion function that serves for selection of suitable partners for the virtual enterprise in terms of efficiency and quantification of the benefits for the initiator in a particular case. The application of designed function is demonstrated by using the case study approach.
