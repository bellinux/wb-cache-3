50|$|The torque {{switching}} is {{not only}} used for torque seating in the end position, but it also serves as overload protection over the whole travel and protects the valve against excessive torque. If excessive torque acts upon the closing element in an intermediate position, e.g. due to a trapped object, the torque switching will trip when reaching the set tripping torque. In this situation the end position is not signalled by the limit switch. The controls can therefore distinguish between normal <b>operation</b> <b>torque</b> switch tripping {{in one of the}} end positions and switching off in an intermediate position due to excessive torque.|$|E

The variation of stator and rotor resistance due to changes in temperature or frequency deteriorates the performance of DTC controller by introducing errors in the estimated flux linkage and the electromagnetic torque. As a result, this approach will not be suitable for high power drives such as those used in tractions, as they require good torque control performance at considerably lower frequency. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to validate the proposed technique. The system is tested at different speeds and a very satisfactory performance has been achieved...|$|R

50|$|The sport {{differential}} operates {{by using}} two superposition ("step up") gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches {{each side of}} the differential crown wheel. When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal yaw sensors, the ABS wheel sensors, and a steering wheel sensor), the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the step-up gear to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher speed output shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (turning) moment.

The paper studies the field weakening control strategy for the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) and provides a field weakening control strategy for the IPMSM at the full-speed range. By studying the mathematical IPMSM model and the methods of conventional vector control and analyzing the operating conditions of the IPMSM at the full-speed range, the paper divides the operating conditions into constant <b>torque</b> <b>operation</b> region I, constant <b>torque</b> <b>operation</b> region II, constant power field weakening operation region and high-speed field weakening operation region to confirm the control strategy algorithm in each region and the transition conditions between regions and provide the current control strategy that the d-axis current and q-axis current are confirmed by the reference torque and the feedback speed.
