5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described in the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited {{in our ability to}} understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|Koch himself {{believes}} that a considerable part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> can be dated to the 6th century. Greene in 1971 considered that the language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> was 9th century rather than 6th century, and Isaac, writing in 1999, stated that the linguistic evidence did not necessitate dating the poem as a whole before the 9th or 10th century.|$|E

The poem focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> Critics have focused on other aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E

5|$|Joan of Arc is a 1796 epic poem {{composed}} by Robert Southey. The {{idea for the}} story came from a discussion between Southey and Grosvenor Bedford, when Southey realised that the story would be suitable for an epic. The subject further appealed to Southey because {{the events of the}} French Revolution were concurrent to the writing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> and would serve as a parallel to current events. Eventually, Samuel Taylor Coleridge helped rewrite parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> for a 1798 edition. Later editions removed Coleridge's additions along with other changes.|$|E
5|$|Njörðr is {{referenced}} in stanza 22 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> Þrymskviða, {{where he}} {{is referred to as}} the father of the goddess Freyja. In the poem, the jötunn Þrymr mistakenly thinks that he will be receiving the goddess Freyja as his bride, and while telling his fellow jötunn to spread straw on the benches in preparation for the arrival of Freyja, he refers to her as the daughter of Njörðr of Nóatún. Towards the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> Sólarljóð, Njörðr is cited as having nine daughters. Two of the names of these daughters are given; the eldest Ráðveig and the youngest Kreppvör.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> occurs, Tolkien writes, at line 1887, {{after which}} all the earlier story is summarized, so a complete account of Beowulf's tragedy is given between 1888 and the end, but without {{the account of the}} gloomy court of Heorot, or of the contrast between the young Beowulf and the old Hrothgar.|$|E
5|$|According to Lokasenna, Loki rebukes {{the gods}} {{at the start}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> for not {{properly}} welcoming him to the feast at Ægir's hall.

5|$|In July 1793, Southey {{discussed}} {{the story of}} Joan of Arc with Grosvenor Bedford, his friend. The conversation led to him believe that Joan of Arc {{would serve as a}} good basis for an epic so he began to work a plan for the poem and started composing lines. The subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> appealed to Southey because it reflected incidents surrounding the French Revolution that started in early 1793. By 8 August, he had around 300lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> written. On 13 August, he devoted his time to writing a 12-book poem that he hoped to complete by the end of September. After admitting this desire for haste in the preface to the poem's first edition, critics accused Southey of not spending enough time on composing the poem. During Summer 1794, Southey attempted to find a publisher for John of Arc while taking up The Fall of Robespierre, a poetic drama about the French Revolution, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.|$|E
5|$|In some {{versions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> considered older, Lalli's {{weapon was}} a sword. The axe was {{the murder weapon}} of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E
