5|$|The {{dynamical}} effects <b>of</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine {{would explain}} five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} Solar System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the plane of the Solar System. While other mechanisms have been offered for many of these peculiarities the gravitational influence <b>of</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine {{is the only one that}} explains all five. The dynamical effects <b>of</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E
5|$|There are {{types of}} planets {{that do not}} exist in the Solar System: super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of {{volatiles}} and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types <b>of</b> <b>planet.</b> There are hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become chthonian planets, which are the leftover cores. Another possible type <b>of</b> <b>planet</b> is carbon planets, which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers {{expect that}} the {{discovery}} <b>of</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine would aid in understanding the processes behind {{the formation of the}} Solar System and other planetary systems, as well as how unusual the Solar System is, with a lack of planets with masses between that of Earth and that of Neptune, compared to other planetary systems.|$|E
5|$|Batygin and Brown also {{predict a}} yet-to-be-discovered {{population}} of distant objects.

5|$|Kepler-9c is a gas giant that {{is smaller}} and {{slightly}} less massive than planet Saturn. It is approximately 0.171 MJ, or 17% the mass <b>of</b> <b>planet</b> Jupiter. It {{also has a}} radius of 0.823 RJ, which makes it slightly smaller (1.5%) than Saturn. The planet is, on average, situated 0.225 AU from the star.|$|E
5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and resonant dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long timescales and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia oscillate. The resonant dynamics acts on shorter timescales and provides phase protection, maintaining the stability of the objects by preventing close approaches. The inclination <b>of</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of the objects circle that of the Solar System's Laplace plane, which is bent toward the plane <b>of</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered toward one side.|$|E

5|$|The bending of the Laplace {{plane of}} the Solar System toward that <b>of</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the ascending nodes and arguments of perihelion of the extreme TNOs. The Laplace plane defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit precesses with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum <b>of</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine causes the Laplace plane to bend toward that of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit precess about the Laplace plane, they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the ecliptic pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were found to be more stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a libration of the longitudes of ascending nodes with respect to the ecliptic making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of perihelion this can also produce clustering of the arguments of perihelion.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of the orbits of comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit <b>of</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. If these orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a declination of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of this analysis, notes that many different forces influence the orbits of comets.|$|E
5|$|An {{improved}} {{mathematical analysis}} of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the constraints on possible locations <b>of</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine. Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} explore a broader range of parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is most likely to be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes <b>of</b> <b>planet</b> formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E
