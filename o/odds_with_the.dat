5|$|The {{secretary}} to the president, Hong Soo-jin (Myung Ji-yun), tends {{to find herself}} at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> head of the his chief advisor. She rarely speaks her mind freely and appears to have allegiances beyond those that are already apparent.|$|E

5|$|As Chief Minister, Modi favoured {{privatisation}} {{and small}} government, {{which was at}} <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth 6.6trillion were signed.|$|E
5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> realities of the impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 Shaw {{invested}} £1,000 for a one-fifth {{share in}} the Webbs' new publishing venture, a socialist weekly magazine called the New Statesman, which appeared in April 1913. He became a founding director, publicist, and in due course a contributor, mostly anonymously. He was soon at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> magazine's editor, Clifford Sharp, who by 1916 was rejecting his contributions—"the only paper {{in the world that}} refuses to print anything by me", according to Shaw.|$|E
50|$|Katerina Ksenyeva {{was born}} in Saint Petersburg, Russia (formerly Leningrad, USSR). Her father is the widely {{acclaimed}} film director Yuri Mamin whose dissident views often put him at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> Soviet authorities and current Russian capitalist policies.

5|$|The {{results of}} archeological studies of 9th- and 10th-century gords in Greater Poland are at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{timing of this}} story. There was no Gniezno {{settlement}} in the 9th century; there was a pagan cult site there beginning only {{at the turn of}} the 10th century. The Gniezno gord was built around year 940, possibly because the location, of great spiritual importance to the tribal community, would rally the local population around its building and defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{synopsis}} is at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reviewers of {{the film}} who state that the arrow which reveals the hidden cache is shot by the little boy and not the mother. The image still shows the woman with a large bow, but further details by the reviewers state that the boy used a toy bow and arrow to make the shot.|$|E
5|$|This was at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and {{resulted}} in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on the nuclear weapons program. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration. After some debate, this resulted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.|$|E
50|$|Voight was {{reunited with}} {{director}} Boorman in 1998's The General. Set in Dublin, Ireland, the film tells the true-life {{story of the}} charismatic leader of a gang of thieves, Martin Cahill, at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> police and the Provisional IRA. Voight portrays Inspector Ned Kenny, determined to bring Cahill to justice.|$|R

5|$|When the WFM {{withdrew from}} the IWW in 1907, Bill Haywood {{remained}} a member of both organizations. His murder trial had made Haywood a celebrity, {{and he was in}} demand as a speaker for the WFM. But his increasingly radical speeches became more at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> WFM, and in April 1908, the WFM announced that the union had ended Haywood's role as a union representative. Haywood left the WFM, and devoted all his time to organizing for the IWW.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} TNA X Division Championship at Against All Odds, Jay Lethal {{went on to}} defend the title against Petey Williams at Destination X. Lethal {{retained}} the title at the event. However, the storyline between Steiner and Williams continued after Against All <b>Odds,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> two creating a partnership, in which Steiner gave Williams the TNA X Division Feast or Fired Title shot, which Williams used on the April 17, 2008 episode of Impact! to win the title. Meanwhile, Steiner went on to use the TNA World Heavyweight Feast or Fired Title shot at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event on May 11, 2008, in a losing effort against then-champion Samoa Joe and Kaz in a 3-Way Dance.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's work became {{increasingly}} controversial among literary critics, {{teachers and parents}} from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|Hiram Lodge is {{the father}} of Veronica and the second protagonist of the series. He is at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Archie {{throughout}} <b>the</b> series as the two do not hold the same views concerning the zombie outbreak.|$|R
5000|$|Margolis {{identifies}} {{his politics}} as [...] "Eisenhower Republican".

50|$|Oliver Ridsdale Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1 March 1899- 10 August 1958), {{known as}} Viscount Corvedale from 1937 to 1947, was a British socialist {{politician}} {{who had a}} career at political <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> his father, <b>the</b> Conservative prime minister Stanley Baldwin.|$|R
5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This is at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> traditional Egyptian system where {{the legitimacy of the}} new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> duty of a {{judge to}} stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; {{as a member of}} society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, {{after the}} {{separation}} of the western portion of the Indiana Territory to create the Illinois Territory, elections were held to select members of territorial legislature's upper and lower houses for the first time. (Previously, lower-house members were elected, but the territorial governor appointed members to the upper house.) Harrison found himself at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> legislature after the antislavery faction came to power and the eastern portion of the Indiana Territory grew to include a large, antislavery population. When the Indiana Territory's general assembly convened in 1810, its antislavery faction immediately repealed the indenturing laws enacted in 1803 and in 1805. After 1809 Harrison's political authority declined as the Indiana territorial legislature assumed more authority and the territory advanced toward statehood. By 1812 Harrison had moved away and resumed his military career.|$|E

5000|$|He {{did little}} {{professional}} work after 1940, and felt increasingly at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> modernism and <b>the</b> historical-artistic {{developments of the}} post-war period.

5000|$|Taylor's {{conviction}} that [...] "religion" [...] is a paradigm {{that can be}} understood to include entirely naturalistic worldviews puts him at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> many of <b>the</b> new atheist thinkers such as Christopher Hitchens and especially Richard Dawkins, whom he discusses directly in his book.|$|R
5|$|In 1910, {{controversy}} {{arose in}} the NP when lawyer Olaf Madsen– who had cooperated with Ola Thommessen for more than 20 years at the newspaper Verdens Gang and was responsible for its economic decisions– wanted to have more dividend for his investments in the newspaper. Editor Ola Thommessen considered this to be an inappropriate intervention in the editorial part of the newspaper, and took his staff with him and started a new newspaper named Tidens Tegn. Vogt supported Thommessen in his decision, and came at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chairman of Morgenbladets board, lawyer and politician Edmund Harbitz. Both left Morgenbladet {{in the summer of}} 1913 {{as a result of the}} disaccord, although Vogt continued as theatre and literature critic in the paper until his 1927 death. As editor, Vogt was succeeded by C. J. Hambro.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E
5|$|Olds was {{assigned}} to command the 71st Fighter Squadron, which was soon detached from the 1st FG to the Air Defense Command and based at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport in Pennsylvania. As a result, he missed service in the Korean War despite repeated applications for a combat assignment. Discouraged and at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Air Force, {{in which he was}} seen as an iconoclast, Olds reportedly {{was in the process of}} resigning when he was talked out of it by a mentor, Maj Gen Frederic H. Smith, Jr., who brought him to work at Eastern Air Defense Command headquarters at Stewart AFB.|$|E
50|$|Cupid was {{the enemy}} of chastity, and the poet Ovid opposes him to Diana, the virgin goddess of the hunt who {{likewise}} carries a bow but who hates Cupid's passion-provoking arrows. Cupid is also at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Apollo, <b>the</b> archer-brother of Diana and patron of poetic inspiration whose love affairs almost always end disastrously. Ovid blames Cupid for causing him to write love poetry instead of the more respectable epic.|$|R
40|$|György Ligeti (1923 - 2006) had {{a special}} {{affinity}} for the poetry of his countryman Sándor Weöres (1913 - 1989). Early songs set Weöres’ iridescent symbolism within spiky arrangements whose imagery seems at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> whose imagery seems at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> “new nationalism” advocated by Bartók and the prevailing doctrines of Socialist Realism. Ligeti set Hungarian again only twice, returning to poems by Weöres in 1983 (the 16 -voice Hungarian Etudes) and 2000 (Síppal, doppal, nádihegedűvel for mezzo-soprano and four percussionists). In these settings both poetry and music embody the “cosmopolitan imagination,” a condition of self-problematization promoting new relations between self, other and world. I argue that the free-floating exoticism of these works neither mimics nor merges the vernacular music that inspires it, but produces an authentic moment of aesthetic discovery. Weöres’s fantastic poems meet a similar sonic world to produce a singular event, a comic turn that grounds the universal in the concrete, whether the context be melancholy princesses, singing wolves, or dreaming apples...|$|R
50|$|On April 20, 2017, Bylsma was {{released}} by the Buffalo Sabres.
