40|$|All {{investors and}} {{stakeholders}} in general {{worry about the}} accuracy of both the financial information and the corporate governance, yet at different scales. Knowing that inadequacies exist in the financial information, would {{we be able to}} find some ways that would help us improve the credit rating of the firms? In order to answer this question, our research’s aim is to define the impact <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> following (analyst quest) on firm’s credit rating throughout the period between 2002 and 2014. The research’ results exhibit that the level <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> following has a positive influence on firms’ credit rating. However, this constructive influence occurs only when there is a significant degree <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> following. Indeed, at a low analyst following, our results reveal a negative correlation between this factor and the firm’s credit rating. Consequently, we end up concluding that a high degree <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> following makes it difficult for insiders to miscommunicate the right information related to firm’s value which reduces agency problems leading to a positive credit rating, thus a low cost of debt...|$|R

25|$|The {{momentum}} of set theory {{was such that}} debate on the paradoxes {{did not lead to}} its abandonment. The work of Zermelo in 1908 and Abraham Fraenkel in 1922 resulted in the set of axioms ZFC, which became the most commonly used set of axioms for set theory.

25|$|During the {{earliest}} parts of psychoanalytic history, analysts granted that homosexuality was non-pathological in certain cases, and the ethical {{question of whether}} it ought to be changed was discussed. By the 1920s analysts assumed that homosexuality was pathological and that attempts to treat it were appropriate, although psychoanalytic opinion about changing homosexuality was largely pessimistic. Those forms of homosexuality that were considered perversions were usually held to be uncurable. Analysts' tolerant statements about homosexuality arose from recognition of the difficulty of achieving change. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for roughly twenty years, major changes occurred in how analysts viewed homosexuality, which involved a shift in the rhetoric <b>of</b> <b>analysts,</b> some of whom felt free to ridicule and abuse their gay patients.|$|E

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{suggests}} that the public release <b>of</b> financial <b>analyst</b> output is informative to traders about firm value. However, empirical tests of this mechanism have encountered difficulties in isolating the release <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> output from concurrent intervening events such as analysts' private-client communications. Earnings conference calls provide {{a unique opportunity to}} overcome this obstacle: both analyst remarks and stock price movements can be measured publicly in real time. Accordingly, we find that the linguistic tone <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> comments during the call is significantly associated with intraday returns after appropriately controlling for management disclosures, explaining about one-third of the stock price movement during the discussion period. In reacting to analyst tone, traders anticipate future analyst predictions and recommendations on the company, which can help to explain why prior studies have found mixed evidence on the price reaction to the release of those products. Overall our findings suggest that traders use the public release <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> output to determine firm value...|$|R

25|$|A {{consensus}} among political pundits developed throughout the primary election season regarding swing states. From {{the results of}} presidential elections from 2004 through to 2012, the Democratic and Republican parties would generally start with a safe electoral vote count of about 150 to 200. However, the margins required to constitute a swing state are vague, and can vary between groups <b>of</b> <b>analysts.</b> It was thought that left-leaning states in the Rust Belt could become more conservative, as Trump had strong appeal among many blue-collar workers. They represent {{a large portion of}} the American populace and were a major factor in Trump's eventual nomination. Trump's primary campaign was propelled by victories in Democratic states, and his supporters often did not identify as Republican. In addition, local factors may come into play. For example, Utah was the reddest state in 2012, although the Republican share was boosted significantly by the candidacy of Mormon candidate Mitt Romney. Despite its partisan orientation, some reports suggested a victory there by independent candidate Evan McMullin, particularly if there was a nationwide blowout.|$|E

Two key results emerge : (i) Positive role of short-term price-impact.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the value <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> coverage on the covered firms. Design/methodology/approach – To isolate the value impact <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> coverage, the study focuses on a unique set of firms that receive analyst coverage for the first time after having been traded in an exchange for at least one year. Event study and ordinary least square regressions are used to test the hypotheses. Findings – There is a significant and positive price reaction at the time of the announcement <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> coverage initiations. However, unlike the coverage initiations around the initial public offers (IPOs), the price impact is not related to the reputation <b>of</b> the <b>analyst</b> firm, the exchange listing or whether the analyst firm is also the IPO underwriter. The sample firms do not experience significant reduction in the level of information asymmetry but experience a significant increase in liquidity. The increase in liquidity only occurs after the coverage initiations. The increase in liquidity is not explained by the increase in institutional investors' interest. Finally, the price impact around a coverage initiation is positively related to the change in liquidity. Practical implications – The findings suggest that firms benefit from analyst coverage through an improvement in liquidity. Originality/value – This is the first study to focus on the analysts' first-time coverage initiations. It argues that focusing on the first-time coverage initiations provides a better analysis of the effects <b>of</b> <b>analyst</b> activities on the firm value.
