5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War gave Finland a window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> achieve this. The Finns sought aid from both the German Empire and the Bolsheviks to that end, and on 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the country's independence. The new Bolshevik Russian government was weak, and soon the Russian Civil War would break out. Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin could spare no troops or attention for Finland, and consequently, Soviet Russia recognized the new Finnish government just {{three weeks after the}} declaration of independence. In 1918, the Finns fought a short civil war, where the pro-Bolshevik Red Guards were armed by 7,000 to 10,000 Russian troops stationed in Finland.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} study is (a) to define the concept <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn (OTL) as a {{theoretical}} category, (b) to present selected research tools that are most commonly used for investigating <b>opportunities,</b> and (c) <b>to</b> compare differences in defining and using <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn as a theoretical category in the Czech Republic and in the U. S., where the concept originated. In {{the first part of}} the study, a specific historical development <b>of</b> defining <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn is presented. Initially, the <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn were viewed as a theoretical category comprising the coherence between content of teaching and content requirements of (standardized) tests or curricula. Later, the scope <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn expanded towards examining school-dependent variables and school-independent variables related to school performance of students. In the second part <b>of</b> the study <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn are operationalised, including examples of methods and techniques used for their investigation. On an example of selected research, the study shows that the concept <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn in the U. S. primarily covers complex research-based analyses of the relationship between teaching and learning. This contrasts with the use <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn as a theoretical concept in the Czech Republic, where <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn mainly represent a theoretical basis for conducting microanalyses of teaching...|$|R

25|$|The Israelis {{were also}} deeply troubled by Egypt's {{procurement}} of {{large amounts of}} Soviet weaponry that included 530 armored vehicles, of which 230 were tanks; 500 guns; 150 MiG 15 jet fighters; 50 Ilyushin Il-28 bombers; submarines and other naval craft. The influx of this advanced weaponry altered an already shaky balance of power. Israel was alarmed by the Czech arms deal, and believed it had only a narrow window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> hit Egypt's army. Additionally, Israel believed Egypt had formed a secret alliance with Jordan and Syria.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason that}} churches were so {{segregated}} within the United States {{was that there}} was little push from African American church leaders to have integrated churches. It was often that White religious leaders pushed for integrated churches, while African American leaders preferred separate congregations. This may be in part due to several factors, including the lack <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> pursue leadership roles in predominantly White or segregated churches, the fact that African American churches allowed a place to build community, and for interests in practicing Christianity differently.|$|E

Also, the P-47 Thunderbolts of Ninth Air Force would be dispatched to perform fighter sweeps over Juvincourt after the Marauder raids, then meet up with the heavy bombers and provide fighter escort back to England. As the P-51 Mustang groups of Eighth Air Force began accompanying the heavy bombers all the way to their German targets by mid-1944, it was routine for them to also attack Juvincourt on their return to England with a fighter sweep and attack any target <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> be found at the airfield.|$|E

Because of {{his reputation as a}} botanist, Baldwin was selected to sail on the frigate USS Congress as a botanical investigator as well as the ship's surgeon. He embarked late in 1817 and returned to Wilmington in July 1818. During its voyage, Congress stopped at the ports of Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Maldonado, San Salvador, Brazil, and Margarita Island, Venezuela. During these stops, Baldwin found plenty <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> collect plants that he would press and dry for later study.|$|E
25|$|Some areas once rich in mopane worms are now barren due to over-harvesting {{and lack}} of a proper {{sustainable}} approach to commercial mopane worm farming. A good case is in Nkayi District, Zimbabwe, where most mopane woodland areas once produced a high population of these worms; but the harvests have decreased drastically. Suggestions of how to reintroduce the worms to these areas include re-colonisation. As the adult moth lives only three to four days, during which it must mate and lay eggs, {{there is only a}} small window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> relocate them. If this stage was to be successfully completed, collaboration with local farmers and communities would be required to ensure that the caterpillars are not harvested for a set number of years. It would thus be ensured that the area is adequately repopulated, so that a sustainable harvest is created for the future.|$|E
25|$|In Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc. v. Attorney-General (1989), the Court of Appeal {{found that}} it was not unfair that the Minister for Communications and Information had not given The Asian Wall Street Journal a chance to explain why it had {{published}} certain articles before declaring that the Journal had engaged in Singapore's domestic politics, and restricting its circulation under section 16 of the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act. The Court dismissed the appeal {{on the grounds that the}} Minister had not treated the appellant, Dow Jones, unfairly, nor had the appellant been prejudiced in any way by the lack <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> make representations. This was because the appellant had already been warned by the Minister. Furthermore, it was aware from precedent that the Minister was likely to invoke section 16 upon its refusal to publish a letter from the Monetary Authority of Singapore responding to an article, and it had been given many opportunities to publish the letter.|$|E

25|$|Sint-Truiden Air Base was a {{frequent}} target of USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The medium bombers would attack in coordinated raids, usually in the mid-to-late afternoon, with Eighth Air Force heavy bombers returning from attacking their targets in Germany. The attack was timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the Luftwaffe interceptors pinned {{down on the ground}} and be unable to attack the heavy bombers.

25|$|After the {{surrender}} of the Batavian squadron on 30 August, the British fleet had become master not just of the North Sea, {{but also of the}} Zuider Zee. Remarkably, the British had not made use of this advantage (and of the psychological consequences of {{the surrender}} for Batavian morale) to force the issue, for instance by making an amphibious landing near Amsterdam. General Krayenhoff, who at the time was in charge of improvising the defences of that city, points out that for a few days Amsterdam lay quite defenseless against such an attack. In his opinion the campaign might have ended then and there. The British fleet had remained strangely passive. This changed {{in the days after the}} Battle of Bergen when the British belatedly occupied the undefended ports of Medemblik, Enkhuizen, and Hoorn, at the same time mastering the West Friesland region between these ports. A number of islands in the Zuider Zee were also occupied, but by then the window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> capture Amsterdam had closed.|$|E

500|$|Of {{the reign}} of King Henry VIII, {{it has been said}} that: [...] "at no time since its establishment, was [...] in higher estimation, nor in fuller employment, than in this reign." [...] Henry VIII was fond of pomp and magnificence, and thus gave the heralds plenty <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> {{exercise}} their roles in his court. In addition, the members of the College were also expected to be regularly despatched to foreign courts on missions, whether to declare war, accompany armies, summon garrisons or deliver messages to foreign potentates and generals. During his magnificent meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, Henry VIII brought with him eighteen officers of arms, probably all he had, to regulate the many tournaments and ceremonies held there.|$|E

For Corruption, the code was examined to find ways to make it run faster and better than in the original Wii release.

500|$|Following Ajay's escape, he is left {{stranded}} in the snow at high altitude where he is rescued by Pagan Min. After tending to Ajay's wounds, Min leaves him in a tower in Northern Kyrat, as {{he is unable to}} return Ajay to the Golden Path directly. He then leaks news of Ajay's escape to Sabal and Amita, and allows them to secure a Royal Army helicopter so that they can extract him. However, word of this has spread to Yuma, who marshals the forces loyal to her and plans to attack the landing site once Ajay tries to escape. Because of this, Ajay only has a limited window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> escape, but can buy more time by attacking Yuma's forces. In exchange for disrupting Yuma's plans for a coup, Min promises Ajay support and resources at the landing site. During his missions, Ajay overhears one of the guards of Yuma saying that she was sent to a valley in the northern mountains of Kyrat on an expedition after something of great power called [...] "The Relic". After killing Yuma's lieutenants, disrupting her supply lines, and thwarting her plans to sabotage Min's communications, Ajay ventures to the landing site where he is forced to fight off Yuma's attack long enough for the helicopter to power up. With the landing site secured and Yuma's forces in disarray, Ajay is successfully airlifted out contacts Sabal and Amita saying that he was heading to the valley to learn what is behind the expedition and the Relic.|$|E

500|$|The weak/strong grapple {{system from}} the past games was removed from WWE '12 onwards. Characters now perform {{different}} moves based on their opponent's current physical state. Players now have a window <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> attack while still in a downed state and can also interrupt moves and Royal Rumble eliminations with attacks. Similarly, the pinning meter from the past games has been reworked {{to make it more}} difficult to kick out as a wrestler takes more damage. The game's artificial intelligence has also been adjusted to prevent players from overusing the same move. In addition, the ability to store finishing moves has returned. [...] "Dynamic Comebacks" [...] gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New [...] "wake up taunts" [...] bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move (such as pounding on the ground before RKO finishing maneuver). Players also have the ability to target specific limbs during matches and perform submissions through a [...] "Breaking Point" [...] submission minigame. OMG! moments were introduced to WWE '13. These are moves than can be performed in certain situations with certain superstars when a finisher is obtained. An example of this is Mark Henry superplexing the Big Show, making the ring break and the match stop. Better weight detection was implemented to WWE '13, so the smaller Rey Mysterio can't body slam the 500 pound Big Show. In fact, super heavyweights like [...] now have different frames to better capture their enormous size. Pinning is now not only influenced by damage, but the power of the move that was previously executed. In WWE '13 alongside selecting arenas, characters and the number of finishing moves available at the start of a match (a new option, which can range from 0 to Infinite), players will be able to adjust a setting called 'Match Experience'. Three settings – [...] "Quick", [...] "Normal" [...] and [...] "Epic" [...] – will affect the overall pacing of a fight, independent of AI difficulty. Factors such as momentum, damage, enemy aggressiveness and even kick out and reversal rates will be affected.|$|E

30|$|Previous {{research}} on OTL has largely {{focused on the}} factors affecting students’ exposure <b>to</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn and their disposition or ability to take up and actualize those <b>opportunities.</b> Much <b>of</b> this has centered on the uneven distribution <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn across demographic groups and other student populations (e.g., Flores 2007; Oakes 1990). This work has {{shed light on the}} direct connection between divergent mathematical outcomes across student populations and the unequal distribution <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn mathematics afforded to these populations. Additionally, this works highlights the role of students’ mathematical dispositions in actualizing these <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn (e.g., Gresalfi 2009), as well as the role of different pedagogical environments in providing different amounts of and types <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn (e.g., Yackel et al. 1991). Together, this indicates that factors stemming from students’ backgrounds, their mathematical dispositions, and their classroom experiences contribute to how they experience and actualize content coverage, exposure, and emphasis. In other words, a student’s perceptions of, and ability to capitalize on, OTLs depend on both the individual student and his/her instruction.|$|R
