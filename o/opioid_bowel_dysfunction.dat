40|$|Introduction: The use of opioids is {{associated}} with unwanted adverse effects, particularly opioid-induced constipation (OIC). The adverse effects of opioids on gastrointestinal function are mediated by the interaction with opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. The most common drugs used for relieving OIC are laxatives, which do not address the <b>opioid</b> receptor-mediated <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and do not provide sufficient relief. Areas covered: This paper discusses {{the role of a}} combination of prolongedrelease formulation of oxycodone (OX) and naloxone (N) in the prevention and management of OIC, reporting efficacy and safety outcome of controlled studies. In a therapeutic area of great unmet need, the combination tablet of prolonged release of OX and N (PR OXN) could offer patients effective analgesia, while improving opioid-induced <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Expert opinion: PR OXN offers a unique and specific mechanism to control OIC in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy. This combination has the potential advantage of preventing OIC, particularly in subgroups of population, like elderly or advanced cancer patients. This approach can decrease the use of laxatives and additional medications, which represent a burden for patients presenting comorbidities requiring multiple medication...|$|R

40|$|Opioid analgesics {{are usually}} {{effective}} {{in the management of}} severe chronic pain. However, symptoms of opioid-induced <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> (OIBD) are common during <b>opioid</b> therapy. Opioid-induced <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> is often unsuccessfully managed due to limited effectiveness and numerous adverse effects of tradi-tional laxatives. Newer treatment pos-sibilities directed at the pathomechanism of OIBD comprise combined prolonged-release oxycodone with prolonged-release naloxone (oxycodone/naloxone) tablets. Oxycodone/naloxone provides effective analgesia with limited impact on bowel function as oxycodone displays high oral bioavailability and naloxone act as local antagonist on opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract due to near-ly complete inactivation in the liver. Oxycodone/naloxone is administered to opioid-naive patients with severe pain and those unsuccessfully treated with weak opioids. Oxycodone/naloxone may be also administered to patients treated with strong opioids who expe-rience intense symptoms of OIBD.

40|$|Background: Postoperative <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> affects {{quality of}} life after sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery, but {{the extent of the}} problem is not clearly defined due to {{inconsistent}} outcome measures used to characterise the condition. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess variation in reporting of postoperative <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and make recommendations for standardisation in future studies. If possible, a quantitative synthesis of <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> symptoms was planned. Data Sources: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Library were queried between 2004 - 2015. Study Selection: The studies selected reported at least one component of <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> following resection of rectal cancer. Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measures were reporting, measurement and definition of post-operative <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Results: Of 5428 studies identified, 234 met inclusion criteria. Widely reported components of <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> were incontinence to stool (227 / 234; 97. 0 %), frequency (168 / 234; 71. 8 %) and incontinence to flatus (158 / 234; 67. 5 %). Urgency and stool clustering were reported less commonly, with rates of 106 / 234 (45. 3 %) and 61 / 234 (26. 1 %). <b>Bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> measured as a primary outcome was associated with better reporting (OR: 3. 49; 95 % CI: 1. 99 – 6. 23; P< 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND In {{spite of}} the {{increasing}} trend in opioid abusers worldwide, the prevalence of narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS) is undetermined. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of NBS and other <b>opioid</b> <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> (OBD) in opioid abus-ers in Kerman, southeast Iran. According {{to the best of}} our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the prevalence of NBS in opioid abusers. METHODS By referring to addiction treatment centers in Kerman city and in a cross-sectional study, 577 subjects with opium or opioid subtracts abuse were in-cluded in our study. A validated questionnaire was used for OBD assessment and diagnosis of NBS was made according to both the presence of chronic abdominal pain despite increasing the opioid dose and ruling out other causes of abdominal pain. SPSS software version 16 was used for data analysis. p value< 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS Constipation, regurgitation, and heartburn were the most gastrointestinal complaints that were found in 132 (22. 9 %), 123 (21. 3 %) and 91 (15. 8 %) sub-jects, respectively. Only 16 (2. 8 %) participants fulfilled all the NBS criteria. Simultaneous use of non-narcotic sedative drugs increased the risk of NBS significantly (the odds ratio 3 : 1 and p= 0. 049).

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Although care of urological {{disorders}} in spina bifida is well established, {{there is yet}} no agreement on a standardized approach to <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in this population. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> using validated instruments and the risk factors in adults with spina bifida. DESIGN: A multidisciplinary team prospectively collected patient data, focusing on anorectal and urological symptoms. SETTINGS: The study was conducted with data from a French referral center for spina bifida. PATIENTS: A total of 228 adults with spina bifida (sex ratio men:women, 92 (40 %) : 136 (60 %)) with a median age of 34. 7 years (range, 26. 8 - 44. 7 y) were assessed. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Factors associated with severe fecal incontinence (Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score ≥ 9) and severe <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> (Neurogenic <b>Bowel</b> <b>Dysfunction</b> score ≥ 14) were assessed in a multivariate analysis model. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of severe fecal incontinence and severe <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> were 60 % (130 / 217) and 42 % (71 / 168). <b>Bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was the second most common major concern of patients after lower urinary tract dysfunction. Male sex, obesity, urinary incontinence, and a Knowles-Eccersley-Scott symptom constipation score ≥ 10 were independently associated with severe fecal incontinence. Patients with soft stools had significantly less severe <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Neither neurologic level nor other neurologic features of spina bifida were associated with severe fecal incontinence or severe <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> LIMITATIONS: The recruitment of patients with spina bifida through a national referral center might have resulted in selection bias, and some data were missing especially regarding BMI and Neurogenic <b>Bowel</b> <b>Dysfunction</b> score (21 % and 26 % of missing data). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rates of severe fecal incontinence and severe <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in adults with spina bifida were high and were adequately perceived by the patients.

40|$|Total hip {{and knee}} {{replacement}} operations {{are one of}} the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedures in Australia. It is estimated however that up to 65 % of patients will experience some degree of opioid-related <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in the post operative period. Often considered a mild and selflimiting problem, constipation can lead to significant morbidity and occasional mortality. Several clinical incidents and a lack of robust evidence to guide bowel management in this cohort was the impetus for this study. This cluster randomised study sought to evaluate the Murdoch Bowel Protocol©, a simple nursing intervention based on the administration of polyethylene glycol (Movicol®) titrated to Bristol Stool Chart type. The Neuman Systems Model was the theoretical framework used to guide this study. The hypothesis was that patients who undergo a knee or hip replacement and receive the study bowel protocol will experience a statistically significant reduction in time taken to return to normal bowel function compared with patients who receive standard bowel management. Three hundred and thirty one patients were recruited across seven hospitals in two Australian states over a 13 month period. Five hospitals were randomised as controls, two hospitals as interventions. Data was collected from all patients at three intervals: pre-admission, during admission and post discharge. Control participants (n = 171) received post operative bowel management as per that hospital or doctors usual regime whilst intervention participants (n = 160) received post operative bowel management as per the Murdoch Bowel Protocol©. Inferential statistics confirmed several highly statistically significant results as well as clinically significant outcomes. Patients treated with the Murdoch Bowel Protocol© returned to normal bowel function more quickly than those xi treated with ad hoc post operative bowel regimes (p = 0. 000). In addition intervention patients were more than seven times more likely than controls to return to normal bowel function by day five post operatively (p = 0. 000). Age, gender and length of pre-operative fasting were not found to influence this result. Type of anaesthetic was significant with patients who received combined regional and general anaesthesia returning to normal bowel function around two days less than those who received a general anaesthetic (p = 0. 014). Type of operation was also significant with total knee replacement patients taking on average one extra day to return to normal bowel function (p = 0. 027). Use of the generalised linear mixed model confirmed no cluster effect. These results confirm and support the study hypothesis. These results support practice changes not only for hip and knee replacement patients but for other patient groups who experience <b>opioid</b> induced <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Further research will determine whether the protocol is as efficacious in these patient groups...|$|R

A bowel program according to the characteristics of neurogenic <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was performed for each patient. Before and after bowel program, gastrointestinal problems (constipation, difficult intestinal evacuation, incontinence, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, loss of appetite, hemorrhoids, rectal bleeding and gastrointestinal induced autonomic dysreflexia) and bowel evacuation methods (digital stimulation, oral medication, suppositories, abdominal massage, Valsalva maneuver and manual evacuation) were determined. Neurogenic <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> score {{was used to assess}} the severity of neurogenic <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> At least one gastrointestinal problem was identified in 44 (80 %) of the 55 patients before bowel program.

40|$|Human {{intestinal}} flora comprises thousands of bacterial species. Growth {{and composition of}} intestinal microbiota is dependent on various parameters, including immune mechanisms, dietary factors and intestinal motility. Patients {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI) frequently display neurogenic <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> due to the absence of central nervous system control over the gastrointestinal system. Considering the <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and altered colonic transit time in patients with SCI, we hypothesized the presence of a significant change in the composition of their gut microbiome. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the gut microbiota in adult SCI patients with different types of <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> We tested our hypothesis on 30 SCI patients (15 upper motor neuron [UMN] bowel syndrome, 15 lower motor neuron [LMN] bowel syndrome) and 10 healthy controls using the 16 S rRNA sequencing. Gut microbial patterns were sampled from feces. Independent of study groups, gut microbiota of the participants were dominated by Blautia, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus. When we compared all study groups, Roseburia, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Dialister, Marvinbryantia and Megamonas appeared as the genera that were statistically different between groups. In comparison to the healthy group, total bacterial counts of Pseudobutyrivibrio, Dialister and Megamonas genera were significantly lower in UMN <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> group. The total bacterial count of Marvinbryantia genus was significantly lower in UMN <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> group when compared to the LMN group. Total bacterial counts of Roseburia, Pseudobutyrivibrio and Megamonas genera were significantly lower in LMN <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> group when compared to healthy groups. Our results demonstrate for the first time that butyrate-producing members are specifically reduced in SCI patients when compared to healthy subjects. The results of this study would be of interest since to our knowledge, microbiome-associated studies targeting SCI patients are non-existent and the results might help explain possible implications of gut microbiome in SCI.

Growth {{and composition of}} intestinal microbiota is dependent on various parameters, including immune mecha-nisms, dietary factors and intestinal motility. Patients {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI) frequently display neurogenic <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> due to the absence of central nervous system control over the gastrointestinal system. Considering the <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and altered colonic transit time in patients with SCI, we hypothesized the presence of a significant change in the composition of their gut microbiome. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the gut microbiota in adult SCI patients with different types of <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> We tested our hypothesis on 30 SCI patients (15 upper motor neuron [UMN] bowel syndrome, 15 lower motor neuron [LMN] bowel syndrome) and 10 healthy controls using the 16 S rRNA sequencing. Gut microbial patterns were sampled from feces. Independent of study groups, gut microbiota of the participants were dominated by Blautia, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibac-terium and Ruminococcus. When we compared all study groups, Roseburia, Pseudobutyri-vibrio, Dialister, Marvinbryantia and Megamonas appeared as the genera that wer...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bowel</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> mainly constipation, is a {{well-known}} and anticipated side effect of opioids. The physician prescribing an opioid frequently confronts the challenge of preventing and treating <b>bowel</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Different strategies have emerged for managing opioid-induced constipation. These strategies include physical activity, maintaining adequate fluid intake, adhering to regular daily bowel habits, using laxatives and other anticonstipation medications and, recently, using a peripheral opioid antagonist, either as a separate drug or {{in the form of}} an opioid agonist-antagonist combination pill. What options exist for the physician when a patient receiving opioids complains of diarrhea, cramps and bloating, rather than the expected constipation? The present article describes a possible cause of opioid-induced diarrhea and strategies for management...|$|R
