But I do think a lot of creativity depends on your relationships with other people, your personal relationships, your partner or whatever. Your personal happiness or unhappiness comes <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> work, it's a reflection of your emotional state and you can't separate the two." ...|$|E
