25|$|Before any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> rise {{to examine}} it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, {{about the same}} shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As {{for me and my}} companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, that we could not move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

Dismissing the box office failure of Thunderbirds Are Go as a one-off misfortune, United Artists advised Anderson to produce a second film, which would be titled Thunderbird 6. Anderson remembers the period of transition: [...] "None <b>of</b> <b>us...</b> <b>could</b> understand why the film hadn't succeeded, so it was decided we would make another one." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Germany, {{against the}} advice of the British government, and met Hitler at his Obersalzberg retreat. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes. In an article for the New York Daily News and Chicago Tribune of 13 December 1966 the Duke wrote that in 1937 Hitler persuaded him [...] "it was in Britain's {{interest}} and in Europe's too, that Germany be encouraged to strike east and smash Communism forever...

500|$|The jury convicted him in April 1988. He {{was sentenced}} to three years imprisonment, {{suspended}} to two years' probation and 250 hours of community service, which he discharged by painting a school bus and working at a library. He had to sell {{his share of the}} family farm to his sister to pay his legal bills, and was fired from his job driving a school bus in Newman Grove even though there was no evidence he had ever approached children sexually. He lowered his profile, often driving to more distant communities to run routine errands. Nonetheless, his hometown supported him. [...] "Any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> be caught up in such a sting," [...] the Newman Grove local newspaper editorialized.|$|E
500|$|By 1829–30, Verdi had {{established}} himself as a leader of the Philharmonic: [...] "none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> rival him" [...] reported the secretary of the organisation, Giuseppe Demaldè. An eight-movement cantata, I deliri di Saul, based on a drama by Vittorio Alfieri, was written by Verdi when he was 15 and performed in Bergamo. It was acclaimed by both Demaldè and Barezzi, who commented: [...] "He shows a vivid imagination, a philosophical outlook, and sound judgment in the arrangement of instrumental parts." [...] In late 1829, Verdi had completed his studies with Provesi, who declared that he had no more to teach him. At the time, Verdi had been giving singing and piano lessons to Barezzi's daughter Margherita; by 1831, they were unofficially engaged.|$|E

Guitarist Eddie Reyes insisted on playing his own part, {{as opposed to a}} chord progression, on several occasions. Cooper said [...] "So instead of trying to force him to play one thing, he’ll go and do his own thing that’s way more cool and unique that any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> imagine." [...] Lazzara {{mentioned}} there was [...] "an urgency and an energy and an excitement" [...] embedded into the material, which [...] "you can't create or fake". Nolan stated that Straylight Run helped Cooper and himself as musicians: [...] "We learned, we grew and were much more mature coming back to TBS." [...] Cooper mentioned that {{towards the end of the}} writing process the group's [...] "creative juices ... were just so depleted".|$|E

The couple lived at 4 route du Champ d'Entraînement in the Bois de Boulogne, near Neuilly-sur-Seine, for most of the remainder of their lives, essentially living a life of easy retirement. They bought a second house in the country, Moulin de la Tuilerie or [...] "The Mill" [...] in Gif-sur-Yvette, where they soon became close friends of their neighbours, Oswald and Diana Mosley. Years later, Diana Mosley claimed that the Duke and Duchess shared her and her husband's views that Hitler should have been given a free hand to destroy Communism; as the Duke wrote in the New York Daily News of 13 December 1966: [...] "it was in Britain's interest and in Europe's too, that Germany be encouraged to strike east and smash Communism forever...

500|$|Johnson gained {{high office}} {{due to his}} proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and {{self-employed}} tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the [...] "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, [...] "Johnson {{was always the same}} to everyone... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen." [...] Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, [...] "you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none of the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>Could</b> have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you. Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but the people would send you." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Cowan became Manchester City captain, {{succeeding}} Jimmy McMullan. During his captaincy the club reached two further FA Cup Finals. The {{first of these}} was in 1933, against Everton. During the match Cowan was up against Everton captain Dixie Dean. Both players were renowned for their heading ability. Matt Busby claimed that Cowan could [...] "head a ball as far as most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> kick it", but Dean prevailed in the aerial battle, scoring Everton's second goal with a header. The Daily Mail observed that Dean's presence gave Cowan a dilemma: [...] "He was torn between a determination not to leave Dean {{and a desire to}} help his forwards. He broke down between the two." [...] Everton were 3–0 victors, but when Cowan received his runner's up medal from the Duke of York, he remarked that he would come back next year to win. True to Cowan's word, City returned to Wembley the following year. In the 1934 FA Cup Final, Cowan became the first and thus far only Manchester City player to represent the club in three FA Cup finals. He captained City to a 2–1 victory over Portsmouth. As team captain Cowan held primary responsibility for motivating his fellow players and match tactics. This was typical for a captain of his era, as managers of the period were chiefly administrators who had little input into coaching and tactics.|$|E

500|$|In 1938, Imogen {{had visited}} Dartington Hall, a {{progressive}} school and crafts community near Totnes in Devon, {{which had been}} founded in 1925 by Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst. [...] In 1941–42, while travelling for CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942, while recuperating there, she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre's administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington. He had in mind a music course, [...] "the {{sort of thing that}} your father did in the old days at Morley College". Beginning in 1943, Imogen established [...] a one-year [...] course, initially designed to train young women to organise amateur orchestras and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Imogen's leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including the foundation of an amateur orchestra: [...] "Hardly any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> play... However bad we were, we went on". Imogen's teaching methods, heavily based on [...] "learning by doing" [...] and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect. Rosamond Strode, a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Imogen at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: [...] "She knew exactly how, and when, to push her victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn't be long before... they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank".|$|E
500|$|In October 1971, Dyer {{accompanied}} Bacon to Paris for {{the opening}} of the artist's retrospective at the Grand Palais. The show was the high point of Bacon's career to date, and he was now being described as Britain's [...] "greatest living painter". Dyer was now a desperate man, and although he was [...] "allowed" [...] to attend, he was well aware that he was [...] "slipping", in every sense, out of the picture. To draw Bacon's attention he earlier planted cannabis in Bacon's flat, then phoned the police, and he had attempted suicide on a number of occasions. Dyer committed suicide, via an overdose of barbiturates, {{on the eve of the}} Paris exhibition in their shared hotel room. Bacon spent the following day surrounded by people eager to meet him. In mid-evening he was informed that Dyer had taken an overdose of barbiturates and was dead. Though devastated, Bacon continued with the retrospective and displayed powers of self-control [...] "to which few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>could</b> aspire", according to Russell. Bacon was deeply affected by the loss of Dyer, and he had recently lost four other friends and his nanny. From this point on, death haunted his life and work. Though he gave a stoic appearance at the time, he was inwardly broken. He did not express his feelings to critics, but later admitted to friends that [...] "daemons, disaster and loss" [...] now stalked him as if his own version of the Eumenides. Bacon spent the remainder of his stay in Paris attending to promotional activities and funeral arrangements. He returned to London later that week to comfort Dyer's family. The funeral proved to be an emotional affair for all, and many of Dyer's friends, including hardened East-End criminals, broke down in tears. As the coffin was lowered into the grave one attendant screamed [...] "you bloody fool!". Although Bacon remained stoic throughout, in the following months Dyer preoccupied his imagination as never before. To confront his loss, he painted a number of tributes on small canvasses and his three [...] "Black Triptych" [...] masterpieces.|$|E
