The article {{is divided into three}} main parts: In the first, I consider the concept of rationality and conclude that rational thinking is a part of intelligence, but not a major part. In the second, I consider Stanovich's concept of dysrationalia, and propose that an alternative concept, practical intelli-gence (or the lack thereof), may better accomplish the goals that Stanovich wishes to achieve with his concept. Finally, I draw some conclusions. <b>ould</b> <b>you</b> rather take orders from Kirk or Spock? In a highly nonscientif ic study of nonrandomly selected nonstudents that I conducted, a large majority of the respondents preferred Kirk. Kirk, you may recall, was captain of the Starship Enterprise in the television and movie series Star Trek. Spock was the first officer. Spock, from the planet Vulcan (shamelessly omitted from the maps of heavenly bodies in science museums and astronomy books), was presented as a wholly rational being, whereas Kirk was certainly intelligent, but sub-ject to the range of emotions and pas-sions that characterize all human beings. People's preference for Kirk might be an example of what Stanovich (this issue) refers to as dysrationaliaâ€”the inability to think and behave rationally despite adequate intelligence. Or this preference might indicate that rational thinking is not quite the panacea it is sometimes thought to be for the stu-pidities we see in the world. I will divide the remainder of this article into three parts. First, I will dis-cuss the relation of rational thinking to intelligence, and argue that although it is a part of intelligence, rationality is not particularly important to most life pursuits. Second, I will discuss Stano-vich's concept of dysrationalia in par-ticular, and argue that it is misnamed and slightly misconceptualized. I will propose that the concept of practical intelligence may be more heuristically useful than that of rational thinking for the kinds of phenomena that interest Stanovich. Finally, I will draw some conclusions...|$|E
