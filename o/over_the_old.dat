5|$|After this {{bankruptcy}} filing, Greyhound dropped low-demand rural {{stops and}} started concentrating on dense, inter-metropolitan routes. It cut nearly 37 {{percent of its}} network. In some rural areas local operators took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> stops (often with government subsidies) particularly in the Plains states, parts of the upper Midwest (such as Wisconsin), and the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|Between 1930 and 1935 the {{through station}} was {{expanded}} {{under the direction}} of the GWR's chief architect P E Culverhouse, in art deco style, both eastwards <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> cattle market and southwards on a new wider bridge across Cattle Market Road and the New Cut of the River Avon. This made room for the addition of five through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to be both widened and lengthened. All the routes approaching Temple Meads were widened to four tracks to allow more flexibility.|$|E
5|$|By 2002, Sovereign's fleet {{amounted}} to just 45 vehicles. Stevenage depot {{was closed and}} a smaller garage in the same town acquired, with Arriva Shires & Essex taking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> site. Finally, in January 2005, the remainder of Sovereign was sold to Arriva Shires & Essex. Having previously acquired the successors to the former London Country North West, London Country South West and London Country South East companies as well as County Bus & Coach, Arriva now owned all of the former London Country Bus Services apart from the St Albans operation.|$|E

5|$|In 1904, {{the club}} were managed by Jimmy Philip. At {{the end of}} its first season, despite having {{finished}} seventh out of twelve teams, Aberdeen were elected to the new, expanded First Division. They have remained in the top tier of Scottish football ever since. From 1906, the club made steady progress, with a Scottish Cup semi-final appearance in 1908 and another in 1911. In that season of 1910–11, Aberdeen recorded their first victories <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Firm of Celtic and Rangers, and led the league for a time, but finished the season in second place.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{in order}} to add four {{additional}} Amtrak trips along the corridor, four of the then six round trips to New London were cut back to Old Saybrook. An agreement with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection limits service <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Saybrook-Old Lyme bridge {{in order to}} avoid inconveniencing recreational boaters. ConnDOT's agreement with Amtrak allowed commuters with monthly passes to ride certain Amtrak trains instead. After criticism over the service cuts, in April 2008 ConnDOT began allowing commuters with multi-ride passes to board the selected Amtrak trains as well.|$|E
5|$|Modern NY9L {{follows the}} length of the Old Military Road, which was the first road to connect to what is now the town of Queensbury. It was first built in 1755 as the Colonial Army headed north from Albany. The {{construction}} of the road helped to increase development in the town. In 1832, the Glens Falls Feeder Canal opened, further improving transportation in Queensbury. Sixteen years later, in 1848, a plank road was built <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Military Road.|$|E

50|$|Ainoceras ("Ainu's Horn") is a genus of extinct, aberrantly coiled ammonite {{cephalopod}} {{that live}} in the Pacific Ocean during the Campanian division of the Cretaceous, where Japan is today. Their shells were coiled very similarly to the related Anaklinoceras, in that, when young, the shell coiled helically, and then upon reaching adulthood, the shell then bent <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> coils. However, Ainoceras differed in this respect in that, whereas in Anaklinoceras, the youngest coil wrapped very closely around <b>the</b> <b>older</b> coils, while in Ainoceras, the youngest coil bent <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> coils in a wide loop or oxbow.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} {{periodic}} attempts to restore service in southern Montana and North Dakota. A proposed plan from 1982–1983 would have involved North Dakota and Montana paying 45% of costs {{in the first year}} and 65% thereafter of a new section of the Empire Builder operating tri-weekly between Fargo and Sandpoint. This proposal went nowhere as neither state voted funds. Another proposal mooted in 1991 would have required an additional yearly federal appropriation of $12–15 million plus new equipment. In this scenario the Portland section would operate <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> route. Again, nothing came of it.|$|E
5|$|The Campbells {{continued}} {{to add to}} the castle, building a new house <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> west range in 1725. However, the rest of the castle was already decaying. In 1810 an accidental fire gutted the castle, and the Captains ceased to live here, moving to Dunstaffnage House, some 2km to the south-east, until this too burned down in 1940. Tenants lived in the 1725 house within the castle until 1888.|$|E
5|$|The MSC Railway {{was able}} to receive and {{despatch}} goods trains to and from all the UK's main line railway systems, using connecting junctions at three points in the terminal docks.

The third was to the south, operated by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), where by the MSC Railway had taken <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> and abandoned route of the CLC, giving them a monopoly on traffic to the new soap works and steel mill.|$|E

5|$|The Silver Jubilee Bridge was widened in {{the mid-1970s}} by bolting a new {{pedestrian}} way {{to the side of}} the original structure and widening the roadways <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> footpaths. It is a bottleneck and becomes congested at peak travel times, and in the event of a breakdown or accident on the bridge, traffic in the area comes to a standstill. To resolve this problem, a second crossing of the Mersey is planned, to be known as the Mersey Gateway.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} built <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> cloisters and the main rooms are on the first floor. It is a stone house with stone slated roofs, twisted chimney stacks and mullioned windows. Throughout {{the life of the}} building, many {{architectural}} alterations, additions, and renovations have occurred so that the house is a mish-mash of different periods and styles. The Tudor stable courtyard {{to the north of the}} house has retained many of its original features including the old brewhouse and bakehouse.|$|E
5|$|There {{were a few}} {{noticeable}} {{changes to}} the Ramblin' Wreck after the 1982 refurbishment. An aftermarket chrome stone guard was added to protect the grill, The emblems on the side were removed and replaced by a basic GT decal on the doors. The 1952 Yellow Jackets were moved to the front tire wells. The white horn was chromed <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> <b>old</b> tire cover was a shield with a football helmet wearing yellow jacket. This was replaced with a white generic naugahyde Ford tire cover. The Old Model A tires and brakes were replaced with Model B whitewall tires and modified brakes.|$|E

5|$|Forti {{produced}} a new chassis, the FG03, {{for the next}} race {{of the season in}} Imola. It had been designed by the same personnel as the previous year, with further work carried out by George Ryton after the latter moved to the team from Ferrari and took up the post of Technical Director mid-season. Both drivers judged it a significant improvement <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> car, with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity, but there was only one FG03 available, and Montermini failed to qualify in the old car. Badoer, however, qualified last, but comfortably within the 107% cut-off, and only 0.7s behind Ricardo Rosset in the Footwork. Badoer finished 10th and last, but had suffered reliability problems in the new car and was two laps behind Pedro Lamy's Minardi. Both drivers qualified in Monaco, but Montermini crashed in the wet warm-up session and did not start the race, whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions and took out Jacques Villeneuve as he was being lapped by the Williams. He was fined $5000 and received a two-race suspended ban.|$|E
5|$|Hamurabi in {{particular}} is mostly known for its appearance in Ahl's book. The original game, a text-based strategy video game of land and resource management, was developed by Doug Dyment at DEC in 1968 as The Sumer Game. Dyment created it as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL-69 languages, but an expanded, uncredited version of the game was included in 101 BASIC Computer Games as Hamurabi, and later versions of the game, even in FOCAL, referenced the new title <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>old.</b> Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is an antecedent to the city-building genre.|$|E
