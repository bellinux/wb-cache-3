5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and smoothness of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water <b>ocean</b> exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the <b>ocean</b> to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the <b>ocean</b> below. Sea salt from a subsurface <b>ocean</b> may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the <b>ocean</b> is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{has three}} marinas: Marina Bay, <b>Ocean</b> Village Marina, and Queensway Quay Marina. <b>Ocean</b> Village Marina {{is located on}} Gibraltar's Westside, outside the {{northern}} end of Gibraltar Harbour, in the Bay of Gibraltar, next to the airport runway. It is adjacent to Marina Bay which is just to its north. The marina forms part of the <b>Ocean</b> Village Project or <b>Ocean</b> Village Marina Complex, often referred to as just <b>Ocean</b> Village. <b>Ocean</b> Village Marina is the former Sheppard's Marina or Sheppard's Yard. Both Marina Bay and <b>Ocean</b> Village Marina have been incorporated into <b>Ocean</b> Village, between the North Mole and the airport runway. The strategic location of the marina offers protection from moisture-laden Levanter winds.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the <b>ocean</b> by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump.

5|$|Long and slender, {{the blue}} whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally and {{somewhat}} lighter underneath. There {{are at least}} three distinct subspecies: B. m. musculus of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia of the Southern <b>Ocean</b> and B. m. brevicauda (also known as the pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian <b>Ocean</b> and South Pacific <b>Ocean.</b> B. m. indica, found in the Indian <b>Ocean,</b> may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small crustaceans known as krill.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{habitats}} can {{be divided}} horizontally into coastal and open <b>ocean</b> habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline {{to the edge of}} the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 percent of the total <b>ocean</b> area. Open <b>ocean</b> habitats are found in the deep <b>ocean</b> beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats {{can be divided}} vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and benthic (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ocean</b> Village Marina was {{formerly}} Sheppard's Marina, owned by H. Sheppard & Co. By 2004, the marina {{had been sold}} to <b>Ocean</b> Village Investments Ltd and demolition had commenced. The marina retained its original name, at least informally, for several years after the sale. The sale of Sheppard's Marina was not without controversy, as some residents of the marina were eventually evicted from their berths by the new owners. After <b>Ocean</b> Village Investments acquired the adjacent Marina Bay in 2006, both marinas were incorporated into <b>Ocean</b> Village, a resort with residential, retail, and leisure facilities.|$|E

40|$|The <b>oceans</b> have a {{major impact}} on global {{geophysical}} processes of the Earth. Non-tidal changes in oceanic currents and ocean-bottom pressure have been shown to be a major source of polar motion excitation and also measurably change the length of the day. The changing mass distribution of the <b>oceans</b> causes the Earth's gravitational field to change and causes the center-of-mass of the <b>oceans</b> to change which in turn causes the center-of-mass of the solid Earth to change. The changing mass distribution of the <b>oceans</b> also changes the load on the oceanic crust, thereby affecting both the vertical and horizontal position of observing stations located near the <b>oceans.</b> Recognizing the important role that non-tidal oceanic processes play in Earth rotation dynamics and terrestrial reference frame definition, the International Earth Rotation Service has recently created a Special Bureau for the <b>Oceans</b> in order to facilitate research into these and other solid Earth geophysical processes affected by the <b>oceans...</b>|$|R

5|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} {{are found in}} warm and {{temperate}} waters worldwide.
