40|$|Since the <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> {{system is}} subject to under {{actuation}} system due to that <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> and payload are connected by flexibility wire rope. The payload generates residual swing when the <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> is accelerating/ decelerating the motions. This may cause trouble for the payload precise positioning and motion planning. Hence, an optimization input shaping control method is presented to reduce the under actuated <b>overhead</b> <b>crane’s</b> payload swing caused via the inertia force. The dynamic model of the <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> is proposed according to the physics structure of the crane. The input shaper based on the motion planning of the crane is used as the feed forward input to suppress payload residual swing. Simulation and experiment {{results indicate that the}} ZV input shaper and ZVD input shaper can reduce the payload swing of the <b>overhead</b> <b>crane...</b>|$|R
40|$|Disclosed is a {{movement}} control method for an <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> in a cargo handling system having route switching capability, said method comprising the following steps: installing rails to form a plurality of independent zones covering entire plant, and connecting unconnected independent zones by route switching control initiating an <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> monitoring thread and a cargo transfer request thread querying a list of cargo for transfer, and extracting a task to be executed querying an <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> list, determining a <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> to execute a transfer task, then determining a working transfer path for said <b>overhead</b> <b>crane,</b> downloading the transfer path to the <b>overhead</b> <b>crane,</b> and starting the transfer task. The method of the present invention consists mainly in forming the multiple independent zones {{by means of the}} installed rails, and connecting the unconnected independent areas through timely, rapid, and accurate route switching, thus shortening the operation time of the <b>overhead</b> <b>crane,</b> and implementing a complex rail system, so that cargo can be automatically transferred throughout a plant with no involvement of personnel, thus improving production efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Compared with a {{traditional}} single-container <b>overhead</b> <b>crane,</b> the double-container <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> {{is a type of}} new efficient container stevedoring machinery, however, it is actually a complicated nonlinear system. In this brief, both the kinematic and dynamic characteristics concerning the double-container crane are investigated, and then an accurate dynamic model of the underactuated double-container <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> is established by utilizing Euler-Lagrange's method. Not only is the variation of the rope and payloads, but also some uncertainties such as mechanical frictions and air-resistance in the environment are taken into account in modeling. Simulation results show the validity of the established double-container <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> model...|$|R

2500|$|Carnegie Steel {{made major}} {{technological}} innovations in the 1880s, especially {{the installation of}} the open-hearth system at Homestead in 1886. [...] It now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and for armor plate for the United States Navy, which paid far higher prices for the premium product. In addition, the plant moved increasingly toward the continuous system of production. Carnegie installed vastly improved systems of material-handling, like <b>overhead</b> <b>cranes,</b> hoists, charging machines, and buggies. All of this greatly sped up the process of steelmaking, and allowed the production of vastly larger quantities of the product. [...] As the mills expanded, the labor force grew rapidly, especially with less skilled workers. In response, the more-skilled union members reacted with a strike designed to protect their historic position.|$|E
