Applying this manure to agricultural land can improve the fertility of the soil providing it essential nutrients. It is estimated that 27.8% of the municipal solid waste generated in United States in 2009 was organic waste consisting <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> <b>trimmings</b> and food waste that is compostable. [...] The agricultural and animal waste generated can also be composted and used as manure. For example, it is estimated that a dairy cow produces approximately 40 pounds of waste (dung, urine) per day which can be dried and used as manure. This manure can also be used in digesters to produce biogas (methane gas) or electricity, and other biofuels like ethanol.|$|E

Composters are converting {{a wide variety of}} otherwise wasted materials into safe, valuable, and marketable soil amendment products. <b>Yard</b> <b>trimmings</b> (defined here to include leaves, grass clippings, and brush), food scraps, non-recycled paper, food and seafood processing by-products, livestock manures, dead chickens, municipal sewage sludge, and other clean, source separated decomposable organic materials provide ingredients for the enterprising composter. Researchers are documenting the feasibility of composting an ever increasing array of materials (e. g., Brinton and Seekins, 1988 : Seekins, 1986). It is often reported that composting <b>yard</b> <b>trimmings,</b> food scraps, and non-recycled paper can deal with 30 - 60 percent of the municipal solid waste stream. This would represent a tremendous boost to attain municipal solid waste reduction goals. However, there is a growing concern about markets as the upply of compost mounts. Where will all the compost go? Who will treasure it and eagerly seek more (Gregory, 1973) ? A dramatic example of the rise in cornposting is evident from the results of BioCvcle's survey of the states (Glenn, 1990 : Glenn and Riggle, 1989).

In this study, we determined the extent of 2, 4 -D mineralization, incorporation into humic matter, volatilization, and sorption during the composting <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> <b>trimmings.</b> Yard trimmings (2 : 1 [wt/wt] leaves-grass) were amended with 14 C-ring-labeled 2, 4 -D (17 mg/kg of dry weight) and composted in a temperature-controlled laboratory scale compost system. During composting, thermophilic microbes were numerically dominant, reaching a maximum of 2 3 1011 /g. At the end of composting, 46 % of the organic matter (OM) present in the yard trimmings was lost and the compost was stable, with an oxygen uptake rate of 0. 09 mg of O 2 per g of OM per h, and was well humified (humification index, 0. 39). Mineralization of the OM temporally paralleled mineralization of 2, 4 -D. In the final compost, 47 % of the added 2, 4 -D carbon was mineralized, about 23 % was complexed with high-molecular-weight humic acids, and about 20 % was not extractable (humin fraction). Less than 1 % of the added 14 C was present in water expressed from the finished compost, suggesting a low potential for leaching of 2, 4 -D. Very little volatilization of 2, 4 -D occurred during composting.

40|$|W e are {{evaluating}} the advan- Q: tages {{and disadvantages of}} di-verting green waste (i. e. yard trimmings) from the landfill. I s there any available data regarding the effects of removing green waste from landfills on the production of landfill gas, specifically for use in gas to energy plants. Please provide any references available. There a re two issues to consider in estimating t h e effect <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> <b>trimmings</b> on landfill gas production-the methane potential of the yard trim-mings and their value a s both a source of nutrients and the bacteria required for methane production. The methane potential of t h e major biodegradable components of municipal solid waste CMSWJ is presented in Figure 1. These values were measured individually by component in laboratory-scale reactors that were operated to maximize decom-position. Each component was shredded (except grass and food waste), and the reactors were seeded with old refuse, operated with leachate recycle and neu-t ra l iza t ion, a n d incubated a t about 37 °C (99 °F). The values in Figure 1 were corrected for the methane potential of the seed. Using {{the values of the}} chart (above, and the composition of waste entering a specific landfill, the lost methane poten-tial of diverting yard trimmings from a landfill can be estimated. As an example, assume a rather typical yard trimmings composition of approximately 40 percent grass clippings, 30 percent leaves and 30 percent branches by weight. Further as-sume that the average moisture contents for grass, leaves, and branches are 85, 40, and 60 percent respectively. Under these assumptions, and deftly convert-ing from metric to English units, 678 cu-bic feet of methane would be generated by a ton <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> <b>trimmings</b> (800 lbs. of g rass, 600 lbs. of leaves, 600 Ibs. of brush).

A SUMMARY OF THE GHG IMPLICATIONS OF COMPOSTING During composting, microbial decomposition aerobically transforms organic substrates into a stable, humus-like material (Brown and Subler, 2007). Although small-scale composting, such as backyard composting, occurs across the United States, WARM models composting only in central composting facilities with windrow piles because data for small-scale composting or other large-scale operations are insufficient. 2 WARM includes composting as a materials management option for yard trimmings, food scraps, and mixed organics. As modeled in WARM, composting results in some carbon storage (associated with application of compost to agricultural soils), as well as minimal carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from transportation and mechanical turning of the compost piles.

Temperature, oxygen concentrations, {{and a number of other}} environmental parameters that influence microbial activity during composting were monitored. The PCBs in contaminated soil had a concentration of 16 + 1 mg/kg dw and an average of 4 chlorines per biphenyl. The soil was composted with five levels <b>of</b> <b>yard</b> <b>trimmings</b> amendment (14 % to 82 % by weight) in pilot scale compost piles (25 m 3) turned once per month. Results showed up to a 40 % loss of PCBs with amendment levels of 60 % and 82 %. Congener specific PCB analysis indicated that less chlorinated PCB congeners (1 - 3 chlorines per biphenyl) were preferentially degraded. Bench-scale studies indicated that less than 1 % of the PCBs in the contaminated soil were volatilized from composts during incubation with forced aeration at 55 ° C. In conclusion, PCB loss observed during the composting of the PCB-contaminated soil appeared to be largely due to biodegradation and not volatilization. Effective bioremediation of aged PCB-contaminated soils may require coupling of composting with additional remediation technologies to reduce levels of PCB congeners with greater than 4 chlorines...|$|E

Chemical tests of compost solids showed less promise as maturity indi-cators, but provided valuable information on final compost quality.

Estimates of the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from landfilling most of the materials considered in WARM and several categories of mixed waste streams (e. g., mixed paper, mixed recyclables and mixed municipal solid waste (MSW)) are included in the chapter. 1. A SUMMARY OF THE GHG IMPLICATIONS OF LANDFILLING When food scraps, <b>yard</b> <b>trimmings,</b> paper and wood are landfilled, anaerobic bacteria degrade the materials, producing methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). CH 4 is counted as an anthropogenic GHG because, even if it is derived from sustainably harvested biogenic sources, degradation would not result in CH 4 emissions if not for deposition in landfills. The CO 2 is not counted as a GHG because is it considered part of the natural carbon cycle of growth and decomposition; for more information, see the text box on biogenic carbon in the Introduction & Background chapter. The other materials in WARM either do not contain carbon or do not biodegrade measurably in anaerobic conditions, and therefore do not generate any CH 4.

Communication by Barnes Nursery, Inc. with local, state and federal officials about potential wildlife hazards posed by the development of their food waste composting business created an atmosphere of collaboration. We suggest a similar approach for others considering food waste composting operations. However, for those operations proposed within FAA siting criteria for certificated airports under Part 139 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or other airports receiving FAA funding, a Wildlife Hazard Assessment might be deemed mandatory.
