40|$|Learning from noisy {{data sources}} is a {{practical}} and important issue in Data Mining re-search. As errors continuously impose difficulty on discriminant analysis, identifying and removing suspicious data items is {{regarded as one of}} the most effective data preprocess-ing techniques, commonly referred to as data cleansing. Despite the effectiveness of these traditional approaches, many problems still remain unsolved. In this thesis, we study the problem of noise tolerant data mining, which addresses the problem of learning from noisy information sources. We construct a noise Modeling, Diagnosis, and Utilization (MDU) framework, which bridges up the gap between data pre-processing methods and the actual data mining step. This framework provides a conceptual working flow for a typical data mining task and outlines the importance of noise tolerant data mining. Based on the proposed mining framework, we present an effective strategy that com-bines noise handling and classifier ensembling so as to build robust learning algorithms on noisy data. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> systems that consider both accuracy and the diver...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the {{cultural}} encounter between Christian Ethiopians and Portuguese in the 16 th and 17 th centuries. At the dawn of the 16 th century a friendly relationship between Ethiopia and Portugal was inaugurated. The communication between kings of the two countries eventually led to a Jesuit mission to Ethiopia. After a time of debates, the Ethiopian king was baptized in the Catholic faith with the consequence of an attempt to convert the Ethiopian people to Roman Catholicism. By applying the theories of Georg Simmel and Edward Said the distinct constructions of the Stranger in this meeting among both Ethiopian and Portuguese sources are examined. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> as the correspondences and meetings between agents from both countries progressed, doctrinal and cultural enmity between the Ethiopian Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Christians increased.

40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from chronic illness, such as diabetes, use various domestic instruments {{as part of}} their selfcare. For older adults, {{there is a need for}} assistance to use the instruments adequately and to solve technical failures. Following the eHealth concept, we designed a computer assistant for an older adult and a technical specialist, which supports remote collaborative troubleshooting which tailors the feedback to the users' needs. We evaluated two feedback styles, i. e., cooperative and directive, in the TNO Experience lab, with older and younger adults playing the role of patient and technical specialist, respectively, in "failure scenarios". Results show that most effective troubleshooting occurs with teams consisting of a older patient receiving cooperative feedback and a younger technical specialist receiving directive feedback. In addition, the patient experienced more effort than the technical specialist. Further, different personal characteristics had moderating effects on the evaluation of the feedback styles. <b>Our</b> <b>study</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> different user groups require different feedback styles and that computer assistance for remote collaborative troubleshooting will be optimal when this feedback is personalized...|$|E
