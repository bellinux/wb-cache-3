5|$|Coastal Command sank 27 U-boats in 1942 {{and damaged}} 18 more. Some of these kills were {{shared with the}} Navy. Bomber Command, by contrast, whose {{priority}} garnered them greater resources {{at the expense of}} Coastal Command, failed to destroy a single completed U-boat on the slip until April 1944. Arthur Harris, GOC Bomber Command, deplored the use of aircraft for defensive purposes and insisted the threat would be checked by attacking production. An indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of air tactics was the fact very few Allied ships were sunk within 600 miles of British waters by late 1942. Between June 1942 to June 1943, 71 enemy submarines were sunk by the command.|$|E

5|$|Recompression on air {{was shown}} to be an {{effective}} treatment for minor DCS symptoms by Keays in 1909. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by Yarbrough and Behnke, and has since become the standard of care for treatment of DCS. Recompression is normally carried out in a recompression chamber. At a dive site, a riskier alternative is in-water recompression.|$|E
5|$|Several Michigan {{school records}} were broken or tied in the blowout win.

Their 57-point win tied the second-biggest margin of victory for them since 1950, and tied for the eighth-largest margin of victory in school history. The 49 first half points was the team's second highest ever. The 28 point first quarter also tied a school record. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of the offense, the team did not punt the ball once, the first time this has happened since 1978.|$|E

5|$|There were problems. Inflated bomb damage {{assessment}} reports during operations in northeastern Laos were common, but {{the cause was}} not difficult to discern. Mountainous terrain, poor weather, ground cover, the lack of ground forces for confirmation, and the language barrier all contributed to overestimation of the damage inflicted on communist forces by the bombing effort. The result was a skewed sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> and {{the capabilities of the}} campaign. The results of the campaign (which were made obvious by the repeating seasonal nature of PAVN and Pathet Lao offensives), however, indicated that American airpower was quite effective.|$|E
5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{there are}} {{different}} ways <b>of</b> measuring <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> RRSs. <b>The</b> major include <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> unexpected CA outside ICU, <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> unplanned ICU admissions, and hospital mortality. All these outcome measures have limitations and are prone to bias. <b>The</b> level <b>of</b> evidence supporting <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> RRSs is relatively low and almost all studies have a before-and-after design. Despite the ethical and implementation difficulties, high-quality randomized trials are warranted to reliably assess <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> RRS.|$|R
5|$|Like the British Army, Australia did {{not have}} a {{parachute}} operations capability at the outbreak of the Second World War; however, the demonstration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of such forces by the Germans {{in the early stages of}} the conflict soon provided the impetus for their development. Efforts to raise an operational parachute capability in the Australian Army began in November 1942, with 40 volunteers being selected for initial training with the newly formed Paratroop Training Unit. The first descents were made at Tocumwal in New South Wales, with the initial parachute courses consisting of four jumps. By March 1943 enough personnel had been trained for the Army to consider forming a full parachute battalion. As a result, the 1st Parachute Battalion was raised at this time at RAAF Station Richmond near Sydney, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The first attacks {{conducted}} under LeMay's leadership achieved mixed results. XXIBomber Command flew {{six major}} missions between 23January and 19February with little success, though an incendiary raid against Kobe on 4February caused significant {{damage to the}} city and its main factories. Moreover, while improved maintenance procedures implemented by LeMay reduced the number of B-29s that had to return to base during raids due to technical problems, the Command suffered a loss rate of 5.1% in these operations. From 19February to 3March, XXI Bomber Command conducted a series of precision bombing raids on aircraft factories that sought to tie down Japanese air units so they could not participate in the Battle of Iwo Jima. However, these attacks were frustrated by high winds and cloud cover and little damage was inflicted. A firebombing raid conducted against Tokyo by 172 B-29s on 25February was considered successful as it burnt or damaged approximately one square mile of the city's urban area. This attack was a large-scale test <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of firebombing.|$|E
5|$|Their {{frustration}} clearly apparent, the Virginia Tech offense fared {{no better}} on their next possession. Two plays were stopped for no gain, {{and the only}} positive play—a five-yard pass to Eddie Royal—was negated by a false start penalty. The Hokies were again forced to punt the ball away to Florida State, their fifth of the game. The punt allowed FSU to start at their own 46-yard line, and at first, the Seminoles were able to capitalize on that opportunity, showing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> that characterized their prior drive. Lorenzo Booker ran for 24yards on two plays, but afterwards, Drew Weatherford threw two incompletions. A false start penalty backed up the Seminoles, who were forced to punt after failing {{to pick up the}} first down. The kick was an excellent one, and Florida State's special teams were able to get downfield and stop the ball inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line, again hurting the Hokie offense.|$|E

5|$|While {{the coastal}} {{defenses}} had not turned back the invasion at the beach, they {{had broken up}} and weakened the assault formations struggling through them. The German emphasis on this Main Line of Resistance (MLR) meant that defenses further inland were significantly weaker, and based on small pockets of prepared positions smaller than company sized in strength. This tactic was enough to disrupt American advances inland, making it difficult even to reach the assembly areas, let alone achieve their D-Day objectives. As an example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of German defenses despite weakness in numbers, the 5th Ranger battalion was halted in its advance inland by a single machine gun position hidden in a hedgerow. One platoon attempted to outflank the position, only to run into another machine gun position {{to the left of}} the first. A second platoon dispatched to take this new position ran into a third, and attempts to deal with this met with fire from a fourth position. The success of the MLR in blocking the movement of heavy weapons off the beach meant that, after four hours, the Rangers were forced to give up on attempts to move them any further inland.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{colleague}} Wei Pu, Shen planned {{to map the}} orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court. To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, gnomon, sighting tube, and invented {{a new type of}} inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt. He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of the relatively new invention of the canal pound lock. Although Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) was the first to describe camera obscura, Shen was the first in China to do so, several decades later. Shen wrote extensively about movable type printing invented by Bi Sheng (990–1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations. Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321.|$|E

40|$|Background: IA {{provides}} {{assistance to}} an organization in achieving its objectives through assessing and improving <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> risk management, control and governance processes.
