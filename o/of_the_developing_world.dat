5|$|The third {{industrial}} revolution is spreading from {{the developed world}} to some, but not all, parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> To participate in this new global economy, developing countries {{must be seen as}} attractive offshore production bases for multinational corporations. To be such bases, developing countries must provide relatively well-educated workforces, good infrastructure (electricity, telecommunications, transportation), political stability, and a willingness to play by market rules.|$|E
5|$|Many {{trees have}} flowers rich in nectar which are {{attractive}} to bees. The production of forest honey {{is an important}} industry in rural areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using traditional methods. The flowers of the elder (Sambucus) are used to make elderflower cordial and petals of the plum (Prunus spp.) can be candied. Sassafras oil is a flavouring obtained from distilling bark from {{the roots of the}} white sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} are in wide use {{around the}} world. In most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> especially in rural areas, local traditional medicine, including herbalism, is (2015) {{the only source}} of health care for people, while in the developed world, alternative medicine including use of dietary supplements is marketed aggressively using the claims of traditional medicine. As of 2015, most products made from medicinal plants had not been tested for their safety and efficacy, and products that were marketed in developed economies and provided in the undeveloped world by traditional healers were of uneven quality, sometimes containing dangerous contaminants. Traditional Chinese medicine makes use {{of a wide variety of}} plants, among other materials and techniques. Researchers from Kew Gardens found 104 species used for diabetes in Central America, of which seven had been identified in at least three separate studies. The Yanomami of the Brazilian Amazon, assisted by researchers, have described 101 plant species used for traditional medicines.|$|E
30|$|This is {{the first}} paper to compare the {{incidence}} and mortality in three regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> with similar populations. Previous studies looking at incidence of penile cancer have predominantly been focused on single countries. This is also the first paper to correlate population-based circumcision rates between regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world.</b> This provides new information to further explore <b>the</b> widely-debated topic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> circumcision on rates of penile cancer.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> number <b>of</b> {{old people}} is growing {{around the world}} chiefly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post–World War II baby boom and {{increases}} in the provision and standards of health care. By 2050, 33% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world's</b> population and almost 20% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less <b>developed</b> <b>world's</b> population will be over 60 years old.|$|R
25|$|The shootings {{sparked the}} usual {{commentary}} and editorials that are customarily critical of U.S. gun laws and gun culture in <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{some parts}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> {{liberalisation}} brought significant benefits for {{large sections of}} the population – most prominently with Deng Xiaoping's reforms in China since 1978 and the liberalisation of India after its 1991 crisis.|$|E
25|$|While {{hookworm}} infection may {{not directly}} lead to mortality, {{its effects on}} morbidity demand immediate attention. When considering disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), neglected tropical diseases, including hookworm infection, rank among diarrheal diseases, ischemic heart disease, malaria, and tuberculosis {{as one of the}} most important health problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
25|$|Now, in Mexico, Roman Catholics are 89% of {{the total}} population, 47% of whom attend church {{services}} weekly, {{one of the lowest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> In absolute terms, Mexico has the world's second largest number of Catholics after Brazil. While most indigenous Mexicans are at least nominally Catholic, some combine or syncretize Catholic practices with native traditions.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the twentieth}} century, the {{eugenics}} movement became popular throughout the world. This led to the forced sterilization and prohibition of marriage in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> and was later used by Hitler as rationale for <b>the</b> mass murder <b>of</b> mentally challenged individuals during the Holocaust. The eugenics movement was later thought to be seriously flawed and in violation {{of human rights and}} <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> forced sterilization and prohibition from marriage was discontinued by most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> by <b>the</b> mid 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Bonded {{warehousing}} {{exists in}} much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world.</b> They are <b>of</b> note in <b>the</b> United States for {{their role in}} <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> bottled in bond spirits.|$|R
50|$|Famine, in this story, {{seeks to}} destroy <b>the</b> populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> by a devious kind of {{starvation}} {{caused by the}} dwindling nutrition in refined and convenience food.|$|R
25|$|Leishmaniasis {{is mostly}} a disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> and is rarely known in the {{developed}} world outside a small number of cases, mostly in instances where troops are stationed away from their home countries. Leishmaniasis has been reported by U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia and Iraq since the Gulf War of 1990, including visceral leishmaniasis.|$|E
25|$|India is a founding-member of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the WTO. While {{participating}} {{actively in}} its general council meetings, India has been crucial in voicing the concerns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> For instance, India has continued {{its opposition to}} the inclusion of labour, environmental issues and other non-tariff barriers to trade in WTO policies.|$|E
25|$|About 90% {{of people}} survive to age 20, {{and close to}} 50% survive beyond the fifth decade. In 2001, {{according}} to one study performed in Jamaica, the estimated mean survival for people with sickle-cell was 53 years old for men and 58 years old for women with homozygous SCD. The specific life expectancy in much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|In endodontics, {{chlorhexidine}} is {{used for}} root canal irrigation and as an intracanal dressing, [...] but {{has been replaced by}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> sodium hypochlorite bleach in much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{products}} use {{low-density polyethylene}} formed into plastic bags or plastic boxes. There are many makers of plastic boxes {{some such as}} Tupperware and Lock&Lock are known throughout much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world.</b>|$|R
50|$|Residents {{of these}} places produce {{a high rate of}} centenarians, suffer a {{fraction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diseases that commonly kill people in other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world,</b> and enjoy more healthy years of life.|$|R
25|$|Flucytosine {{was first}} made in 1957. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. As of 2016, in the United States the medication cost about 2,000 USD per day while in the United Kingdom it is about 22 USD per day. It is not available in much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anorexia is {{estimated}} to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries {{at some point in}} their life. About 0.4% of young females are affected in a given year and it {{is estimated}} to occur three to ten times less commonly in males. Rates in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> are unclear. Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> such as China, India and Brazil {{remain largely}} rural but are rapidly urbanising and industrialising. In these areas a {{motorised}} infrastructure {{is being developed}} alongside motorisation of the population. Great disparity of wealth means that {{only a fraction of}} the population can motorise, and therefore the highly dense multimodal transportation system for the poor is cross-cut by the highly motorised transportation system for the rich.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, in {{response}} to Charles Darwin's On <b>the</b> Origin <b>of</b> Species, Francis Galton proposed selective breeding of humans to reduce intellectual disability. Early in the 20th century the eugenics movement became popular throughout the world. This led to forced sterilization and prohibition of marriage in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> and was later used by Adolf Hitler as a rationale for <b>the</b> mass murder <b>of</b> people with intellectual disability during the holocaust. Eugenics was later abandoned as an evil violation of human rights, and <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> forced sterilization and prohibition from marriage was discontinued by most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> by <b>the</b> mid-20th century.|$|R
25|$|In {{many parts}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world,</b> suburbs can be {{economically}} distressed areas, inhabited by higher proportions of recent immigrants, with higher delinquency rates and social problems. Sometimes <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> suburb may even refer {{to people in}} real misery, who are kept at <b>the</b> limit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city borders for economic, social, and sometimes ethnic reasons. An example in <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> would be <b>the</b> banlieues <b>of</b> France, or <b>the</b> concrete suburbs <b>of</b> Sweden, even if <b>the</b> suburbs <b>of</b> these countries also include middle-class and upper-class neighborhoods that often consist of single-family houses. Thus some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suburbs <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> are comparable to several inner cities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and Canada.|$|R
25|$|China in 2012 {{produced}} more than one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world's</b> apparel import but the share has been decreasing {{in recent years as}} low-technology and labor-intensive production has been moving to regions like Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.|$|R
25|$|A {{simple pit}} latrine uses no water seal and {{collects}} human excreta in a pit or trench. This type of toilet {{can range from}} a simple slit trench to more elaborate systems with seating or squatting pans and ventilation systems. In developed countries they are associated with camping and wilderness areas, whereas they are common in rural or peri-urban areas of much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> Pit latrines are used in emergency situations.|$|E
25|$|The IBSA Dialogue Forum (India, Brazil, South Africa) is an {{international}} tripartite grouping for promoting international cooperation among these countries. It represents three important poles for galvanizing South-South cooperation and greater understanding between three important continents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> namely, Africa, Asia and South America. The forum provides the three countries with a platform to engage in discussions for cooperation {{in the field of}} agriculture, trade, culture, and defence among others.|$|E
25|$|In the {{developing}} world, {{the migration from}} rural to urbanized habitats has progressed differently. Many areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> have urbanised without significant motorisation {{and the formation of}} suburbs. A small portion of the population can afford automobiles, but the automobiles greatly increase congestion in these multimodal transportation systems. They also produce considerable air pollution, pose a significant safety risk, and exacerbate feelings of inequities in the society. High population density could be supported by a multimodal system of walking, bicycle transportation, motorcycles, buses, and trains.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> (with <b>the</b> notable {{exception}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States) now has sub-replacement fertility levels, {{and population growth}} now depends largely on immigration together with population momentum, which arises from previous large generations now enjoying longer life expectancy.|$|R
50|$|In much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world,</b> {{changes from}} {{distinct}} men's work and women's work to more gender equal patterns have been economically important since the mid-20th century. Both {{men and women}} are considered to be great contributors to social change worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Specially {{designed}} transfer {{chairs are}} now required features at airports in much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> {{in order to}} allow access down narrow airliner aisles and facilitate <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> wheelchair-using passengers to and from their seats on the aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Vehicles with {{a single}} driving wheel. Besides motorcycles, which are {{generally}} not classified as automobiles, this group includes most three-wheeled cars. These were quite common in Europe in the mid-20th Century, but have now become rare there. They are still common in some areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> such as India. Some early four-wheeled cars also had only one driving wheel to avoid {{the need for a}} differential. However, this arrangement led to many problems. The system was unbalanced, the driving wheel would easily spin, etc. Because of these problems, few such vehicles were made.|$|E
25|$|Micro-hydro {{configured}} into mini-grids {{also provide}} power. Over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking, {{and more than}} 166 million households rely on {{a new generation of}} more-efficient biomass cookstoves. Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> Alcohol fuels (ethanol and methanol) can be produced sustainably from non-food sugary, starchy, and cellulostic feedstocks. Project Gaia, Inc. and CleanStar Mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Mozambique.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2006 World Bank study average water tariffs in Latin America are {{the highest}} of any region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> Tariffs are about four times higher than in South Asia, three times higher than in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and almost {{twice as high as}} in East Asia. However, tariffs are less than half as high as in OECD countries. Based on a sample of 23 major cities in Latin America the average {{residential}} water tariff for a monthly consumption of 15 cubic meter was US$0.41, equivalent to a monthly bill of only about US$6.|$|E
50|$|Diloxanide {{came into}} medical use in 1956. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List <b>of</b> Essential Medicines, <b>the</b> most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is not commercially available in much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> as <b>of</b> 2012.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world,</b> {{recession}} hit <b>the</b> United Kingdom at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s. This followed {{a string of}} crises that plagued the British economy for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s. Consequently, unemployment had gradually increased since the mid-1960s.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{financial}} crisis in Japan at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, {{there was a brief}} recession in other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> including Germany, Italy and France in the early-2000s, but once again, the UK avoided recession and continued to enjoy a strong economy and low unemployment.|$|R
