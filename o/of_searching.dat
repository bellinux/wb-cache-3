5|$|In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, {{a branch}} of Bletchley Park, {{informed}} Somerville that the Japanese were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet.

40|$|Abstract: Web log mining {{provides}} tremendous {{information about}} user traffic and search engine behavior at web sites. The behavior <b>of</b> <b>search</b> engines {{could be used}} in analyzing server load, quality <b>of</b> <b>search</b> engines, dynamics <b>of</b> <b>search</b> engine crawlers, ethics <b>of</b> <b>search</b> engines etc. Search engine crawlers are highly automated programs which are seldom regulated manually. These crawlers periodically visit the web sites to collect the information. The dynamicity <b>of</b> <b>search</b> engine crawlers could be identified with the time delay between two consecutive visits. The more the visits of a crawler to a web site, the more it contributes to the server load. We intend to see whether there is {{a significant difference in the}} time delay between visits <b>of</b> a <b>search</b> engine crawler. Similarly the time delay between visits <b>of</b> various <b>search</b> engine crawlers is also analyzed to identify the differences in their behavior...|$|R

5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer {{down the length of}} the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way <b>of</b> <b>searching</b> for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|E
5|$|The Danish sloop Jordenxiold {{was intercepted}} off Isla Palominos on September 3, 1824, as she {{completed}} a voyage from Saint Thomas to Fajardo; the pirates stole goods and cash from the passengers.

On September 8â9 a hurricane, Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la Monserrate, struck southern Puerto Rico and passed directly over the Mona Passage. CofresÃ­ and his crew were caught in the storm, which drove their ship towards Hispaniola.

40|$|We {{propose a}} model <b>of</b> <b>search</b> term {{selection}} process {{based on our}} empirical study of professional searchers during the pre-online stage <b>of</b> the <b>search</b> process. The model characterizes the selection <b>of</b> <b>search</b> terms as the navigation of different discourses. Discourse refers to the way of talking and thinking about a certain topic; there often exists multiple, diverse discourses on the same topic. When selecting search terms, searchers appear to navigate a variety of discourses, i. e., they view the topic <b>of</b> a client's <b>search</b> request {{from the perspective of}} multiple discourse communities, and evaluate and synthesize differences and similarities among those discourses when selecting search terms. Six discourses emerged as sources <b>of</b> <b>search</b> terms in our study. These discourses are controlled vocabularies, documents and domains, the practice <b>of</b> indexing, clients' <b>search</b> requests, databases and the searchers' own search experience. Data further suggest that searchers navigate these discourses dynamically and have preferences for certain discourses. Conceptualizing the selection <b>of</b> <b>search</b> terms as a meeting place of different discourses provides new insights into the complex nature <b>of</b> the <b>search</b> term selection process. It emphasizes the multiplicity and complexity of the sources <b>of</b> <b>search</b> terms, the dynamic nature <b>of</b> the <b>search</b> term selection process, and the complex analysis and synthesis of differences and similarities among sources <b>of</b> <b>search</b> terms. It suggests that searchers may need to understand fundamental aspects of multiple discourses in order to select search terms...|$|R

5|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw an {{increase}} in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of audio file formats such as MP3 and Real Audio, combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for bootleg collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of Napster in 1999 made it easy to share bootlegs between a large computer network. Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were ripped to computer hard disks, and new material was created with digital recording of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option <b>of</b> <b>searching</b> for and downloading bootlegs of individual songs. Artists gave a mixed reaction to bootleg sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while King Crimson's Robert Fripp and, infamously, Metallica were strongly critical of the ease in which Napster could circumvent the traditional channels of royalty payments.|$|E
5|$|The {{unsuccessful}} assault against FSB Coral on {{the night}} of 12/13 May had demonstrated that the North Vietnamese would react violently to Australian attempts to control AO Surfers, and with 1 ATF deployed astride a key route to Saigon and threatening a number of communist bases and staging areas located nearby, further heavy fighting was expected over the following days. In response, the Australians were forced to refine their tactics and Hughes decided to establish strong defensive positions in order to destroy the North Vietnamese by fire, rather than by the painstaking patrolling more familiar to the Australians. The FSBs would be heavily defended by night, while the battalions would conduct defensive patrols by day. Later, fighting patrols up to company-size with armoured support would then be used to locate and destroy the Viet Cong main force bases. As such the Australian concept of operations subsequently evolved from one <b>of</b> <b>searching</b> and clearing in order to locate and cut infiltration and withdrawal routes, into a series of reconnaissance-in-force operations from heavily defended bases. Meanwhile, in AO Manly, 3 RAR continued patrolling for the next seven days, successfully ambushing staging areas and infiltration routes between 13â19 May for the loss of one soldier killed.|$|E
