5|$|Metal corsets {{are found}} {{in a number of}} museum {{collections}} around the world. Some museums, including the Museo Stibbert, and the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, present their metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London describes their iron corset (formerly owned by the painter Talbot Hughes) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for <b>orthopaedic</b> purposes. Others, such as the iron corset in the Fashion Institute of Technology, are presented as fakes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractProfessor Kenelm Hutchinson Digby (1884 – 1954) was {{the first}} Professor of Surgery at the University of Hong Kong. He contributed {{extensively}} {{to the understanding of}} many aspects of <b>orthopaedics</b> and should be regarded as the originator of <b>orthopaedics</b> in Hong Kong. This article outlines the contributions of Professor Digby in the development of <b>orthopaedics</b> in Hong Kong...|$|R
50|$|The {{developing}} {{field of}} <b>orthopaedics</b> was originally focused on deformities in children, and subsequently adults. The involvement of <b>orthopaedics</b> in trauma care {{developed in the}} course of World War I, the interwar period, and World War II. It was not until after World War II that <b>orthopaedics</b> became the dominant field treating fractures in much of the world.|$|R

5|$|Metal corsets {{for medical}} {{purposes}} {{continued to be}} used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place. In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American <b>Orthopaedic</b> Association recommended an aluminium corset coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of Pott disease or curvature of the spine. Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, durable, thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such corsets were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more durable in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} major National Health Service {{hospitals}} in Birmingham. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, {{adjacent to the}} Birmingham Medical School in Edgbaston, houses the largest critical care unit in Europe, and is also {{the home of the}} Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, treating military personnel injured in conflict zones. Other general hospitals in the city include Heartlands Hospital, Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield and City Hospital in Winson Green. There are also many specialist hospitals, such as Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham Women's Hospital, Birmingham Dental Hospital, and the Royal <b>Orthopaedic</b> Hospital.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or <b>orthopaedic</b> brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E

5|$|The new rectory {{was built}} by the Reverend John Ellershaw in the 1870s. The last rector to occupy it was Lionel St. Clair Waldy from 1907 to 1945. It was then bought by Douglas Wills who donated it and the rectory field to Winford Hospital as a convalescent home for 16 children, and later used as a nurses' home before being sold for private use. Primarily an <b>orthopaedic</b> hospital, Winford was built in 1930, and became a part-military and part-{{civilian}} hospital. Wards A to D were for civilian use, while wards E to K, added {{to the hospital in}} 1940, were for the treatment of service and civilian war casualties. The hospital closed in 1996, and the rectory is now divided into several residential units.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{hospitals}} in Enugu are privately run. The UNTH and the National <b>Orthopaedic</b> Hospital are {{among some of}} the government controlled hospitals in the city. The medical equipment for the UNTH was upgraded in 2009 as well as parts of the hospital which were renovated in the same year. Most hospitals in the city suffer from a poor standard of medical facilities available to them; many of the city's citizens travel abroad for medical care. However, hospitals have been aided by foreign organisations and by Enugu's community at home and abroad who have donated medicine and other medical equipment. The most developed government hospital in Enugu is the Park Lane Hospital. The governor has said that the state has bought some ambulance service vehicles in March 2010. Enugu State has established free medical care for pregnant women and for all children under 5 years of age in the state. The child healthcare programme, founded under the District Health System (DHS), was added to the states 2008 budget. Enugu State has a HIV/AIDS prevalence of 6.5%, one of the highest in the country.|$|E
