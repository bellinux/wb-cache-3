5|$|A {{referendum}} in Croatia {{can be called}} by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within the purview of parliament, or on any <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> the president considers important to the independence, unity and existence of the republic. Since the constitution was amended in 2001, parliament is obligated by the constitution {{to call for a}} referendum if signatures of 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected. The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the outcome is binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum.|$|E
5|$|The {{resilience}} of Indonesian Republican resistance and active international diplomacy set world opinion against the Dutch efforts to re-establish their colony. The second 'police action' was a diplomatic {{disaster for the}} Dutch cause. The newly appointed United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson pushed the Netherlands government into negotiations earlier recommended by the United Nations but until then defied by the Netherlands. The Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the Netherlands, and the Dutch-created federal states. The Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as the 'United States of Indonesia' (RUSI). It would include all {{the territory of the}} former Dutch East Indies with the exception of Netherlands New Guinea; sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by the Netherlands until further negotiations with Indonesia. The <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> on which Indonesia gave concessions was Netherlands East Indies debt. Indonesia agreed to responsibility for this sum of £4.3billion, much of which was directly attributable to Dutch attempts to crush the revolution. Sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 December 1949, and the new state was immediately recognised by the United States of America.|$|E

25|$|During the Roosevelt administration, several radical populist {{proposals}} {{which went}} beyond what Roosevelt {{was willing to}} advocate gained in popularity. It is notable that {{all four of the}} main promoters of these proposals, Charles Coughlin, Huey Long, Francis Townsend, and Upton Sinclair, were originally strong New Deal supporters but turned against Roosevelt because they believed the New Deal programs didn't go far enough. Like the New Deal programs, these populist proposals were based entirely on single economic reforms, but did not take a position on any <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> and were therefore compatible with those holding otherwise conservative views. Some historians today believe that the primary base of support for the proposals of Coughlin, Long, Townsend, and Sinclair was conservative middle class whites who saw their economic status slipping away during the Depression.|$|E
25|$|Virtual globes may be {{used for}} study or {{navigation}} (by connecting to a GPS device) and their design varies considerably according to their purpose. Those wishing to portray a visually accurate representation of the Earth often use satellite image servers and are capable not only of rotation but also zooming and sometimes horizon tilting. Very often such virtual globes aim to provide as true a representation of the World as is possible with worldwide coverage up to a very detailed level. When this is the case the interface often has the option of providing simplified graphical overlays to highlight man-made features since these are not necessarily obvious from a photographic aerial view. The <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> raised by such detail available is that of security with some governments having raised concerns about the ease of access to detailed views of sensitive locations such as airports and military bases.|$|E

500|$|Banks's 1859 reelection was {{influenced}} by two significant issues. [...] One was a state constitutional amendment requiring newly naturalized citizens to wait two years before becoming eligible to vote. [...] Promoted by the state's Know Nothings, it was passed by referendum in May of that year. [...] Banks, catering to Know Nothing supporters, supported its passage, although Republicans elsewhere opposed such measures, because they were seeking immigrant votes. The amendment was repealed in 1863. [...] The <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> was John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, which more radical Republicans (notably John Albion Andrew) expressed sympathy for. [...] Not yet ready for armed conflict, the state voted for the more moderate Banks. [...] After the election, Banks vetoed a series of bills, over provisions removing a restriction limiting state militia participation to whites. [...] This incensed the radical abolitionist forces in the legislature, but {{they were unable to}} override his vetoes in that year's session, or of similar bills passed in the next.|$|E

She was the only twin-screw ship ever to have hoisting screws.

Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, was successful at increasing sales; the first of these stories appeared in August 1972, and White reported that sales of that issue were higher than for any <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> of Amazing or Fantastic that year. [...] Each Conan story, according to White, increased sales of that issue by 10,000 copies. [...] White also published several of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, and added [...] "Sword and Sorcery" [...] to the cover in 1975. [...] In the same year a companion magazine, Sword & Sorcery Annual, was launched, but the first issue was the only one to appear.|$|E
500|$|Some {{members of}} the Tories' {{campaign}} committee had urged Diefenbaker not to build his campaign around the Pipeline Debate, contending that the episode was now {{a year in the}} past and forgotten by the voters, who did not particularly care what went on in Parliament anyway. Diefenbaker replied, [...] "That's the issue, and I'm making it." [...] Diefenbaker referred to the conduct of the government in the Pipeline Debate more frequently than he did any <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> during the campaign. St. Laurent initially dealt with the question flippantly, suggesting in his opening campaign address that the debate had been [...] "nearly as long as the pipeline itself and quite as full of another kind of natural gas". As the issue gained resonance with the voters, the Liberals devoted more time to it, and St. Laurent devoted a major part of his final English television address to the question. The Liberals defended their conduct, and contended that a minority {{should not be allowed to}} impose its will on an elected majority. St. Laurent suggested that the Tories had performed badly as an opposition in the debate, and suggested that the public give them more practice at being an opposition.|$|E
500|$|Buffalo, New York, {{announced}} {{interest in}} attracting the Grizzlies. The city had an appropriate venue in HSBC Arena (now KeyBank Center), {{home of the}} Buffalo Sabres NHL ice hockey franchise. Mayor Anthony Masiello, a former college basketball star, stated that the attempt was [...] "a long shot", but worth the try. The city previously hosted an NBA franchise in the Buffalo Braves, from 1970 to 1978, which was only dismantled because Paul Snyder, who owned the team from 1971 to 1976, was feuding with other teams that used Buffalo's only arena at the time (Buffalo Memorial Auditorium); some of those conflicts were no longer issues with the new arena, and Snyder was still active in business {{at the time of}} the Grizzlies bid. The Braves became the San Diego Clippers in 1978 and moved to Los Angeles in 1984; San Diego was also mentioned as a potential site for the Grizzlies, although the city lacked a suitable venue. Heisley visited Las Vegas, Nevada, where he negotiated with Mayor Oscar Goodman. The city offered the team free land for a new arena, but would not pay for construction. The <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> was Stern's demand that casinos stop accepting bets on NBA games as a precondition of placing a team in Las Vegas.|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the thought}} process behind {{changing}} Reyes' origin for the series, Bell {{said that the}} writers first wanted to ground the character in the more realistic world of the series and the wider MCU, and so though Reyes believes he is possessed by the devil in the series, they decided to instead tie the Ghost Rider figure to another dimension. Bell noted that the MCU film Doctor Strange also explores other dimensions and dimensional beings, and was being released {{around the same time}} that the episode was. The <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> that writers and producers had when approaching the origin story for the series is that they felt it was too complicated to translate accurately from the comics, particularly because the series had already used the character Mister Hyde in a different way to the comics and with Reyes' uncle Eli Morrow being a serial killer whose spirit possesses Reyes in that version. They decided to bring their origin story closer to that of other Ghost Rider iterations such as Johnny Blaze and Danny Ketch by having Reyes be more of a traditional [...] "Spirit of Vengeance", and use Morrow in a different way that was still as a villain and [...] "hopefully in a way that surprised people". They hoped that the series' version was true to the spirit of the comics' Robbie Reyes story while also connecting to [...] "the past of the other" [...] Ghost Rider characters, which was described as [...] "the best of both worlds".|$|E
500|$|A week later, {{the figures}} for a brand-new station at Laurence Harbor were released, saying the station would take {{five years to}} construct, with costs ranging from $25 million$30 million (2001 USD) of funding {{from the state of}} New Jersey and the federal government. The station would also relieve the busy Aberdeen-Matawan station, which at the time hosted about 3,500 commuters daily. Most of the city council and mayor {{supported}} the deal, except for councilman Joseph Hoff. Hoff believed the train station was a good idea, but {{there were a number of}} outstanding issues before plans for one could go forward. Hoff stated that the additional truck traffic and the safety of the pedestrians in the area were also a concern. These concerns would also get worse when the Atrium II office complex would be completed on the western side of Exit 120. Another major issue was the traffic congestion at Exit 120 itself, which at rush hour was [...] "atrocious". By November 2002, the station had not received any studies on the general location were not conducted by New Jersey Transit. Although the proposal still had support by the community, several citizens, including Joseph Hoff, were still questioning it. Hoff cited that New Jersey Transit has not put any interest forward and would just end up becoming another parking lot rather than a tax revenue. He reported however, that if residential homes and commercial businesses were constructed, it would be beneficial to Laurence Harbor. The <b>other</b> <b>issue</b> that Hoff maintained, was that it would risk the lives of children heading to and from Laurence Harbor Memorial School by affecting the traffic in the area.|$|E
