5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the <b>object</b> <b>is</b> said to be negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons {{than the number of}} protons in nuclei, the <b>object</b> <b>is</b> said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the <b>object</b> <b>is</b> said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

40|$|In 3 picture word {{interference}} experiments, speakers named {{a target}} {{object in the}} presence of an unrelated not-to-be-named context object. Distractor words, which were phonologically related or unrelated to the context <b>object's</b> name, <b>were</b> used to determine whether the context object had become phonologically activated. All objects had high frequency names, and the ease of processing of these <b>objects</b> <b>was</b> manipulated by a visual degradation technique. In Experiment 1, both <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> nondegraded; in Experiment 2, both <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> degraded; and in Experiment 3, either the target object or the context <b>object</b> <b>was</b> degraded. Distractor words, which were phonologically related to the context objects, interfered with the naming response when both <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> nondegraded, indicating that the context objects had become phonologically coactivated. The effect vanished when both <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> degraded, when only the context <b>object</b> <b>was</b> degraded, and when only the target <b>object</b> <b>was</b> degraded. These data demonstrate that the amount of available processing resources constrains the forward cascading of activation in the conceptual-lexical system. Context <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> likely to become phonologically coactivated if they are easily retrieved and if prioritized target processing leaves sufficient resources...|$|R

5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed <b>object</b> <b>is</b> created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a hologram image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while the <b>object</b> <b>is</b> being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this hologram image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated participants' {{spatial memory}} of a briefly viewed layout. Participants saw an array of five objects on a table and, after a short delay, indicated whether the target object indicated by the experimenter had been moved. Experiment I showed that change detection was more accurate when non-target <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> stationary than when non-target <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> moved. This context effect was observed when participants were tested both at the original learning perspective and at a novel perspective. In Experiment 2, the arrays of five <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> presented on a rectangular table {{and two of the}} non-target <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> aligned with the longer axis of the table. Change detection was more accurate when the target <b>object</b> <b>was</b> presented with the two <b>objects</b> that <b>were</b> aligned with the longer axis of the table during learning than when the target <b>object</b> <b>was</b> presented with the two <b>objects</b> that <b>were</b> not aligned with the longer axis of the table during learning. These results indicated that the spatial {{memory of a}} briefly viewed layout has interobject spatial relations represented and utilizes an allocentric reference direction.

5|$|While {{patterns}} {{can provide}} more effective crypsis than solid colour when the camouflaged <b>object</b> <b>is</b> stationary, any pattern, particularly one with high contrast, stands {{out when the}} <b>object</b> <b>is</b> moving. Jungle camouflage uniforms were issued during the Second World War, but both the British and American forces found that a simple green uniform provided better camouflage when soldiers were moving. After the war, most nations returned to a unicoloured uniform for their troops. Some nations, notably Austria and Israel, continue to use solid colour combat uniforms today. Similarly, while larger military aircraft traditionally had a disruptive pattern with a darker top over a lighter lower surface (a form of countershading), modern fast fighter aircraft often wear gray overall.|$|E

5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown {{has suggested that}} because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant {{to be affected by}} the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached <b>object</b> <b>is</b> accepted in recent publications.|$|E
5|$|Angular motions (or rotary motions) {{occur when}} an <b>object</b> <b>is</b> around another object {{increasing}} or decreasing the angle.

5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n <b>object</b> <b>is</b> {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale.

5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the <b>object</b> <b>is</b> its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports.
