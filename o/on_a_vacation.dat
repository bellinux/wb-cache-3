25|$|Both {{regular and}} {{irregular}} involvement in sports leisure {{can result in}} heightened SWB. Serious, or systematic involvement in certain leisure activities, such as taekwondo, correlates with personal growth {{and a sense of}} happiness. Additionally, more irregular (e.g. seasonal) sports activities, such as skiing, are also correlated with high SWB. Furthermore, the relationship between pleasure and skiing is thought to be caused in part by a sense of flow and involvement with the activity. Leisure activities, such as meeting with friends, participating in sports, and going on vacation trips, positively correlate with life satisfaction. It may also be true that going <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacation</b> makes our lives seem better, but does not necessarily make us happier in the long term. Research regarding vacationing or taking a holiday trip is mixed. Although the reported effects are mostly small, some evidence points to higher levels of SWB, or happiness, after taking a holiday.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{the show}} {{documented}} the housemates as they {{struggled to find}} and maintain jobs and careers in their new locales, with minimal group activities aside from their day-to-day lives {{in the house and}} their socializing in the city. The only group activity engineered by the producers during the first season was a trip for the three females to Jamaica. By the second season, sending the entire cast <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacation</b> and/or short-term local trip would become the norm for most seasons. By the fifth season, the cast would be given an ongoing, season-long activity, with the Miami cast given startup money and a business advisor to begin their own business. This aspect of the show remained in most subsequent seasons. The assignments are obligatory, with casts assigned to work at an after-school daycare program, a radio station, public-access television station, etc. Beginning with the , a rule was implemented that required a roommate fired from the group job to be evicted from the house and dropped from the cast. 's Greg Halstead and 's Joey Rozmus were evicted from their respective houses after they were fired from their group jobs.
