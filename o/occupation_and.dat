5|$|Despite these {{organs of}} {{military}} <b>occupation,</b> <b>and</b> the orders issued by OKH, regulating {{as they did}} {{a wide range of}} administrative, political, economic, cultural and social matters, the Germans still needed to establish a public administrative body that would implement their directives. It was decided to establish a puppet government for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|Following the Allies' May 1945 victory, the Soviets {{effectively}} occupied Central and Eastern Europe, while strong US and Western {{allied forces}} remained in Western Europe. In Germany and Austria, France, Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States established zones of <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> a loose framework for parceled four-power control.|$|E

5|$|The Achaean League {{was upset}} {{that one of}} its members had {{remained}} under Spartan <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> persuaded the Romans to revisit their decision to leave Sparta's territorial gains intact.

5|$|The {{first public}} Lithuanian {{performance}} of the anthem took place in Vilnius in 1905, and it became the official national anthem in 1919, a year after Lithuania declared its independence. Following the <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in 1940, the anthem was forbidden to be played or sung in public.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that most holiday camps in Britain had been damaged by troop <b>occupation,</b> <b>and</b> the situation was so bad that questions were raised in parliament. Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had been damaged by troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Amid German defeats {{against the}} Russians on the Eastern Front after 1942, the King {{prepared}} {{for the end of}} the war. He ordered the preparation of a document, known as the Political Testament (Testament Politique), which would justify his behaviour under the <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> detail his interventions on behalf of Belgian prisoners of war and deported workers. Leopold however continued to condemn the action of the Belgian government in exile (based in London after October 1940). On 7 June 1944, following D-Day, he was deported to Germany. He was finally liberated by American forces on 7 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Allingham {{was in a}} {{reserved}} <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> {{worked on}} a number of projects. Perhaps his most significant contribution was the design of an effective counter-measure to the German magnetic mines. During his Christmas lunch in 1939 he was called away to help design a system that would neutralise the mines and open the port of Harwich, Essex. Nine days later, he had successfully completed the task.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} {{to establish an}} officer candidate school to train an indigenous officer corps from among Haiti's educated upper class failed due to a reluctance among potential candidates to be seen collaborating with the American <b>occupation,</b> <b>and</b> by {{the perception that the}} methods of American military instruction were demeaning. Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, were recruited from indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month.|$|E

5|$|In June 2012 {{director}} Garin Nugroho {{released a}} biopic on Soegijapranata entitled Soegija. Starring Nirwan Dewanto in the titular role, the film followed Soegijapranata's activities during the 1940s, amidst {{a backdrop of}} the Japanese <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> the war for Indonesian independence. The film, which had a Rp 12 billion (US$1.3 million) budget, sold over 100,000 tickets on its first day. Its launch {{was accompanied by a}} semi-fictional novelisation of Soegija's life, written by Catholic author Ayu Utami. Several non-fiction biographies of Soegija, by both Catholic and non-Catholic writers, were released concurrently.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} in 1946, after the Japanese <b>Occupation</b> <b>and</b> the {{disbanding}} of the Straits Settlements, that the people were allowed to elect members into the Legislative Council. The Council then consisted of at least 22 {{but not more than}} 24 members. Only nine members were elected, out of which the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce were each allotted one seat. The other six seats were to be filled by democratic elections based on universal suffrage. Elections were held {{for the first time on}} 20 March 1948.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur {{handed over}} {{power to the}} Japanese {{government}} in 1949, but remained in Japan until relieved by President Harry S. Truman on 11 April 1951. The San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on 8 September 1951, {{marked the end of}} the Allied <b>occupation,</b> <b>and</b> when it went into effect on 28 April 1952, Japan was once again an independent state. The Japanese subsequently gave him the nickname Gaijin Shogun ("foreign military ruler") but not until around {{the time of his death}} in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon invaded Spain in 1807, {{starting}} the Peninsular War. King Charles IV of Spain abdicated {{in favor of}} his son Ferdinand VII, but Napoleon captured him and appointed his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as king of Spain instead, {{in a series of}} transfers of the Spanish crown known as the abdications of Bayonne. The Spanish people organized Government Juntas to resist against the French <b>occupation,</b> <b>and</b> within months the Junta Central of Seville claimed supreme authority over Spain and the colonies. This situation encouraged the Princess Charlotte of Spain to claim the regency of the Spanish American colonies.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the German occupiers was heavily repressed. Displays of patriotism, such as singing the national anthem, La Brabançonne, or celebrating Belgian National Day were banned and those breaking the rules risked strict prison sentences. Newspapers, books and mail were all tightly censored and regulated. Numerous high-profile Belgian figures, including Adolphe Max, the mayor of Brussels, and the historian Henri Pirenne, were imprisoned in Germany as hostages. The aftermath of the Battle of Verdun in 1916 marked {{a turning point in}} the <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> was followed by more repressive measures by the administration, including the deportation of workers to Germany.|$|E
30|$|Models v and vi {{show that}} {{both male and}} female ex-offenders were worse off in female-dominated <b>occupations</b> <b>and</b> in high-skilled <b>occupations,</b> {{supporting}} the conjectures that the acceptability of ex-offenders in the labor market should be higher in male-dominated <b>occupations</b> <b>and</b> in low-skilled <b>occupations.</b> We do not, however, find support for the conjecture that ex-offenders would be better off in larger cities. The difference in probability of receiving a positive response from employers between male applicants with and without a criminal background was 7 and 9 percentage points larger in female-dominated versus male-dominated <b>occupations</b> <b>and</b> in high-skilled versus low-skilled occupations, respectively. The difference in the probability of receiving a positive response from employers between female applicants with and without a criminal background was 9 and 12 percentage points larger in female-dominated versus male-dominated <b>occupations</b> <b>and</b> in high-skilled versus low-skilled occupations, respectively.|$|R
