5|$|The Day <b>of</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> is {{a public}} holiday in South Africa held {{annually}} on 16 December. The holiday came into effect in 1994 {{after the end of}} apartheid, with the intention of fostering reconciliation and national unity for the country. The date was chosen because it was significant to both Afrikaner and African cultures. The government chose a meaningful date for both ethnic groups because they recognize the need for racial harmony. The celebration of the Day <b>of</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> can take the form of remembering past history, recognizing veteran's contributions, marching and other festivities.|$|E
5|$|The {{last year}} Afrikaners celebrated Day of the Vow was in 1994. The {{transition}} from Day of the Vow to Day <b>of</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> was viewed with mixed emotions for Afrikaners.|$|E
5|$|Elagabalus {{declared}} {{the date of}} the victory at Antioch to be the beginning of his reign and assumed the imperial titles without prior senatorial approval. This violated tradition but was a common practice among 3rd-century emperors nonetheless. Letters <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation</b> were dispatched to Rome extending amnesty to the Senate and recognizing the laws, while also condemning the administration of Macrinus and his son.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse– now art {{director}} of the Sèvres national porcelain factory– offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part a gesture <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation,</b> and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.|$|E

40|$|Background. Inferring an {{evolutionary}} scenario for a gene {{family is a}} fundamental prob- lem both in functional and evolutionary genomics. The gene tree/species tree reconciliation approach has been widely used to address this problem, but mostly in a parsimony framework, that considers only the reconciliation that minimizes the number of duplication and/or loss events. Recently a probabilistic approach has been developed, based on the classical birth-death process, including efficient algorithms for computing posterior probabilities <b>of</b> <b>reconciliations</b> and orthology prediction. Results. We recently proposed an efficient algorithm for exploring the whole space of gene tree/species tree reconciliations, that we adapt here to compute efficiently, either exactly or approximately depend- ing on the space size, the posterior probability <b>of</b> the visited <b>reconciliations.</b> We use this algorithm to analyze the probabilistic landscape of the space <b>of</b> <b>reconciliations</b> for, both, a real dataset of fungal gene families and simulated data. Conclusion. Our results suggest that with realistic gene duplication and loss rates, a very small subset <b>of</b> all <b>reconciliations</b> needs to be explored in order to approximate very closely the posterior probability of the most likely reconciliations. For cases where the posterior probability mass is more evenly dispersed, our method allows to explore efficiently the required subspace <b>of</b> <b>reconciliations...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{siege of}} the castle was started, but through papal {{intervention}} King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels {{the right to buy}} back forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation</b> would last until the 1290s. The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the Statute of Marlborough.|$|E
5|$|Although the Kentucky Constitution {{prohibited}} governors {{from serving}} consecutive terms, Beckham {{announced he would}} seek a full term as governor in 1903. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and was eligible to run. Due to his record <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation</b> and supporting non-controversial reforms, he had no significant opposition in winning his party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates.|$|E
5|$|Edward's body lay at Wareham for a {{year before}} being disinterred. Ælfhere {{initiated}} the reinterment, perhaps as a gesture <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation.</b> According {{to the life of}} Oswald, Edward's body was found to be incorrupt when it was disinterred (which was taken as a miraculous sign). The body was taken to the Shaftesbury Abbey, a nunnery with royal connections which had been endowed by King Alfred the Great and where Edward and Æthelred's grandmother Ælfgifu had spent her latter years.|$|E

5|$|Film records survive of two Gettysburg reunions, {{held on the}} battlefield. At the 50th anniversary (1913), {{veterans}} re-enacted Pickett's Charge in {{a spirit}} <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation,</b> a meeting that carried great emotional force for both sides. At the 75th anniversary (1938), 2500 veterans attended, {{and there was a}} ceremonial mass hand-shake across a stone wall. This was recorded on sound film, and some Confederates can be heard giving the Rebel Yell.|$|E
5|$|In early 1345, Apokaukos and Kalekas {{rejected}} offers <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation</b> {{conveyed by}} two Franciscan monks. Trying {{to bolster his}} waning power, Apokaukos {{began a series of}} proscriptions in the capital, and even ordered a new prison constructed for political prisoners. On 11 June 1345, Apokaukos suddenly decided to inspect the new prison, without being escorted by his bodyguard. The prisoners immediately rose up and lynched him, and his head was severed and stuck on a pole.|$|E
5|$|In the city, Argante and Armida, {{in danger}} {{from a common}} enemy, become {{reconciled}} and prepare their troops for battle. Goffredo's army advances, and battle finally commences. After a struggle for supremacy, Jerusalem falls to Goffredo; Argante is overcome and captured by Rinaldo, while Armida is taken by Eustazio. Rinaldo and Almirena celebrate their love and forthcoming marriage. Armida, accepting her defeat, breaks the wand which {{is the source of}} her evil power and together with Argante embraces Christianity. Goffredo expresses his forgiveness to his beaten foes and sets them free, before victors and vanquished join in a chorus <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Robert E. Lee's United States {{citizenship}} was posthumously {{restored in}} 1975. Davis had been specifically excluded from earlier resolutions restoring rights to other Confederate officials, and a movement arose to restore Davis's citizenship as well.

In signing the law, President Jimmy Carter referred to this as the last act <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation</b> in the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Then, {{following}} a degree <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation</b> with Charles, Rupert obtained {{command of the}} Royalist fleet himself. The intention was to restore Royalist finances by using the remaining vessels of the fleet to conduct a campaign of organised piracy against English shipping across the region. One of the obstacles that this plan faced was the growing strength of the Parliamentary fleet {{and the presence of}} Robert Blake, one of the finest admirals of the period, as Rupert's opponent during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Towson United Methodist Church {{is a large}} United Methodist Church in the {{historic}} Baltimore County, Maryland suburb of Towson.

It was a congregation split asunder in 1861 {{on the eve of}} the American Civil War in a border state of divided loyalties, which eventually reunited and built a church in the post-World War II era of the 1950s, a time <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation</b> and rapid growth by mainline Protestant denominations, especially in the more affluent suburbs.|$|E
5|$|A {{letter from}} Pope Adrian to Charlemagne survives which makes {{reference}} to Offa, but the date is uncertain; {{it may be}} as early as 784 or as late as 791. In it Adrian recounts a rumour that had reached him: Offa had reportedly proposed to Charlemagne that Adrian should be deposed, and replaced by a Frankish pope. Adrian disclaims all belief in the rumour, {{but it is clear}} it had been a concern to him. The enemies of Offa and Charlemagne, described by Adrian as the source of the rumour, are not named. It is unclear whether this letter is related to the legatine mission of 786; if it predates it, then the mission might have been partly one <b>of</b> <b>reconciliation,</b> but the letter might well have been written after the mission.|$|E
