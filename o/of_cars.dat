40|$|The constitutively active {{receptor}} (CAR) transactivates a distal enhancer {{called the}} phenobarbital (PB) -responsive enhancer module (PBREM) found in PB-inducible CYP 2 B genes. CAR dramatically increases its binding to PBREM in livers of PB-treated mice. We {{have investigated the}} cellular mechanism of PB-induced increase <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> binding. Western blot analyses of mouse livers revealed an extensive nuclear accumulation <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> following PB treatment. Nuclear contents <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> perfectly correlate with an increase <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> binding to PBREM. PB-elicited nuclear accumulation <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> {{appears to be a}} general step regulating the induction of CYP 2 B genes, since treatments with other PB-type inducers result in the same nuclear accumulation <b>of</b> <b>CAR.</b> Both immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry studies show cytoplasmic localization <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> in the livers of nontreated mice, indicating that CAR translocates into nuclei following PB treatment. Nuclear translocation <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> also occurs in mouse primary hepatocytes but not in hepatocytes treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Thus, the CAR-mediated transactivation of PBREM in vivo becomes PB responsive through an okadaic acid-sensitive nuclear translocation process...|$|R

40|$|The Coxsackie-adenovirus {{receptor}} (CAR) is {{the primary}} site for adenovirus attachment during infection and {{has been used as}} a delivery mechanism for gene therapies. However, the expression profile of the receptor in cancer, particularly in clinical breast cancer, is poorly reported. This study evaluated the expression <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> in human breast cancers. Frozen sections from breast cancer primary tumours (matched tumour n= 114 and background n= 30) were immunostained with CAR antibody. RNA was reverse transcribed and analysed by quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR). Levels <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> were analysed against the clinical background, with a median follow-up of 72 months. Staining intensity <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> was increased within tumour sections compared to background tissue. Q-PCR revealed significantly elevated levels <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> transcript in breast tumours (32 313 +/- 7067 mean+/-SE vs. background tissue 11 483 +/- 7069, P= 0. 023). CAR expression also increased with grade of tumour. Patients who had tumour metastases also showed elevated levels <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> expression (metastasis: 61 940 +/- 22 749 vs. alive and well 29 655 +/- 8149), however those with local recurrences had reduced levels <b>of</b> <b>CAR.</b> Ductal carcinomas expressed lower levels <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> compared to tumours of other types. Tumours with nodal involvement were also associated with higher levels <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> (node positive 2320 median vs. node negative 1077. 5). Levels <b>of</b> <b>CAR</b> were significantly correlated with long-term survival over a period of 6 years (P= 0. 004, univariate analysis). We conclude that CAR expression is elevated in primary breast cancers.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is normalized despite low levels <b>of</b> <b>CaR</b> and VDR after experimental reversal of uremia. The expression <b>of</b> <b>CaR</b> in parathyroid cultures decreases rapidly. Methylation of promoter regions is often detected during epigenetic downregulation of gene expression. Therefore, using an experimental rat model, we examined changes in methylation levels <b>of</b> parathyroid <b>CaR</b> and VDR promoters in vivo and in vitro. Methods. Uremia was induced by 5 / 6 nephrectomy. Melting temperature profiling <b>of</b> <b>CaR</b> and VDR PCR products after bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA from rat parathyroids was performed. Real-time PCR measured expression <b>of</b> PTH, <b>CaR,</b> VDR, and klotho genes in vitro. Results. Parathyroids from uremic rats had similar low levels of methylation in vivo and in vitro. In culture, a significant downregulation <b>of</b> <b>CaR,</b> VDR, and klotho within two hours of incubation was observed, while housekeeping genes remained stable for 24 hours. Conclusion. In uremic s-HPT and in vitro, no overall changes in methylation levels in the promoter regions <b>of</b> parathyroid <b>CaR</b> and VDR genes were found. Thus, epigenetic methylation of these promoters does not explain decreased parathyroid expression <b>of</b> <b>CaR</b> and VDR genes in uremic s-HPT...|$|R

In order to analyze the fatigue strength <b>of</b> aluminum alloy <b>car</b> body, the Goodman fatigue limit diagram was drawn according to the mechanical characteristics of aluminum alloy.
