5|$|In the 1st United States Congress, {{following}} the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills {{of rights and}} English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689; one of these was a prohibition against quartering troops in private homes. Several revisions to the future Third Amendment were proposed in Congress, which chiefly differed {{in the way in}} which peace and war were distinguished (including the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation,</b> such as unrest, which was neither peace nor war), and whether the executive or the legislature would have the authority to authorize quartering. However, the amendment ultimately passed Congress almost unchanged and by unanimous vote. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.|$|E
5|$|The post-conventional level, {{also known}} as the principled level, is marked by a growing {{realization}} that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.|$|E

25|$|Acceptance: A person's assent to {{the reality}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation,</b> {{recognizing}} a process or condition (often a difficult or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it, protest, or exit.

40|$|I {{argue that}} {{descriptive}} uses <b>of</b> indexicals pose <b>a</b> {{challenge to the}} situation semantics of Kratzer and Berman. Many of the proposed methods of analysis for descriptive indexicals {{are based on the}} situation semantics of Kratzer as supplemented by Berman’s notion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimal <b>situation.</b> <b>As</b> Kratzer observed, not all domains are countable and especially not those that are, {{as is the case with}} some situations, overlapping. Thus the notion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimal <b>situation</b> was initially intended to single out those situations which could serve as a counting domain for quantified sentences. Although minimality works well for timeless situations, I argue that descriptive uses of indexicals requires taking time into consideration and that time, combined with static predicates, poses a challenge to minimality. In (2010) Kratzer introduced the notion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> countable <b>situation</b> intended to replace the notion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimal <b>situation.</b> I argue that this notion fails for cases that involve some static predicates...|$|R

25|$|Intellectualization: A form of isolation; {{concentrating on}} the {{intellectual}} components <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> so as to distance oneself from the associated anxiety-provoking emotions; separation of emotion from ideas; thinking about wishes in formal, affectively bland terms and not acting on them; avoiding unacceptable emotions {{by focusing on the}} intellectual aspects (isolation, rationalization, ritual, undoing, compensation, and magical thinking).|$|E
25|$|Shame {{can be a}} {{contributor}} to those with problems of low self-esteem. Feelings of shame usually occur because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where the social self is devalued, such as a socially evaluated poor performance. A poor performance leads to higher responses of psychological states that indicate {{a threat to the}} social self namely a decrease in social self-esteem and an increase in shame. This increase in shame can be helped with self-compassion.|$|E
25|$|Dein and Littlewood (2008) {{suggest that}} an individual’s prayer {{life can be}} viewed on a {{spectrum}} ranging from immature to mature.

25|$|Organizational {{justice is}} {{conceptualized}} as a multidimensional construct. The four proposed components are distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice. Research also suggests {{the importance of}} affect and emotion in the appraisal of the fairness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> as well as one's behavioral and attitudinal reactions to the situation (e.g., Barsky, Kaplan, & Beal, 2011). Much literature in the industrial/organizational psychology field has examined organizational justice {{as well as the}} associated outcomes. Perceptions of justice influence many key organizational outcomes such as motivation (Latham & Pinder, 2005) and job satisfaction (Al-Zu'bi, 2010).|$|E

These can be situations where a person is making suicidal threats, experiencing threat, witnessing homicide or suicide, or experiencing personal loss. While a person is experiencing a crisis on the individual level {{it is important for}} counselors to primarily assess safety. Counselors are encouraged to ask questions pertaining to social supports and networks, as well as give referrals for long term care.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{show the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automo-tive <b>situation</b> {{analysis}} (ASA) {{to determine the}} current driving <b>situation</b> in <b>a</b> given traffic scenario. To fulfill these we propose a consistent and extendable description <b>of</b> <b>a</b> driving <b>situation,</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> model and <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> analysis. In the situation model, information of in-car sensors is used to build up <b>a</b> representation <b>of</b> the environment around the ego vehicle. On top <b>of</b> the <b>situation</b> model, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> analysis is established to detect the current driving situation according to the given description of driving situation.

25|$|Category (c): {{substantive}} {{legitimate expectation}} – promise having {{the character of}} a contract. The third form manifests itself when a public authority's promise or practice has resulted in a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit or a particular outcome <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation.</b> This type of case is likely to arise when the promise is confined to a few individuals, and thus has {{the character of a}} contract. For situations in this third category, such as the present case, the court must determine whether frustration of the expectation would be so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power by the authority. Unless sufficient justification is present, the authority is obliged to act in accordance with what is legitimately expected of it.|$|E
25|$|During the Olympic Games, a truce, or ekecheiria was observed. Three runners, {{known as}} spondophoroi were sent from Elis to the {{participant}} cities at {{each set of}} games to announce {{the beginning of the}} truce. During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia and legal disputes {{and the use of the}} death penalty were forbidden. The truce was primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games and was, for the most part, observed. Thucydides wrote <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> when the Spartans were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 minae for assaulting the city of Lepreum during the period of the ekecheiria. The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet taken hold.|$|E
25|$|McDaniel et al. (2004) further {{distinguished}} event-based prospective memory into immediate-execute {{tasks and}} delayed-execute tasks. Immediate-execute tasks involve a response {{as soon as}} a particular cue is noticed, while delayed-execute tasks involve delays between the perception of the relevant cue and the performance of the intended action. Delayed-execute tasks more commonly occur in real life when circumstances <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> prevent intermediate action once the cue has been perceived. Research was performed by McDaniel et al. (2004), in which participants completed tasks involving various delays and interruptions between cues and responses. It was demonstrated that correct performance suffered when there was a delay or interruption during a task. However, it was further shown that the use of reminders for participants eliminated the effects of the interruption task.|$|E

25|$|The human OFC {{is among}} the least-understood regions of the human brain; {{but it has been}} {{proposed}} that the OFC is involved in sensory integration, in representing the affective value of reinforcers, and in decision-making and expectation. In particular, the OFC seems to be important in signaling the expected rewards/punishments of an action given the particular details <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation.</b> In doing this, the brain is capable of comparing the expected reward/punishment with the actual delivery of reward/punishment, thus, making the OFC critical for adaptive learning. This is supported by research in humans, non-human primates, and rodents. Human research has focused on neuroimaging research in healthy participants and neuropsychology research in patients with damage to discrete parts of the OFC. Research at the University of Leipzig shows that the human OFC is activated during intuitive coherence judgements.|$|E
25|$|The Lost Souls skill {{system is}} based on a value {{assigned}} to each of the character's attributes, such as strength, dexterity, and charisma. The higher their attribute in a given area, more specialization points are available to allocate for a certain skill. For example, higher dexterity allows the user to allocate more specialty points to the use of swords. The more specialty points that are allocated for a certain skill, the faster the skill can be learned and improved. It also increases the maximum skill level the player can have for that particular skill. The intention of this is to allow for 'heroic' levels of capability to be achievable without the risk <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> arising where everyone becomes equally, superhumanly capable at everything, since the system limits and promotes development of different skills at different times.|$|E

Palestine, as a state, could legitimately call upon the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter to remove Israel from the occupied territories. Palestine, as a state, {{would be able to}} accede to international conventions and bring legal action against Israel on various matters. Palestine could accede to various international human rights instruments, such as the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
