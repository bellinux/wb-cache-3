40|$|Agricultural {{management}} alters {{physical and}} chemical soil properties, which directly affects microbial life strategies and community composition. The microbial community drives important nutrient cycling processes that can influence soil quality, cropping productivity and environmental sustainability. In this research, a long-term agricultural experiment in a subtropical Acrisol was studied in south Brazil. The plots at this site represent two tillage systems, two nitrogen fertilization regimes and three crop rotation systems. Using Illumina high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, the archaeal and bacterial composition was determined from phylum to species level in the different plot treatments. The relative abundance of these taxes was correlated with measured soil properties. The P, Mg, total organic carbon, total N and mineral N were significantly higher in the no-tillage system. The microbial diversity was higher in the no-tillage system at order, family, genus and species level. In addition, overall microbial composition changed significantly between conventional tillage and no-tillage systems. Anaerobic bacteria, such as clostridia, dominate in no-tilled soil as well as anaerobic methanogenic archaea, which were detected only in the no-tillage system. Microbial diversity was higher in plots in which <b>only</b> <b>cereals</b> (oat and maize) were grown.

40|$|Prehistoric groundstone tools {{including}} slabs (metate, mo-pan) and mullers (mano, mo-bang) {{are often}} {{considered to be}} tools {{that were used to}} process cereals in ancient China. Most archaeologists believe that groundstone tools are indicators of an agrarian economy. This study employed starch grain analysis to examine a slab and a muller excavated from the Shangzhai Site (7500 - 7000 cal a BP), Beijing. Identifiable starch grains recovered from the stone tools were classified into 9 genera and 12 species, most of which were from acorns and foxtail millets. Remains from the oak species Q. mongolicus, Q. acuttssima, and Q. dentate were identified as well as a few starch grains from broomcorn (Panicum miliaseum) and bean (Vigna sp.). Other starch grains were from unidentifiable roots and grasses. A variety of starch grains indicates that the grinding stone tools were used to process not <b>only</b> <b>cereals,</b> but also other seeds or roots that had to be ground or husked, thus bringing into question the aforementioned cereal hypothesis. Because the numbers of starch grains from nuts and millets were so large, both gathering and cultivation might have been important economic patterns before 7000 years ago in Beijing area. Moreover, the starch remains are derived from plants that indicate that the paleoclimate of Beijing was wetter and warmer than today's. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009...|$|E

In conclusion, despite an overall improvement in diet quality over time, this study suggests that efforts to further improve diet quality in Australia should focus on increasing consumption of fruit, cereals, and a greater variety of foods.

The following impact categories were considered: climate change, eutrophication, acidification, terrestrial ecotoxicity, cumulative energy demand and land occupation. Several feeds were formulated either to minimize the cost of the formulation (with or without AA utilization), to maximize AA incorporation (i. e. the cost of AA was considered to be similar to that of soybean meal), or to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. For both pig and broiler feeds, calculations were made first using <b>only</b> <b>cereals</b> and soybean meal as main ingredients and then using cereals and several protein-rich ingredients (soybean meal, rapeseed meal and peas). In addition, these calculations were performed using two types of soybean meal (from Brazil, associated with recent deforestation or not). For broiler feeds, two types of maize (from France, irrigated, with mineral fertilization v. not irrigated, with animal manure fertilization) were also tested. Regarding the feeds formulated to minimize cost, incorporation of AA decreased the values for eutrophication, terrestrial ecotoxicity and cumulative energy demand of both pig and broiler feeds, regardless of the base ingredients. Reduction in climate change and acidification due to the incorporation of AA depended {{on the nature of the}} feed ingredients, with the effect of AA incorporation being greater when combined with ingredients with high impacts such as soybean meal associated with deforestation. Feeds formulated to maximize AA incorporation generally had a similar composition to those formulated to minimize cost, suggesting that the costs of AA were not the limiting factor in their incorporation. Feeds formulated to minimize greenhouse gas emissions had the lowest values for climate change and cumulative energy demand, but not for other impacts. Further research is needed to elucidate whether the incorporation of additional AA (tryptophan and valine) along with L-lysine, L-threonine and FU-methionine could decrease on the environmental impacts of pig and broiler feeds further...|$|E

Excessive flooding poses risks to human life and is a major contributor to the poverty and vulnerability of marginalized communities especially women and children in poor families (Douglas [2009]). It is estimated that the flood-affected area has more than doubled in size from about 5 % (19 million hectares) to about 12 % (40 million hectares) of India’s geographic area (World Bank Report [2008]). Adding to these already high risk areas, the climate projections suggest that temperatures, precipitation and flooding, and sea level rise are likely to increase, with adverse impacts on crop yield and farm income in Southeast Asia (Unnikrishnan et al. [2006]; Wassmann et al. [2009]; [INCCA 2010]). Rice in these areas is the major crop providing food for millions of subsistence farming families.

Rice grain sizes are larger in the Lower Yangtze/Hangzhou Bay area than in early Shandong and Taiwan (Fuller 2011). Rice was the <b>only</b> <b>cereal</b> in the Lower Yangtze/Hangzhou Bay area, whereas in Shandong and Taiwan, millets were more prominent. Permanent fields with water management in Hangzhou Bay area sites (Fuller and Qin 2009) are without equivalent in Taiwan or in Shandong, where in contrast, the absence of any traces of permanent fields makes cultivation without water management likely for all three cereals. If the Formosan Neolithic were an offshoot of the Hangzhou Bay area Neolithic, one would expect to find permanent fields and water management in Taiwan and, after nearly two additional millennia of domestication, larger rice grains in Taiwan than in the Hangzhou Bay area. One would also expect to find seeds of paddy field weeds such as Echinochloa crus-galli. Until the twentieth century, Formosan rice was cultivated in non-irrigated upland fields, like the millets. Upland fields, whether for rice, foxtail or broomcorn, are referred to in Formosan languages by means of an indigenous word, often a reflex of Proto-Austronesian *qumah. Irrigated paddy rice cultivation was introduced by Chinese settlers in the past centuries (Imbault-Huart 1893): accordingly there is no old Austronesian word for the irrigated rice field in Taiwan or outside of Taiwan.|$|R

In the present study, we screened coleoptile lengths of 432 indica varieties germinated in two environments (normal and flooded) and found more variation existing in flooded coleoptile length (FCL) rather than in normal coleoptile length (NCL). With the phenotypic data of NCL, FCL and FTI (flooding tolerance index), a genome-wide association study was performed by using 5291 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We detected 2, 11, and 9 significant SNPs under a mixed linear mode for NCL, FCL, and FTI, respectively. Of these SNPs, five were shared by FCL and FTI. Haplotype and phenotype effect analysis on the highest ranking locus indicated one of the two haplotypes contributed to coleoptile elongation remarkably. To better understand the controlling gene of this locus, reported expression profile data was applied. We focused on LOC_Os 06 g 03520, a candidate gene which was highly induced by anoxia (∼ 507 fold). Sequence analysis in 51 varieties demonstrated Hap. 2 associated perfectly with flooding tolerance.
