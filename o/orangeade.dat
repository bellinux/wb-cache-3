They go on it, telling the host Wink that they wish for plane tickets to Springfield. In order to get them, they go through {{physical}} torture (particularly Homer), then must pick them up from a rickety bridge over an active volcano. Lisa is {{able to get the}} tickets, but Wink breaks the bridge and the whole family falls into the volcano, which is actually <b>orangeade</b> with lots of wasabi added. As the Simpsons leave Japan, their plane is briefly confronted by four giant monsters – Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and Rodan before it flies off on the journey to Springfield.|$|E

[...] "Have you not {{observed}} that when liquor {{is drawn from}} a cask--wine, or bitter orange-juice to make <b>orangeade,</b> or even rum, which is by nature white and clear--that it runs thick when the cask is shaken? It is the same with us, señor; our brain is the cask out of which we draw {{all the things we}} say." ...|$|E
6000|$|Si {{had been}} right about the heat. Even in the United States we had a spell of uncommonly hot weather, and down here, under the {{tropical}} sun, it was [...] "sizzling," [...] as Walter expressed it. During the noon hour no one thought of going on deck unless it was absolutely necessary. Refreshments of any kind were at a premium, and when a society known as the Colonial Dames sent {{on a number of}} boxes of oranges and lemons for distribution, the jackies could hardly contain themselves for joy. Cuban sugar was easily obtained, and lemonade and <b>orangeade</b> became the order of the hour.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether the most preferred balance between {{sweet and sour}} taste of children (n = 50, 9. 2 +/- 0. 9 yrs of age) are related to their consumption of fruit. Taste preferences were measured with a rank-by-elimination procedure with seven sweet <b>orangeades</b> that differed in added citric acid (i. e. 0. 009 - 0. 065 M). Fruit consumption was assessed with a questionnaire that was completed by the children's parents. Results showed that boys' but not girls' most preferred balance between sweet and sour taste {{was positively correlated with}} their consumption of fruit: that is, the more added citric acid was preferred the more fruit was consumed. We conclude that preference for high concentrations of citric acid in a sweet context may be associated with the consumption of fruit in boys. In girls, the optimal balance between sweet and sour taste seems to be of less importance; their consumption of fruit may be more influenced by their parents, availability and health related motives.

60|$|The Neapolitans are, of course, furious in traffic. They sell a great deal, {{and very}} boisterously, {{the fruit of}} the cactus, which is about as large as an egg, and which they peel to a very bloody pulp, and lay out, a sanguinary presence, on boards for purchase. It is not good to the uncultivated taste; but the {{stranger}} may stop and drink, with relish and refreshment, the <b>orangeade</b> and lemonade mixed with snow and sold at the little booths on the street-corners. These stands looks much like the shrines of the Madonna in other Italian cities, and a friend of ours was led, before looking carefully into their office, to argue immense Neapolitan piety from the frequency of their ecclesiastical architecture. They are, indeed, the shrines of a god much worshiped during the long Neapolitan summers; and it was the profound theory of the Bourbon kings of Naples, that, if they kept their subjects well supplied with snow to cool their drink, there was no fear of revolution. It shows how liable statesmen are to err, that, after all, the Neapolitans rose, drove out the Bourbons, and welcomed Garibaldi.|$|E

50|$|When a fruit's {{juice is}} too sour, acidic, or rich to consume, it's often diluted {{with water and}} sugar to create an ade (such as lemonade, limeade, cherryade, and <b>orangeade).</b> The ade suffix may also refer to any sweetened, fruit-flavored drink, {{whether or not it}} {{actually}} contains any juice.|$|E

5000|$|It can't {{be denied}} that each approach—Richardson's true-subjectreading and Buttel's poetry-of-the-subject interpretation—bringswith it {{some insight into}} the poem. One might venture that the twoapproaches are in {{principle}} individually necessary and jointlysufficient for full understanding. The ideal joint accountwould not necessarily sign off on every detail of any given individualaccount, and the two approaches might have different weight for differentpoems. For instance, relatively little weight might attach to the [...] "truesubject" [...] of The Revolutionists stop for <b>Orangeade</b> because of its devotion to light-hearted word play. In a poem like this, the poetry of the subject seems to be most of the story.|$|E
50|$|Portokalada (<b>orangeade)</b> and Lemonada (lemonade), since 1971, these {{beverages}} {{were served}} everywhere, in homes, cafes, tavernas and restaurants. They {{were made with}} fresh strained orange juice or lemon juice either mixed with carbonated water or flat mineral water and you added sugar to taste. There were also bottled local versions. In 1989 {{on the island of}} Rhodes there were two companies that made and bottled their own portokalada and lemonada using local oranges, lemons and water. These beverages are still standards today, as of 2014, the difference being that most of the small local companies sold their businesses to the big companies like Fanta etc., thus, greatly changing the quality.|$|E
50|$|At the beginning, {{it was a}} {{handmade}} production, then {{it became}} gradually mechanized and was managed by an all female staff. The first machinery was introduced in 1930 and, since that moment, the amount produced has been increasing. Subsequently, the company began a packaging process for shipping to the recipient countries.In 1961, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. started to produce bottled mineral water and other beverages in the new San Pellegrino Terme factory.In 1932, the Aranciata <b>orangeade</b> variant was introduced. Containing S.Pellegrino as its primary ingredient, the soda added concentrated orange juice. Today, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. also produces various other flavors of carbonated beverages: Limonata (lemonade), Sanbittèr (bitters), Pompelmo (grapefruit), Aranciata Rossa (blood orange), and Chinò (chinotto).|$|E

5000|$|Catawissa Bottling Company {{was formed}} in 1926, when the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture issued a license to bottle soda to Bruce Gregorowicz and his wife Suzanne Wegronovich Gregorowicz. The couple {{purchased}} a creamery in Catawissa and converted it to a bottling facility. The original flavors of soda produced by the company included orange soda, lemon soda, birch beer, root beer, lime cloud, lemon sour, cream soda, strawberry, ginger ale, grape, cherry, sarsaparilla, white birch beer, <b>orangeade,</b> raspberry, teaberry, lemonade, uffri cola, celery cola, pop, and still grape. Flavors added later include golden birch beer, root beer, cream soda, sarsaparilla, cola, and blue birch beer. The company uses cane sugar in their proprietary sodas rather than high fructose corn syrup, and markets them under the brands [...] "Catawissa Sparkling Beverages" [...] and [...] "Big Ben's".|$|E
5000|$|Lo {{accumulated}} enough {{capital to}} buy {{a piece of land}} in Aberdeen and started to build a new plant. However, before it was finished the company had acquired the franchise for Green Spot, a large California-based manufacturer of an orange flavoured soft drink. When the Aberdeen factory opened in 1950, it was used for bottling of Green Spot <b>orangeade</b> while Vitasoy remained in the Causeway Bay factory. Lo also began to sell his products in soft drink type glass bottles. He hired an expert who helped him to the sterilisation technology in producing Vitasoy beverages in capped glass bottles in 1953 after repeated failures. The new technology enabled the beverages to be stored without refrigeration. In the same year, the company began to work with UNICEF to popularise the use of soy beverages in developing countries. At that time, other companies formed a lobby to get the Urban Council to ban Lo from using the word [...] "milk" [...] in his product name. In 1953, Lo reached a compromise which allowed him to retain the Chinese characters in his trademark if he changed the English name from Vitamilk to Vitasoy.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{first major}} plant was in Porth in the Rhondda Valleys, {{the heartland of}} the {{industrial}} coalfield in south Wales. Named the Welsh Hills Mineral Water Factory, the building opened during the 1890s and boasted state-of-the-art bottling machinery and a process to safely clean the glass bottles, allowing for the bottles to be reused after being returned by the customer for a small deposit. The bottles originally used Hiram Codd's globe-stopper with a wire hinged top to keep in {{the pressure of the}} carbonated drinks. Initially the firm produced mineral water and ginger beer, under the brand Thomas & Evans' Welsh Hills soft drinks, in the hope they could gain a foothold in public houses as a non-alcoholic alternative. This was an unsuccessful venture, and Evans was forced to find an alternative market for his drinks. Evans struck upon the idea of selling door-to-door using horse and wagon, and soon his venture became a success, with the company branching into other more child-friendly flavours, such as <b>orangeade,</b> dandelion and burdock, raspberryade and lemonade. [...] By {{the turn of the century}} the company had over 200 salesman delivering Corona drinks by horse-drawn delivery wagon across Wales, and two massive steam-driven vehicles.|$|E
