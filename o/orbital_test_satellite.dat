50|$|Sky 1 {{started on}} 26 April 1982 as Satellite Television Ltd, and was Europe's first ever cable and {{satellite}} channel, originally broadcasting from the <b>Orbital</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite</b> aimed at cable operators all over the continent. At first the station struggled financially, due to disappointing ratings in the countries {{in which it was}} officially available, which in turn led to insufficient advertising revenue and increasing difficulty in covering the high transmission costs.|$|E

40|$|Amplitudes of the in-band {{intermodulation}} {{products that}} arise when two equal-amplitude sinusoids are transmitted through a satellite transponder {{can be found}} from a linear transformation when the transponder characteristic is represented by a polynomial. Conversely, the nonlinearity that produces the intermodulation levels measured in a two-tone test can be found from the inverse transformation. As an application, the bandpass nonlinearity is deduced that gives rise to two-tone IM amplitudes that were measured during <b>orbital</b> <b>tests</b> of a <b>satellite</b> transponder, and compared with the measured bandpass characteristic...|$|R
50|$|In October 1981, SATV began test {{transmissions}} on the <b>Orbital</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite</b> {{after the}} European Space Agency allowed {{the company to}} test the satellite {{for the use of}} commercial television, with an hour of light entertainment in English each night. While at first the island of Malta was its official target, it had a wide, pan-European footprint. However, the low-powered satellite forced it to broadcast to cable systems rather than directly to individual satellite dishes, which proved to be a losing proposition.|$|E
5000|$|The European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat) was {{originally}} {{set up in}} 1977 as an intergovernmental organisation (IGO) to develop and operate a satellite-based telecommunications infrastructure for Europe. In 1982 Eutelsat decided to start operations of its first TV-channel (Sky Channel or Sky 1) on the <b>Orbital</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite</b> (OTS) in cooperation with ESA (The European Space Agency). This was the first satellite based direct-to-home TV-channel launched in Europe. In 1983 Eutelsat launched its first satellite {{to be used for}} telecommunications and TV distribution ...|$|E
5000|$|European {{satellite}} television plans {{started in the}} late 1960s, when plans were first laid for an experimental satellite. The <b>Orbital</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite</b> was launched using the Delta rocket (then manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, now Boeing) in May 1978 and allowed the necessary testing to allow for Europe's first commercial venture in telecommunications and television. From 1978 to 1981, OTS was successful in illustrating the viability of Ku-Band technology for the continent of Europe. Following the completion of its test programme, excess transponder capacity was leased to SATV. [...] While governments in Britain and other European countries wrestled with the allocation of their channels, Satellite Television played a pioneering role, providing Europe's first satellite-delivered cable TV service.|$|E

50|$|Between 1967 and 1974 he was Director of Programmes and Planning at the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) in Paris, {{which was}} merged in 1975 {{to form the}} European Space Agency (ESA). In early 1975, the Programmes and Planning {{department}} was split into a department for the Communication Satellite Programme (for MAROTS, the maritime navigation satellite, and <b>Orbital</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite,</b> OTS), and a department for Science and Meteosat. Meteosat-1 had been first launched in November 1977, and was controlled by EUMETSAT from 1983 in Darmstadt, Germany. The ground link was to the Fucino Space Centre in Italy, currently run by Telespazio. Darmstadt's European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) had been established by ESRO in September 1967, and currently runs ESA's space missions - its mission control centre.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} towards a {{telecommunications}} program within ESRO {{was made in}} the end of 1966 when the European Conference on Satellite Communications requested that the organisation examine the potential for a European telecom satellite project. Although studies were carried out at this early stage as well as during the subsequent 5 years the ESRO council would not approve research and development activities until 1971 when the first package deal took effect. The delay was due to ESROs rigid decision making structure and the unfavorable political situation which existed among ESRO members at the time. These problems were largely done away with as part of the 1971 policy change which, among other things, outlined a fully voluntary mechanism for application project financing. Under the first package deal ESRO pursued a project to establish a European satellite system by the early 1980s in partnership with the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations and the European Broadcasting Union. ESRO merged with ELDO to form the European Space Agency in 1975 before the first satellite of the effort, the <b>Orbital</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite,</b> would be successfully launched in 1978.|$|E

40|$|The concept {{discussed}} in this report rests {{on the premise that}} the conventional system fails to meet the needs for rapid exchange of the results of research and development in certain areas of applied science and technology: conventional publication involves several handlings of the material, is labour intensive and is therefore slow and expensive. The paper suggests that significant improvements could be made by the use of compatible text-editing systems by authors, referees and publishers, interconnected over computer networks. By creating a master digital record at the outset, many new output options are possible in addition to the conventional journal or report. Examples are new forms of current awareness publications, in the shape of personalized journals and the like, and immediate information retrieval techniques leading to delivery of full texts via the network. To pass full texts through the network will require the use of high-capacity satellite telecommunications, employing small Earth stations. Finally, it is suggested that a programme of studies should be carried out in association with actual experiments using the European Space Agency's <b>Orbital</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite...</b>|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{attitude}} control system of the European Space Agency’s <b>Orbital</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Satellite</b> (OTS) was originally designed for nominal earth pointing with only limited bias capability (of up to 2. 5 ° in pitch and roll) {{which is more than}} adequate to remove earth sensor/wheel misalignments that could be incurred during or following launch. Subsequently, a need was expressed to support off-nominal coverage missions and antenna mapping tests. A method was thus defined that would provide greater repointing capability (up to 4. 6 °) while retaining the accuracy available with the precision infrared sensor. The method is outlined, and the repointing limitations indicated that are inherent to the OTS sensor design (13 ° in roll and 7 ° in pitch). Operations and conditions are stated that enable these extremes to actually be reached. The error budget is presented for the case of antenna mapping, demonstrating that attitude restitution can be made so that beam centre position can be determined to an accuracy of 0. 1 ° half cone angle. The significant advantages of the described method are that only one ground station is required, and that results can be available within 24 hours following completion of the test. Results obtained with OTS are referred to, that support the claims. Finally desirable design modifications are discussed that could allow further increases in repointing capability of future satellites...|$|E
