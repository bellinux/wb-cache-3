40|$|Glutaraldehyde is {{commonly}} used in endoscopy labs to clean and disinfect instruments. It can cause direct irritation of the skin and {{the upper and lower}} airways. Health care workers are also at risk for the development of irritant-induced or sensitizer-induced occupational asthma when exposed to this chemical. Herein, we report on a patient who had frequent exposures to glutaraldehyde over one year while working in an endoscopy lab and developed chronic upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms. Multiple spirometric tests during her evaluation revealed variable results including restrictive pattern with a response to bronchodilators, <b>obstructive</b> <b>pattern</b> with a paradoxic bronchoconstrictive response to bronchodilators, and <b>obstructive</b> <b>pattern</b> with a partial response to bronchodilators. These results indicate that the distribution of inflammation and bronchial responsiveness can vary in a single patient with glutaraldehyde-induced occupational asthma. Therefore, the evaluation may be more difficult than might be expected in patients with occupational asthma, and some patients will need multiple pulmonary function tests to characterize their airway disease...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the severity of ureteral obstruction, diuresis (frosemide-induced) renography {{was carried out in}} addition to conventional renography in 29 patients who had upper urinary tract obstruction. When the conventional renogram showed a normal pattern or a pattern which suggested terminal renal parenchymal damage owing to ureteral obstruction, the renogram pattern was not improved by means of frosemide administration, On the contrary, when the conventional renogram showed other <b>obstructive</b> <b>patterns,</b> improvement of the renogram pattern to various degrees was demonstrated in the diuresis renography. These observations led us to conclude that if in the diuresis renography the <b>obstructive</b> renogram <b>pattern</b> was normalized, thc ureteral obstruction would be mild and that if the renogram <b>pattern</b> still remained <b>obstructive,</b> the ureteral obstruction would be severe with renal function deteriorating rapidly in such cases. We propose that diuresis renography is helpful in estimating the severity of upper urinary tract obstruction and predicting the outcome of renal function impairment in these patients...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Heart failure with {{systolic}} dysfunction occurs frequently. Studies in North America and Germany {{have shown}} a high prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with heart failure. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing and its associated risk factors in French patients with heart failure. METHODS: A total of 316 patients with stable heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction less or equal to 45 % underwent polygraphy prospectively to diagnose sleep apnoea syndrome, defined as an apnoea-hypopnoea index greater or equal to 10 events/h. RESULTS: Mean age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and body mass index were 59 +/- 13 years, 30 +/- 11 % and 28 +/- 6 kg/m(2), respectively. The prevalence of sleep breathing disorder was 81 % (n= 256); 30 % of syndromes were classified as central and 70 % as obstructive. The mean apnoea-hypopnoea index was high (30 +/- 3 events/h) and a large proportion (41 %) of syndromes had an apnoea-hypopnoea index greater or equal to 30 events/h. A central sleep apnoea syndrome pattern was associated with more severe heart failure and a more elevated apnoea-hypopnoea index than an <b>obstructive</b> <b>pattern.</b> The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was lower in women than in men (64 % versus 85 %; chi(2) = 0. 0003) as was its severity (mean apnoea-hypopnoea index 15 +/- 13 events/h versus 27 +/- 19 events/h, p= 0. 0001).

Results: Dyspnea (95 %), cough (86 %) and wheezing (68 %) were the most frequent clinical findings. Spirometry showed significant decrease in all parameters including VC (FVC), FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC, FEF 25 - 75 and FEF 25 - 75 /FVC. The low value of FEV 1 /FVC and FEF 25 - 75 and the increment of RV were in favor of <b>obstructive</b> <b>patterns</b> in 95 % of subjects.

We sought to determine to what extent spirometric restriction {{is associated with}} impaired quality of life. We used data from two large population-based European cohorts: 6698 European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) and 6069 Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA) adult participants. The restrictive pattern was defined as forced expiratory volume in 1  s (FEV 1) /forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥lower limit of normal (LLN) and FVC <LLN; an <b>obstructive</b> <b>pattern</b> was defined as FEV 1 /FVC <LLN independent of FVC. The Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary of quality of life were computed using the Short Form- 36 questionnaire.

Timing of diuretic {{administration is not}} universally standardized in renography. In the present study we compared F- 15, F+ 20 diuretic renography protocols in patient with upper urinary tract dilatation. Methods: From Feb 2004 to Aug 2009, 48 patient were referred with flank pain and pyelocalyceal system dilatation without ureteral dilatation in ultrasonography IVP or retrograde pyelogram, F- 15 and F+ 20 diuretic renal scans with TC-EC(Ethyiene dicysteine) were performed. Renal function data renograms were recorded and patients were undergone conservative or surgical therapy and followed up with physical exams and IVP or diuretic renal scan after 6 months and then we compared the results with two diuretic renal scan protocols. We used marginal homogeneity test to compare renograms and paired t-student test to compare renal function in two protocols. Results: Among 48 cases, 32 were male and 16 were female. Mean age were 17. 8 &plusmn; 23 years. Ultrasound showed pyelocalyceal dilatation without ureteral dilatation, delayed pyelogram. The results were equivocal in 11 cases (22. 91 %) of F+ 20 scans whereas they had complete <b>obstructive</b> <b>pattern</b> in F- 15 scans. 6 cases (12. 58 %) had nonobstructive pattern in F+ 20 but equivocal or <b>obstructive</b> <b>pattern</b> in F- 15 scans.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{respiratory}} {{symptoms in}} asthmatic patients {{are likely to}} be caused by bronchoconstriction, this should be confirmed by spirometry. In this study, our aim was to determine the percentage of asthmatic patients who present with mild respiratory symptoms but fail to show any evidence of bronchoconstriction in spirometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 428 known asthmatic patients (57. 5 % females) participated in the study. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 16 years, known asthmatics for at least 1 year, presenting with mild respiratory symptoms including cough, wheezes, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Patients presenting with moderate or severe asthma exacerbations were excluded from the study. Spirometry measurements were performed according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society. SPSS was used for data analysis. The percentage of patients who did not show any evidence of airway obstruction was calculated. For spirometry variables, mean and standard deviation were calculated. For the categorical variables, Chi-square test was performed to determine statistical significance at alpha= 0. 05. RESULTS: Typical <b>obstructive</b> <b>pattern</b> was found in 38 (or 9 %) of all participants. Evidence of obstruction within small or middle airways was found in all those who showed an <b>obstructive</b> <b>pattern</b> and more than 90 % of those who showed restrictive or mixed patterns. About 11 % of the participants showed a normal spirometric pattern with no evidence of small airway obstruction. Statistical analysis showed an insignificant relation between patterns of spirometry and gender or body mass index of the participants. CONCLUSION: About 11 % of asthmatic patients with mild respiratory symptoms who attended the respiratory clinic have no evidence of bronchoconstriction.

40|$|Background: Despite {{epidemiological}} evidences {{of relationship}} between poor lung function and atherosclerosis, {{the relationship between}} poor lung function and microalbuminuria (MAU), an early surrogate marker of both kidney damage and atherosclerosis, is not well understood. Hence, we plan to investigate the relationship between poor lung function and MAU using multivariate models to adjust for other atherogenic risk factors. Methods: We used data from the 5 th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Poor lung function is determined by spirometric measurement, primarily through estimation of the forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1). Declines in the percent predicted FVC (, 80 %) and in the FEV 1 /FVC ratio (, 0. 7) are defined as restrictive and <b>obstructive</b> <b>patterns,</b> respectively. Urine albumin to urine creatinine levels ratio (UACR) were measured in spot urine samples. MAU was defined as UACR. 30 mg/g. Results: Inverse relationship was observed between lung function and UACR. In an age-adjusted regression model, the regression coefficient (B) of 10 % lower FVC was 11. 09 in men (P = 0. 002), which remained significant after adjustment for SBP, FBG, triglyceride level, BMI, smoking history, and heavy alcohol consumption (B = 7. 52, P = 0. 043). When the restrictive pattern was compared to the normal pattern, the odds ratios (OR) (95 % confidence interval, 95 %CI) for MAU were 1. 90 (1. 32 – 2. 72) in men, after adjustment for age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, triglyceride level, obesity, smoking history...|$|R

The treatment serves to maintain a normal growth, reduce the respiratory workload, and prevent further complications, by trying not to interfer with postnatal lung development. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia may be associated with bronchial hyperreactivity and an <b>obstructive</b> bronchial <b>pattern</b> that may lead to frequent hospital admissions for reactive airway disease in the small child, and contribute to the persistence of chronic lung disease mainly as a new chronic obstructive pulmonary disease phenotype in adulthood...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Carpet factory {{produces}} {{various types}} of dusts and workers occupationally get exposed to them continuously. It has adverse health effects and most notably to the pulmonary functions. Nepal {{is one of the}} carpet exporter developing countries and still does have many factories within Kathmandu valley. However, the health hazards especially the status of pulmonary function of carpet factory workers from Nepal has not been studied. Methods: A cross-sectional comparative study was designed to recruit carpet factory workers and healthy controls to assess their pulmonary functions. A total of 118 subjects (59 males and 59 females) were recruited (60 carpet factory workers and 58 controls). Pulmonary function tests were carried out using Medical International Research Spirolab II portable spirometer. Results: The carpet factory workers had significantly less FEV 1 (90. 37 ± 16. 6 % vs. 103. 89 ± 9. 79 %, p< 0. 001), FVC (87. 78 ± 15. 48 % vs. 102. 81 ± 8. 41 %, p < 0. 001) and PEFR (66. 19 ± 20. 29 % vs. 102. 81 ± 11. 09 %, p < 0. 001) as compared to control group. Similarly the carpet factory workers had significantly higher FEV 1 /FVC ratio (89. 96 ± 6. 42 % vs. 87. 12 ± 4. 58 %, p = 0. 007) as compared to control. Conclusions: Carpet industry dusts exposure adversely affects pulmonary functions among its workers. The findings significant increase in the FEV 1 /FVC ratio and decrease in FEV 1, FVC, and PEFR suggest that the effects are both restrictive and <b>obstructive</b> <b>patterns</b> of lung disease.

30|$|In {{another recent}} study to examine {{reduction}} of adhesive bowel obstruction following surgery for colorectal cancer, 427 subjects were randomized to receive (n[*]=[*] 185) {{or not to}} receive (n[*]=[*] 242) one piece of Seprafilm over the denuded pelvic inlet [38]. Bowel obstruction {{was defined as the}} presence of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention, in combination with a radiologic <b>obstructive</b> bowel <b>pattern.</b> There was no difference in the clinicopathologic parameters or non-obstructive complications between the two groups. However, the incidence of early postoperative small bowel obstruction was less in the Seprafilm treated subjects than in the controls (2.7  % vs. 7.0  %, respectively, p[*]=[*] 0.045). A similar trend which did not reach significance was identified in the later postoperative follow-up period (2  % vs. 4.6  %, respectively).|$|R
