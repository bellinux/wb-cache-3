25|$|Analysts {{concluded}} that Georgian Buk missile systems {{were responsible for}} downing four Russian aircraft—three Sukhoi Su-25 close air support aircraft and a Tupolev Tu-22M strategic bomber—in the 2008 South Ossetia war. U.S. <b>officials</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> Georgia's SA-11 Buk-1M was certainly {{the cause of the}} Tu-22M's loss and contributed to the losses of the three Su-25s. According to some analysts, the loss of four aircraft is surprising and a heavy toll for Russia given the small size of Georgia's military. Some have also pointed out, that Russian electronic counter-measures systems were apparently unable to jam and suppress enemy SAMs in the conflict and that Russia was, surprisingly, unable to come up with effective countermeasures against missile systems it had designed. Georgia bought these missile systems from Ukraine which had an inquiry to determine if the purchase was illegal.|$|E
