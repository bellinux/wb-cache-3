25|$|By the 16th century, {{paintings}} by Joachim de Beuckelaer, Pieter Aertsen and Pieter Bruegel clearly depict the modern waffle form. Bruegel's work, in particular, not only shows waffles being cooked, but fine detail of individual waffles. In those instances, the waffle pattern {{can be counted}} as a large 12x7 grid, with cleanly squared sides, suggesting {{the use of a}} fairly thin batter, akin to <b>our</b> <b>contemporary</b> Brussels waffles (Brusselse wafels).|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{overwhelming}} impact, influence and enduring legacy of The Grammar of Ornament, {{it can be}} {{easy to forget that}} Jones was, during his lifetime, well known to the public for his work as an architect. This skew in <b>our</b> <b>contemporary</b> perception of Jones's work is made particularly acute because many of Jones's built projects have since been demolished or otherwise destroyed – most notably the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, which was lost forever due to a fire in 1936. His most important building was St James's Hall, which was located between Piccadilly and Regent Street and for almost fifty years was London's principal concert hall. Jones was also responsible for two grand shopping emporiums: the Crystal Palace Bazaar and a showroom for Osler’s, the glassware manufacturer, both in the West End. These three buildings all opened within a few years of each other, between 1858 and 1860, but had all been demolished by 1926. Their sumptuous polychromed interiors of cast iron, plaster and stained glass were breathtaking monuments to leisure and consumption.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} emphasized, {{to a level}} {{never before}} seen, the supposed sexual undercurrents {{of the story of}} Titania's infatuation with Bottom after he turns into an ass. Brook was influenced by Jan Kott's study of the play in Shakespeare <b>Our</b> <b>Contemporary,</b> in which Kott notes the phallic properties of the donkey, and argues that Oberon deliberately degrades Titania by exposing her to this monstrous sexuality. In Brook's staging, Bottom entered Titania's bower carried by the fairies, one of whom thrust his upraised arm between Bottom's legs to represent a phallus. In a jab at more traditional stagings, the sequence was accompanied by Mendelssohn's Wedding March, a piece of music originally written to be played as an intermezzo between Acts IV and V, but often used in more genteel productions for the final marriage scene of the play. Despite the disturbing undercurrents of this view of sexuality, many audience members found the play witty and affectionate in its treatment of sex, in tune with the spirit of 1960s permissiveness.|$|E

Walker's authoritative account of the days and events surrounding the TMI accident captures the complexities of the situation, clears up some misconceptions, and discusses the aftermath and implications. According to Barber, Walker provides [...] "thoughtful and sober grounds for the continued debate over the role of nuclear power in <b>our</b> <b>contemporary</b> world".|$|E

2500|$|In most of {{his short}} stories and novels (about Shimi Derbendi), Avshalumov acts as a satirist and humorist. Shimi Derbendi is a common figure of Dagestan’s people and it embodies {{the image of a}} typical {{representative}} of the Tats. For many years, novels about the ingenious Shimi Derbendi were printed on the pages of national newspapers, causing a constant interest in readers. Some of them have been published in the journal Soviet Literature and published abroad into English, German, French and Spanish.

2500|$|Kubrick {{once said}} of his {{decision}} to make a war film: [...] "One of the attractions of a war or crime story is that it provides an almost unique opportunity to contrast an individual or <b>our</b> <b>contemporary</b> society with a solid framework of accepted value, which the audience becomes fully aware of, and {{which can be used}} as a counterpoint to a human, individual, emotional situation. Further, war acts as a kind of hothouse for forced, quick breeding of attitudes and feelings. Attitudes crystallise and come out into the open. Conflict is natural, when it would in a less critical situation have to be introduced almost as a contrivance, and would thus appeared forced or, even worse, false." ...|$|E
60|$|Great men {{are thus}} a collyrium to clear our eyes from egotism, and {{enable us to}} see other people and their works. But there are vices and follies {{incident}} to whole populations and ages. Men resemble their contemporaries, even more than their progenitors. It is observed in old couples, or in persons who have been housemates for a course of years, that they grow alike; and, if they should live long enough, {{we should not be}} able to know them apart. Nature abhors these complaisances, which threaten to melt the world into a lump, and hastens to break up such maudlin agglutinations. The like assimilation goes on between men of one town, of one sect, of one political party; and the ideas of the time are in the air, and infect all who breathe it. Viewed from any high point, the city of New York, yonder city of London, the western civilization, would seem a bundle of insanities. We keep each other in countenance, and exasperate by emulation the frenzy of the time. The shield against the stingings of conscience, is the universal practice, or <b>our</b> <b>contemporaries.</b> Again; it is very easy to be as wise and good as your companions. We learn of <b>our</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> what they know, without effort, and almost through the pores of the skin. We catch it by sympathy, or, as a wife arrives at the intellectual and moral elevations of her husband. But we stop where they stop. Very hardly can we take another step. The great, or such as hold of nature, and transcend fashions, by their fidelity to universal ideas, are saviors from these federal errors, and defend us from <b>our</b> <b>contemporaries.</b> They are the exceptions which we want, where all grows alike. A foreign greatness is the antidote for cabalism.|$|R
