5|$|Burston {{believed}} in personal reconnaissance and {{leading from the}} front. He was {{at the forefront of}} providing the medical arrangements for Operation Compass. He attempted, in the face of equipment shortages, to anticipate medical problems and so far as possible to prevent <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> them. He dispatched Major Ian Murray Mackerras to investigate fly breeding in order to prevent an outbreak of diarrhoea. Burston gave Mackerras a free hand to tackle hygiene problems.|$|E
5|$|Flag of {{convenience}} (FOC) {{is a business}} practice whereby a merchant ship is registered in a country other {{than that of the}} ship's owners, and the ship flies that country's civil ensign. Owners of a ship may register the ship under a flag {{of convenience}} to reduce operating costs <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> the regulations of the owner's country. The closely related term open registry, which describes a ship register that will register foreign-owned ships, also exists.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, private {{companies}} pay for weather forecasts tailored {{to their needs}} {{so that they can}} increase their profits <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> large losses. For example, supermarket chains may change the stocks on their shelves in anticipation of different consumer spending habits in different weather conditions. Weather forecasts can be used to invest in the commodity market, such as futures in oranges, corn, soybeans, and oil.|$|E

5|$|The book's {{criticism}} of Eddy is considerable. She {{is portrayed as}} greedy, uneducated and deceitful, someone who regularly revised her life story and was interested only in making money. The authors produce witness statements from Eddy's childhood alleging that she engaged in repeated fainting spells to gain attention <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> punishment, particularly from her father, and that, as an adult, she developed a habit of appearing to be seriously ill only to recover quickly.|$|E
5|$|The robot {{has several}} {{possible}} responses to any obstacles. These {{will depend on}} its environment (navigation corridor, tarmac area without many obstacles, cluttered indoor environment etc.) {{at the time of}} the encounter with an obstacle. It can stop and wait for a gap in traffic, <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> an obstacle by using a technique based on a spiral, or perform path planning trajectories.|$|E
5|$|Before 1984, {{all three}} contestants {{received}} their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with $0 or a negative score received consolation prizes). This was changed {{in order to}} make the game more competitive, and avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won. From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. The current cash consolation prize is provided by Geico.|$|E

5|$|In Asia, {{the normal}} diet {{includes}} rice and noodles {{as the main}} energy source, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians, will not eat root vegetables <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, {{they appear to be}} just as effective.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} map, players may engage the enemy {{as soon as}} they enter Battle Mode, which uses a pausable {{real-time}} combat system, much like Square's Parasite Eve (1998). In Battle Mode, when the player taps the attack button, a spherical grid appears around Ashley. Individual body parts within this sphere can be targeted. The battle system involves the player chaining different attacks known as Chain Abilities to achieve large combos and deal damage to the enemy. This is done by pressing buttons in timely succession, making combat resemble a rhythm game. In addition to Chain Abilities, Defensive Abilities allow Ashley to reduce or reflect damage <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> status ailments. Ashley also gains Break Arts, which exchange his hit points (HP) for increased damage.|$|E
5|$|The party's {{activities}} {{alternate between}} {{events in the}} real world and exploration through dungeons in the Idolospheres, each designed around a specific theme. Unlocked by progressing through the story, the party navigates through multiple floors, activating switches and devices to solve puzzles and advance while avoiding traps and encountering or avoiding enemies represented by sprites on the field. The dungeon map is displayed on the GamePad. Once cleared, dungeons can be replayed at any time. Friendly NPC mirages also act as merchants within dungeons. Battles are triggered when an enemy touches the party touched. The player can attack a Mirage on the field to stun it, allowing them to perform a pre-emptive attack <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> battle.|$|E

5|$|Remember Me {{features}} platforming, {{exploration and}} melee combat. The {{game is played}} as Nilin from a third-person view and introduces the mechanic of memory remixing: entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them. Players accomplish this by replaying a memory and modifying details to change the target's recollection of the outcome. Another key mechanic of the gameplay is stealing memories from certain targets and using points called Remembranes to replay the memory in real-time: this is often needed to proceed through the game <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> hazards otherwise hidden from the player. When the player is low on health, the screen will glitch until a sufficient amount of health is regained. On occasion, Nilin encounters puzzles {{in the form of}} riddles she must solve to unlock doors so as to further progress in the story.|$|E
5|$|The episodes all {{contain a}} {{different}} set of enemies in their levels, which the player must kill, stun, <b>or</b> <b>avoid.</b> These enemies are typically aliens or robots. Levels can also include hazards, such as electricity or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Invasion of the Vorticons features a raygun that Keen can use ammo for to kill enemies; Keen Dreams exchanges this for flower power pellets that temporarily stun enemies when thrown, episodes four through six use a stun gun that permanently stuns enemies, and the 2001 Commander Keen has a stun gun that temporarily stuns enemies unless they are then killed with a pogo jump. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, collectable items that award an extra life beginning with episode four, and items that grant an instant extra life.|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the episodes}} contain a {{different}} set of enemies in their levels, which the player must stun <b>or</b> <b>avoid.</b> The first episode contains a variety of alien creatures, including large slugs, giant bouncing mushrooms, and flying bats, while the second contains different types of robots and alien energy beings. Levels can also include hazards, such as dart traps or fire; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. The episodes feature three difficulty settings, which change the number and types of enemies present. While Vorticons contained a raygun and the in-between episode Commander Keen in Keen Dreams had pellets that temporarily stunned enemies, Goodbye, Galaxy features a stun gun that knocks out most enemies permanently using ammo found throughout the game. Different enemies take differing numbers of shots to kill, or in some cases are immune. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. The first episode also contains water droplets which award an extra life for every 100 drops, and the second green drinks which do the same. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, and items which instantly grant an extra life.|$|E

5|$|Their engagement, {{announced}} in May 1901, was unexpected {{by family and}} friends, as Peter had shown no prior interest in women, and members of society assumed he was homosexual. At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901, Olga married 33-year-old Peter. After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg palace on the Field of Mars. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while her husband left for a gambling club returning the next morning. Their marriage remained unconsummated, and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his ambitious mother. Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, the Dowager Empress, <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> marriage into a foreign court. The couple initially lived with her in laws Alexander Petrovich and Eugénie Maximilianovna of Oldenburg. It was not an harmonious arrangement as Peter's parents, both well known for their philanthropic work, berated their only son for his laziness. Eugénie, {{a close friend of}} the Dowager Empress, showered her daughter-in-law with gifts including a ruby tiara that had been a present to Joséphine de Beauharnais from Napoleon, but Olga took a dislike towards her mother-in-law. A few weeks after the wedding, Olga and her husband traveled to Biarritz, France, from where they sailed to Sorrento, Italy, on a yacht loaned to them by King Edward VII of Great Britain.|$|E
