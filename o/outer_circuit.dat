25|$|The next {{series of}} major archaeological {{excavations}} at Stanwick {{were carried out}} from 1981 to 1986 by a team from Durham University led by Percival Turnbull and Professor Colin Haselgrove. One of their most enigmatic finds was an adult male burial {{at the rear of}} a rampart in the fortifications where a horse's head had been carefully placed upon the body. Turnbull and Haselgrove argued that Stanwick's huge <b>outer</b> <b>circuit</b> of ditches and banks had probably been built first, during the mid-first century AD, and then the inner area sub-divided. They maintained that the six mile (10km) fortification was too long to be easily defended and that its enormous size was intended instead to emphasise the power, prestige and wealth of its owner. They concluded that Stanwick had not been the fortress stronghold of Venutius but was rather the estate of his ex-wife, Queen Cartimandua, and possibly even the original tribal capital of the Brigantes.|$|E
500|$|The {{second phase}} of {{building}} work undertaken by the Hospitallers {{began in the early}} 13thcentury and lasted decades. The outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site, lending the Krak des Chevaliers its current appearance. Standing [...] high, the <b>outer</b> <b>circuit</b> had towers that projected strongly from the wall. While the towers of the inner court had a square plan and did not project far beyond the wall, the towers of the 13th-century outer walls were rounded. This design was new and even contemporary Templar castles did not have rounded towers. The technique was developed at Ch√¢teau Gaillard in France by Richard the Lionheart between 1196 and 1198. The extension to the southeast is of lesser quality {{than the rest of the}} circuit and was built at an unknown date. Probably around the 1250s a postern was added to the north wall.|$|E
60|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>circuit</b> was covered, as a lean-to, {{all round}} his inner, apartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty two angles {{to the top}} posts of the inner house, being about twenty feet distant; {{so that there was}} a space like a walk within the outer wicker wall, and without the inner, near twenty feet wide.|$|E

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} synchronization of two chaotic electronic circuits whose dynamics is relayed {{by a third}} parameter-matched circuit, {{to which they are}} coupled bidirectionally in a linear chain configuration. In a wide range of operating parameters, this setup leads to synchronization between the <b>outer</b> <b>circuits,</b> while the relaying element remains unsynchronized. The specifics of the synchronization differ with the coupling level: for low couplings a state of intermittent synchronization between the <b>outer</b> <b>circuits</b> coexists with one of antiphase synchronization. Synchronization becomes in phase for moderate couplings, and for strong coupling identical synchronization is observed between the outer elements, which are themselves synchronized in a generalized way with the relaying element. In the latter situation, the middle element displays a triple scroll attractor that is not possible to obtain when the chaotic oscillator is isolated. Comment: 7 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

60|$|One {{circumstance}} gave Quentin peculiar trouble, {{which was}} the character and nation of his guide, who, as a heathen and an infidel vagabond, addicted besides to occult arts (the badge of all his tribe), was often looked upon as a very improper guest for the holy resting places at which the company usually halted, and was not in consequence admitted within even the <b>outer</b> <b>circuit</b> of their walls, save with extreme reluctance. This was very embarrassing, for, on the one hand, {{it was necessary to}} keep in good humour a man who was possessed of the secret of their expedition, and, on the other, Quentin deemed it indispensable to maintain a vigilant though secret watch on Hayraddin's conduct, in order that, as far as might be, he should hold no communication with any one without being observed. This of course was impossible, if the Bohemian was lodged without the precincts of the convent at which they stopped, and Durward could not help thinking that Hayraddin was desirous of bringing about this latter arrangement for, instead of keeping himself still and quiet in the quarters allotted to him, his conversation, tricks, and songs were at the same time so entertaining to the novices and younger brethren, and so unedifying in the opinion of the seniors of the fraternity, that, in more cases than one, it required all the authority, supported by threats, which Quentin could exert over him, to restrain his irreverent and untimeous jocularity, and all the interest he could make with the Superiors, to prevent the heathen hound from being thrust out of the doors. He succeeded, however, by the adroit manner in which he apologized for the acts of indecorum committed by their attendant, and the skill with which he hinted the hope of his being brought to a better sense of principles and behaviour, by the neighbourhood of holy relics, consecrated buildings, and, above all, of men dedicated to religion.|$|E
60|$|As for Will Atkins, who was {{now become}} a very industrious, useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such a tent of basket-work as I believe was never seen; it was one hundred and twenty paces round on the outside, as I {{measured}} by my steps; the walls were as close worked as a basket, in panels or squares of thirty-two in number, and very strong, standing about seven feet high; in the middle was another not above twenty-two paces round, but built stronger, being octagon in its form, and in the eight corners stood eight very strong posts; round the top of which he laid strong pieces, knit together with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for a handsome roof of eight rafters, joined together very well, though he had no nails, {{and only a few}} iron spikes, which he made himself, too, out of the old iron that I had left there. Indeed, this fellow showed abundance of ingenuity in several things which he had no knowledge of: he made him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire; he made himself charcoal for his work; and he formed out of the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer upon: in this manner he made many things, but especially hooks, staples, and spikes, bolts and hinges. But to return to the house: after he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he worked it up between the rafters with basket-work, so firm, and thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that his house was as dry {{as if it had been}} tiled or slated. He owned, indeed, that the savages had made the basket-work for him. The <b>outer</b> <b>circuit</b> was covered as a lean-to all round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about twenty feet distant, so that there was a space like a walk within the outer wicker-wall, and without the inner, near twenty feet wide.|$|E
60|$|A {{part of the}} mountain-top is {{occupied}} by the church of St. Margaret, and this was St. Margaret's day. The houses pause roundabout it and leave a grassy slope, planted here and there with lean black cypresses. The contadini from near and far had congregated in force and were crowding into the church or winding up the slope. When I arrived they were all kneeling or uncovered; a bedizened procession, with banners and censers, bearing abroad, I believe, the relics of the saint, was re-entering the church. The scene made one of those pictures that Italy still brushes in for you with an incomparable hand and from an inexhaustible palette when you find her in the mood. The day was superb--the sky blazed overhead like a vault of deepest sapphire. The grave brown peasantry, with no great accent of costume, but with sundry small ones--decked, that is, in cheap fineries of scarlet and yellow--made a mass of motley colour in the high wind-stirred light. The procession halted in the pious hush, and the lovely land around and beneath us melted away, almost to either sea, in tones of azure scarcely less intense than the sky. Behind the church was an empty crumbling citadel, with half-a-dozen old women keeping the gate for coppers. Here were views and breezes and sun and shade and grassy corners to the heart's content, together with one could n't say what huge seated mystic melancholy presence, the after-taste of everything the still open maw of time had consumed. I chose a spot that fairly combined all these advantages, a spot from which I seemed to look, as who should say, straight down the throat of the monster, no dark passage now, {{but with all the}} glorious day playing into it, and spent a good part of my stay at Cortona lying there at my length and observing the situation over the top of a volume that I must have brought in my pocket just for that especial wanton luxury of the resource provided and slighted. In the afternoon I came down and hustled a while through the crowded little streets, and then strolled forth under the scorching sun and made the <b>outer</b> <b>circuit</b> of the wall. There I found tremendous uncemented blocks; they glared and twinkled in the powerful light, and I had to put on a blue eye-glass in order to throw into its proper perspective the vague Etruscan past, obtruded and magnified in such masses quite as with the effect of inadequately-withdrawn hands and feet in photographs.|$|E

60|$|So {{much had}} they {{addicted}} themselves to wicker-work, {{prompted by the}} ingenuity of the Indians, who assisted them, that when I viewed the Englishmen's colonies, they seemed at a distance {{as though they had}} lived like bees in a hive: for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious and sober man, had made himself a tent of basket-work round the outside; the walls were worked in as a basket, in pannels or strong squares of thirty-two in number, standing about seven feet high: in the middle was another, not above twenty-two paces round, but much stronger built, being of an octagonal form, and in the eight corners stood eight strong poles, round the top of which he raised a pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty, I assure you, and joined very well together, with iron spikes, which he made himself; for he had made him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows and charcoal for his work, forming an anvil cut of one of the iron crows, to work upon, and in the manner would he make himself hooks, staples, spikes, bolts, and hinges. After he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he made it so firm between the rafters with basket-work, thatching that over again with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, that his house was as dry {{as if it had been}} tiled or slated. The <b>outer</b> <b>circuit</b> was covered as a lean-to, quite round this inner appartment, laying long rafters from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house, about twenty-feet distant, so that there was a space like a wall between the outer and inner wall, near twenty feet in breadth. The inner place he partitioned off with the same wicker-work, dividing it into six neat apartments every one of which had a door, first into the entry of the main tent, and another into the space and walk that was round it, not only convenient for retreat, but for family necessaries. Within the door of the outer circle, there was a passage directly to the door of the inner house; on either side was a wicker partition, and a door, by which you go into a room twenty-two feet wide, and about thirty long, and through that into another of a smaller length; so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner tent, serving as retiring rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle, and four large warehouses, which went in through one another, two on either hand of the passage that led through the outer door to the inner tent. In short, nothing could be built more ingeniously, kept more neat, or have better conveniences; and here lived the three families, Will Atkins, his companion, their wives and children, and the widow of the deceased. As to religion, the men seldom taught their wives the knowledge of God, any more than the sailors' custom of swearing by his name. The greatest improvement their wives had, was, they taught them to speak English, so as to be understood.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} and report an experimental confirmation of zero-lag synchronization (ZLS) {{in a system}} of three coupled time-delayed piecewise linear electronic circuits via dynamical relaying with different coupling configurations, namely mutual and subsystem coupling configurations. We have observed that when there is a feedback between the central unit (relay unit) and {{at least one of the}} outer units, ZLS occurs in the two outer units whereas the central and outer units exhibit inverse phase synchronization (IPS). We find that in the case of mutual coupling configuration ZLS occurs both in periodic and hyperchaotic regimes, while in the subsystem coupling configuration it occurs only in the hyperchaotic regime. Snapshots of the time evolution of <b>outer</b> <b>circuits</b> as observed from the oscilloscope confirm the occurrence of ZLS experimentally. The quality of ZLS is numerically verified by correlation coefficient and similarity function measures. Further, the transition to ZLS is verified from the changes in the largest Lyapunov exponents and the correlation coefficient as a function of the coupling strength. IPS is experimentally confirmed using time series plots and also can be visualized using the concept of localized sets which are also corroborated by numerical simulations. In addition, we have calculated the correlation of probability of recurrence to quantify the phase coherence.
