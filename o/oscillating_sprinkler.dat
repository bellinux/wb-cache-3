30|$|Bulk density was {{determined}} in three undisturbed soil cores dried at 105 ºC, and total porosity was calculated from particle density and bulk density. Particle density {{was determined}} in ground (< 50  µm) dry soil by the pycnometer method, using toluene as the filling liquid. The aggregate size distribution was determined after {{ten minutes of}} dry shaking in a sieving machine at medium intensity, from the weight fraction of aggregates retained on sieves with mesh size of 2 and 1  mm, the top threshold of clods being 5  mm (Burke et al. 1986). Aggregate stability was determined by wet sieving following the method of Kemper and Rosenau (1986). The aggregate resistance to raindrop impact was determined by evenly spreading 50  g of soil sieved between 4 and 0.25  mm on a sieve of mesh size 0.25  mm. The soil was subjected to 30  min of artificial rainfall simulated by ejecting water at an exit pressure of 0.25  kg cm− 2 from an <b>oscillating</b> <b>sprinkler</b> at 2.5  m high over the soil. The simulated rain had a mean drop diameter 1.25  mm, intensity 45  mm h− 1 and a kinetic energy 14.38  J m 2 mm− 1. From the results of duplicate experiments, the proportion of soil loss was calculated (g m− 2  min− 1).|$|E

50|$|Home lawn {{sprinklers}} {{vary widely}} in their size, cost, and complexity. They include impact <b>sprinklers,</b> <b>oscillating</b> <b>sprinklers,</b> drip sprinklers, and underground sprinkler systems. Small sprinklers {{are available at}} home and garden stores or hardware stores for small costs. These are often attached to an outdoor water faucet and are placed only temporarily. Other systems may be professionally installed permanently {{in the ground and}} are attached permanently to a home's plumbing system. An ingenious domestic sprinkler made by Nomad called a 'set-and-forget tractor sprinkler' was used in Australia in the 1950s. Water pressure ensured that the sprinkler slowly moved across a lawn.|$|R
40|$|Water {{was applied}} to swaths of cut alfalfa forage with <b>oscillating</b> <b>sprinklers</b> to stimulate rain damage to field drying alfalfa hay to {{determine}} the changes in chemical composition, loss of yield, and acceptability of rain damaged hay to sheep. An additional objective was to develop models to estimate yield losses form experimental hay. The experimental hay was prepared with a 2 x 2 x 4 x 4 x 2 factorial design. The factors were two different cuttings (July and September), two width of swath (3. 05 m and 4. 27 m), four times of applying artificial rain (3 h, 8 h, 13 h, and 24 h after cutting), four levels of artificial rain (no rain, 12. 5 mm, 25. 0 mm, and 50. 0 mm), and two applications of artificial rain (initially and repeated 24 h after first application). The hay was dried in favorable weather conditions during the summer season. Fair weather, was observed in the fall season. Chemical composition of the fresh forage {{at each of the}} seasons of cutting was closely comparable. Main factors (cut, swath width, time, level, and application of water) and their respective interactions (cut x swath, cut x time, cut x level, time x level) affected chemical composition and voluntary intake of the experimental hay. Samples were analyzed for dry matter, ash, crude protein, plant cell walls, hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and acid detergent fiber. No significant changes in the chemical composition occurred when the artificial rain was applied on the fresher forage (3 ̆c 3 h after cutting). However, substantial losses were observed after the forage wilted (3 ̆e 13 h after cutting). Plant cell contents (100...|$|R
