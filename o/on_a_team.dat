5|$|Following the season, the Flames signed Regehr {{to another}} five-year {{contract}} extension worth {{a total of}} US$20-million.

Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007–08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in a game, and suffering a deep bruise on his foot while blocking a shot that was initially feared to be a broken bone.|$|E

5|$|Health {{issues in}} American {{football}} comprise {{a large number}} of health risks associated with participating in the sport. Injuries are relatively common in American football, due to its nature as a full-contact game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players can be at a greater risk, while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include strains, sprains, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of mental illnesses like dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In individual leagues like the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a public injury report is published containing all injured players <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>team,</b> their injury and the game-day status of each player.|$|E
5|$|In 2002–03, Parker {{played in}} all 82 regular-season games as San Antonio's {{starting}} point guard <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that was largely revamped from previous years. He improved his regular season statistics, averaging 15.5 {{points per game}} (ppg), 5.3 assists per game (apg) and 2.6 rebounds per game (rpg). Parker's role as the team's playmaker was reflected in his leading the team in assists on 49 occasions. During the 2003 NBA All-Star Weekend, Parker represented the Sophomores in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, and also participated in the inaugural 989 Sports Skills Challenge. In the post season, the Spurs, led by Tim Duncan, defeated the New Jersey Nets 4–2 in the finals, and Parker earned his first NBA championship ring. Despite the victory, Parker struggled with inconsistent play throughout the playoffs, and was often substituted for the more experienced guards Steve Kerr and Speedy Claxton late in the games.|$|E

5|$|In 2007–08, Jovanovski {{recorded}} a career-high 51 points (12 goals and 39 assists), which tied for tenth among League defencemen and led all Coyotes defencemen. It {{was also the}} second-highest total for a defenceman in Coyotes history after Oleg Tverdovsky's 55-point year in 1996–97. Jovanovski's career season included a one-game suspension on December 1, 2007, for a hit {{to the head of}} Minnesota Wild forward Marián Gáborík. Jovanovski also appeared in his second consecutive All-Star Game in 2008. The team continued to struggle, however, as they ranked 12th in the West, eight points out of a 2008 playoff spot. The following season, Jovanovski's offensive production dipped to 36 points in 82 games. Although it was his lowest total since his third season with the Panthers in 1997–98 (not including seasons with major injuries), he still led all Coyotes defencemen in scoring for the third consecutive year. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> basis, he missed the playoffs with Phoenix for the third-straight year, as they finished 13th in the West.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, 1943, SEC {{officials}} met in Nashville in {{an effort}} to bring a full football schedule back for the 1944 season. In order to have enough students eligible to participate <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>team,</b> the SEC changed its eligibility restrictions to allow for any civilian to play as long as they had not played four years of college football or professionally. At that time, Alabama along with Tennessee and Vanderbilt indicated they might reform their respective teams and resume conference play for the 1944 season. On January 12, 1944, all SEC members, with the exceptions of Mississippi and Mississippi State, indicated their intent to field football teams the following fall. On May 19, 1944, every SEC school with the exception of Vanderbilt (who fielded an informal team) agreed to play a full conference schedule the following fall. Football officially returned to Alabama {{for the first time since}} the 1942 season on September 30, 1944, when the Crimson Tide played LSU to a tie in their season opener.|$|E
5|$|Reality TV was {{a popular}} genre of {{television}} programming in the UK in 2002.
