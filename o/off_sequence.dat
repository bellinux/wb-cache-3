50|$|Yellow flag pit stops {{during this}} caution period brought {{one of the}} most pivotal moments of the race. As cars exited the pits, {{previous}} race leader Townsend Bell attempting to gain position contacted with Hélio Castroneves, sending Bell into a spin that collected Ryan Hunter-Reay. Bell and Hunter-Reay would both fall off the lead lap due to the incident, while Castroneves was not greatly affected. During these pit stops, Alex Tagliani and Alexander Rossi elected not to pit, putting them <b>off</b> <b>sequence</b> {{from the rest of the}} field.|$|E
50|$|On lap 104, Castroneves, still <b>off</b> <b>sequence</b> {{from the}} {{previous}} caution, surrendered the lead to make a pit stop, opening up the cycle of green flag stops while handing the lead back to Hunter-Reay. The majority of the field came in around lap 110, with Hunter-Reay resuming the lead with a margin over three seconds to his teammate Rossi. Alonso, Castroneves, and Power rounded out the top five. The gaps were erased on lap 122, when Buddy Lazier lost control of his car in turn 2 and hit the wall, bringing {{an end to the}} former winner's day. During the ensuing caution, Sage Karam's race came to an end when a dead battery caused him to grind to a halt on course.|$|E

50|$|On lap 37, {{the second}} caution {{of the day}} came out when Sébastien Bourdais rolled to a halt on track. Most of the leaders pitted under the caution, but Hélio Castroneves and Conor Daly, who had made their first stops early and went <b>off</b> <b>sequence</b> from the leaders, stayed out, handing Castroneves the lead. On the restart, Daly {{was able to get}} by Castroneves and take the lead, which he held for 14 laps before coming in for his final pit stop. After Castroneves pitted two laps later, Simon Pagenaud resumed the lead and was able to gain enough of an {{advantage}} to not lose it again after his pit stop. Pagenaud took victory by roughly 4.5 seconds over his teammate Castroneves, giving Pagenaud his third consecutive victory and a comfortable lead in the point standings. James Hinchcliffe took the final step of the podium, coming across about half a second after Castroneves. Graham Rahal, despite starting {{at the back of the}} field, finished fourth. Despite fading in the last laps of the race, Conor Daly still placed a respectable sixth, making him the highest finishing rookie in the race.|$|E
5000|$|Point leader Jacques Villeneuve {{set a new}} {{track record}} in qualifying; the eight such {{occurrence}} of the season. Al Unser Jr., starting in Row 4, came in during the parade laps with a flat tire. At the start Americans Eddie Cheever and Scott Pruett touched wheels and collected compatriot Parker Johnstone, who spun off in Turn 4 (the starts at Mid-Ohio {{take place on the}} backstretch, just after Turn 3). Johnstone's day was over before it started. A few laps later, Brazilians Raul Boesel and Andre Ribeiro received stop and go penalties for overtaking under the Turn 4 yellow, the site of Johnstone's accident. Through the first 20 laps only Michael Andretti could match the pace of polesitter Villeneuve, both men several seconds ahead of third placed Maurício Gugelmin. By this time, however, the wicker on Andretti's rear wing came loose, and ultimately {{the left side of the}} wicker flew off. But Andretti stayed on Villeneuve, apparently unaffected by the [...] "wing change". Little Al made his first pit stop oat Lap 23, a bit earlier than the leaders who were negotiating traffic. Pay drivers Hiro Matsushita, Eliseo Salazar, and Carlos Guerrero were not easy for Jacques and Michael to overtake. The duo pitted on Lap 29, with no position change, but Michael made a dramatic pass in Turn 7 (a part of the esses, or the [...] "twisty bits", as they are also called at Mid-Ohio) to take the spot. The pass was not for the lead, however, because rookie Gil de Ferran stayed out for a few more laps on a light fuel load. De Ferran went from 5th to 3rd after his pit stops completed the first round of stops. Soon after pit stops second place Villeneuve reported braking problems, which was later diagnosed as a boiling problem on a very warm and humid day. Rookie Andre Ribeiro was soon very warm when he brought the Tasman car into the pits unscheduled; a fire developed in the rear of the car when the fuel vent stack stuck open allowing fuel to gush out and ignite on the exhaust. De Ferran took second from Villeneuve whose pace had slowed due to concern over the brakes. On Lap 39 Bobby Rahal, the crowd favorite who had moved up from 8th to 4th in the pit stops, tried Villeneuve on the outside of Turn 5. They touched wheels and Rahal was sent into the wall. Neither he nor the crowd were pleased with Villeneuve, who was given enough room according to Rahal.

40|$|HF-induced airglow at 630 nm was {{observed}} by the Digital All-sky Imager, located near Skibotn in Norway, at F-region altitudes above the EISCAT HF facility near Tromsø on 21 February 1999. The transmitter was operated in a 4 -min on, 4 -min <b>off</b> <b>sequence</b> at 4. 04 MHz O-mode with the beam pointing vertically.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{developing}} a DNA sequencing methodology, we theoretically examine the feasibility of using nanoplasmonics to control the translocation of a DNA molecule through a solid-state nanopore and to read <b>off</b> <b>sequence</b> information using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that high-intensity optical hot spots produced by a metallic nanostructure can arrest DNA translocation through a solid-state nanopore, thus providing a physical knob for controlling the DNA speed. Switching the plasmonic field on and off can displace the DNA molecule in discrete steps, sequentially exposing neighboring fragments of a DNA molecule to the pore {{as well as to}} the plasmonic hot spot. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering from the exposed DNA fragments contains information about their nucleotide composition, possibly allowing the identification of the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule transported through the hot spot. The principles of plasmonic nanopore sequencing can be extended to detection of DNA modifications and RNA characterization.

40|$|Ulceration of {{the lower}} limb is a chronic, {{debilitating}} condition affecting an increasing percentage of the adult and elderly populations. Conservative treatment options are limited, and generally result in surgery or amputation. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the feasibility of using intermittent pneumatic compression for the treatment and management of chronic non-healing leg ulcers. The aim was to develop a system capable of improving the healing of leg ulcers of varying causes through improving distal blood flow whilst also being comfortable and easy to use, to encourage patient compliance. Using Doppler ultrasound, it was demonstrated that intermittent pneumatic compression was capable of producing a distal blood flow response in the limb of a healthy volunteer. Further investigations examined the effect on this distal response of altering the cuff design, pressure and cycle duration {{in order to determine the}} optimal compression regime for enhancing the distal circulation the ultimate objective being to use intermittent pneumatic compression to improve the healing of chronic leg ulcers by improving distal blood flow. The optimal sequence involved a 3 -chamber thigh cuff, using a pressure of 60 mmHg and a short sequential cycle which was operated within a 2 minute on and <b>off</b> <b>sequence.</b> The optimal system was investigated for distal blood flow effects in a group of 20 healthy volunteers, and 14 patients with leg ulcers of differing aetiologies. A distal hyperaemic response was achieved during the 2 minutes without compression, consequent upon changes included in the venous circulation during the 2 minutes of compression. A greater response was detected in the patient group as compared with the healthy volunteer group. A 3 month case study of the clinical effects of the new system resulted in the complete healing of the patients long standing non-healing leg ulcer. Further case studies are required to determine the significance of this finding...|$|E

40|$|An {{adaptive}} method of controlling parametric instabilities in laser produced plasmas is proposed. It involves fast temporal modulation of a laser pulse on the fastest instability's amplification time scale, adapting to changing and unknown plasma conditions. These pulses are comprised of on and <b>off</b> <b>sequences</b> having {{at least one}} or two orders of magnitude contrast between them. Such laser illumination profiles are called STUD pulses for Spike Trains of Uneven Duration and Delay. The STUD pulse program includes scrambling the speckle patterns spatially in between the laser spikes. The off times allow damping of driven waves. The scrambling of the hot spots allows tens of damping times to elapse before hot spot locations experience recurring high intensity spikes. Damping in the meantime will have healed the scars of past growth. Another unique feature of STUD pulses on crossing beams is that their temporal profiles can be interlaced or staggered, and their interactions thus controlled with an on-off switch and a dimmer.
