The introduction of radar in the 1930s provided a way to directly determine the distance to an object even at long <b>distances.</b> <b>Navigation</b> systems based on these concepts soon appeared, and remained in widespread use until recently.

40|$|Long <b>distance</b> <b>navigation</b> {{of mobile}} robots is in general based metric maps. Such maps suffer from high memory {{consumption}} and poor scalability. Especially, {{if we consider}} small mobile robots, efficient memory usage is crutial. A navigation strategy, adopted from insect navigation, generates topological maps. Such a topological navigation is memory efficient and easily scalable, in case of memory shortage. In this work, a navigation algorithm for resource limited systems, {{which is based on}} the LTMap, is developed, implemented and evaluated. The LT-Map approach stores landmarks in a tree structure, according to the relation between referring viewframes. The roadmap based navigation system utilizes an omnidirectional camera as input sensor and global image features for landmark identification. The topological algorithm requires no metrical information - only a unit vector towards each landmark is utilized. Different feature tracking algorithms are evaluated and robustification methods are applied. The presented system can generate a map of the current navigated path online and retrace it. Robustness and scalability qualify this approach for long <b>distance</b> <b>navigation</b> of mobile platforms with limited resources. All components and the overall system functionality have been evaluated experimentally and the feasibility of the developed system has been proved...|$|R

The MNPC {{does not require}} many trial runs to achieve long <b>distance</b> <b>navigation.</b> However, in areas where magnetic anomalies occur, trajectory of the robot meanders. If magnetic anomalies occur in a wide range, the robot swerved from the desired path. It is a fatal problem since the MNPC uses a linear magnetic map, that contains only magnetic data on the desired path.|$|R

40|$|Magnetoreception {{can play}} a {{substantial}} role in long <b>distance</b> <b>navigation</b> by animals. I hypothesize that locomotion guided by a magnetic compass sense could {{also play a role}} in short <b>distance</b> <b>navigation.</b> Animals identify mates, prey or other short distance navigational goals using different sensory modalities (olfaction, vision, audition, etc.) to detect sensory cues associated with those goals. In conditions where these cues become unreliable for navigation (due to flow changes, obstructions, noise interference, etc.), switching to a magnetic compass sense to guide locomotion towards the navigational goals could be beneficial. Using simulations based on known locomotory and flow parameters, I show this strategy has strong theoretical benefits for the nudibranch mollusc Tritonia diomedea navigating towards odour sources in variable flow. A number of other animals may garner similar benefits, particularly slow-moving species in environments with rapidly changing cues relevant for navigation. Faster animals might also benefit from switching to a magnetic compass sense, provided the initial cues used for navigation (acoustic signals, odours, etc.) are intermittent or change rapidly enough that the entire navigation behaviour cannot be guided by a continuously detectable cue. Examination of the relative durations of navigational tasks, the persistence of navigational cues, and the stability of both navigators and navigational targets will identify candidates with the appropriate combination of unreliable initial cues and relatively immobile navigational goals for which this hypothetical behaviour could be beneficial. Magnetic manipulations can then test whether a switch to a magnetic compass sense occurs. This hypothesis thus provides an alternative when considering the behavioural significance of a magnetic compass sense in animals...|$|R

France sold their newly constructed pre-dreadnought battleship Tsesarevich to the Russian Imperial Navy in time for it to fight as Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft's flagship at the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904.
