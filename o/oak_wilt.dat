5000|$|After 2005, {{treatment}} goals shifted towards [...] "passive <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> control" [...] on properties {{less than}} 5 acres and, for large acreages, treating to natural barriers or edges, especially when managing northern pin oaks on entisol soils. Passive control means letting the disease burn {{out over a}} few years and allowing native species to take over. Treating to natural barriers means restoring to native forest or savanna species by harvesting out to where <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> can no longer expand via root grafts. All oaks of the species that is infected are logged out, whether they are infected or healthy. Passive <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> control on large acreages creates short and long term problems for oaks. White oak group trees are at risk for infection from nearby sporulating red oak group trees for the short term; re-developing monocultures of oaks that sustain <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> infections for 50-100 more years are long term risks. Treating to natural barriers/edges or cover type changes is by far the best method to use when controlling <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> on large acreages.|$|E
30|$|The mass {{mortality}} of oak trees has been prevalent {{along the eastern}} coast of the Japan Sea since the late 1980 s [1]. This large-scale forest mortality {{is caused by the}} ambrosia fungus, Raffaelea quercivora, which is a symbiotic microorganism carried by the ambrosia beetle, Platypus quercivorus Murayama [2]. The beetle carries the fungus in a specialized fungal storage organ called a mycangium for breeding its larva. The ambrosia beetle bores into the trunk of a dead or <b>wilting</b> <b>oak</b> tree and a brownish yellow coloration is generated around the beetle gallery in the sapwood. The colored part could contain several substances, such as repellents against the beetle, because beetles newly attacking a tree have an inclination to avoid colored parts of the trunk. However, knowledge about the chemical components and the biological function of the colored part is limited.|$|R
5000|$|Petriella setifera {{was first}} {{discovered}} on horse dung by A. Schmidt in Germany 1912. [...] In this discovery, the fungus was categorized {{as a species}} of Microascus. It was later determined as a wood fungus by L. Shigo in 1957 when it was collected from a <b>wilted</b> <b>oak</b> tree in West Virginia. [...] Since the discovery, the fungus {{was found in a}} variety of environments including wood and soil areas. This fungus was renamed under the genus Petriella in 1930 for reasons currently unknown. Further analysis of the fungus concluded there are multiple stages of development, including Schmidt`s discovery of the fungus in teleomorph phase. In 1961 Barron reported on the Sporotrichum and Graphium anamorph stages of the fungus in isolations from soil. A year later, A.L Shigoon reported the fungus in Tokyo and other regions of the globe including the United States. The fungus continues to be found in other regions, classified under P. setifera.|$|R

50|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> {{is similar}} to Dutch elm disease but more controllable. Beetles that carry the <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> fungus do not have chewing mouth parts -and need some other {{creature}} or physical damage to create open wounds - whereas beetles that carry Dutch elm disease do have chewing mouth parts. Prevention is essential, {{as there is no}} permanent cure. To prevent beetle transmission, oaks should never be pruned in the spring months in the east and Midwest or February through June in Texas. Care should be taken to prevent injury to susceptible trees during this period, particularly from construction. If a tree is injured through a storm or accident in the spring, tree paint to cover the wound is advised. Reducing the source of spores is helpful. When an oak has died from <b>oak</b> <b>wilt,</b> trees should be debarked, split or chipped then burned or covered with plastic sheeting to effect composting. Heat from composting should destroy or severely enervate the fungus. Logs from trees infected with <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> should never be moved to unaffected areas, even for firewood.|$|E
5000|$|Before the windstorm, <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> {{could spread}} north at three {{quarters}} of a mile per year and east or west at one and one half miles per year. [...] During the storm, <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> spread at up to 100 miles per hour. In the two years following the 2011 storm, infections were found at new locations in four Minnesota and at least one (Sawyer) of three Wisconsin counties. [...] These 2011 infections have serious ecological/economic impacts, including loss of stumpage and real estate values, and will only get worse if summer (aerial with ground follow up) surveys aren't established as soon as possible.

50|$|Ceratocystis is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Ceratocystidaceae. Several species are {{important}} plant pathogens, causing diseases such as <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> and pineapple black rot.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> affects all oak species, but {{affects the}} two main groups differently. Oaks in North and Central America are sorted into two groups based mostly upon {{porosity}} and corresponding leaf shape. The white oak group have rounded leaf edges and the pores are clogged with tyloses. The red oak group have pointed leaf edges and pores are large and open/not clogged. Because of this difference in porosity, red oak group trees die faster from <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> disease than white oak group trees. Common names of oaks are based upon common folklore or customs, which leads-to black oaks being in the red oak group. In the upper midwest, red oak group trees like black, northern red and northern pin are most threatened-by <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> for two reasons: they die faster and they produce spore mats. White oak group trees rarely produce spore mats, so overland spread of <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> from white oaks is not a problem. Oaks in the red oak group are particularly susceptible and, when infected, generally die {{over the course of}} a single summer. These oaks typically die from the top of the tree down as leaves become a bronze color and fall off the tree. Another symptom is discoloration of the vascular tissues. Brown streaks or spots can be seen under the bark in the sapwood.|$|E
5000|$|It's {{difficult}} for oaks to get infected in mid summer - after July 1 - because of reduced sporulation from red oaks and summerwood cell development. Two factors changed this around on July 1, 2011: the trillions of <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> spores carried in from upwind and the re-opening of oaks' 2011 earlywood cells. The <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> fungus {{is too large}} to fit within the smaller latewood cells, but can move upward through the much larger earlywood cells. This increased the chances of infection to storm damaged oaks 1,000 - 1,000,000 times the usual. Instead of one new infection per 1,500 acres, foresters were seeing one new infection per 10 acres. The manageable level of <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> disease is one infection per 640 acres.One year after the storm, in summer 2012, <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> specialists found 10 - 20 infections per 100 acres both in Rushseba Township, Chisago County Minnesota and at St. Croix State Park [...] in Pine County, Minnesota. Wounding & infecting at ten oaks per 100 acres, one oak per 100 acres or one oak per 200 acres, presents {{a serious threat to}} the oak resource. St. Croix State Park's northern-most infected oak and southern-most infected oak were 10 miles apart. The only way you get that broad of coverage for infection in mid-summer is, huge spore supplies and the re-opening of that years' early wood cells.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> can attack all red oaks, {{including}} the Shumard oak. Other diseases that attack Shumard oaks are various fungi that can grow on the leaves, powdery mildew, canker diseases, and shoestring root.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} oak trees {{caused by the}} fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum. Symptoms vary by tree species, but generally consist of leaf discoloration, wilt, defoliation, and death. The fungus spreads from diseased to healthy trees from insects or by connections between tree roots. Management of the disease historically meant preventing infection by avoiding tree wounds, removing diseased trees and breaking root connections with vibratory plows, trenchers/rocksaws or hoes. Present methods focus on the area of monocultures and restoring correct ecosystems using soils. Fungicide treatments, used in urban areas, are available and are mostly preventative as well. <b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> is an important disease of oak for timber production and of oak trees in urban areas.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012 and 2013, <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> disease showed-up {{in areas}} of east central Minnesota and {{northern}} Wisconsin where {{it had never been}} seen before. The infections appeared to have coincided-with the July 1, 2011 mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) windstorm, which had windspeeds of over 100 mph, because foresters found that first oaks infected were 7-1-11 storm-damaged oaks. They also knew infections happened within 48 hours of storm damage. Approximately 3/4 million acres in Minnesota, possibly 10 times that area for Wisconsin and up to the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, were affected by the storm. Millions of freshly wounded oak trees were now open to infection from trillions of <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> spores carried-in by the storm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> (Ceratocystis fagacearum), a {{vascular}} disease, attacks Chinkapin oak {{and usually}} kills the tree within {{two to four}} years. Other diseases that attack Chinkapin oak include the cankers Strumella coryneoidea and Nectria galligena, shoestring root rot (Armillarea mellea), anthracnose (Gnomonia veneta), and leaf blister (Taphrina spp.).|$|E
50|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> is {{a devastating}} disease, killing trees rapidly {{in a single}} season. It is an {{important}} disease in urban areas where a few oak trees in a homeowner's yard may be of great value. If one tree in the homeowners yard becomes infected it will die. Not only will the homeowner need to pay to remove the dead tree, they will also need to protect {{the rest of the}} oak trees in their yard or face the prospect that nearby trees in their yard will continue to die. Loss of trees from a property can also lead to a decrease in property value. Even if a homeowner is vigilant about pruning at the correct time, storms and construction can damage trees and introduce <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> into a neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|Raffaelea quercivora is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Ophiostomataceae. It causes Japanese <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> disease, and is spread by the ambrosia beetle (Platypus quercivorus). It has small obovoid to pyriform sympodioconidia and slender, long conidiophores. The fungus has been {{isolated}} from the body surfaces and mycangia of the beetle.|$|E
50|$|The {{damage caused}} by these various living and nonliving agents can appear very similar. Even with close observation, {{accurate}} diagnosis can be difficult. For example, browning of leaves on an oak tree caused by drought stress may appear similar to leaf browning caused by <b>oak</b> <b>wilt,</b> a serious vascular disease caused by a fungus, or the browning caused by anthracnose, a fairly minor leaf disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> is a fungal {{caused by}} Ceratocystis fagacearum, {{is a disease}} {{originating}} in eastern Russia. It can slowly or quickly kill an oak tree when the tree reacts to the fungus by plugging its own cambial tissue while attempting to block {{the spread of the}} fungus. This plug prevents the cambium vascular tissue from delivering nutrients and water {{to the rest of the}} plant, which eventually kills it. Red oaks are very susceptible.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{live oaks}} retain their leaves nearly year-round, {{they are not}} true evergreens. Live oaks drop their leaves {{immediately}} before new leaves emerge in the spring. Occasionally, senescing leaves may turn yellow or contain brown spots in the winter, leading to the mistaken belief that the tree has <b>oak</b> <b>wilt,</b> whose symptoms typically occur in the summer. A live oak's defoliation may occur sooner in marginal climates or in dry or cold winters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> (Ceratocystis fagacearum) is a {{potentially}} serious vascular disease of black oak that is widespread throughout the eastern United States. Trees die {{within a few}} weeks after the symptoms first appear. Usually scattered individuals or small groups of trees are killed, but areas several hectares in size may be affected. The disease is spread from tree to tree through root grafts and over larger distances by sap-feeding beetles (Nitidulidae) and the small oak bark beetle.|$|E
5000|$|Northern pin oak (Q. ellipsoidalis) {{susceptibility}} is extreme when monocultures exist. Northern pin oak {{forests are}} typically found on entisol soils (aka barren sands or lakebed sands) in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and these forests are often misidentified as oak savanna.

50|$|Dr. Frank Gouin, Professor Emeritus of Horticulture at the University of Maryland, College Park, {{impressed}} {{both by the}} age {{and size}} of the tree, as well as its unusual resistance to <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> fungus and the gypsy moth, led a successful effort to clone the Wye Oak. The first two cloned saplings were planted at Mount Vernon on April 26, 2002. Another clone was planted on June 6, 2006, in a special ceremony in the remains of the trunk of the original tree. A marker commemorates the event.|$|E
50|$|Transmission via root graft is {{the most}} common means of spread, as trees within as much as 15 m (50 feet) of a diseased tree can be infected. <b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> usually moves from diseased trees to healthy trees through roots that have become {{interconnected}} (root grafts). In this case, spores (also endoconidia) that have been produced inside the tree travel through the vascular tissue. Most root grafts form between oaks of the same species; red oak roots graft more commonly than do white oak roots, and grafts between red and white oaks are very rare.|$|E
50|$|Many {{invasive}} species are spread inadvertently by human activities, such as seeds stuck to clothing or mud transporting firewood, or through ballast water. The government has instituted several different policies related to different pathways the {{invasive species}} may be spread. For example, quarantines on a {{federal and state}} level exist for firewood across the Eastern United States {{in an attempt to}} halt the spread of the emerald ash borer, gypsy moth, <b>oak</b> <b>wilt,</b> and others. Transporting firewood out of quarantine zones can result in a fine of up to $1,000,000 and 25 years in jail, but punishments are usually much lower.|$|E
50|$|Live Oak Decline {{began in}} 2001 when Combs, Ewart, and Watson {{moved into a}} house {{together}} on Live Oak Street in Austin, Texas. The neighbors were not accepting of their partying and late night recording sessions, so the band often joked about being {{the decline of the}} neighborhood's peaceful reputation. Shortly after, the band's name was coined. It has also been implied the name is meant to send an environmental message. Live oak decline is actually another term for <b>oak</b> <b>wilt,</b> a tree disease that can devastate live oak tree populations. A bird has always been the subject of their logos.|$|E
50|$|In April 1973 {{it found}} that Dutch elm disease had been {{imported}} on Rock Elm logs from North America. The disease had first appeared in 1965. The disease had originally been shipped to the North America from Britain in the 1930s. The disease in Britain had then become less known. There were outbreaks of the disease in 1965 in north Gloucestershire and in 1967 in south Essex. Two scientists at the station discovered two strains of the disease. The areas affected were southern Hampshire, north-west Kent, the Severn valley, and Ipswich. The scientists realised that these outbreaks {{could have been prevented}} by controlling imports of logs. It had been assumed that as Britain had the disease in the 1930s that trees would not be affected. By 1984 Dutch elm disease had reached Scotland. Other diseases of trees to be controlled were <b>Oak</b> <b>wilt</b> and Chestnut blight.|$|E
50|$|Sudden oak death (Phytophthora ramorum) is a water mould {{that can}} kill oaks within {{just a few}} weeks. <b>Oak</b> <b>wilt,</b> caused by the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum (a fungus closely related to Dutch elm disease), is also a lethal disease of some oaks, {{particularly}} the red oaks (the white oaks can be infected but generally live longer). Other dangers include wood-boring beetles, as well as root rot in older trees {{which may not be}} apparent on the outside, often being discovered only when the trees come down in a strong gale. Oak apples are galls on oaks made by the gall wasp. The female kermes scale causes galls to grow on kermes oak. Oaks are used as food plants by the larvae of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species such as the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, which can defoliate oak and other broadleaved tree species in North America.|$|E
50|$|In the Lake States, if {{infection}} is {{discovered in a}} tree, a vibratory plow line, commonly called a trench (or better yet, two generally parallel trenches at different distances from the area of risk) may be plowed to a minimum depth of {{four and a half}} feet (54 inches) between it and other potentially susceptible species to prevent root graft disease transmission. Such plowing will sever root grafts that may transmit the disease to neighboring trees. In southern states like Texas, where heavy clay soils are prevalent, rocksaws are commonly used in lieu of vibratory plows. An infected tree should not be cut down before vibratory plowing, because that increases the risk of <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> migrating quickly via roots to nearby trees. Injections of propiconazole, a fungicide, can help prevent transmission as well; as many as a half dozen injections every six months may be required to protect a large red oak near infected trees. Injections every other year may also be used to treat a white oak, if it is not yet greatly affected.|$|E
50|$|The <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> fungus spreads in {{two basic}} ways: {{transfer}} of spores from diseased to healthy trees by insect vectors and {{movement of the}} fungus from a diseased tree to a healthy tree through root grafts. If conditions are right after the oak has wilted and died, spores are produced on fungal mats that form under the bark of the tree. These mats produce asexual spores called endoconidia, which are barrel shaped spores produced in chains. If compatible mating types are present, these mats will also produce sexual spores called ascospores in fruiting structures called perithecia. Certain species of sap beetles are attracted to the fruity smell of these mats. They will visit the mats to feed and breed, thereby picking up the fungal spores. These same beetles are also attracted to the bleeding sap of wounded oak trees and can then deposit the spores picked up from the fungal mats. This method of transmission is important for introducing the fungus into a new area {{it could not have}} reached by transmission via root grafts.|$|E
40|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>wilt,</b> Ceratocystis fagacearum, {{has been}} {{documented}} in the Southern Appalachian region of North Carolina since the early 1950 s. Due to its rapid spread and rate of damage, the North Carolina Forest Resources Division monitored <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> closely by performing annual surveys to both control for and monitor the disease. This project uses the monitoring data to investigate where and how <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> could spread in the near future. Understanding the spatial nature of <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> can help managers target future monitoring and prevention efforts for this particular region. Both spatial and statistical analyses were used, including the Chi-Squared test, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models, and the Mantel test. Results from several tests indicate that <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> prefers specific oak species within the red oak family, {{has the potential to}} spread in Western North Carolina, and spread of <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> by long-range pathogen mechanisms have a higher impact on the transmission of <b>oak</b> <b>wilt</b> than short-range mechanisms...|$|E
