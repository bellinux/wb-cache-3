25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time {{he went back to the}} drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>led</b> to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the theoretical approach behind the InCommonSense system. This approach {{makes use of}} writing conventions on the Web. The theory behind InCommonSense is based on research findings from the fields of linguistics, psychology, HCI, sociology, and information retrieval. The theoretical background for finding and reusing conventions in hypertext is discussed, and the possibilities of extending the system to improve existing hypertext systems and creating new futuristic hypertext meanings (in particular on the Web) are examined Introduction Among the many new things I have learnt in my undergraduate years there was <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>led</b> me to carry on studying.

[...] "Guys have trouble committing and women want us to commit," [...] he explained to authors Adam White and Fred Bronson. [...] "Women want us to admit that we don't want to commit."

60|$|Mrs. Trevennack assented gladly. If {{he wanted}} to fight the devil, it was best at any rate he should be {{out of reach of}} Walter Tyrrel while he did it. And {{it was a good thing}} to get him away, too, from St. Michael's Mount, and St. Michael's Crag, and St. Michael's Chair, and all the other {{reminders}} of his archangelic dignity in the Penzance neighborhood. Why, she remembered with a wan smile--the dead ghost of a smile rather--he couldn't even pass the Angel Inn at Helston without explaining to his companions that the parish church was dedicated to St. Michael, and that the swinging sign of the old coaching house once bore a picture of the winged saint himself in mortal conflict with his Satanic enemy. It was something, at any rate, to get Trevennack away from a district so replete with memories of his past greatness, to say nothing of the spot where their poor boy had died. But Mrs. Trevennack didn't know that <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which <b>led</b> her husband to select Dartmoor this time for his summer holiday was the existence, on the wild hills a little behind Ivybridge, of a clatter-crowned peak, known to all the country-side as St. Michael's Tor, and crowned in earlier days by a medieval chapel. It was on this sacred site of his antique cult that Trevennack wished to fight the internal devil. And he would fight it with a will, on that he was resolved; fight and, as became his angelic reputation, conquer.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} lineage {{is one that}} is {{frequently}} invoked in discussions sur-rounding jazz, and is used by both players in casual contexts and by academics and critics in more formal settings. However, very little {{attention has been paid to}} defining what lin-eage may mean in a jazz context, and to how it might actually function. Beyond a simple chronology of great players and jazz styles, an investigation of lineal traditions in jazz has ramifications for discussions of pedagogy. Using the lineal tradition of pianist Len-nie Tristano and saxophonist Lee Konitz as a case study, this paper considers these issues as well as how lineal traditions may fit with the current institutional model for jazz education. …You study with someone, but while you study you’re listening to records and hearing music, there are outside forces, so you’re never just the product of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> [...] . Which <b>led</b> me to start think-ing about the idea of lineage [...] . who you study with formatively, and what is it that gets passed. What is this thing that constitutes lineage? Is it style? No. Eighth notes? No. Is it the way you com-pose? Well sometimes, but not necessarily. And I began to thin...|$|R
