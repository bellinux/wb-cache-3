5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance is MFR's generic {{term for a}} non-frontal area <b>of</b> <b>low</b> pressure that has organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. The system should be estimated to have wind speeds of less than 28knots (50km/h, 32mph).|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} western coast of Africa on September26, quickly spawning an area <b>of</b> <b>low</b> pressure. Upon {{the formation of}} the low, the wave split into two pieces and a second area <b>of</b> <b>low</b> pressure developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September28. The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October8. A broad area <b>of</b> <b>low</b> pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275miles (440kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, the low remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October13, the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear. The low developed enough convection late on October14 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435mi (705km) southwest of Colima, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 24. It developed into an area <b>of</b> <b>low</b> pressure as it crossed the Atlantic, and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on August 28 while 960mi (1550km) east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

5|$|An area <b>of</b> <b>low</b> {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada {{during the}} 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to {{what is known as}} cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area <b>of</b> <b>low</b> pressure developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale area <b>of</b> <b>low</b> pressure may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions <b>of</b> <b>low</b> CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E

5|$|If enough {{moisture}} exists, thunderstorms {{can form}} along sea breeze fronts that then can send out outflow boundaries.

5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center <b>of</b> <b>low</b> {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone <b>of</b> <b>low</b> pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E
