Broke then also came under heavy fire from Vichy French forces and was forced to withdraw. Broke sank the next day while heading for Gibraltar. Her crew, including Gardner, were rescued by the destroyer HMS Zetland and returned to Algiers, now captured by the Allies, before returning to England on a Dutch liner. The convoy was attacked by a submarine: the escort carrier immediately ahead, , was torpedoed and sank. Gardner had been injured in Algiers, and was rendered deaf in one ear. He was later mentioned in dispatches for his actions.|$|E

It was hoped that either complete surprise would be achieved or that the defenders would support the invasion to the extent at least of refusing to fire on the attackers. However, the Vichy forces opened fire on the ships, damaging them heavily. Malcolm was forced to withdraw, but Broke had better luck. On her third attempt, she sliced through the boom and succeeded in landing her troops under fire on the Quai de Fécamp, four hours after the operation started. Broke continued to receive heavy fire and was forced to withdraw at 10:30. Broke was again hit by shore batteries when withdrawing which compounded earlier damage. She was taken in tow by the destroyer , but sank two days later on 10 November at position 36.50N 00.40E.|$|E

The British 36th Brigade Group from the British 78th Division stood by in floating reserve. Though some landings went to the wrong beaches, this was immaterial because of the extremely low level of French opposition. All the coastal batteries had been neutralized by French resistance, and one French commander openly welcomed the landing Allies. The only fighting {{took place in the}} port of Algiers, where in <b>Operation</b> <b>Terminal,</b> two British destroyers attempted to land a party of U.S. Army Rangers directly onto the dock, in order to prevent the French destroying the port facilities and scuttling their ships. Heavy artillery fire prevented one destroyer from landing but the other was able to disembark 250 Rangers before it too was driven back to sea. The landed troops pushed quickly inland and General Juin surrendered the city to the Allies at 18:00.|$|E
