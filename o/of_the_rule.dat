5|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} principles spring from the basic idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law.

5|$|A thin {{conception}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law {{has generally}} been adopted by the Singapore Government and Members of Parliament from the ruling People's Action Party, as evidenced from the views expressed during a 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law. However, a thicker conception was evinced by the Minister for Law in a speech made during the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association's International Section in Singapore. On the other hand, a thick conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law that encompasses human rights has been adopted {{by a number of}} Government critics, including opposition politicians, and foreign and international organizations such as Human Rights Watch, Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada and the World Justice Project.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> 1905 <b>Rules</b> became {{increasingly}} outdated. They soon sold out, and it {{became increasingly}} difficult to obtain to a complete set <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> with all amendments. In Copenhagen 1953 the French and English texts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> were declared <b>of</b> equivalent official force, and a declaration was approved to prepare a new compilation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> In 1958, an Editorial Committee in London elaborated a completely new version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nomenclatural <b>rules,</b> which were finally published as <b>the</b> first edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ICZN Code on 9 November 1961.|$|R

5|$|In Singapore, {{ensuring}} {{widespread and}} {{equal access to}} justice for Singapore citizens is a constant goal. In this respect, the judiciary takes effort to ensure that both procedural and substantive elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law are fulfilled – firstly, by continually increasing {{the efficiency of the}} courts and legal processes, and secondly, by regularly improving the skills, knowledge and values of and judges.|$|E

5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced the suspension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E
5|$|Between 1200 and 1600 several laws {{emerged that}} {{drastically}} altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing {{all of the}} opponent's pieces. Stalemate was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the stalemate rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the en passant rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see Variations throughout history of castling for different versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule).</b>|$|E
5|$|Joachim III was enthroned in the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of emperor George Terter I (r. 1280–1292). However, soon after that Joachim III refused to acknowledge the emperor's second marriage to Kira Maria because his first wife Maria Terter was still alive. After George Terter divorced Maria in 1279 he sent her and his first born son Theodore Svetoslav as hostages to the Byzantine Empire. The Patriarch refused to allow George Terter I to the church sacraments until he conceded to abandon Kira Maria and remarry his first wife, after he secured her return from Byzantine captivity in 1282.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this {{pamphlet}} is {{to compile}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more recent weather analysis and forecasting rules in a compact form for ready reference; to indicate <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> {{which have been}} imposed by assumptions; end to attempt to evaluate <b>the</b> usefulness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> in accordance with experience. The need for such a pamphlet was thought to exist when it was realized that many texts must be referred {{to in order to}} cover the field even partially; and that many meteorologists use <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> rather blindly without due regard to the original and later assumptions, and to their resultant limitations on <b>the</b> applicability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules.</b> For example, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> quoted in this compilation were derived on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> experience in middle latitudes only; hence judgments as to their usefulness have been based on experience gained in forecasting middle­ latitude weather only. It is doubtful if any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> has more than very limited applicability either in polar or in tropical areas...|$|R

5|$|Many other {{cellular}} automata {{and other}} computational systems {{are capable of}} emulating the behavior of Rule 90. For instance, a configuration in rule 90 may be translated into a configuration into the different elementary cellular automaton Rule 22. The translation replaces each Rule 90 cell by three consecutive Rule 22 cells. These cells are all zero if the Rule 90 cell is itself zero. A nonzero Rule 90 cell is translated into a one followed by two zeros. With this transformation, every six steps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> 22 automaton simulate a single step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> 90 automaton. Similar direct simulations of Rule 90 are also possible for the elementary cellular automata Rule 45 and Rule 126, for certain string rewriting systems and tag systems, and in some two-dimensional cellular automata including Wireworld. Rule 90 can also simulate itself in the same way. If each cell of a Rule 90 configuration {{is replaced by a}} pair of consecutive cells, the first containing the original cell's value and the second containing zero, then this doubled configuration has the same behavior as the original configuration at half the speed.|$|E
5|$|The author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> of Saint Benedict, {{which was}} the {{principal}} monastic code in Western Europe in the early Middle Ages, was Saint Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–550). Under this rule {{the lives of the}} monks were mainly devoted to prayer, together with reading sacred texts and manual work. They lived a communal life and were required to give complete obedience to their abbot. Benedict's achievement was to produce a stable system characterised by moderation and prudence.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} of 1159 {{and the subsequent}} schism shows the necessity of amending the rules concerning papal elections. The decree Licet de evitanda discordia issued by the Third Lateran Council in 1179 abolished the rule of unanimity in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> {{of the majority of}} two thirds. The decree confirmed also that all three orders of the College of Cardinals (bishops, priests and deacons) are equal in the papal elections. Although the practice allowing the participation of cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons on equal rights with cardinal-bishops had been introduced no later than in the papal election, 1118, the decree In Nomine Domini (1059) conferring the special electoral rights on the cardinal-bishops had never been formally revoked up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Another event which {{attracted}} {{much debate}} was the Supreme Court's annulment of the 1946 war crimes conviction of Gregorij Rožman. Rožman was the Catholic bishop of Ljubljana {{who had been}} found guilty of war crimes and treason during World War II {{as a result of}} his collaboration with Italian and German occupation forces. Several attempts during the 1990s to review the trial had failed. This had led to Janša's government changing the law, enabling the religious communities to request a review of trials of their deceased members, something which had previously been reserved only for close relatives. After the Archdiocese of Ljubljana initiated the review, the Supreme Court annulled the 1946 trial on procedural grounds, effectively rehabilitating Rožman, a decision that caused much controversy. This proved harmful for Peterle's campaign, as he was closely associated with the Catholic Church. When asked about the Rožman case in a TV debate, Peterle confined himself to remarking that he was a supporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law, that the war had divided the nation and that Rožman had played some part in that.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{his work}} as a {{barrister}} and judge, Denning was involved in supporting student law societies and other groups; at various times he was Vice-President of Queen's University Belfast Law Society and a patron of the Legal Research Foundation, the United Law Clerks' Society and the Commonwealth Legal Education Association. He also spent time as the Vice-President of the Society of Genealogists, Honorary President of the Council for the Protection of Rural England and Honorary President of the Glasgow University Dialectic Society. From 1950 he acted as an administrator and fund-raiser for Cumberland Lodge. After being made aware of the Le Court charity for invalid ex-servicemen by Geoffrey Cheshire Denning became the chairman of the organisation in 1952. In 1953 he was elected President of Birkbeck College, University of London and on 18 March presented the 1952 Haldane Memorial Lecture on the subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law and the welfare state. In 1964 he was made President of the English Association in recognition of his contributions to English prose. He became Chairman of the Historical Manuscripts Commission in 1962, resigning in December 1982.|$|E

25|$|The plaintiffs {{successfully}} {{argued that}} after Congress adopted <b>the</b> Federal <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Evidence in 1975, Frye {{was no longer}} the governing standard for admitting scientific evidence in trials held in federal court.

Frye was certainly part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal common law of evidence because it was decided almost 50 years before <b>the</b> <b>Rules</b> were enacted.

5|$|Brentwood Academy {{sued the}} {{association}} over this action. Brentwood {{argued that the}} enforcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> constituted state action which they claimed violated the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The school asserted that their due process rights had been violated {{because there were no}} evidentiary hearings to determine the validity of the claim that they inappropriately recruited football players. Further, they argued that the rule violated their freedom of speech because it restricted the ways the Academy could recruit. In July 1998, the District Court agreed with this argument and granted summary judgement to the Academy, while enjoining the association from enforcing the rule. A year later, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the actions of the association did not constitute 'state action'. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari of the case to review this question.|$|E
5|$|Giuseppe Elia Pace, an {{advocate}} and {{close friend of}} Mikiel Anton Vassalli, {{was found guilty of}} treason during the reign of de Rohan and was sentenced for flogging in Valletta followed by a permanent exile out of Malta. Vassalli was imprisoned at the Klistanija at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of the Order of St. John, and was accused of plotting revolutionary ideas during the magistracy of Grand Master Hompesch. Vassalli denied the accusations and remained imprisoned. Meanwhile, he received visits from the father of Fortunato Panzavecchia. While dining together around a table with prison guards, Panzavecchia took notes from conversations he had with Vassalli. These notes shed more light on the life of Vassalli, who after his death became the national Maltese linguistic. Though given a life sentence, he either managed to escape or was released after the expulsion of the Order from Malta.|$|E
5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E
