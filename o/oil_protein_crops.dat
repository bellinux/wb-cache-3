40|$|Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] is {{the number}} one <b>oil</b> and <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> in the United States, but the seed {{contains}} several anti-nutritional factors that are toxic to both humans and livestock. RNA interference technology has become an increasingly popular technique in gene silencing because it allows for both temporal and spatial targeting of specific genes. The objective of this research is to use RNA-mediated gene silencing to down-regulate the soybean gene raffinose synthase 2 (RS 2), to reduce total raffinose content in mature seed. Raffinose is a trisaccharide that is indigestible to humans and monogastric animals, and as monogastric animals are the largest consumers of soy products, reducing raffinose would improve the nutritional quality of soybean. An RNAi construct targeting RS 2 was designed, cloned, and transformed to the soybean genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Resulting plants were analyzed for the presence and number of copies of the transgene by PCR and Southern blot. The efficiency of mRNA silencing was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. Total raffinose content was determined by HPLC analysis. Transgenic plant lines were recovered that exhibited dramatically reduced levels of raffinose in mature seed, and these lines were further analyzed for other phenotypes such as development and yield. Additionally, a precision-fed rooster assay was conducted to measure the true metabolizable energy (TME) in full-fat soybean meal made from the wild-type or transgenic low-raffinose soybean lines. Transgenic low-raffinose soy had a measured TME of 2, 703 kcal/kg, an increase as compared with 2, 411 kcal/kg for wild-type.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{is often}} the most {{limiting}} factor in crop production. Hence, application of fertilizer nitrogen results in higher biomass yields and protein yield and concentration in plant tissue is commonly increased. Nitrogen often affects amino acid composition of protein and in turn its nutritional quality. In cereals, abundant supply of nitrogen decreases the relative proportion of lysine and threonine, thus, reducing the biological value of the protein. Increasing nitrogen supply generally improves kernel integrity and strength, resulting in better milling properties of the grain. In <b>oil</b> seed <b>crops,</b> <b>protein</b> levels are increased upon nitrogen fertilization, whereas oil concentration is decreased. Effects of nitrogen fertilization on oil composition and quality are inconsistent. In sugarbeet production, abundant supply of nitrogen results in a reduction of sucrose concentration per unit fresh matter and {{to an increase in}} impurities (alpha-amino-nitrogen, invert sugars, and lime salts), which negatively affect efficiency of sucrose extraction.

In contrast to many other regions, in Finland climate change could open new opportunities through enabling more diverse cropping systems. It is justified to re-enquire whether the extent and intensity of <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> production are optimized, resources are used efficiently and sustainably, cropping systems are built to be resilient and whether ecological services that <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> provide are utilized appropriately. This paper aims to analyze in a descriptive manner the biological grounds for sustainable intensification of <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> production in Finland. Production security is considered by evaluating the effects of and likelihood for constraints typical for northern conditions, examining historical and recent crop failures and estimating ecosystem services that more extensive introduction of <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> potentially provide for northern cropping systems now and in a changing climate. There is an evident potential to expand <b>protein</b> <b>crop</b> production sustainably {{to a couple of}} times its current area. In general, variability in protein yields tends to be higher for <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> than spring cereals. Nevertheless, protein yield variability was not necessarily systematically higher for Finland, when compared with other European regions, as it was for cereals. <b>Protein</b> <b>crops</b> provide significant ecological services that further support their expanded production. By this means protein self-sufficiency remains unrealistic, but increased production of <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> can be achieved. The expansion of rapeseed and legumes areas also seems to be economically feasible. From the economic viewpoint, an increase in domestic protein supply requires that farmers have economic incentives to a) cultivate protein-rich crops instead of cereals, and b) use them as animal feed instead of imported sources of protein.

They {{play a key role in}} the crop diversification and sustainable intensification of agriculture, particularly in light of new and urgent challenges, such as climate change and food security. In addition, the role of legumes in nutrition has been recognized as a relevant source of plant protein, {{together with}} other benefits for health. Chapters dealing with common bean, lupine, soybean, lentil, cowpea and Medicago are included in this book. Most contributions deal with legumes, but the significant number of papers on different aspects of quinoa gives an idea of the increasing importance of this <b>protein</b> <b>crop.</b> Pseudocereals, such as quinoa and amaranth, are good sources of proteins. Quinoa and amaranth seeds contain lysine, an essential amino acid that is limited in other grains. Nutritional evaluations of quinoa indicate that it constitutes a source of complete protein with a good balance among all of the amino acids needed for human diet, and also important minerals, vitamins, high quality oils and flavonoids. Other <b>protein</b> <b>crops</b> also included in this book are hemp, cotton and cereals (maize, wheat and rice). Although cereals protein content is not high, their seeds are largely used for human consumption. In this book are included articles dealing with all different aspects of <b>protein</b> <b>crops,</b> including nutritional value, breeding, genetic diversity, biotic and abiotic stress, cropping systems or omics, which may be considered crucial to help provide the plant proteins of the future.

Crops were subjected to two phases, three years each, of multiple abiotic stresses by manipulating length of the growing season and population density under typical management practices of each crop in the upper Midwest, USA. In Phase II, crops were rotated to release the additional edaphic stress of no-rotation in Phase I. Nutrient densities were estimated using LECO analyzer (Carbon and Nitrogen) or ICP instrument (Calcium, Copper, Iron, Manganese, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur and Zinc). Comparisons of functional relationships among nutrients were based on statistics (α, β, and R 2) derived from 1000 -permutations using reduced major axis (RMA) regression analyses. Genotypic differences in nutrients functional relationships were modulated, in decreasing order, by Carbon:Nitrogen ratio, stress treatments, and storage macromolecules. Comparisons between the β statistics for each nutrient in Phases I and II suggested that differences in nutrient functional relationships between crop species were significantly larger than differences between genotypes within species. Nitrogen, rather than Carbon content, followed by plant density, but not short growing season, influenced some (Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur, and Zinc) nutrient relationships and their allocations to leaves, stems and seed of crop species. Functional relationships between Copper, Iron, Sulfur and Zinc, at the seed storage macromolecules level in Phase I and II indicated that <b>oil</b> and <b>protein</b> producing <b>crop</b> species {{are more prone to}} larger adverse effects of abiotic stresses than those producing carbohydrates alone or in combination with protein.

The objectives were to (1) determine if cytoplasmic effects were detectable for seed oil concentration, (2) evaluate estimates for heritability and genotypic and phenotypic correlations for seed <b>oil,</b> <b>protein,</b> oil+protein concentration, yield, and 100 -seed weight, (3) characterize genotype x environment interactions for seed oil concentration, (4) perform QTL analyses for seed <b>oil,</b> <b>protein,</b> oil+protein concentration, yield, and 100 -seed weight, and (5) perform a candidate gene analysis in QTL regions to identify putative genes responsible for oil biosynthesis and storage. The results indicated evidence for significant cytoplasmic effects for total oil concentration. The correlations between seed <b>oil</b> and <b>protein</b> concentrations were consistent with other studies, as were heritability estimates for all traits. Results for all four populations showed significant genotype x environment interactions for seed oil concentration, and stability analyses identified individuals that represent Type 1 or Type 2 stability.
