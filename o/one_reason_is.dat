5|$|Several anecdotal stories {{supposedly}} {{explain why}} Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as {{the focal point}} of his pop art. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that he needed a new subject after he abandoned comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of Roy Lichtenstein. According to Ted Carey—one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s—it was Muriel Latow who suggested the idea for both the soup cans and Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E

5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E
5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E
5|$|Unlike a {{significant}} number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with The Jockey Club registry) unless conceived by live cover, the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion. Artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping. The main reason, however, may be economic; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible. As an example, in 2008, the Australian stallion Encosta De Lago covered 227 mares. By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages.|$|E

25|$|Most textual {{critics of}} the New Testament favor the Alexandrian text-type as the closest {{representative}} of the autographs for many reasons. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that Alexandrian manuscripts are the oldest found; {{some of the earliest}} church fathers used readings found in the Alexandrian text. Another is that the Alexandrian readings are adjudged more often to be the ones that can best explain the origin of all the variant readings found in other text-types.|$|E
50|$|Historically the Indian {{peoples of}} the North American {{continent}} rarely joined forces across tribal lines, which were divisions related to distinct language and cultural groups. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> that most tribes were highly decentralized, with their people seldom united around issues.|$|R

50|$|In Germany, {{the coal}} miners {{demonstrated}} their militancy by large-scale strikes in 1889, 1905 and 1912. However, {{in political terms}} the German miners were middle-of-the-road and not especially radical. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> the formation of different unions—Socialist, liberal, radical and Polish—that seldom cooperated.|$|R
25|$|Overall {{the culture}} of Northumberland, as with the north east of England in general, has much {{more in common with}} Scottish Lowland and Northern English culture than with that of Southern England. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that both regions have their {{cultural}} origins in the old Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria, a fact borne out by the linguistic links between the two regions. These include many Old English words not found in other forms of Modern English, such as bairn for child (see Scots language and Northumbria).|$|E
25|$|The computable numbers may {{be viewed}} as the real numbers that may be exactly {{represented}} in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.|$|E

The Hastati were placed at the front for several reasons. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the city of Rome could ill-afford to lose experienced soldiers, so they put the greenest soldiers at the front. If they survived, the Hastati/tus would gain invaluable experience. Another reason is if the newest soldiers succumbed to battle nerves and broke and tried to run, then there were experienced soldiers behind them to stiffen their resolve.|$|E

25|$|In-N-Out Burger has {{resisted}} franchising its operations or going public; <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> {{the prospect of}} quality or customer consistency being compromised by excessively rapid business growth. The company's business practices have been noted for employee-centered personnel policies. For example, In-N-Out {{is one of the}} few fast food chains in the United States to pay its employees more than state and federally mandated minimum wage guidelines – starting at US$11.00 per hour in California, as of May 2017. The In-N-Out restaurant chain has developed a highly loyal customer base, and has been rated as one of the top fast food restaurants in several customer satisfaction surveys.|$|E
25|$|The human sexual {{response}} cycle set {{the foundation for}} studying and categorizing sexual dysfunctions in men and women. There are four main categories of sexual dysfunctions: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasm disorders, and sexual pain disorders. They are still categorized as such in the DSM-IV-TR. Recent research however, suggests that the current model of {{sexual response}} needs to be revised to better treat these dysfunctions. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that there is considerable overlap between sexual dysfunctions in women. One study found that in patients with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), 41% of women {{had at least one}} other sexual dysfunction and 18% had diagnoses in all 3 categories (that is, in desire, arousal, and orgasm disorders).|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that each year about 17,000 children die from diarrhea. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that drinking water quality is often below standards. Some water treatment plants are not maintained properly and are thus inefficient in removing parasites, viruses and other parasitic microorganisms. In 2009, {{a study by the}} Ministry of Health showed that drinking water for half a million people in Asiut was unfit for human consumption. As of June 2011, nothing had been done to address the problem. Chlorination systems of wells, which had been installed years ago because high levels of bacteria had been detected in the groundwater, failed for lack of maintenance and have been shut down so that untreated water is provided to the residents.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> the {{official}} policy of cadre deployment, whereby persons {{loyal to the}} ruling party, the African National Congress, are given jobs in different branches of government. This intransparent process puts party loyalty ahead of competence and demoralises public service employees, according to a 2012 study by the Human Sciences Research Council. Skilled staff are concentrated at the national and provincial levels, {{but there is a}} skills deficit at the municipal level. South Africa does not have a unified civil service, so that there are no uniform standards for hiring and promotion at the municipal level. According to the study, there is also a high level of turnover of middle and senior managers in the civil service, due to stressful working conditions and opportunities for qualified professionals in the private sector.|$|E
25|$|Sweet {{potatoes}} {{became popular}} {{very early in}} the islands of the Pacific Ocean, spreading from Polynesia to Japan and the Philippines. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that they were a reliable crop in cases of crop failure of other staple foods because of typhoon flooding. They are featured in many favorite dishes in Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and other island nations. Indonesia, Vietnam, India, and some other Asian countries are also large sweet potato growers. Sweet potato, also known as kelang in Tulu, is part of Udupi cuisine in South India. Uganda (the second largest grower after China), Rwanda, and some other African countries also grow a large crop which {{is an important part of}} their peoples' diets. The New World, the original home of the sweet potato, grows less than three percent (3%) of the world's supply. Europe has only a very small sweet potato production, mainly in Portugal. In the Caribbean, a cultivar of the sweet potato called the boniato is popular. The flesh of the boniato is cream-colored, unlike the more popular orange hue seen in other cultivars. Boniatos are not as sweet and moist as other sweet potatoes, but many people prefer their fluffier consistency and more delicate flavor.|$|E

40|$|Two natural ideas we {{have about}} {{justification}} are that we are justified by basing our beliefs on good reasons, rather than wishful thinking or blind prejudice, and that justification makes our beliefs objectively likely to be true. Despite their appeal, respecting both of these ideas is impossible if we think that <b>one's</b> <b>reasons</b> for belief <b>are</b> determined entirely by one's psychological states, such as one's beliefs and experiences, and not by how the world is around <b>one.</b> If <b>one's</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> isolated from the world, it seems {{that they could not}} make our beliefs likely to be true. This is why the debate between epistemic internalists, who think that justification is determined just by states of the believer, and externalists, who deny this, seems so intractable. Internalists are motivated by the intuition that justification is determined by the subject's reasons for belief, whereas externalists are motivated by the intuition that justification makes our beliefs objectively likely to be true. I argue that the key to resolving this dispute is to reject the view that <b>one's</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> determined entirely by one's psychological states in favor of the view that <b>one's</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> facts - including facts of the world around one. We can then accept both the idea that justification is a matter of the subject's reasons for belief and the idea that justification makes one's beliefs objectively likely to be true. On this view <b>one's</b> <b>reasons</b> (the facts of the world around us) can make one's beliefs likely to be true. The result is a theory of justification that captures the motivations both of traditional forms of internalism and traditional forms of externalism, while avoiding the characteristic problems those views face...|$|R
