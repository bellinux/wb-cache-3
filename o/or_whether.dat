5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|Authorities {{disagree}} as {{to whether}} Salientia is a superorder that includes the order Anura, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders, but an extinct salamander-like family, the Albanerpetontidae, is now considered part of Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic proto-frog, Triadobatrachus.|$|E

5|$|Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for {{the last}} time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and was ignored, and later wondered whether this was due to combat fatigue <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{forms of}} human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA)especially B46, DR9, DQB1*0303, A2, Bw22, AW19, B17, and DRW8are more common in TPP. Linkage to particular forms of HLA, which plays {{a central role in}} the immune response, might imply an immune system cause, but it is uncertain whether this directly causes TPP <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> it increases the susceptibility to Graves' disease, a known autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|During Sophia's lifetime, {{there were}} various rumours about her alleged incestuous {{relationship}} with her brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who later became the King of Hanover. The Prince Regent supposedly warned his sisters not to be alone {{in the same room}} with the Duke, and Cumberland was deeply unpopular with the British people. It is unclear whether there was truth to these rumours <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> they were circulated by the Duke's numerous political enemies.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{frequently}} remarked, {{that it seems}} to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from reflection and choice, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether, as Bede understood, Sigebert and Eorpwald were brothers, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> {{they shared the}} same mother but not the same father, as was stated by the 12th century chronicler William of Malmesbury.

5|$|The Medway Megaliths can {{be divided}} into two {{separate}} clusters: one {{to the west of the}} River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between 8 and 10 kilometres (5 and 6 miles). The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the Chestnuts Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Kit's Coty House, Little Kit's Coty House, the Coffin Stone, and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> there was a hierarchy in their usage.|$|E
