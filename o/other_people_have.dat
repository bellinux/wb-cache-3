According to the Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America—all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> or <b>other</b> countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>have</b> had their teachers. If <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>have</b> had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam." ...|$|R

25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings {{have done a lot}} to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of the}} experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E

[...] Rachel Kadish, reflecting on her own superimposition of the founding of Israel onto Watership Down, has remarked [...] "Turns out plenty of <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> seen their histories in that book...some people see it as an allegory for struggles against the Cold War, fascism, extremism...a protest against materialism, against the corporate state.

500|$|Gardner was {{diagnosed}} with antisocial personality disorder. [...] In June 1985, Gardner pleaded guilty {{to the murder of}} Otterstrom and received a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. At one point, Gardner threatened to disrupt subsequent court hearings because he was upset over being required to wear a leg brace that would lock if he attempted to escape again. He was advised by guards that it would be to his benefit to behave in front of prospective jurors. District Judge Jay E. Banks instructed the jury, on October 22, 1985, that they had the option of a verdict for the lesser offense of manslaughter if they found Gardner to be under mental or emotional duress when he shot Burdell. The jurors deliberated less than three hours and found Gardner guilty of capital murder. Ultimately sentenced to death, Gardner selected execution by firing squad over lethal injection. Legislators in Utah had eliminated the firing squad as a method of execution in 2004, but convicts who were sentenced before that date, such as Gardner, could still select that option. Since 1976, only two <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been executed by firing squad in the United States, both in Utah: Gary Gilmore and John Albert Taylor. In contrast to Taylor, who said he chose the firing squad to embarrass the state, Gardner's attorney said that his client did not want to attract attention and simply preferred to die this way.|$|E

She assures him {{that there will be}} no other like her. [...] "Miles De Voces" [...] (""), a hip hop track from Buddha's Family (2001), contains simple harmonic progressions, synthesizers, affronted lyrics and a sociopolitical theme while alternating between major and minor key. [...] "La Abusadora" [...] ("The Abuser") originates from Iván Joy's Diamond Hits (2004). While reviewing the compilation Reggaeton Diamond Hits (2006), Steve Leggett, from Allmusic, named the song the highlight of the album. [...] "Aunque La Distancia" [...] ("") was originally included on the compilation release Romances Del Ruido 2 (2003) by Baby Rasta & Gringo as [...] "Llora Mi Corazón" [...] (""). Queen's rap contributes to a hip hop beat accompanied by Gran Omar. It is also known by the name of [...] "Eres Mi Hombre" [...] (""). [...] "Yo Lamento" [...] (Salsa Version), also from Contra La Corriente, is essentially the same track only re-recorded and mixed into salsa with a duration of four minutes and sixteen seconds; the longest on the album and only salsa track. In the song, Queen sings to her friend about loving her friend's man. She tells her that she had never intended to hurt her. Queen assures that she loves her friend, but acknowledges the fact that their friendship was lost. [...] "He looked at me and we started dancing while the music took us away. Dancing, he touched me. My mind wasn't thinking, passion was leading. My friend don't think that I don't love you", she sings.|$|E
