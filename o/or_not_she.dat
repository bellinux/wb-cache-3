5|$|Final Fantasy XIII: Episode I, a short novel set {{immediately}} after XIII, shows Lightning uneasy about whether her battle is over <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>She</b> leaves to save Fang and Vanille, but first gives her blessing to Snow and Serah's marriage. Eventually, Lightning finds herself {{caught in a}} dark void, but she decides to keep moving forward.|$|E
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> was actually dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave her fate open {{in order for the}} audience to debate whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> survived the hotel explosion {{at the end of the}} episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, questioning whether or not Ros survived the hotel explosion.|$|E
60|$|I drew {{a little}} breath of relief. I was {{reckless}} whether <b>she</b> heard it <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> Suddenly <b>she</b> paused.|$|R
50|$|The media, as {{represented}} in the film, has a vindictive nature behind the drive to release a story. The newspaper only publishes conspiracies and disregards the truth. All of these factors don’t help in proving Katharina’s innocence as the film goes on, and it’s clear that the media don’t care if <b>she’s</b> really innocent <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> <b>She’s</b> a story, and that’s her only purpose to them.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{left him}} with a lighter heart. <b>She</b> did <b>not</b> know whether <b>she</b> had been too hard on Clay <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> but <b>she</b> felt that she could trust him.|$|R
5|$|Heureuse Réunion {{responded to}} the cannonade in kind. During the engagement, Gaspard {{repeatedly}} attempted to board Southampton, where his vastly superior numbers could overwhelm the British crew. Yeo was aware of his enemy's intentions, and repeatedly manoeuvered out of the way, his more disciplined and agile vessel easily able to remain out of contact with the overloaded Haitian ship. Within half an hour the highly efficient gunners on Southampton had knocked down the main and mizen masts on Heureuse Réunion, leaving her unable to manoeuvre and vulnerable to repeated pounding at close range. Despite the severe damage the Haitian ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship. The two smaller Haitian vessels {{did not support the}} frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near Petit Goâve to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed Heureuse Réunion to discover whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person who gave the surrender is not known.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> {{broke into the}} house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes {{the names of all}} the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{member of the}} new ensemble was Laura Peverara, followed by Livia d'Arco and Anna Guarini, daughter of the prolific poet Giovanni Battista Guarini. Giovanni wrote poems for many of the madrigals which were set for the ensemble, and choreographed scenes for the balletto delle donne. Judith Tick believes Tarquinia Molza sang with the group, but Anthony Newcomb says she was involved solely as an advisor and instructor. Whether Tarquinia Molza ever performed with them <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>she</b> was ousted from any role in the group after her affair with the composer Giaches de Wert came to light in 1589. Luzzasco Luzzaschi directed and composed music to showcase the ensemble, and accompanied them on the harpsichord. Ippolito Fiorini was the maestro di capella, in charge of the entire court's musical activities. In addition to his duties to the overall court, he accompanied the concerto on the lute. Vittorio Baldini was brought to the court as ducal music printer in 1582.|$|E

Sam said to me, 'That little lady of yours is the slickest {{thing that ever}} came to this town,' he said; and Ma Dawson--I didn't hardly know whether she'd like you <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>she's</b> such a dried-up old bird, but she said, 'Your bride is so quick and bright, I declare, she just wakes me up.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Dolores {{was very}} much surprised, and did <b>not</b> know whether <b>she</b> liked it <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> but <b>she</b> saw her aunt's closed eyes and uplifted hands, {{and she tried to}} follow the example.|$|R

5|$|The series {{opens with}} Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld) and George Costanza (Jason Alexander) seated at Pete's Luncheonette, debating the {{placement}} of one of George's shirt buttons. Jerry tells George about a woman he met in Lansing, Michigan, Laura (Pamela Brull), who is coming to New York, and the two discuss whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> has romantic intentions. The next evening, Jerry tells his neighbor Kessler (Michael Richards) that he thinks he misunderstood the situation with Laura. However, he then receives {{a telephone call from}} Laura, who asks if she can stay overnight at his apartment. Though Jerry agrees, he is still unsure whether or not her visit is intended to be romantic. George and Jerry continue to debate the issue, with Jerry determined to find the true nature of her visit.|$|E
5|$|Torres, {{who was in}} a coma {{the entire}} time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; she had almost died from the {{accident}} in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her near-death experience, but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain Kathryn Janeway permits Torres to put herself in an induced coma, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on Sto-vo-kor (a version of the afterlife similar to the Norse Valhalla) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that Voyager is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{month after}} Genie's {{admission}} to Children's Hospital, Jay Shurley, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Oklahoma and a specialist in extreme social isolation, {{took an interest in}} her case. Shurley noted that Genie's was the most severe case of isolation he had ever studied or heard about, which he maintained more than 20 years later. Over the next year and a half he came on three three-day visits to conduct daily observations and to carry out a sleep study, hoping to determine if Genie was autistic, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> had sustained any brain damage, and whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> was born mentally disabled. Shurley concluded she was not autistic, with which later researchers concurred; he noted that she had a high level of emotional disturbance, but wrote that her eagerness for new stimuli and lack of behavioral defense mechanisms were uncharacteristic of autism.|$|E

5000|$|Episode 2: [...] "Where's Nicole?"Bridget is {{frustrated}} when Nicole {{does not show}} up for work.

Tina and Janjay clash at a meeting. Rachel and Andrew pitch story ideas at a meeting and must compete for a spot in the September issue. Sparks fly when Bridget and Andrew go to a party for charity.|$|R
6000|$|Staniford's meaning {{was clear}} enough to himself; but Lydia paused, {{as if in}} doubt whether he was jesting <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> before <b>she</b> asked, [...] "Why were you riding with her then?" ...|$|R
25|$|Heseltine {{believed}} {{that he would have}} defeated Thatcher if she had contested the second ballot. It has been suggested that he should have withdrawn after weakening her on the first ballot, and that he would have been restored to the Cabinet whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> continued as Prime Minister; he writes that this was never seriously suggested at the time.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable storylines Lofty was {{involved}} with was his marriage to the teenage mother, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Michelle and Lofty's church wedding was a massive target of press speculation before the episodes aired. They wanted to know two things, firstly the design of Michelle's dress, and secondly whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> would jilt Lofty at the altar.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to her European language skills, Alexandra speaks a bit of Cantonese. At {{a press conference in}} 1995, when asked whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> is able to communicate with Prince Henrik in Chinese, she stated that she believes that his Chinese is better than hers. She then clarified that Henrik speaks Mandarin Chinese while she speaks a little bit of Cantonese, which is the dominant language in Hong Kong.|$|E

6000|$|Alice Deringham {{was never}} quite sure whether <b>she</b> looked up <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> but <b>she</b> felt her cheeks glowing and the man's hand tighten on her shoulder. [...] "I--I can't," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What kind of insect?' Alice inquired {{a little}} anxiously. What {{she really wanted}} to know was, whether it could sting <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> but <b>she</b> thought this wouldn't be quite a civil {{question}} to ask.|$|R
25|$|Terris the Terrible, {{as he was}} dubbed, {{amassed a}} 13–2 record for Newark in 1938 while {{completing}} his 18 starts. But he was also at the centre of a controversy, when the Eagles players and staff hinted at a possible sentimental relation between Mrs. Manfrey and McDuffie. While there is no conclusive evidence to support whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> and McDuffie had an affair, Abe Manley promptly traded him to the New York Black Yankees.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Emma, Regina, Hook, and Snow chase {{down the}} beast {{in the woods}} that Emma {{believes}} {{to be the same}} one from the dream, and uses her magic to stop it. When they reach the creature, they are shocked to find a wolf, only to learn from Snow as she put Ruby's cloak on a big bad wolf; it's actually Ruby, who has shown up in the Underworld, but unsure of whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> is still alive. Snow tells Emma that her dream was actually a vision pointing them to Ruby.|$|E
25|$|When Bianca {{realizes that}} she has {{increasing}} romantic feelings for Maggie, she fears it is because Maggie has the same face and body as Frankie. She pushes Maggie into a relationship with Tim Dillon to help her get over the young woman. Maggie, however, ignores Tim, even while {{on a date with}} him and insists on being closer to Bianca. Bianca's forcefulness of pushing Tim and Maggie together does not work out. She later confronts Maggie to define whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> and Maggie are lovers in the making. Maggie says that she loves Bianca, but stresses that she is not in love with her.|$|E
60|$|And if {{the lady}} {{wants to buy}} books, music, artistic bric-a-brac, <b>or</b> what <b>not,</b> <b>she</b> will find the big store {{displaying}} and selling all these things on commission for the municipal or private producers all over the world....|$|R
5000|$|Matt Molgaard {{praised the}} {{character}} saying [...] "Handicapped, forever wheelchair-bound, Dourif’s character, Nica, doesn’t look too imposing or powerful. In fact, initially she {{looks a bit}} fragile. And then shit gets crazy in the film and Nica’s defensive mindset spins 180 degrees. Survival instinct takes over, and whether handicapped <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>not</b> going down without a fight for the ages." [...] Adam Frazier who gave the film a mixed review praised Fiona's performance stating [...] "Aside from Fiona Dourif, who makes a solid Final Girl, many of the performances are amateurish." ...|$|R
50|$|Meredith asks Bailey {{to perform}} gene mapping {{on her to}} finally know whether she has Alzheimer's genes like her mother <b>or</b> <b>not</b> and <b>she</b> tests {{positive}} {{for more than one}} of the genetic markers for the disease.|$|R
25|$|On {{the evening}} of Friday 15 July 1977 while {{returning}} from a cruise and approaching Dunoon pier, Waverleys steering failed and she struck the rocks to the south called The Gantocks. Firmly aground and {{down by the head}} the ship was extensively damaged. There was some doubt about whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> would hold together on refloating but she did, and she was repaired and returned to service. Her survival was attributed to her heavier than normal post World War II construction which had included provision for minesweeping gear and a deck gun in case she was ever requisitioned by the Admiralty for use in a future war.|$|E
25|$|The Oregon Coast Aquarium (OCA) in Newport, Oregon {{where the}} orca Keiko was kept {{prior to his}} {{translocation}} to Iceland, offered its facilities to rehabilitate Springer for a one-year period, after which a scientific panel would determine whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> was fit to return to Johnstone Strait, BC. Media reports soon revealed that OCA was deep in debt and bound by {{an agreement with the}} Free Willy-Keiko Foundation (FWKF) that Keiko's former tank, built by FWKF, could never again house a wild orca. Furthermore, growing scientific opinion was that rehabilitating Springer in a concrete tank would further acclimate the orca to humans and likely result in permanent captivity. OCA withdrew its offer.|$|E
25|$|The American Prospect {{noted in}} 2008 that Onyango risked being persecuted and {{tortured}} in Kenya if she returned, {{and said that}} risk to her family members had increased, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> was deported, because of her asylum case having been leaked and widely publicized internationally. They also noted that due to the heightened danger in Kenya, her asylum claim in the US was bolstered. After her case was revealed in international media, Onyango traveled to stay with unidentified friends in Cleveland, Ohio. She had felt threatened in Boston, as people called and knocking on her door at all hours. The Boston police {{said that there was}} a problem with curiosity seekers and paparazzi.|$|E
