The fuselage was <b>of</b> <b>square</b> <b>cross-section</b> and carried Avro's characteristic [...] "comma" [...] rudder, with no fin. The wings were heavily staggered and had pronounced sweepback, both features intended to improve stability. They were not constructed with the usual span-length spars, but used a cellular approach. The interplane struts were not the usual single-piece shaped rods, but built up multi-piece, wide chord structures covered in canvas. There were conventional midsection [...] "N" [...] type struts between the fuselage and the upper wing. Ailerons were carried on both upper and lower wings. Most unusually for its time, the inboard lower wing featured landing flaps, so the 511 landed at a sedate 35 mph (56 km/h).|$|E

5000|$|Designed as a minimalist, {{affordable}} aircraft, the Junior was {{marketed as}} [...] "built {{to sell for}} the price of an automobile in the medium price class". Curtiss-Robertson's plans to produce such an aircraft were driven by the imminent arrival of the Aeronca C-2 and American Eagle Eaglet on the market. Hoping to compete in the same class, the company purchased the rights to the Snyder Buzzard but soon discovered that it simply could not be made to perform well enough. To replace it, the Skeeter was produced as an all-new design that retained the Buzzard's basic configuration. The aircraft featured a fuselage <b>of</b> <b>square</b> <b>cross-section</b> made from steel tube covered in fabric. The top of the fuselage was left open to create an open cockpit for the pilot and a passenger sitting in tandem. The tiny pusher engine was mounted to the upper surface of a parasol wing.

50|$|As {{originally}} completed, {{all three}} aircraft had much in common. They had almost constant chord wings that carried ailerons fitted with slots for low speed control. The fuselage was <b>of</b> <b>square</b> <b>cross-section,</b> with the underside tapering towards the tail. There was no fixed tailplane, only an elevator, and both types had a fixed triangular fin. On the H.P.22s this carried a rectangular, unbalanced rudder, but the H.P.23's rudder was rounded on the trailing edge and horn-balanced. The open cockpit {{was ahead of}} the wings and the undercarriage had two small wheels, mounted inboard on the fuselage on the H.P.22 and outboard on the H.P.23. The main {{differences between the two}} types came about because the H.P.23 was designed for the speed prizes rather than those for flight duration. It therefore had a much shorter span of 20 ft (6.1 m) compared with 36 ft 6 in (11.13 m) for the H.P.22. This wing had full span leading edge slots and camber changing flaps. Both types had their engine mounted on a pylon immediately ahead of the pilot. The H.P.22 used a 397 cc ABC flat-twin and the H.P.23 a 750 cc Blackburne V-twin, the latter requiring slight changes to the pylon and nose.|$|E

A fourth-order energy-conserving discretizations have been used that ensure non-physical dissipative effects introduced usually in other numerical schemes. The two sensitive fine-scales kinetic and thermal dissipation rates have been studied statistically to reveal high correlation within the thermal boundary layers and equilibrium zones of the two dissipations at strong thermal and kinetic interactions. It has been found that the foregoing zones could mark the plumes since these last reflect significant correlation regions of the kinetic and thermal fields. Afterwards, a novel class of symmetry-preserving regularization models that restrain the convective production of small scales of motion in unconditionally stable manner, have been applied on the studied problem. The obtained results are compared directly with the DNS ones to show a reasonable correspondence with and without model at this kind of moderate turbulence.

To separate the effects of the geometry from those of molecular diffusion, entrance flow, and channel length, the mixing in straight microchannels of the same length is also evaluated for comparison. Reynolds numbers in the range from 5 to 150 are considered. The study is performed both with reference to a fixed Peclet number, equal to 2500 and obtained by scaling the diffusion coefficient when varying the Reynolds number, and to a fixed diffusion coefficient, yielding a constant Schmidt number of 16. $(6) over bar.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} outcome of {{applying}} two di erent low-Reynolds-number eddy-viscosity models to resolve the complex three-dimensional motion that arises in turbulent ows in ducts with 90 ◦ bends. For the modelling of turbulence, the Launder and Sharma low-Re k – model and a recently produced variant of the cubic non-linear low-Re k – model have been employed. In this paper, developing turbulent ow through two di erent 90 ◦ bends is examined: a square bend, and a rectangular bend with an aspect ratio of 6. The numerical results indicate that for the bend <b>of</b> <b>square</b> <b>cross-section</b> the curvature induces a strong secondary ow, while for the rectangular cross-section the secondary motion is con ned to the corner regions. For both curved ducts, the secondary motion persists downstream of the bend and eventually slowly disappears. For the bend <b>of</b> <b>square</b> <b>cross-section,</b> comparisons indicate that both turbulence models can produce reasonable predictions. For the bend of rectangular cross-section, for which {{a wider range of}} data is available, while both turbulence models produce satisfactory predictions of the mean ow eld, the non-linear k – model returns superior predictions of the turbulence eld and also of the pressure and friction coe cients.
