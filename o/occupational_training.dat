40|$|Using data on worker {{training}} programs in South Dakota {{over the years}} 2002 – 11, this study estimates the employment and earnings effects of <b>occupational</b> skills <b>training</b> and on-the-job training. Average treatment effects {{for the first and}} third calendar quarters after training are reported by: gender, worker type, demographic group, region of residence, and time period of job loss. ^ Both <b>occupational</b> skills <b>training</b> and on-the-job training effectively increased the employment rates and incomes of participants. The effectiveness of <b>occupational</b> skills <b>training</b> tended to grow as time passed, but the effectiveness of on-the-job training tended to fade over time. Three calendar quarters after leaving training, the effects of <b>occupational</b> skills <b>training</b> were generally higher than they were after only one quarter. In contrast, three calendar quarters after training, on-the-job treatment effects tended to be smaller than after one quarter. ^ On-the-job training had large impacts on employment but disproportionately small impacts on earnings. The employment effects of on-the-job training were typically 2 to 3 times larger than the employment effects of <b>occupational</b> skills <b>training.</b> But when considering earnings effects, the impacts of <b>occupational</b> skills <b>training</b> were often larger than those of on-the-job training. ^ Training was generally more effective for men than women in the period immediately following training, but after three calendar quarters the effects of training were typically larger for women than for men. The short- and longer-run effects of training were greater for the non-dislocated jobless than for displaced workers. The demographic results showed that Native Americans benefited more from training than did any other demographic groups. ^ From a regional perspective, training effectively increased employment rates and incomes for both rural and urban areas, with the impacts being slightly larger for rural areas than for urban. Finally, training was less effective {{in the wake of the}} 2007 – 09 recession than beforehand. Training had no significant employment effects and only modest income effects following the Great Recession. ^ The results reported in this study suggest that <b>occupational</b> skills <b>training</b> and on-the-job training effectively increased employment rates and quarterly earnings across numerous sub-populations, regions, and time periods. The findings of this study will help guide policy makers going forward so that they might maximize the potential impacts of worker {{training programs}}. ...|$|R
25|$|However, due to {{the rise}} in {{tensions}} between the East and West over the political landscape of Europe, the threat from the Soviet Union in 1949 and 1950, coinciding with {{the start of the}} Cold War, led to a return to the militaristic policy by the Swedish government. From 1950 until around 1976 the size of the army was at an average of 250 000 soldiers with a peak of 400 000 active duty soldiers during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The mandatory period of service during this period was 22 months for non-educated conscripts and 14 months for college educated ones, with 30 years in the reserve and 30 days of reserve service obligation per 18 months. The compulsory service period included 2 months of basic training and 3 months of advanced <b>occupational</b> <b>training.</b> The rules were badly enforced, but dodging the draft was punishable with a year of imprisonment and the refusal of state social welfare benefits. Only in 1976–77 was there a change in policy where the compulsory service period of all conscripts was reduced and equalized at 14 months.|$|E
