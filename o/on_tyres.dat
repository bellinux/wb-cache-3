2500|$|The {{bus network}} is today {{managed by the}} Ametis , whose network covers Amiens Métropole, the {{agglomeration}} of Amiens. The establishment of dedicated bus lanes began in 2006. Former Mayor Gilles de Robien had envisioned {{the creation of a}} tram, but the choice of dedicated bus lanes had been preferred for reasons of cost and attendance. His successor, Mayor , had been considering the development of a [...] in the metropolitan area. As a result of numerous studies and conferences, elected representatives voted {{for the creation of a}} tram at the municipal Council of 15 November 2012. The project had been endorsed by the Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole on 18 December 2012 and the commissioning of a first north-south [...] was scheduled for 2018/2019. Following the , which were a defeat for most municipal and community carriers of the project, the new mayor of Amiens Brigitte Fouré and by extension the new president of Amiens Métropole Alain Gest decided to suspend the project at least during the time of their respective mandates, thus applying a campaign promise (the tram was at the heart of debate) and despite a project announcement of trams <b>on</b> <b>tyres</b> (of TVR type). Improvement of public transit would then be only by that of the bus network. Indeed, in December of the same year, the Community Council approved funding for a study (the sixth in 20 years) relating to the establishment of a rapid transit [...] (BHNS), which should enter into service in March 2019, and whose vehicles could be electric.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} patents <b>on</b> <b>tyre</b> cooling have been {{reviewed}} {{with a focus}} on those which can be applied to earthmoving tyres for the mining industry. The mechanisms of heat transfer within the tyre carcass are introduced as well as the basic tyre structure and effects of overheating <b>on</b> <b>tyre</b> operation. The tyre cooling patents are separated into five functional groups and reviews are made based on practicality and potential for significant heat transfer. This analysis has made it evident that potential cooling effectiveness is often compromised by practicality of an invention. The patents deemed to have the most potential for cooling are those which incorporate a working fluid which undergoes a phase change to transfer heat between different regions of the wheel assembly. Finally, these inventions are also related to current research projects which aim to develop a new cooling technique and extend the working life of earthmoving tyres...|$|R

50|$|In 1939 Motor Rail {{introduced}} the Motor Rail Dumper - a 4-ton, 2-wheel-drive dump truck (running <b>on</b> <b>tyres</b> rather than rails). It again used a Dorman engine, and {{a variant of}} the Dixon-Abbot gearbox. At least one survives. According to a 1955 advert, the diesel engine dumper had a capacity of 3 cubic yards, and had six forward gears and two reverse. It would carry a load of 4 tons up a 1 in 5 gradient. It was available with front control (driver at the front facing forward), or rear control (driver looking over the load, and hence with rear wheel steering, as is common modern practice).|$|E

40|$|A tyre testing {{system was}} {{developed}} for the quantitative investigations of fundamental tyre properties. This system consists of a driving car, a measuring device of forces which act <b>on</b> <b>tyre</b> and a data acquisition device. The measuring device of forces which was manufactured for this paper is a calculating type; so it is desirable that the data acquisition device also should have calculating ability. 　For that reason, a micro-computer system (CPU:μPD 8080 A), which consists of DC amprifiers, an AD converter　and data logging memory, was employed for the data acquisition device. 　As a result of performance tests, {{it became clear that}} the measuring system satisfies the fundamental requirements,　and is able to sample simultaneous data of six channels with the sampling rate of 256 (Hz). 　It was also ascertained that the effect of velocity should be considered in the measurment of force acting <b>on</b> <b>tyre</b> in　case of dry sand road, unlike the case of hard surface road...|$|R
