A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973.

5|$|In February 1971, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, federalization <b>of</b> <b>Medicaid</b> for the poor with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations. Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long. Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. He also played a leading role, with Senator Jacob Javits, in the creation and passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules <b>of</b> <b>Medicaid</b> funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) {{requires}} {{states to}} provide tobacco-cessation services without cost-sharing for pregnant traditional Medicaid-beneficiaries effective October 2010. It is unknown {{the extent to}} which obstetricians–gynecologists are aware <b>of</b> the <b>Medicaid</b> tobacco-cessation benefit. We sought to examine the awareness <b>of</b> the <b>Medicaid</b> tobacco-cessation benefit in a national sample of obstetricians–gynecologists and assessed whether reimbursement would influence their tobacco cessation practice. In 2012, a survey was administered to a national stratified-random sample of obstetricians–gynecologists (n= 252) regarding awareness <b>of</b> the <b>Medicaid</b> tobacco-cessation benefit. Results were stratified by the percentage <b>of</b> pregnant <b>Medicaid</b> patients. Chi-squared tests (p< 0. 05) were used to assess significant associations. Analyses were conducted in 2014. Eighty-three percent of respondents were unaware of the benefit. Lack of awareness increased as the percentage <b>of</b> pregnant <b>Medicaid</b> patients in their practices decreased (range= 71. 9 %– 96. 8 %; P= 0. 02). One-third (36. 1 %) of respondents serving pregnant Medicaid patients reported that reimbursement would influence them to increase their cessation services. Four out of five obstetricians–gynecologists surveyed in 2012 were unaware of the ACA provision that required states to provide tobacco cessation coverage for pregnant traditional <b>Medicaid</b> beneficiaries as <b>of</b> October 2010.

5|$|The ACA's major {{provisions}} {{came into}} force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured {{share of the}} population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20–24 million additional people covered during 2016. The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion <b>of</b> <b>Medicaid</b> eligibility and to major changes to individual insurance markets. Both involved new spending, funded {{through a combination of}} new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and Medicare Advantage. Several Congressional Budget Office reports said that overall these provisions reduced the budget deficit, and that repealing the ACA would increase the deficit. The law also enacted a host of delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After the law went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.|$|E
5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement <b>of</b> <b>Medicaid</b> by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion <b>of</b> <b>Medicaid,</b> and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E

40|$|Created in 1965 {{to provide}} health care for the poor, Medicaid today is the largest medical {{coverage}} provider of any social or private insurance program in the United States. As both enrollment increases and cost growth outpaces income growth yearly, Medicaid is an increasingly costly program {{that is one of the}} top budgeting obligations for both the federal and state governments. This program's role in society is expected to only grow further as one of the primary vehicles for providing health coverage to the uninsured under recent health reform. With the importance <b>of</b> <b>Medicaid's</b> future in mind, many forecasts of its costs for the next ten or twenty years have been made, and the study of these forecasts renders the data, assumptions, and methods employed to produce them. Understanding these choices is essential for being able to create my own forecast model and expect reasonable results. Applying data for two states, Massachusetts and California, to this model enables a broader comprehension <b>of</b> <b>Medicaid's</b> outlook as the program progresses uniquely in each state. Predicting costs in the future with a high degree of accuracy is inherently difficult to do. Despite this, the results from this type of work give a perspective on what could be expected if trends today continue in the future. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To develop {{estimates}} <b>of</b> state <b>Medicaid</b> expenditures {{attributable to}} smoking {{for fiscal year}} 1993. METHODS: The smoking-attributable fractions (SAFs) <b>of</b> state <b>Medicaid</b> expenditures were estimated using a national model that describes the relationship between smoking and medical expenditures, controlling {{for a variety of}} sociodemographic, economic, and behavioral factors. RESULTS: In fiscal year 1993, the SAF for all states (all types of expenditures) was 14. 4 %, with a range from 8. 6 % in Washington DC to 19. 2 % in Nevada. On average, SAFs ranged from a low of 7. 9 % for home health services expenditures to 21. 7 % for hospital expenditures. An estimated total of $ 12. 9 billion of fiscal year 1993 Medicaid expenditures was attributable to smoking. The relative error of this estimate was 40. 3 %. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking accounts for a substantial portion <b>of</b> annual state <b>Medicaid</b> expenditures, with considerable variation among states. The range in expenditures among the states is due to differences in smoking prevalence, health status, other socioeconomic variables used in the model, and the level and scope <b>of</b> the <b>Medicaid</b> program...|$|R
