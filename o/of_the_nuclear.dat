5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope {{marks the}} end of the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} {{eventually}} canceled by the Air Force in January 1959, seemingly {{out of fear}} of a negative public reaction and the risk to the population should anything have gone wrong with the launch.

5|$|After {{the bombings}} at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, {{a number of}} Manhattan Project {{physicists}} founded the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about atomic weapons. In {{the face of the}} destructiveness of the new weapons and in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> arms race several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view that it was necessary to reach agreement on international control of nuclear research and atomic weapons. The Baruch Plan, unveiled {{in a speech to the}} newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international atomic development authority, but was not adopted.|$|E
5|$|British wartime {{participation}} in the Manhattan Project provided a substantial body of expertise that was crucial {{to the success of}} High Explosive Research, the United Kingdom's post-war nuclear weapons programme, although it was not without important gaps, such as in the field of plutonium metallurgy.

5|$|Early {{research}} into the element was somewhat limited because most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> physicists and chemists in the United States {{at the time were}} focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the Manhattan Project.

5|$|Five {{of these}} had been {{completed}} {{by the spring of}} 1956 and were undergoing preflight tests when the entire program was canceled on 13 April 1956 and all components in preparation scrapped. A week later, the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the Fighter-Bomber branch and the doctrine of the VVS was drastically modified. No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army, but rather it would use tactical nuclear weapons as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> program, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E

Scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. E. W. R.
