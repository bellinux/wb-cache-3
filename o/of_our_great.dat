25|$|Tuesday 1stMay. Hazy, raw. Yesty {{was very}} {{unfavorable}} {{for the general}} moving <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>great</b> city. High rents, incommodious dwellings, & necessity combine to crowd our streets with carts overloaded with furniture & hand barrows with sofas, chairs, sideboards, looking glasses & pictures, so as to render the sidewalks almost impassable. The practice of all moving on one day, & give up & hiring Houses in Feby is of an antient custom & when the city was small & inhabitants few in number, almost every body owned or continued for years tenants in the same houses. Few instances of removals were seen, but now N York is literally in an uproar for several days before & after the 1stofMay. This practice of move all, to strangers appears absurd, but it is attended with the advantage of affording a greater choice of abodes in the Feby quarter.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{believe that}} a state statute would be {{consistent}} with our constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion if it specifically denied the right to practice law to all members of one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>great</b> religious groups, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish. Yet the Quakers have had a long and honorable part in the growth of our nation, and an amicus curiae brief filed in their behalf informs us that, under the test applied to this petitioner, not one of them, if true to the tenets of their faith, could qualify for the bar in Illinois. And {{it is obvious that the}} same disqualification would exist as to every conscientious objector to the use of force, even though the Congress of the United States should continue its practice of absolving them from military service. The conclusion seems to me inescapable that, if Illinois can bar this petitioner from the practice of law it can bar every person from every public occupation solely because he believes in nonresistance, rather than in force.|$|E

500|$|The presidential {{campaign}} of 1904, as Roosevelt sought election {{in his own}} right, brought Mr. Dooley ample opportunity to comment.

They got Senator Fairbanks to accept... by showing him a picture <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>great</b> and noble president trying to jump a horse over a six-foot fence". The president's enthusiastic campaigning attracted Mr. Dooley's attention: [...] "And when Theodore Roosevelt kisses a baby thousands of mothers in {{all corners of the}} land hear the report and the baby knows it's been kissed and bears the honorable scar through life. Twenty years from now the country will be full of young fellows looking as though they'd graduated from a German college." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1649, Clarke went to Seekonk (then in Plymouth Colony {{but later}} in Rehoboth, Massachusetts) to help {{organize}} a Baptist church.

[...] I believe their practice comes nearer to the first practice <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>great</b> Founder, Christ Jesus, than other practices of religion do." [...] Several members of the Seekonk church had quarreled with their minister Samuel Newman and had broken off from the main church, largely over the issue of infant baptism. [...] Hearing of this division, Clarke and Lucar went to welcome the dissidents and baptize them by immersion. [...] One of the Seekonk men was Obadiah Holmes who is considered a [...] "pugnacious man [...] a hot-tempered fault-finder" [...] by Clarke biographer Sydney James.|$|E

500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders). [...] However, insects offer ecological goods and services. The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O. Wilson observed: [...] "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>great</b> cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show. The Washington Post stated: [...] "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the Asian tiger mosquito or the fire ant, appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs." ...|$|E
500|$|Nash is most {{noted for}} his playmaking, ball-handling skills and shooting. He {{led the league}} in assists for five years, {{averaging}} 11.5 assists per game in 2004–05, 10.5 in 2005–06, 11.6 in 2006–07, 11.0 in 2009–10 and 11.4 in 2010–11 and won the 2005 and 2010 NBA All-Star Skills Contests. As of the end of 2012–13 season, he had a 90.4% career free-throw shooting average (best in NBA history) and a 42.8% career three-point shooting average (eighth-best in league history), and ranked {{as one of the top}} 10 players in league history in total assists, assists per game, and three-point field goals made. In addition, he is ranked second (starting from 1986–87) in regular season point–assist double doubles. In the 2005–06 season, Nash became the fourth player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better from the field, 40% from three-point range (43.9), and 90% from the line, joining Larry Bird, Reggie Miller, and Mark Price in the 50–40–90 club. Nash would repeat this feat three more times in the 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10 campaigns. Nash (four times) and Larry Bird (two times) are the only players to have accomplished this feat more than once. A two-time NBA MVP, Nash is only the second point guard (along with Magic Johnson) to win the MVP award multiple times and the third guard in NBA history to earn back-to-back MVPs (joining Johnson and Michael Jordan). Only ten other NBA players have won back-to-back MVP awards: Johnson, Jordan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry. On 11 May 2006, ESPN.com rated Nash as the 9th-best point guard of all time, and in a survey by nba.com in 2007, Nash received 85% of the votes by the league's general managers as best point guard in the league. In a similar survey in 2009, Nash was rated as the best passer of the ball and the player possessing the best basketball IQ. Commenting on Nash losing out to former teammate Dirk Nowitzki for the 2007 NBA MVP, Boston Celtics centre and Hall of Famer Russell stated: [...] "I think, on the world stage, he's one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>great</b> athletes in all sports... I'm a big fan. The two MVPs he got, he deserved. Part of the reason that he's so good and so effective is that the guys like playing with him. He creates an atmosphere where they win games." ...|$|E
