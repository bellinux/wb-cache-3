5|$|Harvey {{also noted}} that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>life</b> under Christian rule was like.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland {{and forced}} that nation's second-largest {{community}} of Jews, 270,000 strong, into {{one section of}} the city of Łódź, which they later walled off to form a ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in Łódź. When her father heard rumors of the impending German invasion, the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw. The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into a segregated section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>life</b> in the ghetto is like: her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings.|$|E

Horizons closed permanently in 1999 after a few years of sporadic operation; construction began on Mission: Space shortly thereafter. Industry estimates put the cost of developing the new attraction at US$100 million. The pavilion, like others at Epcot, features a VIP lounge for HP employees called The Red Planet Room.|$|E

On the crossing, she offers guidance to a young woman making her own first trip to Brooklyn. The film ends with Eilis and Tony reuniting and happily embracing.|$|E
25|$|Beckham {{missed the}} next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, {{sitting on the bench}} in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>life</b> would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to {{security}} concerns, {{it was the first time}} the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le Méridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.|$|E

500|$|Free Collars Kingdom {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from English-speaking audiences. Matthew Alexander of Mania praised the artwork, noting that characters were [...] "cute and sexy {{with a wide}} variety of clothing that does a good job expressing the character's personality" [...] and that, overall, the artwork was [...] "very clean with attractive characters and well-detailed backgrounds". In his review of the second volume, Alexander wrote that [...] "so far, the story continues to be a fun examination <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>life</b> might be like from the cat's point of view, but I don't know how the whole Wild Cat storyline is going to be wrapped up in only one more volume". In his review of the third volume, Alexander felt that [...] "the story probably received an early ending", but concluded that [...] "despite the series only being three volumes, it really is a worthy read and quite funny if you've ever owned a cat".|$|E
500|$|Those reviewers who {{singled out}} the show's final segment, set after {{the return to}} Ohio, did so with compliments. Poniewozik wrote that the episode [...] "did a really fine job {{handling}} its epilogue, in which New Directions had their hopes crushed, went back to Lima—and {{found that it was}} a pretty awesome experience regardless. Brittany connected with Santana, a brief scene that reminded me how far both characters have come this season. Kurt didn't get a championship, but he has Blaine, and he has a taste <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>life</b> can be like for him after graduation." [...] Canning said it was a [...] "nice denouement, putting everyone at peace for having failed to reach the top ten at Nationals and getting their hopes high for next year." [...] Hankinson credited Brittany with some of the funniest lines in the episode as well as the most important scene—in the epilogue with Santana—and he was impressed with her lead vocals throughout. He concluded, [...] "She's the M.V.P. of the night and possibly the season." ...|$|E

500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Minnesota's Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care {{to be far more}} important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority said their most important role was to [...] "show love and affection" [...] to kids. [...] "Safety and protection" [...] came next, followed by [...] "moral guidance," [...] "taking time to play," [...] and [...] "teaching and encouraging." [...] "Financial care" [...] finished last. [...] Many men are now becoming more involved in their children's lives, and because of that many men now have a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>life</b> is like for their child growing up in modern society. [...] Because fathers are immersed in their children's lives, many of the stereotypically [...] "manly" [...] attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender-neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being. This allows children, especially male children, to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally-structured households.|$|E

2500|$|While Hialeah {{was once}} envisioned as a {{playground}} for the elite, Cuban exiles, fleeing Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution {{as well as}} World War II veterans and city planners transformed the city into a working-class community.

[...] She further describes the city as [...] "a place where different groups have left their imprint while {{trying to create a}} sample <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>life</b> should be like." [...] Several waves of Cuban exiles, starting after the Cuban Revolution in 1959 and continuing through to the Freedom Flights from 1965–1973, the Mariel boatlift in 1980, and the Balseros or boat people of the late 1990s, created what at least one expert has considered the most economically successful immigrant enclave in U.S. history as Hialeah is the only American industrial city that continues to grow.|$|E
