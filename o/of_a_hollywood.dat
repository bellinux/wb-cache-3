5|$|On April 18, 2005, {{the crew}} began {{shooting}} at Dominica, a location Verbinski had selected {{as he felt}} it fitted the sense of remoteness he was looking for. However, this was also a problem; the Dominican government were completely unprepared for the scale <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hollywood</b> production, as while the 500-strong crew occupying around 90% of the roads on the island they had trouble moving around on the underdeveloped surfaces. The weather also alternated between torrential rainstorms and hot temperatures, the latter of which was made worse for the cast who had to wear period clothing. At Dominica, the sequences involving the Pelegosto and the forest segment of the battle on Isla Cruces were shot. Verbinski preferred to use practical props for the giant wheel and bone cage sequences, feeling long close-up shots would help further suspend the audience's disbelief. Dominica was also used for Tia Dalma's shack. Filming on the island concluded on May 26, 2005.|$|E

The game allows players to take the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hollywood</b> film mogul, running a studio and creating films. Much has been made about the film-making aspect of the game, as it allows players to easily create viewable works or machinima. It won Best Simulation Game at the BAFTA Video Games Awards and was nominated for best game at the Game Developers Choice Awards.|$|E

Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions thanks in part to the limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5million in personal profit.|$|E

But the environmental sloganeering of The Simpsons as well as Groening's cartoon commentary are symptomatic <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hollywood</b> and a popular culture that are hostile to the concerns and values of most Americans." [...] After the episode aired, media researchers Robert Lichter and Linda S.

500|$|In 1944, Erich Pommer and Hans Janowitz each {{separately}} {{attempted to}} obtain the legal rights to the film, with hopes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hollywood</b> remake. Pommer attempted to argue he had a better claim to the rights because the primary value of the original film came not from the writing, but [...] "in the revolutionary way the picture was produced". However, both Janowitz and Pommer ran into complications related to the invalidity of Nazi law in the United States, and uncertainty over the legal rights of sound and silent films. Janowitz wrote a treatment for a remake, and in January 1945 was offered a minimum guarantee of $16,000 against a five-percent royalty for his rights to the original film for a sequel to be directed by Fritz Lang, but the project never came to fruition. Later, Janowitz planned a sequel called Caligari II, and unsuccessfully attempted to sell the property to a Hollywood producer for $30,000.|$|E

500|$|The {{season was}} not without controversy, however. There {{are a number of}} episodes with scenes of one {{teenager}} being beaten by his father. When reviewing those episodes, the Ryerson University of Toronto said the show [...] "stands on its own" [...] in reflecting [...] "the kinds of issues [...] facing in their own lives ... handled with care and consideration, without all the glamour <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hollywood</b> soap opera." [...] A two-part storyline about date-rape proved too risqué for The N officials, who delayed its broadcasting until suitable edits could be made, and other special treatments were available in the form of panel discussions, online parental guides and separately filmed introductions. The Gazette said, [...] "You've got to hand it to the creative team behind CTV's justly celebrated teen series, Degrassi: The Next Generation.

In a retrospective of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "731" [...] was rated a B. The review noted that the episode was [...] "strangely tension-free", though it derided Scully's stubbornness to believe what the series had established as truth. Nick De Semlyen and James White of Empire named it the second [...] "greatest" [...] episode of the series, stating it is [...] "arguably the greatest of The X-Files' many mythology episodes" [...] and a [...] "high-octane mix of action and intrigue, with the production values and pacing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hollywood</b> blockbuster".|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{design of the}} film, led by art director M. K. Syed, was extravagant, and some sets took six weeks to erect.

The song [...] "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" [...] was filmed in Mohan Studios on a set built as a replica of the Sheesh Mahal in the Lahore Fort. The set was noted for its size, measuring [...] in length, [...] in breadth and [...] in height. A much-discussed aspect was the presence of numerous small mirrors made of Belgian glass, which were crafted and designed by workers from Firozabad. The set took two years to build and cost more than 1.5 million (valued at about US$314,000 in 1960), more than the budget of an entire Bollywood film at the time.
