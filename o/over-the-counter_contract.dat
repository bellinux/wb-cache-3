50|$|Over-the-counter (OTC) or {{off-exchange trading}} is to trade {{financial}} instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities or derivatives directly between two parties. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via facilities constructed {{for the purpose}} of trading (i.e., exchanges), such as futures exchanges or stock exchanges.In the U.S., over-the-counter trading in stock is carried out by market makers that make markets in OTCBB and Pink Sheets securities using inter-dealer quotation services such as Pink Quote (operated by Pink OTC Markets) and the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB). OTC stocks are not usually listed nor traded on any stock exchanges, though exchange listed stocks can be traded OTC on the third market. Although stocks quoted on the OTCBB must comply with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements, other OTC stocks, such as those stocks categorized as Pink Sheets securities, have no reporting requirements, while those stocks categorized as OTCQX have met alternative disclosure guidelines through Pink OTC Markets. An <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>contract</b> is a bilateral contract in which two parties agree on how a particular trade or agreement is to be settled in the future. It is usually from an investment bank to its clients directly. Forwards and swaps are prime examples of such contracts. It is mostly done via the computer or the telephone.

We find evidence that routine decisions to commit to and unwind derivatives positions were influenced by speculative behavior in the period 2003 - 2008. However, during the period 2009 - 2011, we find no evidence of speculation, in line with the results of Coutinho, Sheng and Lora (2012).

40|$|I model an {{entangled}} {{financial system}} in which banks hedge their portfolio risks using <b>over-the-counter</b> (OTC) <b>contracts.</b> However, banks choose not to hedge counterparty risk, and thus the idiosyncratic failure of a bank {{can lead to a}} systemic run of lenders. An inefficiency arises because banks engage in a version of risk shifting through the network externalities created by OTC contracts. Banks do not take into account that the costly hedging of low-probability counterparty risk also benefits other banks. In the model, it is welfare improving to tax OTC contracts to finance a bailout fund. (JEL G 22, G 28) Modern financial institutions are entangled in a network of bilateral hedging <b>contracts,</b> such as <b>over-the-counter</b> (OTC) derivatives.

Banks invest in an outside risky assets and they are potentially interconnected with each other via <b>over-the-counter</b> (OTC) <b>contracts</b> to diversify their portfolio. The insurance company (IC) provides credit default swap contracts (CDS) to banks. Therefore, OTC and CDS might be channels for shock propagation in the financial network. CDS {{were one of the}} main financial instruments due to which different financial institutions were interconnected with each other during the global financial crisis 2007 - 2008 caused severe damage for the whole financial system. I investigate whether CDS reduce or enlarge systemic risk in interacting financial networks. Using computational model with banks hedging their asset risk via CDS, I identified that when the risk weighting on risky assets is small, banks and the whole network benefit from buying CDS since the number of defaults is less than in the case of not buying CDS. When the probability of risky project’s defaults is approximately in the interval [0. 5, 0. 6], we have the minimum number of bank defaults. Since financial institutions are linked with each other via OTC and CDS and a shock or default of one bank can affect multiple other banks, all banks benefit from a {{reduction in the number of}} bank defaults...|$|R
40|$|Banks use <b>over-the-counter</b> {{derivative}} (OTCD) <b>contracts</b> {{for sharing}} {{the risks of}} their asset streams. OTCDs are composed of an optimal combination of interbank loans, asset swaps and credit default swaps (CDS). The settlement of ex-post realized claims are renegotiated by participating banks after defaults {{by one or more}} banks to minimize the systemic impact of the default. The bailout by a solvent bank of an insolvent one creates a positive externality for all other solvent banks in the system with claims due from the insolvent bank. The lack of coordination among the solvent banks leads to an inefficient liquidation policy (system-wide runs) even though we allow mergers among them to potentially internalize the positive externality. Interbanks loans and CDS contracts have relatively lower incentive costs than swaps, but the former has the largest distress costs without renegotiations. With renegotiations, the payoffs of interbank loans and CDS are similar in strong bankruptcy regimes, while the latter dominate in weak regimes. Asset swaps provide the best hedging and are optimal for banks without incentive problems. Hedging with optimal OTCD contracts creates a tradeoff between the amount of credit risk and systemic risk (liquidation spillover) in the banking system...|$|R
50|$|In other words, {{a forward}} rate {{agreement}} (FRA) is a tailor-made, <b>over-the-counter</b> financial futures <b>contract</b> on short-term deposits. A FRA transaction is a contract between two parties to exchange payments on a deposit, called the Notional amount, {{to be determined}} {{on the basis of}} a short-term interest rate,referred to as the Reference rate, over a predetermined time period at a future date. FRA transactions are entered as a hedge against interest rate changes. The buyer of the contract locks in the interest rate in an effort to protect against an interest rate increase, while the seller protects against a possible interest rate decline. At maturity, no funds exchange hands; rather, thedifference between the contracted interest rate and the market rate is exchanged. The buyer of the contract is paid if the reference rate is above the contracted rate, and the buyer pays to the seller if the reference rate is below the contracted rate. A company that seeks to hedge against a possible increase in interest rates would purchase FRAs, whereas a company that seeks an interest hedge against a possible decline of the rates would sell FRAs.|$|R
40|$|Jet {{fuel costs}} have {{substantially}} risen {{over the past}} several years putting consistent pressure on airlines to maintain positive cash flows. While the costs are hedgable, there is not a perfect hedge available in either the over-the-counter or exchange traded derivatives markets. Over-the-counter derivatives on jet fuel are very illiquid which makes them rather expensive and not available in quantities sufficient to hedge all of an airlines jet fuel consumption. Exchange-traded derivatives are not available in the United States for jet fuel, so airlines must use futures contracts on commodities that are highly correlated with jet fuel, such as crude and heating oil. As such, airlines employ a variety of strategies ranging from not hedging to fully hedging using a combination of products. This paper is divided into several sections. First, we document the various strategies, including hedging using <b>over-the-counter</b> derivatives, futures <b>contracts,</b> and not hedging, and evaluate the effectiveness and merits of each. We then discuss the accounting rules and the implications these rules have for driving hedging strategies. Finally, we perform an industry survey as of December 31, 2003 and document the practices currently in place in the domestic airline industry to determine whether the use of a hedging strategy appears to create market value. Our research indicates that, contrary to the opinions of many airline executives, the optimal strategy is to employ a dynamic hedging program that is actively managed through the price cycle using a variety of derivative products. Because the airline industry is relatively unhedged at the present, using derivatives to hedge jet fuel costs creates a competitive advantage and has been shown to increase firm value. I. Available Hedging Strategies Domestic airlines have a variety of hedging strategies available to them.

40|$|Since the {{liberalisation}} of {{the energy}} market in Europe in the early 1990 s, much opportunity to trade electricity as a commodity has arisen. One significant consequence of this movement is that market prices have become more volatile instead of its tradition constant rate of supply. Spot price markets have also been introduced, affecting the demand of electricity as companies now {{have the option to}} not only produce their own supply but also purchase this commodity from the market. Following the liberalisation {{of the energy}} market, hence creating a greater demand for trading of electricity and other types of energy, various types of options related to the sales, storage and transmission of electricity have consequently been introduced. Particularly, swing options are popular in the electricity market. As we know, swing-type derivatives are given in various forms and are mainly traded as <b>over-the-counter</b> (OTC) <b>contracts</b> at energy exchanges. These options offer flexibility with respect to timing and quantity. Traditionally, the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model is a very popular and standard approach for modelling the risk neutral price dynamics of underlyings. However, a limitation of this model is that it has very few degrees of freedom, as it does not capture the complex behaviour of electricity prices. In short the GBM model is inefficient in the pricing of options involving electricity. Other models have subsequently been used to bridge this inadequacy, e. g. spot price models, futures price models, etc. To model risk-neutral commodity prices, there are basically two different methodologies, namely spot and futures or so-called term structure models. As swing options are usually written on spot prices, by which we mean the current price at which a particular commodity can be bought or sold at a specified time and place, it is important for us to examine these models in order to more accurately inculcate their effect on the pricing of swing options. Monte Carlo simulation is also a widely used approach for the pricing of swing options in the electricity market. Theoretically, Monte Carlo valuation relies on risk neutral valuation and the technique used is to simulate as many (random) price paths of the underlying(s) as possible, and then to average the calculated payoff for each path, discounted to today's prices, giving the value of the desired derivative. Monte Carlo methods are particularly useful in the valuation of derivatives with multiple sources of uncertainty or complicated features, like our electricity swing options in question. However, they are generally too slow to be considered a competitive form of valuation, if any analytical techniques of valuation exist. In other words, the Monte Carlo approach is, in a sense, a method of last resort. In this thesis, we aim to examine a numerical method involved in the pricing of swing options in the electricity market. We will consider an existing and widely accepted electricity price process model, use the finite volume method to formulate a numerical scheme in order to calibrate the prices of swing options and make a comparison with numerical solutions obtained using the theta-scheme. Further contributions of this thesis include a comparison of results and also a brief discussion of other possible methods...|$|R
