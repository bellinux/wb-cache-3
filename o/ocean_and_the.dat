These included significant number of Shakta devotees.

5|$|Ocepeia {{lived at}} a time when {{northwest}} Africa was at the intersection of the Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ancient Tethys Ocean, and much of the area was flooded by shallow, warm inland seas. Ocepeia fossils are associated with diverse sharks, birds, and marine reptiles, and a small number of early mammals, including other condylarths and early proboscideans. The early appearance and specialized features of Ocepeia suggest afrotherians originated and diversified within Africa, contrary to theories suggesting a more northern origin.|$|E

5|$|Coconut crabs {{live in the}} Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> central Pacific Ocean, with a {{distribution}} that closely matches that of the coconut palm.

There is evidence that the coconut crab once lived on the mainlands of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius, but it no longer occurs in any of these places. As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae.|$|E
