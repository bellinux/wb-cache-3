It {{is used in}} the design of coastal and <b>offshore</b> <b>structures,</b> {{in order to determine the}} wave kinematics (free surface elevation and flow velocities). The wave kinematics are subsequently needed in the design process to determine the wave loads on a structure.

In such shallow water, a cnoidal wave theory often provides better periodic-wave approximations.|$|E

The blue runner is distributed across the Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Brazil to Canada in the western Atlantic and from Angola to Great Britain including the Mediterranean in the east Atlantic.

The blue runner is known to reach a maximum length of 70cm and 5.05kg in weight, but is much more common below 35cm. The species inhabits both inshore and offshore environments, predominantly over reefs, however it is known to congregate around large man made <b>offshore</b> <b>structures</b> such as oil platforms.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with robust control of an offshore steel jacket platform subject to nonlinear wave-induced forces. Since time delay and uncertainty are inevitably encountered for an <b>offshore</b> <b>structure</b> and their existence may induce instability, oscillation and poor performance, it is very significant to study on how the delay and uncertainty affect the <b>offshore</b> <b>structure.</b> In this thesis, a memory robust control strategy is, for the first time, proposed to reduce the internal oscillations of the <b>offshore</b> <b>structure</b> under wave-induced forces, so as {{to ensure the safety}} and comfort of the <b>offshore</b> <b>structure.</b> Firstly, when the system's states are adopted as feedback, memory state feedback controllers are introduced for the <b>offshore</b> <b>structure.</b> By using Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, some delay-dependent stability criteria have been established, based on which, and by combining with some linearization techniques, memory state feedback controllers are designed to control the <b>offshore</b> <b>structure.</b> The simulation results show that such controllers can effectively reduce the internal oscillations of the <b>offshore</b> <b>structure</b> subject to nonlinear wave-induced forces and uncertainties. On the other hand, a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is introduced to derive a less conservative delay-dependent stability criterion. When this criterion is applied to the <b>offshore</b> <b>structure,</b> an improved memory state feedback controller with a small gain is obtained to control the system more effectively, which is sufficiently shown by the simulation. Secondly, when the system's outputs are adopted as feedback, memory dynamic output feedback controllers are considered for the <b>offshore</b> <b>structure.</b> By employing a projection theorem and a cone complementary linearization approach, memory dynamic output feedback controllers are derived by solving some nonlinear minimization problem subject to some linear matrix inequalities. The simulation results show that the internal oscillations of the <b>offshore</b> <b>structure</b> subject to nonlinear wave-induced forces are well attenuated. Finally, robust H control is fully investigated for the <b>offshore</b> <b>structure.</b> By employing Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, some delay-dependent bounded real lemmas have been obtained, under which, via a memory state feedback controller or a dynamic output feedback controller, the resulting closed-loop system is not only asymptotically stable but also with a prescribed disturbance attenuation level. The simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed method. " [...] abstract...|$|R

40|$|Random {{wave and}} current forces acting on an <b>offshore</b> <b>structure,</b> cause random base shear forces in time. The peak base shear is the maximum value of base shear that occurs during {{the passage of}} a wave. The extreme base shear is the maximum value of base shear that occurs within a period of time, say one hour. So far, the {{distributions}} of extreme base shear forces acting on jacket type structures were calculated numerically. Time domain simulations of base shear were generated for the jacket type <b>offshore</b> <b>structure</b> by means of a computer program, using the Morison equation on every member segment. Extreme base shears could be sampled from these time records of base shear forces. By simulating a storm over a period significantly greater than one hour, say sixty hours, histograms of extreme base shear could be developed. These computer simulations cause high computer costs. This study investigates a method to develop probability density functions of extreme base shears acting on a jacket-type <b>offshore</b> <b>structure.</b> A probability density function of extreme base shears acting on a single vertical cylindrical column structure was derived analytically in the past. The probability density function for a single column is used to obtain the probability density functions for a jacket-type <b>offshore</b> <b>structure.</b> The complex jacket-type <b>offshore</b> <b>structure</b> is represented by a number of vertical cylindrical columns which cause equivalent wave and current forces.

40|$|For an <b>offshore</b> <b>structure,</b> wind, wave, current, tide, ice and {{gravitational}} {{forces are}} all important sources of loading which exhibit {{a high degree}} of statistical uncertainty. The capability to predict the probability distribution of the response extreme values during the service life of the structure is essential for safe and economical design of these structures. Many different techniques have been introduced for evaluation of statistical properties of response. In each case, sea-states are characterised by an appropriate water surface elevation spectrum, covering a wide range of frequencies. In reality, the most versatile and reliable technique for predicting the statistical properties of the response of an <b>offshore</b> <b>structure</b> to random wave loading is the time domain simulation technique. To this end, conventional time simulation (CTS) procedure or commonly called Monte Carlo time simulation method is the best known technique for predicting the short-term and long-term statistical properties of the response of an <b>offshore</b> <b>structure</b> to random wave loading due to its capability of accounting for various nonlinearities.
