500|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} {{to the development}} of the College of Cardinals as a body of papal advisors, the popes started to elevate to the cardinalate some [...] "external" [...] abbots. After such appointments, they continued to reside in their abbeys and did not become members of the Papal curia. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hands,</b> the elections of the cardinals to the posts of abbots of external monasteries were also ratified by the popes. The main goal of such appointments was probably to strengthen the ties between some important monastic centers with the Roman Church. The first known instances of such appointments concerned the abbey of Montecassino, one of the main centers supporting reform of the Church. In 1057 cardinal-deacon Frederick de Lorraine (the future pope Stephen X) was elected abbot of Montecassino; Pope Victor II confirmed his election and simultaneously named him cardinal-priest of S. Crisogono. His successor as abbot of Montecassino, Desiderio, was also quickly promoted to the cardinalate, but continued to act also as abbot. From 1057 until 1259/62 at least eight abbots of Montecassino were simultaneously members of the College of Cardinals. Also some other Italian (e.g. Subiaco, Farfa, Vallombrosa, S. Sophia in Benevento) and French abbeys (St. Victor at Marseille) were for some time ruled by the cardinal-abbots.|$|E

2500|$|Levin {{describes}} {{the stages of}} the young man and his dissociation from the love triangle. As the young man departs,the poet {{will have a chance to}} rekindle his love with the Dark Lady:"the fair young man is fulfilled in his marriage, creating the possibility, however remote, that the speaker, in the absence of his young rival, will be granted restorative sexual relations with the mistress". The question of who is being loved by whom within the love triangle is quite controversial. Levin states that the young man and the poet are competing for the Dark Lady's affection. Sauer, on the other hand, claims that there is a connection between the love of the Dark lady for the young man and the love of the poet for the Dark Lady and the young man. Sonnet 154 addresses the love that the poet has for this young man in which the young man becomes the Dark Lady's fixture of desire. Sauer states that the Dark Lady may have stolen this young man away from the poet as the [...] " [...] Young Man or Lovely boy becomes the subject of desire for the Dark Lady, too, and the poet feels increasingly alienated as the Dark Lady 'steals' the Fair Young Man from him". Levin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>hands</b> states that the poet feels that the Dark lady may have run off with the young man and left him with his desire for her that is unfulfilled [...] "for the poet, the Dark Lady becomes the occasion for fiction making: she becomes the emblem of unchecked desire, passion, and frustration, but also a symbol of mystery".|$|E
