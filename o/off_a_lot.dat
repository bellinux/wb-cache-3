25|$|Less Than {{a minute}} {{into the game}} Brady Quinn proved just why he's {{one of the top}} QBs in College Football today and he didn't stop there going 14 of 19 for 207 yards passing and 4 TDs. At :54 seconds Quinn hit Jeff Samardzija for a 51-yd TD pass and a 7-0 lead. Less than five minutes later he threw a 1-yd pass to John Carlson to put Notre Dame up 14-0. At 8:40 into the game Air Force got on the board when Zach Sasser kicked a 32-yd field goal to shrink the deficit to 14-3. But Quinn would respond with a 24-yd pass to Rhema McKnight. Air Force was able to block the Extra Point Attempt and Notre Dame was now up 20-3 to finish up the 1st quarter. The second quarter showed <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of good defense {{including}} a blocked FG attempt that saw Terrail Lambert return the blocked kick 76-yds for a TD to put Notre Dame up 27-3 at the half.|$|E

25|$|While Natale ran the family, Merlino and {{his young}} allies {{maintained}} control on the street, collecting extortion payments and profiting from rackets and schemes Natale was not made aware of. Merlino was also the crime family's main link {{to many of the}} other criminal groups in Philadelphia. Merlino was only 32 years old, an extremely young age for any Mafia member, let alone a leader of a Mafia family. Merlino and his allies were all young and unexperienced in running a criminal organization of such magnitude. They were also flashy, violent and loved the limelight. Merlino was often spotted by reporters and cameramen on the streets of South Philadelphia followed by a large entourage. Merlino's high-profile brought a lot of attention from the press and law enforcement. The crime family itself was unstable, with things poorly managed by Merlino's crew whose violent reputation was used to keep things in order. The Merlino faction's arrogance and aggressiveness turned <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of criminals from working with the crime family. Merlino's associates were also involved in drug deals in Philadelphia and Boston while overseeing the crime family's gambling, loan sharking, stolen goods and extortion rackets.|$|E

[...] And so, yeah, absolutely because we love those guys". Carlock said that Frank, Toofer, and Lutz are [...] "always a fun foil" [...] against Jane Krakowski's Jenna [...] "which we use a lot with the two of them [...] Jenna against those guys kind of squaring <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of times." [...] In addition, Carlock noted that it is always [...] "fun" [...] when the writers and Jenna [...] "are scheming off each other" [...] as featured in this episode.|$|E

[...] Daniels also said all the questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming it for so long, as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E

500|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and {{longing for a}} return to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really amazed at how badly [...] was being viewed... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're not trying to be difficult... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people... What we're doing isn't that radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E

One night after {{finishing}} recording [...] "Shiver", the band took a break and {{went out of the}} studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." [...] The melody [...] "started <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> slower", according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, [...] "and it sort of got a bit heavier".|$|E

2500|$|In woodworking, surforms {{are used}} for rapidly {{removing}} wood from curved surfaces. They remove less wood than a drawknife, so they are easier to control. Even though surforms leave very coarse finishes, the worked areas can be easily smoothed with finer tools, such as files and sanding blocks. Woodworker Sam Maloof described their use in chairmaking: [...] "Once I have roughed out the arm on the bandsaw, I use a Surform® (Stanley® model No. 295). This tool does about the same job as a spokeshave -- it can take <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of wood very quickly -- but I can use it without worrying about grain direction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} usually rely on uranium to {{fuel the}} chain reaction. [...] Uranium is a very heavy metal that is abundant on Earth and is found in sea water {{as well as most}} rocks. [...] Naturally occurring uranium is found in two different isotopes: uranium-238 (U-238), accounting for 99.3% and uranium-235 (U-235) accounting for about 0.7%. [...] Isotopes are atoms of the same element with a different number of neutrons. [...] Thus, U-238 has 146 neutrons and U-235 has 143 neutrons. [...] Different isotopes have different behaviors. [...] For instance, U-235 is fissile which means that it is easily split and gives <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of energy making it ideal for nuclear energy. [...] On the other hand, U-238 does not have that property despite it being the same element. [...] Different isotopes also have different half-lives. [...] A half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a sample of a radioactive element to decay. [...] U-238 has a longer half-life than U-235, so it takes longer to decay over time. [...] This also means that U-238 is less radioactive than U-235.|$|E
2500|$|... 2003 was {{the year}} of the Samsung Cup. It was his first big title in three years. Cho was known for not doing well in {{international}} tournaments, so when he progressed to the quarter-finals of the 8th Samsung Cup, many were surprised. The only time before the Samsung Cup in which he won an international cup was back in 1991 when he won the Fujitsu Cup because his opponent, Qian Yuping, fell ill. The quarter-final was a historical game for Cho, as {{it was the first time}} he beat Cho Hunhyun since 1981. The final four were left now. Other than Cho, the other players who were Hu Yaoyu, Xie He, and Park Young-Hoon. All were under the age of 21, while Cho was 47 at the time. In the semi-final, in which pairings were selected by lot, he played Hu Yaoyu. He was lucky, winning by only half a point. Park had beaten Xie He, so Cho and Park met in the final. Park won the first game by 4 and a half points, but Cho came back and took the next two games. The last game was clearly worse for Cho until Park slipped up on move 180 and Cho was able to cut <b>off</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of stones. This led to Park resigning. Cho won his first international title in 12 years, and only his second of all time.|$|E
