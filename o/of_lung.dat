5|$|About 8% <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> {{cancer is}} due to {{inherited}} factors. In relatives of people with lung cancer, the risk is doubled. This is likely due {{to a combination of}} genes. Polymorphisms on chromosomes 5, 6 and 15 are known to affect the risk <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> cancer.|$|E
5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> cancer.

5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise {{relative to other}} types <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>lung</b> adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Dihydroartemisinin {{was shown}} to produce two types of {{inhibitory}} effects on the cardiac muscles of rats. It was also shown to stimulate haemopoiesis in the lungs, liver, spleen, intestine and kidney of rats. This study attempted {{to find out the}} nature of the effect of oral dihydroartemisinin on the <b>lungs</b> <b>of</b> Wistar albino rats. Approach: The effects of dihydroartemisinin on the tissues <b>of</b> the <b>lungs</b> <b>of</b> wistar albino rats were investigated with five doses of Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) administered for 5 days by oral intubation. The five tested doses were 1 mg kg - 1, a repeated dose of 1, 2, 60 and 80 mg kg - 1 DHA. Results: Histopathological examination of the tissue micrographs <b>of</b> the <b>lungs</b> <b>of</b> the dihydroartemisinin treated rats showed that in comparism with those of the controls, DHA had no adverse effects on the tissues <b>of</b> the <b>lungs</b> <b>of</b> the rats but rather produced a direct stimulatory effect on the smooth muscles <b>of</b> the <b>lungs.</b> This stimulation caused hyperplasia of these tissues which was observable histologically in tissue micrographs <b>of</b> the <b>lungs.</b> These effects <b>of</b> dihydroartemisinin on the tissues <b>of</b> the <b>lungs</b> <b>of</b> Wistar albino rats were dose, repetition and time dependent. Conclusion: These growth hormone-like stimulatory effects of dihydroartemisinin on the smooth muscles <b>of</b> the <b>lungs</b> suggest that DHA enhanced the functioning capacity <b>of</b> the <b>lungs</b> <b>of</b> the DHA-treated rats. These results suggest that dihydroartemisinin has possible respiration enhancement effects...|$|R

30|$|Preventing cyclic {{collapse}} and reopening of alveoli during tidal ventilation is an established principle {{to minimize the}} risk <b>of</b> ventilator-induced <b>lung</b> injury in critically ill patients [7] and, recently, even in patients with normal lungs mechanically ventilated in the operating room [8]. The absence of simple, noninvasive and continuous methods to evaluate the aeration <b>of</b> <b>lungs</b> has renewed interest in the analysis of the acoustic characteristics of the respiratory system during mechanical ventilation. Both over- and under-inflation <b>of</b> the <b>lungs</b> induce changes in the transmission of both externally introduced and breathing-induced lung sounds [3],[9],[10]. As such, monitoring the acoustic properties <b>of</b> the <b>lung</b> could potentially be used to identify areas <b>of</b> injury, follow <b>lung</b> inflation, and optimize ventilator settings during the recruitment <b>of</b> collapsed <b>lung</b> parenchyma.|$|R
