Mid-June, Riis Cycling A/S {{announced that}} Saxo Bank had entered a three-year contract as name sponsor, with immediate effect, so the team entered the 2008 Tour de France as Team CSC Saxo Bank.

5|$|Occasionally, male tigers {{participate}} in raising cubs, usually their own, {{but this is}} extremely rare and not always well understood.

5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E

5|$|The {{human body}} absorbs {{strontium}} {{as if it}} were its lighter congener calcium. Because the elements are chemically very similar, stable strontium isotopes do not pose a significant health threat. The average human has an intake <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> milligrams of strontium a day. In adults, strontium consumed tends to attach only to the surface of bones, but in children, strontium can replace calcium in the mineral of the growing bones and thus lead to bone growth problems.|$|E
5|$|Though the bobcat prefers {{rabbits and}} hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, small rodents, and deer. Prey {{selection}} depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring {{and has a}} gestation period <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> months.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the island's {{population}} consisted <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> hundred former pirates {{and several}} hundred fugitives who had escaped from nearby Spanish colonies. Rogers organised a government, granted the King's Pardon to those former pirates {{on the island}} {{who had not yet}} accepted it, and started to rebuild the island's fortifications, which had fallen into decrepitude under pirate domination. However, less than a month into his residence on New Providence, Rogers was faced with a double threat: Vane wrote, threatening to join with Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard) to retake the island, and Rogers learned that the Spanish also planned to drive the British out of the Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} over a period <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got {{into the spirit of}} the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, {{during the}} midst of Tet New Year celebrations, a North Vietnamese deserter {{surrendered}} himself to the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters. Through extensive interrogations, the North Vietnamese soldier revealed the whereabouts of North Vietnamese units; the 10th Infantry Division had encircled Duc Lap, while the 320A Infantry Division had arrived in Ea H’leo and were gearing up for an assault on Thuan Man, and an unknown unit was heading towards Ban Me Thuot. In late February, North Vietnamese artillery shells began to rain down on Pleiku, which convinced General Phu that the North Vietnamese would attack Pleiku instead of Ban Me Thuot. South Vietnamese military intelligence and information received from the American Embassy in Saigon showed the presence <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> or three North Vietnamese combat divisions positioned about 20kilometres away from Kontum and Pleiku. Indeed, the movements around Pleiku and Kontum {{during the month of}} February were designed by the North Vietnamese Tay Nguyen Front to fool South Vietnamese military commanders in the Central Highlands.|$|E
5|$|The Lineweaver {{team also}} {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of}} the galactic habitable zone with respect to time, finding, for example, that stars close to the galactic bulge had to form within a time window <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> billion years in order to have habitable planets. Before that window, galactic-bulge stars would be prevented from having life-sustaining planets from frequent supernova events. After the supernova threat had subsided, though, the increasing metallicity of the galactic core would eventually mean that stars there would have a high number of giant planets, with the potential to destabilize star systems and radically alter the orbit of any planet located in a star's circumstellar habitable zone. Simulations conducted in 2005 at the University of Washington, however, show that even in the presence of hot Jupiters, terrestrial planets may remain stable over long timescales.|$|E

5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first batch}} of twenty {{locomotives}} was ordered in April 1941, although {{the changes in}} design to the Light Pacific arrangement meant that production was delayed until late 1944. Due to wartime contract work at Brighton works, the boilers were built under contract at the North British Locomotive Company. Before {{the first of the}} class had been delivered, the order was increased to thirty, with a second batch of ten ordered in September 1944. Deliveries from Brighton works began in May 1945 with prototype No. 21C101 Exeter, and proceeded at the rate <b>of</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> locomotives per month. The class was gradually run in on the Central Section until October 1945, when they were successfully trialled on Plymouth and Kentish services. By the time the first fifteen had entered traffic a further order of fifteen was placed, with these entering service between June and October 1946. From this batch onwards, traction was improved by the addition of steam sanding to the front driving wheel, with covers added to protect the motion from sand falling from the filler pipes.|$|E
