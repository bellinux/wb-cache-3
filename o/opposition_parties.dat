5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views.

5|$|In the 2008 general election, BN was {{returned}} to power {{for the first time}} without its customary 2/3 supermajority in the Dewan Rakyat, meaning it could no longer pass constitutional amendments without the support of <b>opposition</b> <b>parties.</b> The election results were widely seen as reflecting discontent {{about the state of the}} country's economy and increasing ethnic tensions within the country; the three main <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> had campaigned on a platform condemning the NEP and the government's response to widening economic disparities. The month after, the Crown Prince of Kelantan Tengku Faris Petra said during an assembly organised by the newly formed Malay Unity Action Front that since the Malays had given in to granting the non-Malays citizenship, the latter should not seek equality or special treatment.

5|$|In this context, Tătărescu {{chose to}} back the regime, as the PNL, like the National Peasants' Party, {{remained}} active in nominal clandestinity (as the law banning {{it had never been}} enforced any further). Having personally signed the document banning <b>opposition</b> <b>parties,</b> he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938, and contested the legitimacy of the action for the following years.

5|$|The GRC scheme {{has also}} been criticized for raising the bar for the {{opposition}} in elections. First, <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> may find it harder to find competent candidates, including minority candidates, to form teams to contest GRCs. Goh Chok Tong has acknowledged that the GRC scheme benefits the PAP as they can put together stronger teams. With the GRC system the threshold for votes for the opposition is also increased, and <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> {{have to take a}} gamble and commit huge proportions of their resources to contest GRCs. Each candidate in a GRC is required to deposit a sum equal to 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the calendar year preceding the election, rounded to the nearest S$500. At the 2011 general election, the deposit was $16,000. Unsuccessful candidates have their deposits forfeited if they do not receive at least one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled in the GRC. Critics have noted that the number of walkovers has generally increased since the introduction of GRCs. To date, only one opposition party, the Workers' Party, has won a GRC: Aljunied, in the 2011 general election.|$|E
