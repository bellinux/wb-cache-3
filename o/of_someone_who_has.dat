They meet Rita, Howie, Joe, and Gibbis, who have also appeared in the hotel, without any idea how they arrived. The Doctor learns that each hotel room contains the greatest fear <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been in the hotel, and that a minotaur-like creature is feeding off their fear.|$|E

25|$|The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy {{party that}} Houston was {{expected}} to attend, which featured many {{of the biggest names}} in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the mixtape received an average score of 83, based on 12 reviews. Jim Carroll of The Irish Times dubbed it [...] "a dashing statement of intent." [...] AllMusic's Andre Barnes wrote of its appeal to hip hop purists and listeners, [...] "For the saints, Live Love ASAP {{is nothing short}} of a guilty pleasure ... But for the aesthetically inclined, Live Love ASAP is a marvel of contemporary rap music, despite its abounding moral decay."

[...] Brad O'Mance for Popjustice likened the song to Massive Attack's 1991 song [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] "with a different song on top", while Official Charts Company writer Rob Copsey described it as [...] "gutsy and uplifting". However, Michael Clemons of The Daily Reveille thought that while {{it was not a}} stand out track, it was a good listen. Chuck Campbell of Knoxville News Sentinel thought that the track's lyrical theme, and the album's theme as a whole, was flawed as a concept, writing [...] "The problem with repeatedly declaring you don’t need the approval <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> wronged you is that your message is false. Clearly if Lewis indulges in six straight bitter songs about defiantly rebounding from a bad relationship (which she does on “I Am”), she obviously craves validation from the very person (or people) who did her dirty." ...|$|E

Rumors circulated that Origin planned to cancel the project. Following a proposal by the team around this time, Spector, who had previously worked with Neurath on Space Rogue, assumed the role of producer. Church later described this event as [...] "a big win for everyone". Spector began to interact regularly with the team by phone and to visit the studio in person. Neurath later said, [...] "Warren understood immediately {{what we were trying to}} accomplish with the game, and became our biggest champion within Origin. Had not Warren stepped in this role at that stage, I'm not sure Ultima Underworld would have ever seen the light of day." [...] Church said that Spector helped the team polish the game and [...] "make it real", and that Spector's past experience in the industry enabled him to keep the team focused on completing the game.

500|$|Agnes Bron, a Scientology {{representative}} in France, {{denied that the}} test was related to Ballo's death, and asserted that the Scientology personality test was not created by the Church of Scientology. Scientologists pay royalties to the Hubbard Foundation {{for use of the}} test. She said that Ballo never actually received the results of her personality test. A spokesperson for Scientology asserted to Verdens Gang that the results of the personality test are seen as neither positive nor negative, but rather allow the individual to gain insight into their own personality. A representative of Scientology in Norway described the concerns leveled against the organization as [...] "deeply unfair". The Scientology official noted Ballo had a psychological history as a teenager, and said she had an eating disorder. The Church of Scientology's Information Chief in Norway, Matthias Fosse, asserted that the Scientology personality test was not [...] "dangerous", and stated that [...] "millions" [...] of individuals had partaken in the examination. He asserted that approximately 10,000 residents of Norway had taken the test. [...] "I have never, never, never heard <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> killed {{on the basis of the}} OCA test," [...] said Fosse. Fosse said that Ballo had entered the Scientology premises in Nice of her own volition. Fosse maintained that the negative views of the organization were based on ignorance and intolerance.

2500|$|Rivette's {{early years}} in Paris were impoverished and {{he was known to}} live ascetically on minimal resources; Chabrol said that he was very thin and hardly ate, {{comparing}} his smile to that of the Cheshire Cat. Gruault described Rivette as [...] "slight, dark-haired and had very lively dark eyes in an emaciated visage of a waxy pallor…add to that a forced, nervous smile <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> to make constant efforts to win acceptance by a society that he seemed to regard as irremediably hostile." [...] His opinions were highly regarded among his peers and according to Douchet, [...] " [...] was the great talker. He was the group's secret soul, the occult thinker, a bit of a censor." [...] Godard said, [...] "I might like a film very much, but if Rivette said 'It's no good' then I would agree with him ... it was as though he had a privileged access to cinematographic truth." [...] Truffaut considered Rivette his best friend, and they were frequently seen at screenings.

2500|$|Photographers find perp walks {{their second}} most-dreaded {{assignment}} after {{going to the}} home <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> recently died {{to ask for a}} picture. They must wait a long time for a period of a few seconds in which they will be competing with a potentially large group of other photographers and television crews. This presents the possibility that they can be trampled beneath the group, as depicted in the 1994 film The Paper, and the difficulty of photographing a defendant who may be looking downward to keep his face from view. Marty Lederhandler, an Associated Press photographer who worked for {{the last half of the}} 20th century and shot the perp walks of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, as well as David Berkowitz, describes the perp walk as [...] "it's, 'He'll be out in 10 minutes.' You line up. He comes out and into the car, and you've got your picture. Nice." [...] When he began in the years after World War II, Lederhandler says, the media was more polite during perp walks than they are now. [...] "We all had the same lenses those days, and everybody would stand 8 or 10 feet back, and nobody was pushing or shoving." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jamie Fullerton of the NME commended {{the work}} of {{producers}} James Ford and Paul Epworth, writing that on tracks like [...] "Dog Days Are Over" [...] and [...] "Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)", they [...] "create epic cauldron-swirls of Terminator-theme drums, Massive Attack atmospherics and twinkle-eye harp matched by Florence's grappling of skyward choruses", but found that [...] "with the likes of 'I'm Not Calling You A Liar' and 'Howl' boasting similarly windy production yet no identifiable tunes the results sound aimless—if harmless." [...] Drowned in Sound's Ed Miller commented on the comparisons drawn between Welch and Kate Bush, arguing, [...] "Like Bush, but minus the mark of genius, listening to Florence and the Machine can sometimes feel like being led by the hand through a story world by a girl who has forgotten to grow up." [...] However, Miller critiqued that [...] "he only major problems are {{the inclusion of a}} cover of 'You've Got The Love', which {{is an example of a}} bonus track ruining the flow of an album, and 'Hurricane Drunk', a vehicle for a very questionable chorus." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club felt that [...] "t times, Lungs borders on exhausting, careening as it does from one over-the-top track to the next. [...] But with a voice as strong and emotive as hers, it's not surprising that Welch has little use for moments of quiet contemplation." [...] While criticizing instances of [...] "over-smoothed" [...] production on certain tracks, The Observers Sheryl Garratt concluded that [...] "there's a real joy about this debut.

2500|$|Jackman first created {{three pieces}} of music for {{directors}} Anthony and Joe Russo: a modern Captain America theme; a six-to-seven minute suite for the Winter Soldier; and a track representing Hydra. Concerning Captain America, Jackman struggled to balance having [...] "enough theme so that you’ve got something heroic to cling onto, {{but not so much}} that it’s just becoming nostalgic and irrelevant", and stated that in the third act [...] "the more melodic, the more lyrical, the more thematic element [...] to come through". The one note Feige gave Jackman on the score was asking him to embrace [...] "those moments that are emotional or historical or nostalgic", such as when the character visits his own Smithsonian exhibit. For those, Jackman took some inspiration from the works of Aaron Copland. Jackman described the Winter Soldier as [...] "a mechanized, violent, relentless, nihilistic beast that just destroys everything in its path", so approaching the character in a Wagnerian way would be [...] "inappropriate ... instead [...] to embrace it and start exploiting all these other tricks I've learned in working in the record industry and making drum and bass records." [...] In the Winter Soldier suite, [...] "the strings only show up for the last minute. It is violent—it's got screaming and banging and it's dystopian and dysfunctional. Much closer to a modern electronic thing than anything orchestral." [...] Jackman spent ten days just processing vocal recordings to give the theme a sense of [...] "tortured, time-stretched human cries <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been so processed that it's become mechanized at the same time but you can still hear the human in there". He also tried to give the piece an arc, where the human elements get more [...] "revealed {{toward the end of the}} film" [...] as Captain America and the audience come to learn who the Winter Soldier is and care about him. When Jackman played the suite for the directors, they loved the unique and non-film music sound, and asked that Jackman not sanitize or water it down for the film—Joe said, [...] "I really want to hear that in the movie and not just 20% of" [...] it. For Hydra, Jackman wanted to move away from the [...] "Wagnerian symphonic baddie music" [...] of the first film, and [...] "come up with a sinister tonality that didn’t feel like the muhahahaha of an arch villain, because the sinister nature of the neo-fascist within the film is modern, credible and politically contemporary." [...] Jackman also introduces a motif for the Falcon.|$|E
