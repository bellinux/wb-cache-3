25|$|Research {{suggests}} that sleep patterns vary significantly across cultures. The most striking differences are between societies that have plentiful sources of artificial light and <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not. The primary difference {{appears to be}} that pre-light cultures have more broken-up sleep patterns. For example, people without artificial light might go to sleep far sooner after the sun sets, but then wake up several times throughout the night, punctuating their sleep with periods of wakefulness, perhaps lasting several hours.|$|E
25|$|Michigan rarely {{experiences}} earthquakes, {{thus far}} mostly smaller <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not cause significant damage. A 4.6-magnitude earthquake struck in August 1947. More recently, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake occurred on Saturday, May 2, 2015, shortly after noon, about 5 {{miles south of}} Galesburg, Michigan (9 miles southeast of Kalamazoo) in central Michigan, about 140 miles west of Detroit, according to the Colorado-based U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. No major damage or injuries were reported, according to Governor Rick Snyder's office.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the damage}} caused by Cyclone Namu {{occurred}} due to river flooding. The cyclone affected 48% of the Solomon's land area and 62% of its total population. Even though there are few rivers in the Solomon Islands, the <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> exist are shallow and flood easily. Of all the islands, Malaita was the worst affected by the cyclone due to Namu's rough seas and strong winds. Along the eastern coast of the island, damage was massive; entire villages were destroyed. Gardens were devastated and walking pathways were blocked. On Sikiana Island, a small island with a few hundred residents, only one house was left standing. In Babanakira, 5people died.|$|E
500|$|Cuthbert's letter also relates a five-line poem in {{the vernacular}} that Bede {{composed}} on his deathbed, known as [...] "Bede's Death Song". It is the most-widely copied Old English poem, and appears in 45 manuscripts, but its attribution to Bede is not certain—not all manuscripts name Bede as the author, and the <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> are of later origin than those that do not. Bede's remains may have been transferred to Durham Cathedral in the 11th century; his tomb there was looted in 1541, but the contents were probably re-interred in the Galilee chapel at the cathedral.|$|E

2500|$|NIH {{research}} {{published in}} Science reports {{the isolation of}} 3 antibodies that neutralize 90% of HIV-1 strains at the CD4bs region of gp120, potentially offering a therapeutic and vaccine strategy. [...] However, most antibodies that bind the CDbs region of gp120 do not neutralize HIV, and rare <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> such as IgG1-b12 have unusual properties such as asymmetry of the Fab arms or in their positioning. [...] Unless a gp120-based vaccine can be designed to elicit antibodies with strongly neutralizing antiviral properties, there is concern that breakthrough infection leading to humoral production of high levels of non-neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD4 binding site of gp120 is associated with faster disease progression to AIDS.|$|E
2500|$|The Grateful Dead's {{early music}} (in the mid-1960s) {{was part of}} the process of {{establishing}} what [...] "psychedelic music" [...] was, but theirs was essentially a [...] "street party" [...] form of it. They developed their [...] "psychedelic" [...] playing as a result of meeting Ken Kesey in Palo Alto, California, and subsequently becoming the house band for the Acid Tests he staged. The Dead were not inclined to fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melding several of them. It was doubtless with this in mind that Bill Graham said of the Grateful Dead, [...] "They're not the best at what they do, they're the only <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> what they do." [...] Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.|$|E

[...] An extra pawn is harder to convert to a win in a rook and pawn endgame than {{any other type of}} endgame except a bishop endgame with bishops on {{opposite}} colors. [...] Rook endings are probably the deepest and most well studied endgames. They are a common type of endgame in practice, occurring in about 10 percent of all games (including <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not reach an endgame) [...] [...] These endgames occur frequently because rooks are often the last pieces to be exchanged. [...] The ability to play these endgames well is a major factor distinguishing masters from amateurs [...] When both sides have two rooks and pawns, the stronger side usually has more winning chances than if each had only one rook [...]|$|E
2500|$|Generally {{early action}} {{is similar to}} early {{decision}} except the decision is not binding, so a student could apply to multiple colleges. The time frame is similar: apply by early November, get a decision by mid-December, although specific deadlines vary by school. It allows a student to compare competing offers. The exception {{is that there are}} four colleges – Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale—which have a single-choice early action program, meaning that an applicant can only apply early action to one school. Early action can be the best choice for students who know they prefer one particular school and have done everything possible to secure admission since a student will know the result of the application sooner, and to varying extents allows a student to compare aid offers from different schools. One report suggested that non-binding early action programs continued to be highly popular, and noticed that three schools––Harvard, Princeton, and the University of Virginia—which had abandoned early admissions programs in 2006, reestablished them in 2011 after other colleges failed to follow their lead. Generally fewer schools offer the early action program but <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> include Georgetown University, MIT, and Boston College. One account suggested that early action did not give as much of an [...] "admissions edge" [...] as early decision because it was non-binding.|$|E
