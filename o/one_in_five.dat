5|$|In 1900, only <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> American {{families}} had a Christmas tree.

Early in the twentieth century, however, Christmas tree farms began supplying large metropolitan areas with real trees. In the 1920s, real trees became commonplace, supplanting artificial trees in American homes.|$|E

5|$|Kansai, {{the region}} of Japan's capitals from ancient times to the 19th century, has the most National Treasures; Kyoto alone has about <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> National Treasures. Fine arts and crafts {{properties}} are generally owned privately or are in museums, including national museums such as Tokyo, Kyoto, and Nara, public prefectural and city museums, and private museums. Religious items are often housed in temples and Shinto shrines or in an adjacent museum or treasure house.|$|E
5|$|Only <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> Croatian Jews {{survived the}} Holocaust of World War II. Between 1948 and 1952, nearly {{one half of}} the {{surviving}} members of Jewish Community of Zagreb opted for emigration to Israel, and the community dropped to one-tenth of its pre-war membership. The Yugoslav communist regime nationalized virtually all real estate owned by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, including the plot in Praška Street. All this, combined with the new regime's general hostility toward religion, made reconstruction of the synagogue nearly impossible.|$|E
5|$|The Mont Blanc massif {{is now a}} {{significant}} tourist destination. The region attracts over sixmillion people per annum, with around <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> gaining access to its slopes by means of mechanical infrastructure (cable cars or funicular railways). Some surveys have shown that tourists mostly come to the Mont Blanc massif and its environs for winter sports such as skiing as well as summer outdoor activities like hiking, climbing and cycling.|$|E

5|$|A 2007 {{report found}} that about one-third of District {{residents}} were functionally illiterate, compared to a national rate of about <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five.</b> This is attributed in part to immigrants who are not proficient in English. , 85% of D.C. residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language. Half of residents had at least a four-year college degree in 2006. D.C. residents had a personal income per capita of $55,755; higher {{than any of the}} 50 states.

5|$|After the 1942 season, Lavelli {{was drafted}} by the U.S. Army as American {{involvement}} in World War II intensified. After basic training {{and a number of}} other specialized courses on land-sea assaults, he was sent with the 28th Infantry Division to fight in the European Theatre of World War II. There his division landed on Omaha Beach, part of the Allied invasion of Germany-occupied France in 1944. He was involved with American forces in Germany's Battle of the Bulge offensive and in the Siege of Bastogne later the same year. <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> members of his division was killed in battle.|$|E

5|$|By {{the close}} of 1961, the Food for Peace program was {{operating}} in a dozen countries, and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before. In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded school lunch program thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it, and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world. During an audience in Rome, Pope John XXIII warmly praised McGovern's work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> cars from UK roads.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} in about 93% of blood transfusions using infected blood. In developed countries {{the risk of}} acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed; for example, in the UK the risk is reported at <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> million and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008. In low income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008), and {{it is estimated that}} up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections. Although rare because of screening, it is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation.|$|E

5|$|Losses on {{both sides}} were heavy. Arrogant had been damaged early in the battle and lost seven killed and 27 wounded while Victorious which bore {{the brunt of the}} French attack, {{suffered}} 17 killed and 57 wounded, the latter including Clark. Neither British ship was in sufficient repair to continue the engagement; Arrogant had several cannon dismounted and her sail's and rigging were tattered. Victorious was less badly damaged, but had more than <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> of the crew unfit for duty. All of the French ships suffered damage and casualties, although Régénérée reported no losses in the aftermath. Vertu was damaged early on and took 24 casualties, Seine was hit by heavy fire later in the battle and lost 62 dead and wounded, with the captain among the former. The remainder of the squadron suffered lighter losses, with 12 on Prudente, 17 on Cybèle and 23 on Forte.|$|E
5|$|Osteopathic {{physicians}} have historically entered primary care fields {{at a higher}} rate than their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims to a greater emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining. Currently, only <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{casualties}} on that first day are not known. Birdwood, who did not come ashore {{until late in the}} day, estimated between three and four hundred dead on the beaches. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage claims <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five</b> of the three thousand New Zealanders involved became a casualty. The Australian War Memorial has 860 Australian dead between 25–30 April, and the Australian Government estimates 2,000 wounded left Anzac Cove on 25 April, but more wounded were still waiting on the battlefields to be evacuated. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission documents that 754 Australian and 147 New Zealand soldiers died on 25 April 1915. A higher than normal proportion of the ANZAC casualties were from the officer ranks. One theory was that they kept exposing themselves to fire, trying to find out where they were or to locate their troops. Four men were taken prisoner by the Turks.|$|E

There are 456 squadrons located across the country with an approximate enrolment of 23,000 Air Cadets.|$|E
5|$|The summit {{observatory}} {{was built}} in the summer of 1883, and would remain in operation for 21 years. The first path to the summit was built {{at the same time as}} the observatory and was designed to allow ponies to carry up supplies, with a maximum gradient of <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>five.</b> The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all the more so after the arrival of the West Highland Railway in Fort William in 1894. Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a rack railway to the summit, none of which came to fruition.|$|E
