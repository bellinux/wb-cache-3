It was strategically important during the early stages of the war, due to its proximity to fresh water and the Gulf of Mexico. After reaching its low point during the Great Depression, the lakeside community modestly rebounded in 1947 following the nearby discovery <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> <b>A</b> fictional lake of the same name and with a similar history is featured in the 1998 novel Holes.|$|E
5|$|Jadranski naftovod (JANAF) {{operates}} an oil terminal at Omišalj, Krk Island. In 2010, the JANAF transported 6.4million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>a</b> 7% {{drop from}} 6.9million tonnes in 2009. In 2010, JANAF recorded annual revenue of 464.9million kuna (62.8million euro), down less than 1% from 2009, and annual net profit of 118.5million kuna (16million euro), up 11% {{from the previous}} year. However, JANAF operations include other facilities and services besides the oil terminal concession in the Port of Rijeka. JANAF is a joint stock company owned by the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute (50.5%), INA (16%), the Republic of Croatia (14.5%) and other shareholders owning less than 10% of stock each. JANAF's {{chairman of the board}} is Ante Markov. As of March 31, 2011, JANAF had 383 employees working in the Omišalj terminal and other JANAF facilities in Croatia.|$|E

Repsol at the time said the area could ultimately produce 100,000 barrels <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>a</b> day, which would meet 10 percent of Spain's energy needs. However, the analysis of samples obtained did not show the necessary volume nor quality to consider future extraction, and the project was scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Since 1993, China {{has been}} a net {{importer}} <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>a</b> large portion of which comes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed crude in China. Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5millionbarrels (560,000m3) per day by 2010. China is interested in diversifying the sources of its oil imports and has invested in oil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from Central Asia and has invested in Kazakhstani oil fields. Beijing also plans to increase China's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of China's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001–2005), {{with the goal of}} expanding gas use from a 2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of U.S. energy production). Analysts expect China's consumption of natural gas to more than double by 2010.|$|E
25|$|The Third Modification Law (1974) {{extended}} individual entitlements {{to social}} assistance {{by means of}} higher-income limits compatible with receipt of benefits and lowered age limits for certain special benefits. Rehabilitation measures were also extended, child supplements were expressed as percentages of standard amounts and were thus indexed to their changes, and grandparents of recipients were exempted from potential liability to reimburse expenditure of social assistance carrier. The Third Social Welfare Amendment Act (1974) brought considerable improvements for the handicapped, those in need of care, and older persons, and a new fund of 100 million marks for disabled children was established. Allowances for retraining and advanced training and for refugees from East Germany were also increased, together with federal grants for sport. In addition, increases {{were made in the}} pensions of 2.5 million war victims. Following a sudden increase in the price <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>a</b> law was passed in December 1973 granting recipients of social assistance and housing allowances a single heating-oil allowance (a procedure repeated in the winter of 1979 during the Schmidt Administration). Improvements and automatic adjustments of maintenance allowances for participants in vocational training measures were also carried out, and increased allowances were provided for training and retraining, together with special allowances for refugees from East Germany.|$|E

500|$|An ancient Greek and Roman adage runs [...] "The swans {{will sing}} when the jackdaws are silent", meaning that educated or wise people will speak {{only after the}} foolish have become quiet. In Ancient Greek folklore, a jackdaw can be caught with a dish <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> <b>A</b> narcissistic creature, it falls in while looking at its own reflection. The mythical Princess Arne Sithonis was bribed with gold by King Minos of Crete, and was punished by the gods for her greed by being {{transformed}} into an equally avaricious jackdaw, who still seeks shiny things. The Roman poet Ovid described jackdaws as harbingers of rain in his poetic work Amores. Pliny notes how the Thessalians, Illyrians, and Lemnians cherished jackdaws for destroying grasshoppers' eggs. The Veneti are fabled to have bribed the jackdaws to spare their crops.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and {{his group}} (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) {{announced}} they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: [...] "We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land." [...] The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>a</b> rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting {{of them was a}} few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.|$|E
