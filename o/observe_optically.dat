40|$|The {{oxidation}} of AgNPs at a thin-film gold electrode {{is simultaneously}} investigated via digital holography and electrochemistry. The use of holography allows, {{for the first}} time, the 3 D visualization of the electrochemical interfacial region at a relatively high acquisition rate. It is demonstrated how the coupling of these two techniques provides complementary chemical information. The ensemble response of the oxidation of surface-adsorbed silver nanoparticles to AgCl is monitored electrochemically, whereas this process is difficult to <b>observe</b> <b>optically.</b> Conversely, the subsequent chemical dissolution of individual AgCl nanocrystals can be tracked optically due to the associated decrease in the scattered light intensity. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|At high {{concentration}} {{or in the}} presence of electrolytes and organic solvents, solutions of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) can form gels exhibiting optical properties similar to the ones of liquid crystal phases. In an attempt to pattern such a gel phase, we have studied the electrodissolution of a metallic electrode in a water suspension of carboxylated CNCs (cCNCs). Depending on the metal used, the electrodissolution process was observed at a different positive potential. In the case of copper the minimum potential at which we could <b>observe</b> <b>optically</b> the growth of the gel phase was 200 mV. The growth rate was current limited indicating that the process was controlled by the electrodissolution of the copper electrode. This hypothesis was confirmed by using circular and square copper patterns as positive electrodes. In both cases, the consumption of the electrode material was observed optically and correlated with the growth of the gel phase...|$|E

A compact source associated with HR Car is clearly detected at {{the western edge of the}} nebula, but the nebula is very asymmetric with respect to the star, lying almost entirely to the east. The inner nebula shows no evidence for the bipolar structure inferred to exist from observations of the outer nebula: the symmetry axes in the inner nebula are 45 away from the bipolar axes.

40|$|In the {{majority}} of optomechanical experiments, the interaction between light and mechanical motion is mediated by radiation pressure, which arises from momentum transfer of reflecting photons. This is an inherently weak interaction, and optically generated carriers in semiconductors have been predicted to be the mediator of different and potentially much stronger forces. Here we demonstrate optomechanical forces induced by electron-hole pairs in coupled quantum wells embedded into a free-free nanomembrane. We identify contributions from the deformation-potential and piezoelectric coupling and <b>observe</b> <b>optically</b> driven motion more than 500 times larger than expected from radiation pressure. The amplitude and phase of the driven oscillations are controlled by an applied electric field, which tunes the carrier lifetime to match the mechanical period. Our work opens perspectives for not only enhancing the optomechanical interaction {{in a range of}} experiments, but also for interfacing mechanical objects with complex macroscopic quantum objects, such as excitonic condensates.

40|$|We studied {{experimentally}} {{the shock}} waves and combustion waves {{generated by a}} hypersonic spherical projectile in an explosive mixture. An acetylene/oxygen mixture diluted with argon (2 C 2 H 2 + 5 O 2 + 7 Ar) was used with various initial pressures (detonation cell sizes) to <b>observe</b> <b>optically</b> with a shadowgraph imaging system a shock-induced combustion (SIC), a stable oblique detonation wave (ODW), and a wave called a Straw Hat type consisting of a strong SIC and ODW. The criticality of stabilizing an ODW around a projectile is expressed by {{the ratio of the}} projectile diameter, d, to the cell size, λ, as d/λ = 3. 63 – 4. 84. Although the Straw Hat type wave in the vicinity of criticality is an unstable phenomena, it has been mainly observed by a single frame picture to date, so {{that it is difficult to}} discuss the time history of its wave structure.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{materials}} are a promising class of direct energy conversion materials, usually consisting of highly doped semiconductors. The key to maximizing their thermal to electrical energy conversion lies in optimizing three inter-related material properties, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient. All three properties {{are affected by}} the carrier concentration of the thermoelectric material. In practice, tedious trial-and-error testing is needed to determine the optimal carrier concentration for the maximum figure-of-merit, ZT. Theory and computer simulations of thermoelectric properties can aid the determination of new thermoelectric materials, but several challenges remain. The bandgap is a key piece of bandstructure information, but is difficult to determine for heavily doped thermoelectric materials. Under heavy doping conditions, the effective mass and bandgap both change due to the formation of Urbach band tails and other defect states within the bandgap. Furthermore, bandgaps of heavily doped {{materials are}} difficult to <b>observe</b> <b>optically,</b> due to significant amounts of carriers in defects states within the bandgap. Conventional optical measurement techniques relying on transmittance change require extremely thin samples, on the order of microns for thermoelectrics. Photoacoustic spectroscopy is used in this work to optically probe the thermoelectric bandgap, without the need to produce thin samples. Photoacoustic spectroscopy allows simultaneous measurements of the thermal conductivity and optical absorption coefficient. In this work, a relative measurement is devised to reduce the need to carefully control experimental parameters such as light input and microphone gain. Semiconductor theory is discussed to account for the band-filling effects, and a method is proposed to extrapolate the true electronic bandgap from the Burstein-Moss shift of the absorption edge due to heavily doping. by George Ni.
