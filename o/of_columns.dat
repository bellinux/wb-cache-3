5|$|In 1994, the {{overpass}} {{bridge over}} Pottery Road, {{north of the}} Bayview/Bloor interchange was rebuilt. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement <b>of</b> <b>columns</b> and a restructuring of the deck. It was worn down due to {{the cumulative effect of}} heavy traffic and weather. The replacement necessitated the closure of several lanes of the parkway from April until the autumn that year.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1897, it {{is a rare}} {{surviving}} {{example of}} a late Victorian orangery in the Classical style, constructed from ashlar and red brick. It has a seven-bay east/west plan with central entrances and three bays north/south, topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped-roof. An entablature with protruding horizontal geison sits above Ionic half-column supports and corner pilasters. The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the kitchen garden breaks forward as a portico, with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken pediment with a small oculus. Between each pair <b>of</b> <b>columns</b> are large round-headed windows with Gibbs surrounds and keystones.|$|E
30|$|Column rocking with lifting {{would happen}} if {{horizontal}} load {{is big enough to}} make the edge <b>of</b> <b>column</b> foot lift from the stone base. Compression stress distributions of the three sub-states with lifting are shown in Fig.  18, which is corresponding to the concept analysis shown in Fig.  6. Compression stress distribution <b>of</b> <b>column</b> foot with large cross section is shown in Fig.  18 a. Compression deformation is mainly located in the large area <b>of</b> <b>column</b> foot at the initial stage <b>of</b> <b>column</b> lifting. The maximum compression stress occurs to the edge <b>of</b> <b>column</b> foot. Compressions stress distribution <b>of</b> the <b>column</b> foot with half-cross section <b>of</b> <b>column</b> foot is shown in Fig.  18 b, and compression stress distributions <b>of</b> <b>column</b> foot with small cross section at the maximum controlled displacement is shown in Fig.  18 c and the maximum compression stress is equal to the ultimate compression stress parallel to the grain <b>of</b> <b>column</b> at this stage.|$|R

5|$|Dating from 857 of the Tang Dynasty, the Great East Hall (东大殿) is {{the third}} oldest dated wooden {{building}} in China after the main hall of the Nanchan Temple dated to 782, and the main hall of the Five Dragons Temple, dated to 831. The hall {{is located on the}} far east side of the temple, atop a large stone platform. It is a single storey structure measuring seven bays by four or 34 by 17.7 metres (110 by 58ft), and is supported by inner and outer sets <b>of</b> <b>columns.</b> On top of each column is a complicated set of brackets containing seven different bracket types that are one-third as high as the column itself. Supporting the roof of the hall, each of the bracket sets are connected by crescent shaped crossbeams, which create an inner ring above the inner set <b>of</b> <b>columns</b> and an outer ring above the outer columns. The hall has a lattice ceiling that conceals much of the roof frame from view. The hipped-roof and the extremely complex bracket sets are testament to the Great East Hall's importance as a structure during the Tang Dynasty. According to the 11th-century architectural treatise, Yingzao Fashi, the Great East Hall closely corresponds to a seventh rank building in a system of eight ranks. The high rank of the Great East Hall indicates that even in the Tang Dynasty it was an important building, and no other buildings from the period with such a high rank survive.|$|E

30|$|More {{and more}} {{research}} interests have {{been devoted to}} the study <b>of</b> <b>column</b> in heritage buildings in recent years. Friction-sliding seismic isolation model has been proposed and the slippage criterion <b>of</b> a <b>column</b> foot is given [12]. It is assumed that the moment carried by the column foot {{is the same as}} that at the column head, and restoring moment at the column foot is determined according to the analytical moment at the top <b>of</b> <b>column</b> [13]. Lee et al. [14] proposes a technique for obtaining the skeleton curve of moment–rotation relation at the stone base of traditional timber buildings from local compression tests of wooden components. Those studies mainly focused on the friction-sliding characteristics, restoring moment <b>of</b> <b>column</b> head and stiffness characteristics <b>of</b> <b>column.</b> However, study on the whole process <b>of</b> <b>column</b> rocking under external loads is rare, and the rotational behaviors <b>of</b> <b>column</b> foot joint during rocking have not been studied. Furthermore, a recent trend in analyzing timber structures involves considering the timber connections as semi-rigid joints. But, few researches have focused on the semi-rigidity <b>of</b> <b>column</b> foot joint in traditional timer structure, and many studies take column foot as rigid or hinge joint during structural analysis. In fact, the rotation behavior <b>of</b> <b>column</b> foot needs to be better known to properly analyze the whole structure, and there is an urgent to study the mechanical behavior and propose a theoretical model for predicting the restoring moment and the rotational performance <b>of</b> <b>column</b> foot joint.|$|R

30|$|This {{research}} was conducted to investigate the treatment of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) by iron powder (Fe(0)) <b>columns</b> <b>of</b> simulated permeable reactive barriers with and without calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Two columns filled with Fe(0) were used as Cr(VI) removal equipment running at a flow velocity of 10  ml/min at room temperature. After 200  days running <b>of</b> the two <b>columns,</b> {{the results showed that}} Fe(0) was an effective material for Cr(VI) reduction with an average removal rate of above 84.6 %. The performance <b>of</b> <b>Column</b> 2 with CaCO 3 was better than Column 1 without CaCO 3 in terms of average Cr(VI) removal rate. The presence of CaCO 3 buffered the increasing pH caused by Fe(0) corrosion in Column 2 and enhanced the removal rate <b>of</b> <b>Column</b> 2. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of Fe(0) in the three stages of running <b>of</b> the two <b>columns</b> illustrated that the coat layer <b>of</b> <b>Column</b> 1 was a little thicker than that <b>of</b> <b>Column</b> 2. Energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) results showed that the surface <b>of</b> Fe(0) <b>of</b> <b>Column</b> 2 contained more chromium elements.

5|$|A {{signature}} {{feature of}} Parthian architecture was the iwan, an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side. Use {{of the barrel}} vault replaced the Hellenic use <b>of</b> <b>columns</b> to support roofs. Although the iwan was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale. The earliest Parthian iwans are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD. Monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style. The largest Parthian iwans at that site have a span of 15m (50ft).|$|E
5|$|By the 5th century, {{structures}} with small-scale domed cross plans existed {{across the}} Christian world. Examples include the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, the martyrium {{attached to the}} Basilica of San Simpliciano, and churches in Macedonia and {{on the coast of}} Asia Minor. Small brick domes are also found in towers of Constantinople's early 5th century land walls. Underground cisterns in Constantinople, such as the Cistern of Philoxenos and the Basilica Cistern, were composed of a grid <b>of</b> <b>columns</b> supporting small domes, rather than groin vaults. The square bay with an overhead sail vault or dome on pendentives became the basic unit of architecture in the early Byzantine centuries, found in a variety of combinations.|$|E

5|$|During the Renaissance, architects {{aimed to}} use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an {{integrated}} system. The Roman orders types <b>of</b> <b>columns</b> are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These {{can either be}} structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall {{in the form of}} pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti {{was one of the first}} to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the {{distinctive}} Scottish use of stone architecture declined as it was replaced by cheaper alternatives such as Portland cement, concrete, and mass-production brick. Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals. In {{the twentieth century}} private architecture was increasingly client driven. James Robert Rhind (1854–1918), the son of David Rhind, was successful in the competition for new libraries to be constructed in Glasgow following Andrew Carnegie's gift of £100,000 to the city in 1901. His designs were selected for seven libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of Edwardian Baroque architecture. Rhind's libraries were all built with locally quarried sandstone, which blended in with the existing tenement neighbourhoods. His landmark buildings were greatly enhanced by his liberal use <b>of</b> <b>columns,</b> domes and sculpted features. James Miller (1860–1947) is noted for his Scottish railway stations, such as his 1901–05 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station, and the spectacular Wemyss Bay railway station on the Firth of Clyde.|$|E
