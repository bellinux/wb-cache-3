The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front tax deductions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of investment. Investors paid Great Southern a fee to lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct {{the cost of the}} lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The tax deductible status of the investment was widely regarded as the main attraction of MIS schemes to investors.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, <b>the</b> {{market price}} <b>of</b> risk {{is a key}} input to the model, as it is prone to {{estimation}} errors, and the model output is relatively sensitive {{with respect to this}} parameter. As an alternative to a direct input <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market price <b>of</b> risk, we consider in the following an implied calculation based on an available estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity. <b>The</b> reasoning is that most applications focus on an accurate estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity and give a little attention to <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt. We, therefore, analyze how an existing estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity can be used to calibrate the model and consistently obtain an estimate for <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt without explicitly estimating <b>the</b> market price <b>of</b> risk.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt that is applied for DCF valuation <b>of</b> businesses in <b>the</b> specific environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic. Neither theory nor practice {{has focused on}} this issue in detail. There is no systematic and comprehensive list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt estimation methods usable in practice. Valuers and analysts disregard estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt arguing {{that it can be}} easily estimated from the current bank loan interest rates or from the traded bonds. Neither method is perfect and fully applicable in the Czech Republic. This dissertation thesis shows how <b>the</b> DCF value <b>of</b> an enterprise is shaped by <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt. Almost all formulas analysed caused <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> an enterprise to change with <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt, which makes <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt very important. Further, based on an analysis of 183 valuation reports, the thesis documents <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital estimation in the Czech Republic. It shows that while <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity is mainly estimated in compliance with theory, estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt is done by simple and sometimes inappropriate methods, because there is no guidance in the literature. Finally, this thesis suggests various methods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt estimation {{that can be used in}} practice in the Czech Republic. It provides full application guidance to these methods, data that was calculated by the author or taken from other sources and evaluates advantages and disadvantages of these methods. This thesis concludes by recommending methods that should be used for <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt estimation in the Czech Republic as opposed to the simple methods currently used...|$|R
