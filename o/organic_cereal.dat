50|$|Smaller {{companies}} such as Nature's Path, an <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> and snack making business, have also made significant sustainability gains in the 21st century. CEO Arran Stephens and his associates have ensured that the quickly growing company's products are produced without toxic farm chemicals. Furthermore, employees are constantly encouraged {{to find ways to}} reduce consumption. Sustainability {{is an essential part of}} corporate discussions. Another example comes from Salt Spring Coffee, a company created in 1996 as a certified organic, fair trade, coffee producer. In recent years they have become carbon neutral, lowering emissions by reducing long-range trucking and using bio-diesel in delivery trucks, upgrading to energy efficient equipment and purchasing carbon offsets. The company claims to offer the first carbon neutral coffee sold in Canada. Salt Spring Coffee was recognized by the David Suzuki Foundation in the 2010 report Doing Business in a New Climate. A third example comes from Korea, where rice husks are used as a nontoxic packaging for stereo components and other electronics. The same material is later recycled to make bricks.|$|E
40|$|Soil carbon {{changes were}} {{modelled}} over 30 {{years with the}} focus on cereal crops, since leys are often managed similarly in organic and conventional agriculture. Other crops were not considered due to difficulties in large-scale cropping of oilseed rape and potatoes organically because of pest problems. Four scenarios were used: 0 %, 8 % (current), 20 % and 100 % <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> production. Conversion to <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> crop production was found {{to reduce the amount}} of carbon stored as organic matter in agricultural soils. Three factors contributed to decrease soil carbon levels in a given field: (i) a yield decrease, resulting in less C input through roots and above-ground crop residues; (ii) lower leaf area causing less water uptake, which resulted in higher water content in soil and an increased decomposition rate of soil organic matter; and (iii) more frequent and intensive mechanical cultivation for weed control, which resulted in increased mixing and exposure of soil organic matter to oxidative processes, speeding up decomposition. Due to lower yields in organic agriculture, more land must be used to produce the same amount. With 20 % <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> production, land currently in fallow would have to be taken into production, while with 100 % of cereals produced organically, all fallow land plus conversion of forest land to agriculture would be required. An 8 % level of <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> production would lead to losses of 0. 3 Tg C over a 30 -year period, 20 % would cause losses of 1. 1 Tg C and 100 % would cause losses of 12. 8 Tg C. The annual CO₂ losses from 100 % <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> production would be equivalent to the amount emitted by 675 000 average cars in Sweden annually. Losses of soil carbon under organic cultivation would continue for a much longer period than 30 years until a new equilibrium is reached...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{demand for}} {{organically}} produced food is outstripping {{the ability of}} UK farmers to supply it and the majority is imported. Furthermore, {{there is a major}} shortfall in home-produced organic cereals and cereal products, including straw. In response to this need, the consequences of increasing the area of organically produced cereal crops on pests, diseases and weeds require evaluation. Furthermore, as the area of organic cereals increases, crops may be grown more in the major cereal production regions. This could have consequences for both the organic producer and farmers growing cereals conventionally. Objectives (i) 	review the current state of knowledge on the status and distribution of pests, diseases and weeds in organic and conventionally grown cereals, (ii) 	assess the likely rate of expansion of <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> production and the areas where this is most likely to occur, together with any likely or consequent change in the distribution of conventionally grown cereals, (iii) 	assess the distribution of specific cereal cultivars and species in organic and non-organic production in relation to their impact on disease, pest and weed distribution. A specific sub-objective will be to assess the likely impact of the increased use of organically produced seed on seed-borne diseases, (iv) 	try to forecast whether or not the changes in cereal production will affect the current status and distribution of pests, diseases and weeds, and, if so, in which major directions, (v) 	make recommendations for future research, both to ensure that the forecast under paragraph (iii) is correct and that any negative trends are highlighted and, if possible, dealt with. Methods A literature review was undertaken to identify potential risks to conventional and organic production cereals on an extension of the organic area on risks of pests, diseases and weeds. See main report for results. Future work Monitoring of the more important pests and diseases in organic production would be prudent. Any problems for non-organic cereal producers are unlikely to arise for several years because of the small scale and slow increase of <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> production, but this should be regarded as a ‘grace’ period to allow for development of appropriate solutions before any potential problems become important in practice. Problems for organic producers may emerge more quickly; these need to be monitored so that cultivar and other recommendations can be developed. It is likely that the best spectrum of cultivars for non-organic and organic production will differ, which would help in restricting disease interactions between the two production systems. Any constraints on production of seed for <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> growing should be removed so far as possible. Development of the system of bi-cropping, both for organic and non-organic production, should be continued since there are good indications that this can restrict problems due to slugs, aphids and BYDV, septoria leaf and glume blotch, and probably take all. The importance of using disease resistant cultivars needs to be still further stressed for both organic and non-organic production. The influence of sowing date on disease development, particularly in the autumn, needs more attention. Renewed efforts to develop and introduce production of cultivar mixtures, particularly for <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> production, would help to restrict disease development. Fundamental studies on the biology of the major perennial weeds are still needed. Although seed spread can be minimised by frequent cutting, the effects of this on the spread of roots and rhizomes is poorly understood. It is important to maintain a regular watch or survey for indications of any increase in the key seed-borne diseases that may occur in <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> production and to determine the reasons for any such increase. Technology transfer The report will be suitable for wider dissemination among researchers and the agriculture industry.

40|$|International audienceThis {{report shows}} that weed {{harrowing}} in <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> fields is an efficient alternative to herbicides since weed harrowing does not reduce yields compared to weed-free plots. Arable weeds provide resources and habitat to many organisms. However, weeds {{are the most}} important constraint to crop production. Indeed, the potential crop losses of the eight major crops due to weed–crop competition amount to about 30  %. New ways of food production are needed due to the current severe biodiversity decline, about 1, 000 times higher than the natural rate of species loss, and the growing food demands. Herbicides are highly efficient at reducing crop losses due to weed–crop competition, but at the expense of declining biodiversity. Studies have shown a poor efficiency of weed harrows in terms of weed reduction in organic farming systems. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of weed harrows in organic fields to reduce weeds to a threshold that does not limit crop production, while maintaining a rich flora. The results were compared to results obtained using herbicides in conventionally managed fields. Eleven organic and conventional cereal field pairs in Catalonia, Spain, were evaluated for one season in 2006 – 2007. Three different weed control treatments were applied: weed-free plots; weed-controlled plots, using herbicide in conventional fields and weed harrowing in organic ones and non-weeded plots. Crop yield and the abundance, richness and composition of the weed flora, which was dominated by ryegrass and poppies, were evaluated. Our results show that weed harrowing prevents weeds from being a limiting factor of crop productivity in <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> fields, since weed-controlled plots did not reduce yields compared to weed-free plots. A similar trend was observed in herbicide-controlled plots. However, herbicides diminished weed species richness in approximately 47  % and changed the species composition whereas harrowing allowed the maintenance of high levels of weed diversity in the organic fields...|$|E
40|$|Organic foods {{have been}} in great demand lately, {{and more and more}} people tend to buy them to enjoy their healthy benefits. However, {{packages}} of organic food are not distinguishable from those of conventional food as a unique identity of the food that contains higher values. In grocery stores, most organic foods are placed with conventional foods together on shelves and present little attractions to consumers. As a result, they are often overlooked by organic food buyers due to designs similar to those of conventional food packages. Therefore, it is necessary to redesign organic food packages and explore design elements that can help the enhance product experience of organic foods. With that purpose, the current study focuses on an exploration of both materials and designs in <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> packaging design and tries to add emotional and sensory elements to the design by applying different materials, color palettes, and imagery styles.

40|$|Legumes are an {{important}} source of nitrogen in stockless <b>organic</b> <b>cereal</b> production. However, substantial amounts of N can be lost from legume-grass leys prior to or after incorporation as green manure (GM). Here we report N 2 O emissions from a field experiment in SE Norway exploring different green manure management strategies: mulching versus removal of grass-clover herbage during a whole growing season and replacement as biogas residue to a subsequent barley crop. Grass-clover ley had small but significantly higher N 2 O emissions as compared with a non-fertilized cereal reference during the year of green manure (GM) production in 2009. Mulching of herbage induced significantly more N 2 O emission (+ 0. 37 kg N 2 O-N ha − 1) throughout the growing season than removing herbage. In spring 2010 all plots were ploughed (with and without GM) and sown with barley, resulting in generally higher N 2 O emissions than during the previous year. Application of biogas residue (110 kg N ha − 1) before sowing did not increase emissions neither when applied to previous ley plots nor when applied to previously unfertilized cereal plots. Ley management (mulching vs. removing biomass in 2009) had no effect on N 2 O emissions during barley production in 2010. In general, GM ley (mulched or harvested) increased N 2 O emissions relative to a cereal reference with low mineral N fertilisation (80 kg N ha − 1). <b>Organic</b> <b>cereal</b> production emitted 95 g N 2 O-N kg − 1 N yield in barley grain, which was substantially higher than in the cereal reference treatment with 80 kg mineral N fertilization in 2010 (47 g N 2 O-N kg − 1 N yield in barley grain) ...|$|E
