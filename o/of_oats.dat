5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E
5|$|A chapel {{dedicated}} to St Catherine of Alexandria {{is known to}} have existed on the site since 1157, when the Prior of Durham agreed to allow Romanus de Hilton to appoint his own chaplain for the chapel, subject to the prior's approval. In return, de Hilton was to provide an annual contribution of 24sheaves <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> for every draught ox he owned, to the nearby monastery at Monkwearmouth, and was required to attend the mother church of St Peters for the feasts of the Nativity, Easter, Whitsuntide and Saints Peter and Paul. In 1322, there was a chantry {{dedicated to}} the Virgin Mary and there were three chantry priests in 1370.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because they could work despite being fed by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming <b>of</b> <b>oats,</b> a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E

5|$|In 1817, a steam packet service {{started to}} run between Driffield and Hull. Three return trips each week were made, but the journey times were too long, and an {{advertisement}} in 1825 indicated that the engine had been altered and an express steam packet service would commence. Three boats were recorded as trading between Driffield and Hull every other day in a directory of Yorkshire published in 1823. Traffic for 1832 included 7,394 chaldrons of coal, 18,173 quarters of wheat, 7,745 quarters <b>of</b> <b>oats,</b> 19,396 quarters of barley and 4,555 sacks of flour. An additional 1,564 quarters of wheat and 8,194 sacks of flour were carried to or from Foston Mill, reached from Frodingham Beck. A regular carrier also operated between the Leven Canal and Hull once a week.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E
5|$|Feeding horses {{was a major}} issue, {{and horse}} fodder was the single largest {{commodity}} shipped to the front by some countries, including Britain. Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies <b>of</b> <b>oats</b> from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. The Germans faced an even worse fodder crisis, as they had underestimated {{the amount of food}} they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage to ease animals' sense of hunger, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories on the Eastern Front, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive.|$|E

40|$|The control <b>of</b> wild <b>oats</b> (Avena Jatua L.) in Alaskan spring-planted barley was {{investigated}} {{in a series of}} experiments conducted from 1981 - 1984. Rates and times of applications of triallate (a preemergence, soil-incorporated herbicide), diclofop, barban, and difenzoquat (postemergence herbicides) were investigated in relation to control <b>of</b> wild <b>oats</b> and barley yield in 1981 - 1982. Because of very high wild <b>oats</b> populations. none <b>of</b> the herbicides controlled wild oats to the point of· allowing a barley harvest. [...] Generally, wild oats were best controlled when herbicides were applied at an early growth stage and at the highest application rates. Control <b>of</b> wild <b>oats</b> with triallate was the same whether incorporated using parallel or perpendicular passes of a spike-tooth harrow. In 1983 - 84 both single herbicide treatments and combinations of herbicides were studied. Barban, diclofop, and difenzoquat were applied alone or with triallate applied in the fall or spring in emulsifiable concentrate or granular formulation. Wild oats population levels were lower in these 2 years, and applications of even single herbicides provided good wild <b>oats</b> control. [...] <b>Of</b> the individual herbicides, diclofop provided the best control <b>of</b> wild <b>oats.</b> In general, when triallate was applied in conjunction with diclofop, barban, or difenzoquat, control <b>of</b> wild <b>oats</b> was better and higher barley yields were obtained than when a single wild oats herbicide was applied. When triallate was applied in the fall, the granular formulation provided better control <b>of</b> wild <b>oats</b> than the emulsifiable formulation. In a study of the response of eight barley varieties ('Eero', 'Paavo', 'Galt', 'Otra', 'Otal', 'Datal', 'Udal', 'Weal') to high rates and late times of application of the four herbicides, none of the varieties were differentially susceptible. Diclofop decreased heights of all varieties and decreased test weights...|$|R

5|$|The castle {{formed the}} {{backdrop}} for several scenes in William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Another Henry Percy inherited the family estates in 1585 and assumed the title of 9thEarl of Northumberland. After the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605, the earl was imprisoned for his connection with Thomas Percy, one of the plotters. Shortly before he was sentenced (he was fined £30,000 and held in the Tower of London), the earl leased Warkworth Castle to Sir Ralph Gray, who owned Chillingham Castle in Northumberland. Gray neglected the earl's building and allowed it to fall further into disrepair. The lead from the buildings in the bailey was sold in 1607 to alleviate the earl's financial problems. When JamesI visited in 1617 en route to Scotland, his entourage was angered by the sorry state of the castle. With the unification of England and Scotland under a single ruler, the earls of Northumberland had no need for two great castles near the Anglo-Scottish border; they maintained Alnwick {{at the expense of}} Warkworth. In {{the first quarter of the}} 17thcentury, the keep was used to hold manor courts and for the laying out <b>of</b> <b>oats.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing <b>of</b> <b>oats,</b> however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E
