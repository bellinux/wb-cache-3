Mazeika's method for forecasting mixed-layer (thermocline) {{depth of the}} upper ocean layers is discussed along with a newer version of this method developed by James. Using Mazeika's method primarily, a verification for the Northeast Pacific Ocean was completed with data from <b>Ocean</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Stations</b> PAPA (50 N, 145 W) and NOVEMBER (30 N, 140 W) and a point named MIDPOINT (40 N, 140 W). The results indicate Mazeika's method is successful at Station PAPA more than seventy-five {{percent of the time}} during the heating season followed by a rapid decline as the cooling season begins. The method should be useful in the entire Central Subarctic Domain as described by John P. Tully. The method fails at NOVEMBER and MIDPOINT producing less than thirty percent success in prediction. James' version did not improve the results obtained at Station NOVEMBER. This failure appears to be due to the controlling parameters for processes in the Subtropic or Transitional oceanographic regions (which include NOVEMBER and MIDPOINT); these differ from parameters controlling oceanic processes in the Pacific Subarctic region (Station PAPA), which resemble those involved in the Atlantic region for which Mazeika's method was developed. Climatology data which can be used to obtain surface and 400 -foot level temperature are also tested.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{interaction of the}} northward component of planetary rotation and the east-west Reynolds stress affects the isotrophy of the integral scale turbulence in the upper ocean by redistributing turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) among the components. This "rotation stress" mechanism is incorporated into a vertically integrated model of the ocean mixed layer. Simulations of <b>Ocean</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Stations</b> P (50 ˚N, 145 ˚W) and N (30 ˚N, 140 ˚W) are used to compare this model with the Garwood (1977) model and with observations. The significant effect is the augmentation (for easterly winds) or reduction (for westerly winds) of the ratio of vertical to horizontal TKE. The rate of entrainment {{is affected by the}} change in the vertical convergence of TKE at the interface between the mixed layer and the pycnocline. Rotation stress significantly alters the mixing on diurnal and synoptic time scales during late winter and early spring. With rotation stress, retreat events occur more frequently, and the mixed layer depth change during retreat is 10 - 30 % greater than without rotation stress. Typically, the ratio of vertical to total TKE is three times larger when rotation stress is included and the dissipation enhancement of Garwood (1977) is neglected. The resulting TKE distribution is more isotropic and in better agreement with laboratory results for neutrally stratified shear flows. This study demonstrates the need for measurements of the TKE budget in the upper ocean to confirm these findings and to further test the hypotheses of TKE models in oceanic applications.

Physically consistent relationships are found to exist between low cloud type, MBL structure, and surface meteorology at substantially different geographical locations and seasons. Relative MBL height and inferred decoupling between subcloud and cloud layers are increasingly greater for stratocumulus, cumulus-under-stratocumulus, and cumulus, respectively, at midlatitude locations {{as well as the}} eastern subtropical location during both summer and winter. At the midlatitude locations examined, cloudiness identified as fair-weather stratus often occurs in a deep, stratified cloud layer with little or no capping inversion. This strongly contrasts with cloudiness identified as stratocumulus, which typically occurs in a relatively well-mixed MBL under a strong capping inversion at both midlatitude and eastern sub-tropical locations. At the transition between subtropics and midlatitudes in the western North Pacific, cloudiness identified as fair-weather stratus occurs in a very shallow layer near the surface. Above this layer the associated profile of temperature and moisture is similar to that for cumulus at the same location, and neither of these cloud types is associated with a discernible MBL. Sky-obscuring fog and observations of no low cloudiness typically occur with surface-based inversions.

In the upper 100 m of the ocean the temperature fluctuation is predominantly a seasonal variation, the amplitude of which decreases with depth with a typical e-folding depth of 50 m. The non-seasonal temperature anomaly field has a two layer structure; the temperature anomalies in the surface layer, down to about 100 m, have time scales of 2 to 3 years, and those in the lower layer, deeper than 150 m, have time scales of 4 to 7 years and penetrate down to a few hundred meters. More than half of the wave-like temperature fluctuations at the annual frequency consist of a random field of first order baroclinic Rossby waves travelling in a NW direction with wave lengths of about 300 km and phase speeds of about 1 cm/sec. Both the quasi homogeneous and wave-like parts of the low frequency temperature fluctuations in the western part of the North Pacific Current area are much stronger than those in the eastern part. Along the Subarctic (42 °N) and Subtropical (32 °N) Fronts the wave-like temperature fluctuations propagate with phase speeds of about 10 cm/sec, and they reverse their direction of propagation with an annual cycle.
