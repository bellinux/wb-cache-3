2500|$|Although {{glass as}} a {{material}} {{is known for}} its chemical stability resistance to natural deterioration, impurities and variations in glass composition can cause considerable chemical instability that may further destructive processes (Vogel et al. 2007, 7). [...] Glass is also susceptible to atmospheric pollution, and high levels of humidity or moisture over long periods of time, both of which can speed up the corrosion rate of chemically unstable glass. [...] Over time, corrosion, marked by pitting or pocking of the glass, can deepen and spread until the surface layer itself breaks apart, uncovering the vulnerable, damaged core, until it becomes opaque (Rauch 2004, 3).

6000|$|General {{remarks on}} {{printing}} from reliefs--ink; low relief [...] of ridges; layer of ink; drying due to <b>oxidisation</b> [...] 32-34 ...|$|E
60|$|A slight film of <b>oxidisation</b> on {{the surface}} of the ink is a merit, not a harm; it is cleaner to work with and gives a blacker print, because the ink clings less tenaciously to the finger, {{consequently}} more of it is transferred to the paper.|$|E
60|$|The last {{preliminary}} to {{be noticed}} is the slowness with which the printer's ink hardens on the slab, and the rapidity with which it dries on paper. While serviceable for hours in the former case, in the latter it will be dry in a very few seconds. The drying or hardening of this oily ink has nothing whatever {{to do with the}} loss of moisture in the ordinary sense of the word, that is to say, of the loss of the contained water: it is wholly due to <b>oxidisation</b> of the oil. An extremely thin oxidised film soon forms {{on the surface of the}} layer on the slab, and this shields the lower-lying portions of the layer from the air, and retards further <b>oxidisation.</b> But paper is very unlike a polished slab; it is a fine felt, full of minute interstices. When a printed period (.) is placed under the microscope it looks like a drop of tar in the middle of a clean bird's-nest. The ink is minutely divided among the interstices of the paper, and a large surface being thereby exposed to the air, it oxidises at once, while a print from the finger upon glass will not dry for two or three days. One effect of <b>oxidisation</b> is to give a granulated appearance to the ink on rollers which have been allowed to get dirty. This granulation leaves clots on the slab which are fatal to good work: whenever they are seen, the roller must be cleaned at once.|$|E
60|$|The {{fluidity}} {{of even a}} {{very thin}} layer of ink seems to be retained for an indefinite time if the air is excluded to prevent <b>oxidisation.</b> I made experiments, and found that if pieces of glass (photographic quarter plates) be inked, and placed face to face, separated only by narrow paper margins, and then wrapped up without other precaution, they will remain good {{for a year and}} a half.|$|E

50|$|Mundic once {{referred}} to pyrite, but has now adopted the wider meaning of concrete deterioration caused by <b>oxidisation</b> of pyrites within the aggregate (usually originating from mine waste).

50|$|The cliffs to {{the east}} of the harbour are {{composed}} of Bridport Sand Formation and Inferior Oolite, while immediately to the west they are Frome Clay (Upper Fullers Earth) and Forest Marble.

The cliff's distinctive colour is a result of <b>oxidisation</b> of fine pyrite grains, resulting in limonite. The Frome Clay and Forest Marble of the West Cliff are younger and were formed in the Bathonian Age of the Middle Jurassic.

Glass-coated wire had a huge impact on the LED industry by reducing the cost of interconnect components, specifically using Copper wire instead of Gold.

5000|$|Camulodunum was a centre for pottery production, peaking {{at around}} 200, and over 40 kilns {{have been in}} the town, {{including}} those found in the northern suburbs of the colonia around Middleborough and a large group at Warren Fields and Oak Drive on the southern outskirts of the Sheepen site. Many of the kilns are of the oval [...] "Colchester type", whilst tile kilns have larger rectangular chambers. Camulodunum produced many types of pottery, including decorated Samian pottery, mortaria, buff wares, single-handled ring-necked flagons, and, until c. 250, colour-coated wares. In the late 1st century amphorae, called [...] "Camulodunum Carrots" [...] for their shape and colour, were made in the colonia, and are found in thin numbers across Britain. The Samian industry, copying the East Gaullish style, was active for a time in Camulodunum from 160 to about 200, with the names of several individual Samian potters identified as working in the colonia. Over 400 fragments of Samian moulds for producing the decorated pottery have been uncovered in the town, [...] including 37 complete examples. A well-preserved Samian kiln was excavated by archaeologist M.R. Hull near Middleborough, just outside North Gate. It was 8 ft wide, with a 5m flue under a large circular kiln chamber, and had a complex system of ceramic pipes and tubes for regulating the <b>oxidisation</b> of the pottery to produce its distinctive red colour. Several of the potters operating in Camulodunum in the First, Second and Third centuries are identified as immigrants from the Rhine Valley and East Gaul, including the Samian potter Minuso from Trier who also operated in other British towns, Miccio, the mortaria potter G. Attius Marinus and several men called Sextus Valerius. Pottery made in Camulodunum can be found across the East of England, and as far away as Eboracum. One of the most famous examples of locally made pottery is the [...] "Colchester Vase" [...] (c. 200), which depicts combat between gladiators called Memnon and Valentinus.|$|E

However, flakes in dispersion were observed to degrade. We examined two <b>oxidisation</b> routes: deionised water at room temperature and oxygen gas within the temperature range 150 - 350 C. Water was seen to slowly oxidise flakes inwards from the edge, forming an amorphous oxide, a result comparable to the state of flakes which degraded within the original dispersion. Oxygen gas was seen to rapidly oxidise entire flakes to a polycrystalline oxide, when heated 275 C and above. Degradation was studied with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), energy dispersed x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS).
