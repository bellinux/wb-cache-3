5|$|A {{father and}} {{daughter}} rollerblading in Central Park stumble across the body <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> several lacerations hidden in a bush. Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin (Ice-T) learn Peter Harrison (Nick Stahl), who was performing community service for a prior crime against a woman, left work early with a cut thumb {{around the time of}} the murder. Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia Zimmer (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison. However, Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey (Noel Fisher) in the evidence paperwork. Though Stuckey insists he made no mistake, Judge Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light) is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey.|$|E
5|$|At {{first two}} groups {{established}} themselves on fertile grounds in Silesia: One {{on the left}} bank of the Oder River south of Wrocław, {{in the area that}} included Mount Ślęża, and one around the Głubczyce highlands; both stayed in their respective regions during the 400–120 BC period. Burial and other significant Celtic sites in Głubczyce County were investigated in Kietrz and nearby Nowa Cerekiew. The Ślęża group disintegrated eventually within the local population, while the one at Głubczyce Upland apparently migrated out in the southern direction. More recent discoveries include Celtic settlements in Wrocław County, where in Wojkowice a well-preserved 3rd century BC grave <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> bronze and iron bracelets, brooches, rings and chains was found.|$|E

5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia stands in a pose which Etty had sketched many times, that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a woman in this pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish {{than the rest of}} the canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later in a studio.|$|E
5|$|Pfaster, who {{was behind}} the exhumations, proves Mulder's {{prediction}} correct when he brings a prostitute to his apartment. When the prostitute discovers a collection of funerary wreaths in Pfaster's bedroom, he kills her and removes her fingers. Later, Pfaster—having been hired as a frozen food delivery man through charming the female interviewer—delivers to a low-security house <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> teenage daughters. He requests the bathroom to wash his hands, and whilst there steals some discarded hair from a brush he found in the trashcan. Pfaster attends a night class at a community college, where a female classmate defends herself after he makes threatening advances. He is arrested and is placed in a jail cell across from a suspect being interrogated for Pfaster's crimes by Mulder, Scully, and Bocks. Pfaster shows interest in Scully, and learns her name from the interrogated suspect. Pfaster is later released as his charges were dropped.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} {{also revealed}} stones or fragments of carved stone {{dating from the}} 12th to the 16thcenturies. The earliest are in Romanesque style and include two voussoirs decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12thcentury are in Gothic style; they include a capital decorated with leaves and {{a portion of the}} tracery from a rose window. Many of the stones from the 13thcentury were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a cowl with the tonsure visible, the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open book, and a creature that might represent a serpent or an otter. There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15thcenturies. These include portions of string courses, tracery, corbels, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads. Over 1,500fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in grisaille (monochrome) style. Almost 1,300fragments of glass from later periods, and nearly 1,150sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found.|$|E

25|$|In South Korea, barber's poles {{are used}} both for actual barbershops and for brothels. Brothels {{disguised}} as barbershops, {{referred to as}} 이발소 (ibalso) or 미용실 (miyongsil), {{are more likely to}} use two poles next to each other, often spinning in opposite directions, though the use of a single pole for the same reason is also quite common. Actual barbershops, or 미용실 (miyongsil), {{are more likely to be}} hair salons; to avoid confusion, they will usually use a pole that shows a picture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> flowing hair on it with the words hair salon written on the pole.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a {{case study}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> ulcers {{on the back of}} her leg {{reported}} as being diagnosed with PNP. The underlying tumors are almost exclusively of B-cell lineage. However, T-cells and CD56+ Natural Killer cells have also been postulated to be associated effectors of paraneoplastic pemphigus. This case demonstrated the rare association between Natural Killer cell lymphoma and PNP, suggesting that Natural Killer cells could be involved in the pathogenesis of PNP. The article warned clinicians to be alert to the possibility that paraneoplastic pemphigus in lymphomas not of B-cell lineage. This added to the already complex, not fully understood pathogenesis of PNP.|$|E
25|$|In 1855, Lewis {{was killed}} by the husband <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> whom he had been having an affair. On July 1, 1856, a court sale of Lewis' {{property}} (including the undivided half-interest {{in the land of}} the Ranch) was held. King had arranged for Maj W.W. Chapman (died 1859) to bid on the Rincón property, which Chapman acquired for $1,575. Chapman had been the quartermaster of Fort Brown in Brownsville, and regulated the steamboat contracts to supply Fort Ringgold, up river in Rio Grande City. Chapman's heirs published the letters home from his wife in a new book named The News From Brownsville.|$|E

25|$|Labial {{reduction}} by de-epithelialization {{cuts and}} removes the unwanted tissue and preserves the natural rugosity (wrinkled free-edge) of the labia minora, and preserves the capabilities for tumescence and sensation. Yet, {{when the patient}} presents with much labial tissue, a combination procedure of de-epithelialization and clamp-resection is usually more effective for achieving the aesthetic outcome established by the patient and her surgeon. In the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> labial webbing (redundant folding) between the labia minora and the labia majora, the de-epithelialization labiaplasty includes an additional resection technique — such as the five-flap Z-plasty ("jumping man plasty") — to establish a regular and symmetric shape for the reduced labia minora.|$|E
25|$|The {{contraindications}} for mastopexy are few: aspirin use, tobacco smoking, diabetes, {{and obesity}} are medical and health conditions {{associated with increased}} incidences of nipple necrosis. In resolving the perceived ptosis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> encapsulated breast implants, the surgeon determines her suitability for a breast lift procedure after explantation, which facilitates assessment of the true degree of ptosis present in the explanted breasts; likewise {{the assessment of the}} effects of a combined breast-lift and revision-augmentation procedure, featuring the removal and the replacement of breast implants. For the woman who is at high risk for developing breast cancer (primary or recurrent), the mastopexy might alter the histologic architecture of the breasts, which tissue change might interfere with the accurate MRI detection and subsequent treatment of cancer; the risks and benefits will be discussed in that setting.|$|E
