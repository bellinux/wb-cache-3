40|$|In {{the present}} study two {{experiments}} are reported in which the subjects were presented {{on a computer screen}} with a two-dimensional line drawing that is perceived as a three-dimensionalobject (i. e. a cube). The cube could be seen as stationary, as rotating about the y-axis (Experiment 1 A), or as rotating about the x-axis (Experiment 1 B). The subject's attention was directed by a visual precue to a vertex of the cube. As the cube rotated, the precued location moved in viewer-centred co-ordinatesm, but the local feature of the cube that had been precued (i. e. a given vertex) did not move in <b>object-centred</b> <b>co-ordinates.</b> The imperative stimulus was presented at the precued location (valid trials) or at an uncued location (invalid trials). Precued and uncued locations were determined in object-centred coordinates. The subjects were required to signal detection of the imperative stimulus by pressing the space bar on the computer keyboard. There were also control conditions in which the procedure was identical, but the cube was not visible. When the cube was visible, valid trials were faster than invalid trials, regardless of whether it was seen as stationary or rotating. It was concluded that the subjects could allocate spatial attention in <b>object-centred</b> <b>co-ordinates.</b> There wer also indications that responses for invalid trials were faster when the imperative stimulus was presented on the same face as the precue than when it was presented on the opposite face...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is {{a common}} {{syndrome}} in which a patient fails to report or respond to stimulation {{from the side of}} space opposite a brain lesion, where these symptoms are not due to primary sensory or motor deficits. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze an evaluation process system of USN in various visual fields using HMD in order to understand more accurately any faults of USN operating in the <b>object-centred</b> <b>co-ordinates.</b> Method Eight stroke patients participated in this study and they had Left USN in clinical test, and right hemisphere damage was checked by CT scan. Assessments of USN were performed the BIT common clinical test (the line and the stars cancellation tests) and special tests the zoom-in condition (ZI) condition and the zoom-out condition (ZO) condition. The subjects were first evaluated by the common clinical test without HMD and then two spatial tests with HMD. Moreover, we used a video-recording for all tests to analyze each subject's movements. Results For the line cancellation test under the common condition, the mean percentage of the correct answers at the left side in the test paper was 94. 4 %. In the ZI condition, the left side was 61. 8. % and the right side was 92. 4. %. In the ZO condition, the left side was 79. 9 % and the right side was 91. 7. %. There were significant differences among the three conditions. The results of the stars cancellation test also showed the same tendency as the line bisection test. Conclusion The results showed that the assessment of USN using a technique of HMD system may indicate the disability of USN more than the common clinical tests. Moreover, it might be hypothesized that the three dimensional for USN test may be more related to various damage and occurrence of USN than only the two dimensional test. </p...|$|E
