5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (<b>openings</b> <b>in</b> {{the front}} {{part of the}} palate) are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in H.alfaroi. The bony palate is long and extends beyond {{the end of the}} molar row and the back margin of the maxillary bones. The posterolateral palatal pits, which perforate the palate near the third molars, are small, and {{may or may not be}} recessed into a fossa. The sphenopalatine vacuities (<b>openings</b> <b>in</b> the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, behind the palate) are also small, as are the auditory bullae. As in most oryzomyines, the subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and foramina (<b>openings)</b> <b>in</b> the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in T.talamancae follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys.|$|E

5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations that {{characterized}} later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull <b>openings)</b> <b>in</b> its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae {{and a pair of}} tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E

5|$|Kahn {{structured}} {{the library}} in three concentric square rings. The outer ring, which is built of load-bearing brick, includes all four exterior {{walls and the}} library carrel spaces immediately inside them. The middle ring, which is built of reinforced concrete, holds the heavy book stacks. The inner ring is a dramatic atrium with enormous circular <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> its walls that reveal several floors of book stacks.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (<b>openings</b> <b>in</b> {{the front}} {{part of the}} palate) are long, sometimes extending to between the first molars (M1). The bony palate is broad and short, with the posterior margin between the third molars (M3). Nephelomys levipes is the only other oryzomyine with such a short palate, although that of Eremoryzomys polius is only slightly longer. The posterolateral palatal pits (<b>openings</b> <b>in</b> the back part of the palate near the M3) vary from small to fairly large and are located in slight fossas (depressions). In Eremoryzomys, these fossas are deeper. The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, is completely closed or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. The vacuities are much larger in Eremoryzomys. The alisphenoid strut, a piece of bone that separates two foramina (openings), is present in all Drymoreomys specimens examined, except in one juvenile specimen.|$|E

50|$|A new four-storey {{extension}} {{is scheduled}} to be built, <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> summer 2018. Originally planned to be a five-storey structure <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> autumn 2017, the plans were revised and scaled down in 2016 to reduce excessive costs.|$|R
50|$|In June 2016, Disney {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} fourth hotel at the resort, slated for an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> 2021. In August 2016, Disney announced a new Eastern Gateway for the resort, which will include a 6,800-space parking structure, transportation hub, and pedestrian bridge, scheduled for an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> late 2018.|$|R
5|$|The incisive foramina, <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> {{the front}} {{part of the}} palate, reach {{backward}} between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars, the usual condition in oryzomyines. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). Sphenopalatine vacuities are usually absent, but {{have been reported in}} some populations. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is present. The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines. There are some <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> the mastoid bone.|$|E
5|$|The lichen {{typically}} {{grows on}} silicate stone, rarely on decaying wood. It is usually in partial shade in <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> low to mid-elevation moist forests, {{and is also}} frequently found in rocky roadcuts. Lichens with cephalodia are capable of fixing nitrogen, and contribute nitrogen to the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The skull looks delicate. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is {{narrow and}} hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is smooth; both lack conspicuously {{developed}} ridges and shelves. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are poorly developed. The incisive foramina (<b>openings</b> <b>in</b> the front {{part of the}} palate) are short and narrow. The bony palate ends {{at the level of}} the back of the third upper molars. The alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone at the back of the skull separating two foramina, or openings) is absent. The strut is present in most Eliurus, but absent in some specimens of E.grandidieri. The subsquamosal fenestrae (<b>openings</b> <b>in</b> the squamosal bone) are fairly large. The auditory bullae are small. The incisors are weak and the enamel on the upper incisors is yellow to light orange. The root of the lower incisor does not project into a distinct capsular process at the back of the mandible (lower jaw), a feature shared only with E.grandidieri among species of Eliurus.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{multi-purpose}} {{sports arena}} with 1,500 seats. Since its <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> 1986 and until Bet Maccabi <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> 2008, {{it was the}} main sports hall in the city. It was the home arena of Maccabi Rishon since its <b>opening</b> day <b>in</b> 1986, and also hosted Maccabi and Hapoel Rishon LeZion handball clubs home games.|$|R

5|$|The skull, {{which is}} short at the front, shows some typical oryzomyine characters. The palate is long, {{extending}} past the molars and the maxillary bones. The alisphenoid strut, {{which in some}} sigmodontines separates two foramina (<b>openings)</b> <b>in</b> the skull, is absent. The squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process contacting the tegmen tympani, the roof the tympanic cavity. The front part is short.|$|E

5|$|With a {{head and}} body length of , Eliurus petteri is a {{moderately}} large species of Eliurus. Its upperparts are gray-brown to gray and contrast {{sharply with the}} white underparts. The tail tuft, a characteristic feature of Eliurus, is weakly developed. The skull is delicate and the incisive foramina (<b>openings</b> <b>in</b> the front part of the palate) are short and narrow. The incisors are weak.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{skeletal}} features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are {{not considered to be}} synapomorphies. For example, as diapsids, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of temporal fenestrae (<b>openings</b> <b>in</b> the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> the snout and lower jaw. Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated scapula, or shoulder blade; a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in Herrerasaurus); and a perforate acetabulum, or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in Saturnalia, for example). Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.|$|E
5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical <b>openings</b> <b>in</b> defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E
50|$|When the {{railways}} arrived in Conara in the 1880s, the township {{became an important}} social hub in the Midlands region of Tasmania.
