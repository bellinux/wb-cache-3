5|$|Lorna Wing popularized {{the term}} Asperger {{syndrome}} in the English-speaking medical community in her 1981 {{publication of a}} series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms, and Uta Frith translated Asperger's paper to English in 1991. Sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari et al. in the same year. AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic reference, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorders</b> (DSM-IV).|$|E
40|$|A {{psychological}} model <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> A coherent conceptualisation of {{the role}} of psychological factors is of great importance in understanding <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Academic papers and professional reports alluding to psychological models of the aetiology <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> are becoming increasingly common, and there is evidence of a marked policy shift towards the provision of psychological therapies and interventions. This paper discusses the relationship between biological, social and psychological factors in the causation and treatment <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> It argues that simple biological reductionism is not scientifically justified, and also that the specific role of psychological processes within the biopsychosocial model requires further elaboration. The biopsychosocial model is usually interpreted as implying that biological, social and psychological factors are co-equal partners in the aetiology <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> The psychological model <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> presented here suggests that disruption or dysfunction in psychological processes is a final common pathway in the development <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> These processes include, but are not limited to, cognitive processes. The model proposes that biological and environmental factors, together with a person‟s personal experiences, lead to <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> through their conjoint effects on these psychological processes. Implications for research, interventions and policy are discussed. 192 words Key words: psychological processes, biopsychosocial model, biological reductionismA psychological model <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> Page 3 A psychological model <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> disorde...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the image <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> held by nurses with {{experience}} in psychiatric wards. We investigated the relation between individual attributes and images <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> The attributes were psychiatric clinical experience, age, and years of experience. Questionnaires related to the image <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> were distributed to 164 nurses and 82 valid responses were collected. In addition interviews were conducted with four of the respondents. The results indicated that psychiatric ward experience and self-awareness of prejudice were related to the image <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Before having clinical experience, the subjects perceived <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> as simply an illness. With clinical experience, they came to think of it as a disorder with the difficulties of living. Nurses' images <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> affected their nursing, and they came to appreciate patients' adaptations and social environments.

40|$|Objective: Current western medical {{wisdom is}} that suicide is always or almost always the result <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Our {{objective}} was to explore the public record for a relationship between suicide and gambling, in the absence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Method: The public record was examined for examples of individuals without stated evidence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> who completed suicide {{in the setting of}} recent gambling losses. Results: We identified a 17 th century opinion suggesting gambling losses could lead to suicide, and 10 individual cases (including a decorated policeman, a professional athlete and two engineers). Conclusions: This evidence strongly suggests that in the absence <b>of</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> gambling losses may lead to suicide...|$|R
5|$|Schizophrenia is {{diagnosed}} based on criteria {{in either the}} American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorders</b> (DSM 5), or the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E

Later on, Siddiqui also extracted other alkaloids from Rauwolfia serpentina that included Ajmalinine, Ajmalicine (C21H24N2O3), Isoajmaline, Neoajmaline, Serpentine and Serpentinine.

5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Asperger's is unknown. While it is {{probably}} partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively.

40|$|Does the {{reference}} to a mental realm in using the notion <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> lead to a dilemma that consists in either implying a Cartesian account of the mind-body relation or in the need {{to give up a}} notion <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> in its own right? Many psychiatrists seem to believe that denying substance dualism requires a purely neurophysiological stance for explaining <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> However, this conviction is based on a limited awareness of the philosophical debate on the mind-body problem. This article discusses the reasonableness of the concept <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> in relation to reductionist and eliminativist strategies in the philosophy of mind.

5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA—autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear. The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may not reflect {{the true nature of}} the spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from the outset. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorders</b> (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorders,</b> 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Disorders</b> (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> in {{people living with}} HIV/AIDS in a developing country context and {{examine the relationship between}} the presence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> and various independent variables. Nine-hundred HIV positive people were interviewed in 18 recruitment sites across five provinces in South Africa, using a cross-culturally validated diagnostic instrument and a structured socio-demographic and health information questionnaire. Prevalence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> was established using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Chi-square, Fischer exact test, and binary logistic regression examined the relationship between <b>mental</b> health <b>disorders</b> and demographic characteristics, disease stage, CD 4 count, and whether the person was on anti-retroviral treatment. A number of respondents (43. 7 %) were found to have a diagnosable <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Depression was the most common disorder (11. 1 % major and 29. 9 % mild depression), followed by alcohol abuse disorder (12. 4 %). The presence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> was significantly associated with gender, employment status, having children, and the clinical stage of the disease. Gender and the stage of disease were the best predictors <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Rates <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> were substantially higher in people living with HIV/AIDS than generally found in populations in developing countries and similar to HIV positive groupings in developed countries.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> {{and need for}} psychiatric treatment in new remand prisoners and to determine to what extent these are recognised and addressed in prison. DESIGN: Study of consecutive male remand prisoners at reception using a semistructured psychiatric interview. SETTING: Large remand prison for men (HMP Durham). SUBJECTS: 669 men aged 21 years and over on remand, awaiting trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> at reception, prisoners need for psychiatric treatment, identification <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> by prison reception screening, and numbers placed appropriately in the prison hospital. RESULTS: 148 (26 %) men had one or more current <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> (excluding substance misuse) including 24 who were acutely psychotic. The prison reception screening identified 34 of the men with <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> and six <b>of</b> those with acute psychosis. 168 men required psychiatric treatment, 50 of whom required urgent intervention; 16 required immediate transfer to psychiatric hospital. Of these 50, 17 {{were placed on the}} hospital wing because <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> recognised at prison screening.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between self-reported lifetime diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> and health-related outcomes in prisoners {{during the first six}} months after release. METHODS: We interviewed 1, 324 adult prisoners in Queensland, Australia, within six weeks of expected release and one, three and six months post-release. Outcomes of interest included health service access, housing, employment, substance use and criminal activity. We used multivariate logistic regression to investigate {{the association between}} self-reported, lifetime diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> and these health-related outcomes post-release, adjusting for pre-existing disadvantage. RESULTS: 43. 4 % of participants reported a lifetime diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> This group had increased crude odds of poor outcomes across all evaluated domains. After adjusting for pre-existing disadvantage, significantly increased odds of poor outcomes persisted in the substance use, mental health, crime and health service access domains. CONCLUSIONS: People with a history <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> experience particularly poor outcomes following release from prison that are not fully explained by pre-existing disadvantage.

5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities.

40|$|How can we {{understand}} the troubling under-inclusiveness of our law <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> – its failure to recognize mental conditions that, on the most compelling theoretical accounts <b>of</b> how <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> operates on criminal responsibility, ought to concern us deeply? This article argues that the gap between our plausible theories of criminal responsibility and our practices relating to <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> is best understood as a marker for the criminal law’s central social function: the laundering and containment of blame. The article begins by canvassing the conceptual structure of the defence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> turning then to the troubling prevalence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> among those facing criminal judgment, looking specifically at the incidence and effects of FASD, autism spectrum disorder, and anti-social personality disorder. These conditions operate on key elements of our theoretical account of criminal responsibility but are excluded from our defence <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Yet giving serious doctrinal regard to facts about <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> {{that ought to be}} of theoretical concern would destabilize individual responsibility for crime, showing itself as a far more complex social and political matter than we like to admit and raising questions about our collective standing to blame. The article argues that this analysis gives a line of sight into the symbolic and communicative role of the law <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> and the criminal law more generally – it is a mechanism for the concealment of collective responsibility for complex social problems...|$|R
40|$|Whilst differing {{perspectives}} {{can be an}} asset, {{they have}} also been found to lead to conflict and misunderstanding in multidisciplinary practice. Evidence suggests that different mental health disciplines hold differing attitudes towards <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> reflecting differing implicit models held. To contribute {{to our understanding of}} this problem the present study investigates psychologists’ concepts <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> building on a pilot study conducted by Harland et al. with psychiatrists (2009). The Maudsley Attitude Questionnaire was used in an online survey of trainee clinical psychologists (N = 288). Principal components analysis was used to investigate implicit models. It was hypothesised that psychologists’ understandings <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> would differ from psychiatrists'. The findings showed that psychologists endorsed different models for different diagnostic categories <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> Psychologists favoured the social realist model overall. Principal components reflecting a biological-psychosocial continuum, and scales of cognitive/behavioural and psychodynamic/spiritual model endorsement were revealed. The study concluded that, when compared to the findings of Harland et al. (2009), psychologists appear to make more use of psychosocial and less use of biological factors in their understanding <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> than do psychiatrists. There appear to be fundamental differences in psychologists' and psychiatrists’ implicit models <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> A greater emphasis on multidisciplinary training initiatives is recommended...|$|R
