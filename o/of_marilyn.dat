5|$|In the episode, world-renowned songwriting duo Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) are {{inspired}} {{to create a}} new Broadway musical on the life <b>of</b> <b>Marilyn</b> Monroe—instantly attracting the attention of tenacious producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston) and brilliant yet temperamental director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport). As the four search for their leading lady, veteran actress Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) becomes obsessed with winning them over and native Iowan waitress Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) becomes desperate to make her theatrical dreams a reality.|$|E
5|$|The Ferus show {{closed on}} August 4, 1962, {{the day before}} Marilyn Monroe's death. Warhol went on to {{purchase}} a Monroe publicity still from the film Niagara, which he later cropped and used to create {{one of his most}} well-known works: his painting <b>of</b> <b>Marilyn.</b> Although Warhol continued painting other pop art, including Martinson's coffee cans, Coca-Cola bottles, S Green Stamps, and Campbell's Soup cans, he soon became known to many as the artist who painted celebrities. He returned to Blum's gallery to exhibit Elvis and Liz in October 1963. His fans Dennis Hopper and Brooke Hayward (Hopper's wife at the time) held a welcoming party for the event.|$|E
5|$|Antichrist Superstar was {{recorded}} at Nothing Studios in New Orleans by an extensive group of musicians, including members <b>of</b> <b>Marilyn</b> Manson (namely the band's eponymous vocalist, Twiggy Ramirez, Madonna Wayne Gacy, Daisy Berkowitz, and Ginger Fish) and Nine Inch Nails (guitarists Robin Finck and Danny Lohner, and drummer Chris Vrenna). Manson, Trent Reznor and frequent Nine Inch Nails mixer Sean Beavan produced the record, alongside former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie. The {{process of creating}} the album was reputedly a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments involving sleep deprivation, near-constant drug use, as well as self-harm, with Manson indicating that he would regularly insert sewing needles underneath his own fingernails. During this time, antagonism between band members was high, with most of this directed toward founding member Daisy Berkowitz.|$|E
50|$|The summit was deleted {{from the}} {{original}} list <b>of</b> <b>Marilyns</b> in 1999 but was re-instated due {{to a change in}} the recorded summit position. A team including John Barnard surveyed the hill on 18 September 2009 and on 11 February 2010 announced that the summit and col height measurements were 486.9m and 339.2m respectively, and thus it was once again removed from the list <b>of</b> <b>Marilyns.</b>|$|R

25|$|In exchange, two new free uses were {{included}} in the law in 1973. The first was a very broad free use permission allowing newspapers to reproduce any published report or scientific, artistic, literary, or oral work; either in the original or as a translation. This broad permission was exploited by some publications such as Literaturnaya Gazeta, which published on October 24, 1973 long translated excerpts <b>of</b> <b>Marilyn,</b> Norman Mailer's biography <b>of</b> <b>Marilyn</b> Monroe, and again on January 1, 1974 a large translated excerpt from Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut. This practice caused sufficient negative publicity for the USSR in the West that Soviet publishers purchased the publication rights in Russian language on these works shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|A low {{had formed}} near Marilyn, {{which may have}} {{enhanced}} outflow from the system.

25|$|Another {{change was}} the {{infusion}} of story lines based on actual events and medical developments that materialized during the Korean War.

25|$|Set in two spaces, one {{of which}} {{represents}} the personal life <b>of</b> <b>Marilyn</b> Monroe (1926-1962) and the other which depicts moments of American political and civic life, the story interweaves the myth and decline of the movie star up to her mysterious death, with accounts of significant past events: the Korean war, the McCarthy era investigations, the prosecution of Wilhelm Reich, and the lectures of Timothy Leary {{on the use of}} psychedelic drugs. Marilyn is seen as an involuntary victim of the mass culture of her time, a figure only superficially serene and optimistic, a heroine in spite of herself, whose contradictory personality is represented in twelve scenes, equally distributed in the two acts.|$|E
