5|$|The First World War, {{which took}} place between 1914 and 1918, saw the {{extensive}} use of artillery, particularly on the Western Front. Technical advances, combined with the relatively static nature of trench warfare, made these guns {{a key element of}} the conflict: over half the casualties in the war were caused by artillery. Artillery guns and their crews were themselves targets, however, and 49,076 members of the Royal Artillery died during the conflict. In the years after the war, many former servicemen, including gunners, found the scale of the losses difficult to deal with, <b>or</b> <b>felt</b> that the events challenged their trust in the political leadership that had led them into the war. Visual reminders of the conflict were often avoided: mutilated servicemen, for example, were banned in the 1920s from joining in veterans' marches, and those with facial injuries often hid them in public.|$|E

25|$|According to an {{estimate}} by Polish researchers, 40–60,000 of the 200–250,000 Polish Jews who escaped the Nazis survived without leaving Poland (the remainder perished). More were repatriated from the Soviet Union and elsewhere, and the February 1946 population census showed about 300,000 Jews within the new borders. Of the surviving Jews, many chose to emigrate <b>or</b> <b>felt</b> compelled to because of anti-Jewish violence in Poland.|$|E

The day started quietly, with people going about their daily business. The weather in the morning did not indicate any severe threat of a tornado. The local weather bureau predicted thunderstorms, but nothing more serious. Around noon, the clouds began to appear more ominous and the barometric pressure dropped, alarming those who knew that was an indication of a tornado.|$|E
25|$|The oldest type of {{footwear}} is peasant sandals (opinci) {{worn with}} hemp canvas, woollen <b>or</b> <b>felt</b> foot wraps (obiele) or woollen socks (călțuni). Evidence for {{this style of}} footwear {{can be seen on}} a clay foot found in Turdaș, dating from around 2500 BC. Opinci were worn throughout Romania and over a wide area of south and east Europe being known as opanke (Serbia), tservuli (Bulgaria), opinci (Macedonia), etc. Opinci are made of a single rectangle of cow, ox or pig hide gathered round the foot in various ways.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Eugénie hat {{was named}} after Eugénie de Montijo, wife of Napoleon III, whose fashion choices were publicised in fashion sketches and closely scrutinised across Europe and the United States. The design became popular in the 1850s and 1860s, when it was {{also known as the}} empress hat. It was characterised by its forward tilt and featured feathers and ribbons. Typically it was made of velvet <b>or</b> <b>felt.</b> Mary Brooks Picken noted that the hat was generally small in its original incarnation, often with the brim turned up on one or both sides, with what were generally ostrich feathers as a trim. It would normally be tilted towards the right. Originally, the hat was worn for horseriding and travelling.|$|E
25|$|Pentecostalism {{emerged in}} the early 20th century among radical adherents of the Holiness {{movement}} who were energized by revivalism and expectation for the imminent Second Coming of Christ. Believing that {{they were living in}} the end times, they expected God to spiritually renew the Christian Church thereby bringing to pass the restoration of spiritual gifts and the evangelization of the world. In 1900, Charles Parham, an American evangelist and faith healer, began teaching that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism. The three-year-long Azusa Street Revival, founded and led by William J. Seymour in Los Angeles, California, resulted in the spread of Pentecostalism throughout the United States {{and the rest of the}} world as visitors carried the Pentecostal experience back to their home churches <b>or</b> <b>felt</b> called to the mission field. While virtually all Pentecostal denominations trace their origins to Azusa Street, the movement has experienced a variety of divisions and controversies. An early dispute centered on challenges to the doctrine of the Trinity. As a result, the Pentecostal movement is divided between trinitarian and non-trinitarian branches, resulting in the emergence of Oneness Pentecostals.|$|E

500|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by TV Asahi, most Japanese people perceived [...] "Kimigayo" [...] as an important song even before {{the passage of the}} Act on National Flag and Anthem in 1999. However, a poll in the same year conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun found that most respondents opposed legislation making it the national anthem <b>or</b> <b>felt</b> the Diet should take more time in passing such a law. Many Japanese students, who must sing the song at entrance and graduation ceremonies, say they cannot understand the old language of the lyrics and are not educated on its historical uses. Controversies surrounding the use of the anthem in school events still remain.|$|E
500|$|Controversy also {{arose from}} the YOG {{attendance}} policy in Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School, a local primary school. The school stated that a S$5 refundable deposit was required from students who attend the YOG events on a non-school day. The principal, Clifford Chua, {{said that it was}} to [...] "ensure that our children learn the value of responsibility and not take this rare opportunity for granted, by wasting the ticket and depriving others of the chance". Also, the deposit was returned even if the child did not attend the event. However, the move garnered mixed reactions from parents, who either supported the idea <b>or</b> <b>felt</b> it was not the right way to do things. Some other schools such as Nanyang Girls High School, Bukit View Primary School and Park View Primary School gave free tickets to their students while Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) encouraged co-pay of $1 to $2 by the students to teach them to treasure their tickets.|$|E

500|$|Controlled {{experiments}} with numbers {{date back to}} 1933 when the researcher Dietz asked Dutch people to name the first number to come to mind between 0 and 99. The number 7 was mentioned most, {{as it was in}} various later replicas of the study in other countries. The number 7 also came out on top in studies that asked people to name their favourite number. In an online poll by Bellos, columnist for The Guardian, over 30,000 {{people from all over the}} world submitted numbers, with 7 the most popular. All numbers under 100 were submitted at least once and nearly half of the numbers under 1,000. Marketing researchers King and Janiszewski investigated number preference in a different way. They showed undergraduate students random numbers and asked them to say quickly whether they liked the number, disliked it, <b>or</b> <b>felt</b> neutral. The number 100 had the highest proportion of people liking it (70%) and the lowest proportion of people disliking it (5%). The numbers 1 to 20 were liked by 9% more people than the higher numbers; the numbers that are the result of rote-learned multiplication tables (i.e. 2 x 2 to 10 x 10) [...] were liked by 15% more people than the remaining numbers. The researchers concluded that number fluency predicts number preference: hence multiplication table numbers are preferred over prime numbers.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, three classifications of wool {{are named}} in the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939. [...] "Wool" [...] is [...] "the fiber from the fleece of the sheep or lamb or hair of the Angora or Cashmere goat (and may include the {{so-called}} specialty fibers from the hair of the camel, alpaca, llama, and vicuna) which has never been reclaimed from any woven <b>or</b> <b>felted</b> wool product". [...] "Virgin wool" [...] and [...] "new wool" [...] are also {{used to refer to}} such never used wool. There are two categories of recycled wool (also called reclaimed or shoddy wool). [...] "Reprocessed wool" [...] identifies [...] "wool which has been woven <b>or</b> <b>felted</b> into a wool product and subsequently reduced to a fibrous state without having been used by the ultimate consumer".

500|$|Phil Gallo of Variety called Veronica Mars [...] "the smartest teen-oriented drama since Freaks and Geeks". He enjoyed Bell's acting, {{describing}} her [...] "as charismatic {{as she is}} tough and intelligent, giving a multilayered perf that touches on simple 17-year-old insecurity and convincingly incorporates deeper issues concerning family, love and disappointment." [...] Gallo discussed the pilot's reliance on flashbacks and voiceover, and felt that neither {{got in the way}} of the storytelling <b>or</b> <b>felt</b> too obvious. He praised Thomas' writing of the [...] "fine script" [...] and Piznarski's directing. Robert Bianco of USA Today felt that Veronica Mars was more akin to Buffy Summers than Nancy Drew, with [...] "sharp wits, steely nerves and a wicked sense of humor". Bianco praised Bell's portrayal of the character, saying [...] "whether you buy the idea of teen crime-solvers or not, there's no questioning Bell's credentials as a TV star." [...] Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that the pilot was [...] "showing signs of being network television's next Buffy", emanating from a tough, emotionally battered heroine. McFarland found the acting to be fantastic, and said that Bell and Colantoni [...] "create a wonderful father-daughter dynamic". Samantha Bonar of the Los Angeles Times thought that the writing was clever, and praised Bell ability to channel charisma, smarts and frustration.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by a team that consisted of staff members from previous Tales entries, as well as developers from the company's Tekken and Soulcalibur fighting game series. Producer Jun Toyoda explained that {{the goal was to}} create a role-playing game with the [...] "exhilarating battle scenes" [...] found in those titles, and to appeal to players who either felt that fighting games lacked a story <b>or</b> <b>felt</b> that traditional role-playing game combat was too [...] "tedious". Although the game features three-dimensional characters, battle sequences were purposefully restricted to a two-dimensional plane to allow the developers to create large monsters without fear of them obstructing the player's view of the action. Character animation was handled by Yosuke Kadowaki, who had previously used the same motion-capture technology on Soulcalibur II. The scenario was written by Koki Matsumoto and Tsuyoshi Tanaka. The main story theme was [...] "bonds", with the main priority being the overlapping stories of the main cast. Unlike previous Tales games where character art and design was mostly done by Mutsumi Inomata, Tales of Legendia features characters designed by anime illustrator and animator Kazuto Nakazawa, known for his prior work on the animated sequences from the 2003 film , as well as animated features such as El-Hazard and [...] Tales of Legendia includes animated cutscenes produced by Japanese studio Production I.G., and contains more animation than any previous game in the series.|$|E

It was successful enough to be moved Off Broadway for another ten-week run in 2008. The play's writers commented on the difficulty of lesbian-themed works finding financial success. They were tempted {{to make it more}} appealing by turning to camp for comedy. However, one of the writers said, [...] "I just felt like, how can you turn these people into a joke? I mean, these people are real people! Why would I direct a play where I held the characters in some sort of contempt <b>or</b> <b>felt</b> that they were ridiculous? We are allowed to do something else besides camp." [...] The stage adaptation of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles was produced by Lily Tomlin and Jane Wagner, and it won the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Media Award for [...] "fair, accurate, and inclusive" [...] portrayals of gay and lesbian people in New York Theater.
