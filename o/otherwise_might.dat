5|$|These modernizations {{have been}} criticized by some naval historians, given that not only these ships would {{eventually}} prove to be inferior to the British battleships {{they were meant to}} face (namely the Queen Elizabeth-class), since by the time the decision to proceed was taken a war between Italy and the United Kingdom seemed more likely, but also because the cost of the reconstruction would be not much less than the cost of building a brand new Littorio-class battleship; moreover, the reconstruction work caused bottlenecks in the providing of steel plates, that caused substantial delays {{in the construction of the}} modern battleships, which <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> have been completed at an earlier date.|$|E
5|$|This {{turned out}} to be unnecessary, however, as Tyler Fredrickson's punt was {{returned}} 52yards by Virginia Tech's DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown. Hall's return tied the game at 49–49, and with 3:11 remaining in the game, California took over on offense. On his first play after receiving Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, Aaron Rodgers was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The Bears' Chris Murphy jumped on the ball, preventing what <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> have been a game-losing turnover. Rodgers recovered from the fumble by completing three straight passes: first to J. J. Arrington for 11yards, then to Brandon Hall for 18yards and a first down, then to Burl Toler for 22yards and another first down. The last play took California deep into Virginia Tech territory. At the Tech 20-yard line, Rodgers rushed for a five-yard gain, then prepared the offense for a potential game-winning field goal kick. With twoseconds remaining on the clock, California called timeout and sent in kicker Tyler Fredrickson. Despite an attempt by Virginia Tech to ice the kicker by calling its final timeout, Fredrickson was undeterred by the pressure and his 35-yard field goal sailed through the goalposts as time expired. The kick gave California three points and the 52–49 victory.|$|E
5|$|Ganteaume's fleet {{remained}} off the Cape Derna for {{the next}} six days, performing repairs to the captured vessel to make it seaworthy. Detachments of sailors were taken from all of the ships in the squadron and transferred to the prize, and on 30 June Ganteaume's force was ready to sail northwest once again, eventually reaching Toulon without further incident on 22 July. Ganteaume used the capture of Swiftsure to excuse the failure of his effort to reinforce Egypt, which was invaded and captured by a British expeditionary force {{in the spring and summer}} of 1801. While in captivity, Hallowell wrote a letter that was published in Britain praising the treatment he and his men had received while prisoners of war under Ganteaume, and he and his officers were released on parole the following month. On 18 August they faced a court martial on board HMS Genereux at Port Mahon in Menorca to investigate the loss of their ship, and were all honourably cleared of any blame. He was also praised for detaching the convoy, which <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> have also been lost. Hallowell subsequently returned to naval service in 1803 at the start the Napoleonic Wars, operating in the Caribbean and Mediterranean and eventually becoming a rear-admiral in 1811. Swiftsure, one of only five British ships of the line to be captured by the French during the entire war, was subsequently commissioned into the French Navy and remained in service {{for the next}} four years until recaptured at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.|$|E

25|$|On 17 July an {{earthquake}} occurred off the northern coast of Papua New Guinea. The shock occurred on a reverse fault {{and led to}} a tsunami that caused significant destruction and a high number of deaths. In response to an international request for assistance, New Zealand dispatched a Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 aircraft loaded with relief supplies and six NZSAS advanced medics. The short notice deployment of the medics helped preserve lives that <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> have been lost.|$|E
25|$|In the English-speaking world, {{many people}} who <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> not {{have heard of the}} landing at Suvla Bay know {{something}} of its history through the song And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda written in 1972 by Eric Bogle and covered by numerous artists including the Clancy Brothers, Joan Baez and the Pogues. The song, while emotionally charged and vivid, is not an accurate historical account of the landing and subsequent events. Suvla also appears in the traditional Irish song The Foggy Dew commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E

25|$|Between 170 and 180 the {{activities}} of Septimius Severus went largely unrecorded, {{in spite of the}} fact that he occupied an impressive number of posts in quick succession. The Antonine Plague had severely thinned the senatorial ranks, and with capable men now in short supply, Severus' career advanced more steadily than it <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> have. After his first term as quaestor, he was ordered to serve a second term in the province of Baetica (in present-day southern Spain) under Publius Cornelius Anullinus, but circumstances prevented Severus from taking up the appointment.|$|E

25|$|The Zafimanely Kingdom was {{dissolved}} {{after the}} island was colonized by the French in 1896. The king {{of one of the}} most prominent Bara kingdoms, a leader named Ramieba, was arrested by the French for leading Bara participation in the Menalamba rebellion against French rule in 1897. This consequently soured Bara perception of the French, who <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> have been welcomed as conquerors of the widely resented Merina sovereigns. After the French conquered Madagascar they attempted with great difficulty to impose administrative authority in Bara territory, with frequent Bara insurrections between June 1897 and the general southern uprising of 1904–05.|$|E

25|$|Baxter's health {{had grown}} even worse, yet {{this was the}} period of his {{greatest}} activity as a writer. He wrote 168 or so separate works, including major treatises such as the Christian Directory, the Methodus Theologiae Christianae, and the Catholic Theology. His Breviate of the Life of Mrs Margaret Baxter records the virtues {{of his wife and}} tenderness which <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> not have been known. A slim devotional work published in 1658 under the title Call to the Unconverted to Turn and Live formed one of the core extra-biblical texts of evangelicalism until at least the middle of the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|Cunningham's novel also mirrors Mrs. Dalloway's stream-of-consciousness {{narrative}} style (a style {{pioneered by}} Woolf and James Joyce) {{in which the}} flowing thoughts and perceptions of protagonists are depicted as they would occur in real life, unfiltered, flitting from one thing to another, and often rather unpredictable. In terms of time, this means characters interact {{not only with the}} moment in the time in which they are living, but also shoot back to the past in their memories, and in so doing create a depth of history and backstory which weighs upon their present moments, which <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> appear quite trivial; buying flowers, baking a cake and such things.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} whether William {{had a hand}} in the murder of the De-Witt brothers will always remain unanswered, like his exact role in the later Massacre of Glencoe. The fact that he ordered the withdrawal of a federal cavalry detachment, that <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> have prevented the lynching, has always raised eyebrows, however, like {{the fact that he did}} not prosecute the well-known ringleaders like Cornelis Tromp and his relative, Johan Kievit, the Buat conspirator, who now was appointed pensionary of Rotterdam, and even advanced their careers. But maybe firm measures against the conspirators were not feasible in the political climate of those fraught days in the Fall of 1672.|$|E
25|$|No Glaswegian {{troops were}} deployed, with the {{government}} fearing that fellow Glaswegians, soldiers or <b>otherwise,</b> <b>might</b> {{go over to the}} workers' side if a revolutionary situation developed. Under the orders of Field Marshal Sir William Robertson, Scottish regiments were transported to Glasgow from other parts of Scotland, specifically to avert this possible scenario. Troops from the Highland Light Infantry were also transported from Maryhill Barracks from Maryhill Central railway station to Buchanan Street railway station but without their Glaswegian men. Other troops, including the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, Gordon Highlanders and Seaforth Highlanders, arrived from Stirling Castle, Redford Barracks and Fort George into Queen Street Station.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} death of Voltaire in 1778, Beaumarchais set out to publish Voltaire's {{complete}} works, many of which were banned in France. He bought the rights to most of Voltaire's many manuscripts from the publisher Charles-Joseph Panckouck in February 1779. To evade French censorship, he set up printing presses in Kehl, Germany. He bought the complete foundry of the famous English type designer John Baskerville from his widow and also purchased three paper mills. Seventy volumes were published between 1783 and 1790. While the venture proved a financial failure, Beaumarchais was instrumental in preserving many of Voltaire's later works which <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> have been lost.|$|E

25|$|While {{a surgeon}} in Philadelphia, Koop {{performed}} groundbreaking surgical procedures on conjoined twins, invented techniques which today {{are commonly used}} for infant surgery, and saved the lives of countless children who <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> {{have been allowed to}} die. He invented anesthetic and surgical techniques for small bodies and metabolisms and participated in the separation of several sets of conjoined twins whose condition other physicians at the time considered hopeless. He first gained international recognition in 1957 by the separation of two female pygopagus infants (conjoined at the pelvis) and then, again, in 1974 by the separation of two ischiopagus twins (conjoined at the spine) sharing a liver, colon, and parts of the intestines with their entire trunks merged.|$|E
25|$|Old Norse had nasalized {{versions}} of all nine vowel places. These occurred as allophones of the vowels before nasal consonants and {{in places where}} a nasal had followed it in an older form of the word, before it was absorbed into a neighboring sound. If the nasal was absorbed by a stressed vowel, it would also lengthen the vowel. These nasalizations also occurred in the other Germanic languages, but were not retained long. They were noted in the First Grammatical Treatise, and <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> have remained unknown. The First Grammarian marked these with a dot above the letter. This notation did not catch on, and would soon be obsolete. Nasal and oral vowels probably merged around the 11th century in most of Old East Norse.:3 However, the distinction still holds in Dalecarlian dialects.:4 The dots in the following vowel table separate the oral from nasal phonemes.|$|E
25|$|As Shelby Foote noted, the Confederates also {{gained a}} {{strategic}} {{victory in the}} Red River Campaign. They were able to delay the return of Brigadier-General Andrew Smith’s 10,000man force to Major-General Sherman's army {{for use in the}} Atlanta Campaign. Also, about 20,000 Confederate soldiers from Alabama were able to reinforce General Joe Johnston in his defense against Sherman. These forces <b>otherwise</b> <b>might</b> have been engaged in Alabama had Banks attacked Mobile, Alabama, as Lieutenant-General Grant would have preferred, rather than attempt to take Shreveport under Halleck’s plan. The United States Army tied up significant forces in the Red River Campaign and lost significant numbers of artillery pieces, wagons, mules and supplies that could have been used in the more decisive campaigns further east. Yet, Kirby Smith could not get his forces back to Alexandria in time for a further attempt to capture or destroy Banks's force. The disruption and retreat of federal forces in Arkansas also cleared the way for Price's 1864 invasion of Missouri. Ultimately that campaign provided no long term benefit to the Confederates, who were driven out of Missouri again after the Battle of Westport and the consequent offensive by U.S. cavalry under Major-General Alfred Pleasonton, which defeated the Confederates in 4 battles in 5 days following the battle of Westport.|$|E
