5|$|At the Pennsylvania {{state line}} in South Valley, PA346 exits the Allegheny National Forest and becomes NY280 upon {{entering}} New York. The route heads {{north along the}} eastern edge of the Allegheny Reservoir as East Bank Perimeter Road, clipping the southwestern corner of Allegany State Park prior to entering the Allegany Indian Reservation. NY280 passes in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> once more before turning to the east toward Quaker Lake as it enters the town of Coldspring. At Quaker Lake, NY280 penetrates the park boundary once more and intersects Allegany State Park Route3 (ASP Route3) at the Quaker Run entrance. Here, NY280 turns north, traversing a small waterway separating Quaker Lake from the reservoir before reentering the Allegany Indian Reservation limits.|$|E
5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed. This {{is especially true}} of Forest Park, which extends into other watersheds to the northwest. Birds and animals from these watersheds and from the Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, move in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E

During his all-star appearances, Jorge would have Jorge Luis at his side during the player introductions.

25|$|The student-teacher {{relationship}} gradually {{changed to}} one of jealous rivals. Cobb was unpopular with his teammates, and as he became the biggest star in baseball, Crawford was unhappy with the preferential treatment given Cobb. Cobb was allowed to report late for spring training and given private quarters on the road – privileges not offered to Crawford. The competition between the two was intense. Crawford recalled that, if he went three for four {{on a day when}} Cobb went hitless, Cobb would turn red and sometimes walk <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> with the game still on. When it was initially (and erroneously) reported that Nap Lajoie had won the batting title, Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb.|$|E
25|$|The roads have {{reverted to}} their {{previous}} 'heavily restricted' status. There is still considerable car traffic into and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> mainly {{of families with}} children, dog walkers, kite/model aeroplane fliers and other recreational use. However, cross-park 'through traffic' is now completely blocked by sturdy gates across the main link roads, similar to the existing gates at all road entrances and exits, that open and close with dusk and dawn. This measure has significantly reduced {{the use of the}} park as a rush-hour short-cut (notably between Boldmere and Streetly), with some noticeable impact on congestion of local routes around the Park. The benefit of traffic restriction is improvement in the enjoyability of the park; with cleaner air, safer roads for walkers and cyclists, and much reduced visual and noise pollution, plus reduced wear and tear on the poorly maintained, decaying road surfaces.|$|E
25|$|At a {{community}} meeting on 11 February, DSE and Parks Victoria authorities revealed {{a plan to}} back-burn across {{the entrance to the}} promontory, in order to prevent any possibility of the fire burning <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> and into farmland and towards the towns of Yanakie and Sandy Point. Crikey reported that locals were divided on the merits of the plan, some concerned as to why the back-burning had not been carried out earlier, and some worried at the large scale of the proposed burns, which were reported to be larger than both the existing fire as well as the April 2005 fires that affected the park Strong easterly winds on 12 February forced authorities to postpone the proposed burns lest they themselves pose a danger to surrounding communities, though they did proceed with preparatory work.|$|E

25|$|Jealousy {{and hatred}} between Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney, the other ace pitcher on the team, broke out into {{violence}} in the clubhouse. Radbourn was faulted as the initiator of the fight, and was suspended without pay after a poor outing on July 16, having been accused of deliberately losing the game by lobbing soft pitches over the plate. But on July 22, Sweeney had been drinking {{before the start of}} the game and continued drinking in the dugout between innings. Despite being obviously intoxicated, Sweeney managed to make it to the seventh inning with a 6–2 lead: when Bancroft attempted to relieve him with the change pitcher, Sweeney verbally abused him before being ejected and storming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> leaving Providence with only eight players.

25|$|While most of Santa Fe's steam {{locomotives}} were {{retired and}} sold for scrap, a handful were saved {{and a few}} ended up as notable locomotives. Among them is Santa Fe 3751, a 4-8-4 Northern type, built by Baldwin in 1927 which was once a static display in Viaduct Park near the ATSF depot in San Bernardino, California. The locomotive was moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> in 1986 to be restored and after almost 5 years of restoration, 3751 made its first run on a 4-day trip from Los Angeles to Bakersfield and return in December 1991. The trip {{marked the beginning of}} 3751's career in excursion service. The more-modern Santa Fe 2926, another 4-8-4 delivered by Baldwin in 1944 and based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is being restored for operation by the New Mexico Steam Locomotive and Rail Historical Society of Albuquerque, which has expended 114,000 man hours and $1,700,000 in donated funds on her restoration since 2002.|$|E
25|$|The {{grey wolf}} {{is an issue}} if not yet a reality in the Tongue River Basin, {{and there have been}} {{unconfirmed}} sightings of wolves in the more remote areas of the basin. Livestock, particularly sheep and calves, are vulnerable to wolves and, according to reports, livestock suffered significant depredations by wolves and coyotes in {{the last part of the}} 19th and the first part of the 20th century. This led to a war on these predators, with bounties paid by livestock associations and state agencies. By the mid-1930s wolves had been exterminated completely in the Tongue River basin (and indeed throughout the stockgrowing west). Times changed, and sympathy grew for the wolf, as well as his cousin the coyote. Since the release of wolves in Yellowstone Park in 1995, there has been increasing concern by stockgrowers in surrounding areas that wolf packs would migrate <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> to cattle country and re-establish themselves where the pickings were better. In cattle and sheep country like the Tongue River basin, the debate about wolf reintroduction is ongoing and far from resolved.|$|E

500|$|M-203 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a spur route from Hancock north to the state park in 1933. It was later cancelled as a state highway in 1939. This cancellation was reversed in late 1940.

A construction project rerouted the roadway near the state park in 1963. The highway's routing was moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> proper, bypassing it to the east.
