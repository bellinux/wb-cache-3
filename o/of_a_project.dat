5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi {{recognized}} Kricfalusi's talent, {{and wanted}} {{to put him in}} charge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> that would showcase the young animator's skills. Bakshi and Kricfalusi co-wrote the screenplay Bobby's Girl as a take on the teen films of the era. Jeff Sagansky, president of production at TriStar Pictures, put up $150,000 to develop the project, prompting Bakshi to move back to Los Angeles. When Sagansky left TriStar, Bakshi was forced to pitch the film again, but the studio's new executives did not understand its appeal and cut off financing. Bakshi and Zingarelli began to develop a feature about Hollywood's Golden Age, and Bakshi Productions crewmembers worked on proposed cartoons influenced by pulp fiction. Bobby's Girl was reworked as a potential prime time series called Suzy's in Love, but attracted no serious interest.|$|E

He had by now made himself an expert in Patristic Greek; only an inexactness in philology marking his earlier abandonment of Greek for music. Also in 1953 he was appointed co-editor (with Hedley Sparks) of the Journal of Theological Studies and continued editing it until 1985. He held the university appointment of Hulsean Lecturer from 1954–6.|$|E
5|$|El 18 is a {{modification}} of the Swiss Re 460. The class was originally built in 119 units from 1992 to 1995 for the Swiss State Railways, where it was given the brand Lok 2000. It was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> to create a series of new intercity locomotives and cars. Bern–Lötschberg–Simplon-Bahn received eight units in 1994 (as Re 465), the Finnish State Railways received 46 units between the years 1995-2003 (as Sr2) and the Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation received 2 units in 1997. The units are designed to haul heavy passenger trains along existing curved railways at high speeds. It is designed as a universal locomotive, so it is also suitable for freight trains.|$|E

5|$|In Tompkins County, {{the road}} was reconstructed as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> {{contracted}} out on August24, 1916. Work on the highway was completed in the early-to-mid-1920s, and the improved road {{was added to the}} state highway system as SH1433. The Groton–Cortland state highway did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when hundreds of state-maintained highways were assigned a designation for the first time. SH446, SH996, and SH1433 were collectively designated as NY222, which continued east into downtown Cortland by way of locally maintained streets. The alignment of NY222 has not been changed since that time.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{upgrades}} {{were made}} to the portion of U.S. Route 202 concurrent with Route 23. This portion of road, which was originally a four-lane undivided road, saw an upgrade to a six-lane freeway south of the Alps Road interchange and to a six-lane surface road north of there. Construction on these improvements was completed in 1986. There were also plans to replace the Flemington Circle with an interchange as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> that would have also built a limited-access bypass of Flemington for Route 31; however, this plan was never realized.|$|E

The multimillion-euro restoration was partially financed by the European Regional Development Fund. Works began in early 2008 by the Restoration Unit. The process of restoration was documented by Dr. Spiteri.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} New York assumed {{maintenance}} of two highways linking the hamlets of Harford and Harford Mills—one directly connecting {{the two and}} a second, more circuitous route to the east—in the early 20th century. The direct route {{and most of the}} loop road were improved to state highway standards as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>project</b> contracted out on October16, 1914, and were added to the state highway system on December10, 1915, as State Highway1075 (SH1075). Each end of SH1075 connected to the segment of the loop route between modern NY38 and Owego Hill Road, which was rebuilt as part of an earlier project awarded on September19, 1906, and included in the state highway system on July5, 1908, as SH379. Both designations are unsigned and used only for inventory purposes.|$|E
