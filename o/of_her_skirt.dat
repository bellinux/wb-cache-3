25|$|Guaguancó is {{a couple}} dance of sexual {{competition}} between the male and female. The male periodically attempts to “catch” his partner with a single thrust of his pelvis. This erotic movement is called the vacunao (‘vaccination’ or more specifically ‘injection’), a gesture derived from yuka and makuta, symbolizing sexual penetration. The vacunao can also be expressed with a sudden gesture made by the hand or foot. The quinto often accents the vacunao, usually as the resolution to a phrase spanning more than one cycle of clave. Holding onto the ends <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> while seductively moving her upper and lower body in contrary motion, the female “opens” and “closes” her skirt in rhythmic cadence with the music. The male attempts to distract the female with fancy (often counter-metric) steps, accented by the quinto, until he is in position to “inject” her. The female reacts by quickly turning away, bringing the ends of her skirts together, or covering her groin area with her hand (botao), symbolically blocking the “injection.” Most {{of the time the}} male dancer does not succeed in “catching” his partner. The dance is performed with good-natured humor.|$|E
500|$|The body, {{dressed in}} a black sweater and yellow skirt, was soon {{identified}} as the missing Patricia Jones. Jones had been hit with four shots from a [...]22 caliber pistol. Although the fatal wound was a shot to Jones's head, entering near her mouth on an upward trajectory, she also had one through and through bullet wound to her abdomen and two penetrating gunshot wounds to her shoulders on a downward trajectory through her body. Powder burns on the hemline <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirt,</b> which had been raised to her waist, indicated that the gun had been fired from close range at least once. Initial reports and investigation placed Jones's time of death at approximately 9 p.m. on May 27.|$|E

2500|$|Maria de Medici wears a bodice with split, round hanging sleeves. Her tight undersleeves are chartacteristic of Spanish influence. From {{the folds}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirt,</b> {{she appears to}} be wearing a small roll over a narrow Spanish farthingale. Note that her oversleeves are the same shape as those worn by Lettice Knollys.|$|E
6000|$|Grace's {{face had}} heated at her father's words, {{and the very}} rustle <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> upon the box-edging bespoke hauteur. [...] "I shall not think <b>of</b> going to <b>her,</b> father--of course I could not!" [...] she answered.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't think Mr. Beeton cheats much,' said Dick. Bessie was flouncing up {{and down}} the room, and he was {{conscious}} of a keen sense of enjoyment as he heard the swish <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> and the light step between.|$|R
60|$|Her {{face was}} white enough before, {{but it was}} deathly now. Her lips parted, but only a little moan came from them. He heard the rush <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirts,</b> and saw <b>her</b> spring forward. He was left alone upon the hilltop.|$|R
2500|$|The headdresses worn by {{the women}} {{are perhaps the most}} {{spectacular}} and elaborate items of Akha dress. Akha women define their age or marital status with the style of headdress worn. At roughly age 12, the Akha female exchanges her child's cap for that of a girl. A few years later she will begin to don the jejaw, the beaded sash that hangs down the front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> and keeps it from flying up in the breeze. During mid-adolescence she will start wearing the adult woman's headdress. Headdresses are decorated by their owner and each is unique. Silver coins, monkey fur, and dyed chicken feathers {{are just a few of}} the things that might decorate the headdress. The headdresses differ by subgroup. According to an article about the variations in Akha headdress, [...] "High Fashion, Hill Style", the ...|$|E

60|$|Berenice {{came out}} from her place. At {{the sound of the}} {{rustling}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> both men turned their heads. She wore a gown of black velvet and a wonderful rope of pearls hung from her neck. She raised her hand and smiled at Mannering.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't. Come, try it," [...] {{retorted}} Betty, catching hold <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirt.</b> She {{could never}} have allowed a challenge like that to pass.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice {{stooped to}} flick an {{imaginary}} piece of lint off <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirt.</b> She {{did not want}} her mother to see her face just then.|$|E

6000|$|Not {{a single}} detail of that moving little episode had escaped de Marmont's keen eyes: {{he had seen}} Crystal's look of {{positive}} abhorrence wherewith she had regarded Clyffurde, {{he had seen the}} gathering up <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> away--as it were--from the contaminating propinquity of the [...] "English spy." ...|$|R
60|$|The next {{instant she}} had seized it and thrown it upon the sofa. Then seating herself beside it, with {{the gesture of}} a queen and the grace of a Parisienne, she had spread the ample folds <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> over the compromising case, hiding it entirely from view.|$|R
60|$|Gwen {{came forward}} and took hold <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>skirt,</b> looking up anxiously.|$|R

6000|$|... "You lie!" [...] said Teresa, furiously; [...] "she was my friend. A better friend {{than those}} who professed--more, she added, with a contemptuous drawing away <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> as if she feared Curson's contamination.|$|E
60|$|His voice, though sunk {{now almost}} to a whisper, was {{vibrating}} with passion. He half dropped on his knees, took the edge <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> between his fingers and raised it to his lips.|$|E
60|$|There was a moment's pause. Arnold {{moved to}} the door and held it open. They heard the swish <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> as she came through the outer office, and the heavier {{footsteps}} of the doctor who followed. Mr. Weatherley tried vainly to rise to his feet. He held out his arms. Fenella hastened towards him.|$|R
60|$|In the end {{she came}} quite suddenly. The door had opened and closed before he heard even the swish <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirts.</b> She stood there looking at him a little appealingly. She was dressed in dark {{travelling}} clothes and she carried a heavy dressing case in her hand. He sprang forward and took it from her.|$|R
6000|$|She was {{alluring}} as she kneaded {{the bread}} at the table. The flex <b>of</b> <b>her</b> waist and the swing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirts</b> affected Rivers powerfully. He watched her in silence. Once she looked around, and the penetrative glance {{of his eyes}} filled her face with a rush <b>of</b> blood, and <b>her</b> eyes misted. A few minutes later he said [...] "good-night" [...] in an absent-minded way and went home.|$|R

60|$|He {{held out}} one arm to her. She hesitated, then she swiftly put her finger tips {{on the smooth}} brown muscle, and drew them along. Quickly she hid her hand into the folds <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirt,</b> blushing.|$|E
60|$|To our horror Peg {{produced}} {{a handful of}} peppermint lozenges from the pocket <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> and offered us one each. We did not dare refuse but we each held our lozenge very gingerly in our hands.|$|E
60|$|As {{he crawled}} slowly {{back to life}} and clear thinking, Harold's wild heart {{was filled with a}} peace and {{serenity}} of emotion such as it had not known since childhood.
