5|$|Board of Trade {{inspections}} {{took place}} in late December 1862 and early January 1863 to approve the railway for opening. After minor signalling changes were made, approval was granted {{and a few days}} of operating trials were carried <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> grand opening on 9 January 1863, which included a ceremonial run from Paddington and a large banquet for 600 shareholders and guests at Farringdon. Charles Pearson did not live to see the completion of the project; he died in September 1862.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of the two schools, the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl was only their eighth football meeting. Tennessee held a 5-2 advantage in the series, but before 1994, the last meeting between them was in 1937. The 1994 meeting was in the 1994 Gator Bowl, which the Volunteers won 45-23. Each school rapidly sold its allotment of 17,000 tickets, and publicly available tickets were sold <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> matchup was announced. This gave the Chick-fil-A Bowl its 13th consecutive sellout.|$|E

5|$|Kevin Nash fought Samoa Joe in {{the seventh}} contest of the night. The match lasted 12 minutes. At two points during the match, Nash {{performed}} his signature Jackknife Powerbomb with Joe kicking <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> three count. This led to Nash hitting Joe in the groin and placing {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage in his winning pin attempt.|$|E
5|$|The 193738 {{season was}} purely domestic, with no {{international}} matches, {{but it was}} an opportunity for all players to push for selection in the squad for the 1938 Ashes tour. It was another disappointing season for Queensland, who were again winless; they lost three matches, hung on for a draw, eight wickets down in another, and the other two fixtures were washed <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> second innings. Tallon scored 204 runs at 22.66 without managing a half-century and made 17 dismissals.|$|E

5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an <b>out.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} carried <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> flooding of Chew Valley Lake {{found evidence}} of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic (Old, Middle and New Stone Age), Bronze Age and Iron Age, comprising implements such as stone knives, flint blades {{and the head of}} a mace, along with buildings and graves. Other evidence of occupation from prehistoric times is provided by the henge monument at Stanton Drew, long barrow at Chewton Mendip, and Fairy Toot tumulus at Nempnett Thrubwell. Maes Knoll fort, on Dundry Down in the northern reaches of the valley, is a Scheduled Ancient Monument that dates from the Iron Age; it later served as a terminus for the early medieval Wansdyke earthworks.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E

5|$|By 2004, {{the owners}} were {{claiming}} that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, {{and that the}} league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> start of the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994–95 lockout, the owners were again demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season {{was on the verge}} of being lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries.|$|E
5|$|Excavations carried <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{flooding}} of Chew Valley Lake also uncovered Roman remains, indicating {{agricultural and}} industrial activity {{from the second}} half of the 1st century until the 3rd century AD. The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park, where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. There is also evidence from the Pagans Hill Roman Temple at Chew Stoke. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century and 8 Miliarense and 671 Siliqua all dating to the period AD 337– 367. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Johnson {{received}} $1.1 {{million in}} grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education. Johnson used the money to create eight smaller learning communities for the 2003–2004 school year. In {{the first five years}} the graduation rate at Johnson increased 19% with state-required 10th grade reading and writing tests also seeing double digit increases. The money from the grants ran <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 20062007 school year. Currently, there are eight smaller learning communities within the school. All students start in the Freshmen FOCUS Academy and then choose one of seven other academies for the remainder of their high school career based on their interests. Beginning with the class of 2006, graduating seniors are required to engage in the Senior Project, a program designed for students to showcase the skills they have developed during their stay at Johnson and as a practice for building a résumé or portfolio when applying for jobs.|$|E

60|$|Brill {{came to the}} bat for {{the third}} time with a sort of do-or-die look on the faces of the players. It was plucky little Spud who started a batting streak, getting safely to first and {{followed}} by another player who managed to reach second, landing Spud on third. Then came two <b>outs.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> inning was ended, however, two runs were placed on the board to the credit of Brill.|$|R

5|$|In April, the General Assembly {{called a}} border states {{convention}} {{to be held}} in Frankfort in May. Slates of delegates were nominated by both the Unionists and Southern Rightists, but war broke <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> election of delegates; the Southern Rights delegates withdrew from the election, and the Unionist slate, including Crittenden, was chosen by default. On May 27, 1861, Crittenden was chosen chair of the convention and called it to order. With war having largely precluded any good the meeting could have accomplished, only nine of Kentucky's twelve delegates were present, along with four from Missouri (out of seven elected), and one from Tennessee (and his election was questionable); Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware sent no delegates. Ultimately, the convention accomplished little beyond calling on the southern states to reconsider their secession and on the northern states to moderate their demands.|$|E
5|$|In Norway, Johan Nordahl Brun's rousing {{patriotic}} play Einar Tambarskjelve, {{written in}} 1772, {{is considered a}} milestone in Norwegian literature. Later Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson wrote a well-known short poem, Olav Trygvason, on {{the fall of the}} king. Bjørnson also collaborated with Edvard Grieg on an opera about Olaf Tryggvason, but the two fell <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> work was finished. Ragnar Søderlind has now completed the opera, which premiered in September 2000, 1000 years after the Battle of Svolder. Søderlind introduced fate motifs from Wagner, Beethoven and Liszt in the battle scene.|$|E
5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The new engine system is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't {{be able to stand}} the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt to stay behind, feeling that she {{would not be able to}} integrate back on Earth. Janeway reviews the message decoded by Arturis, and discovers the message to be fake. She transports to the Dauntless to confront Arturis. He tries to pin the blame on Seven, but Janeway rejects his claims. Arturis activates a panel on the ship, igniting the engines. All but Janeway and Seven are able to be transported <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> ship enters the slipstream.|$|E

5|$|Midway {{through the}} 1947–48 season, Harvey was {{called into the}} Victorian team for the Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales and made his debut {{alongside}} Merv and Neil, who were already established players. Merv opened, while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively. Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships as they were always <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> next sibling came in to bat. Ray came in at 5/208 to make 43. Victoria ended with 331 and the Harvey brothers had scored almost half the runs. New South Wales were forced to follow on and Victoria were set 51 for victory. After the fall of Fred Freer at 1/24, captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3, allowing two Harveys to bat {{together for the first}} time at first-class level. Ray and Merv put on an unbeaten partnership of 27 to take Victoria to a nine-wicket win. Merv and Ray ended unbeaten on 12 and 22 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Mills captained the Leicester {{team that}} reached the First Division play-offs in 1992–93 with a sixth place league finish, and they beat Portsmouth 3–2 on {{aggregate}} in the semi-final. However, they {{lost in the}} final for the second successive season, being beaten 4–3 by Swindon Town at Wembley Stadium. He made 53 appearances this season, missing only three of Leicester's fixtures. Mills featured regularly in 1993–94 before missing {{the last few months}} of the season with a foot injury, having made 25 appearances by then. By finishing fourth in the table Leicester made the First Division play-offs for the third successive season, and Mills led the team <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> final despite being unable to play. Leicester beat Derby County 2–1 and thus earned promotion to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|News of Breyer's ride to Roubaix {{may have}} spread. Half those who entered {{did not turn}} up at the Brassérie de l'Espérance, the race {{headquarters}} at the start. Those who dropped <b>out</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> race began included Henri Desgrange, a prominent track rider {{who went on to}} organize the Tour de France. The starters did include Maurice Garin, who went on to win Desgrange's first Tour and was the local hope in Roubaix because he and two brothers had opened a cycle shop in the boulevard de Paris the previous year.|$|E
