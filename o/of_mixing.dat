5|$|Fallen is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Evanescence. After {{releasing}} several EPs and a demo CD, the group signed to Wind-up in January 2001. Writing songs for Fallen started near {{the time of}} the band's formation; several of the songs that would feature on the album appeared on the band's earlier releases. Fallen was recorded between August and December 2002 in several locations, including Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. This was followed by a two-week period <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood.|$|E

His son called 911, but Adams was pronounced dead by paramedics when they arrived. The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs in his system were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd {{had already}} experimented with filming outside {{the context of}} a {{standard}} rock concert, including an hour-long performance in KQED TV studios in April 1970. Adrian Maben had become interested in combining art with Pink Floyd's music, and during 1971, he attempted to contact the band's manager, Steve O'Rourke, to discuss the possibilities of making a film to achieve this aim. After his original plan <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> the band with assorted paintings had been rejected, Maben went on holiday to Naples in the early summer.|$|E
5|$|Archosaurs (crocodilians and birds) {{and mammals}} show {{complete}} {{separation of the}} heart into two pumps {{for a total of}} four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, {{at the base of the}} arterial trunks and there is some degree <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> between the blood in each side of the heart, during a dive underwater; thus, only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations – permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|Co-fusion steel process: Although British {{scientist}} and historian Joseph Needham speculates {{that it could}} have existed beforehand, the first clear written evidence of the fusion of wrought iron and cast iron to make steel comes from the 6th century AD in regards to the Daoist swordsmith Qiwu Huaiwen, who was put in charge of the arsenal of Northern Wei general Gao Huan from 543 to 550 AD. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) Newly Reorganized Pharmacopoeia of 659 also described this process <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> and heating wrought iron and cast iron together, stating that the steel product was used to make sickles and Chinese sabers. In regards to the latter text, Su Song (1020–1101) made a similar description and noted the steel's use for making swords.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, {{research}} chemists in Heilmeier {{group at}} RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed {{only in the}} number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105°C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is used to this very day to tailor materials to meet specific applications.|$|E
5|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by Kamikene and Daisuke Ishizaka of Hatos. It {{features}} two overlapping circles colored deep blue and bright blue, {{in order to create}} , a color close to indigo. The bright blue was chosen as it was a synthetic ink that regularly occurs in Japanese printing, while the deep blue was taken naturally, isolating a color taken from a photo of the sky just before dawn. The center of the artwork features the Kikuuiki typography, as well as a logo of two overlapping circles. The mix of natural and artificial blue circles was used to represent Kikuuikis theme <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> points.|$|E
5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E
40|$|In two {{longitudinal}} experiments, conducted both in {{the field}} and lab, we investigated the recollection <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> emotions. Results demonstrated that the intensity <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> emotions is generally underestimated at the time of recall [...] an effect that increases over time and does not occur to the same degree with unipolar emotions. Of note, the decline in memory <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> emotions is distinct from the pattern found for memory of negative emotions, implying that the recall bias is diagnostic of the complexity <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> emotions rather than of any association with negative affect. Finally, the memory decay effect was driven by the felt conflict aroused by the experience <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> emotions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the problems of the well-posedness for a system <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> quasivariational-like inequalities in Banach spaces.

40|$|Mixed methods {{research}} (the combined use {{of quantitative}} and qualitative methods in the same study) is becoming an increasingly popular approach in the discipline fields of sociology, psychology, education and health sciences. Calls for the integration of {{quantitative and qualitative}} research methods have been advanced in these fields. A key feature <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> methods research is its methodological pluralism, which frequently results in research which provides broader perspectives than those offered by monomethod designs. The overall purpose and central premise <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> methods is {{that the use of}} quantitative and qualitative approaches in combination provides a better understanding of research problems and complex phenomena than either approach alone. Despite calls for the combined use of quantitative and qualitative research in business and management studies, the use <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> methods in business and management has seldom been studied. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review the application <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> methods research within organisational research. The study reported in this paper identifies the use <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> methods in three organisational journals for the period 2003 to 2009 : the Strategic Management Journal, Journal of Organizational Behavior and Organizational Research Methods. The landmark Tashakkori and Teddlie (2003) Handbook <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> methods in social and behavioral research, played a pivotal role in providing both the visibility and credibility <b>of</b> <b>mixed</b> methods as a third methodological movement and since the publication of this seminal work the mixed methods movement has rapidly gained popularity.
