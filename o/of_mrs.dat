40|$|ABSTRACT: Healthy {{aging and}} {{longevity}} depend on successful and dy-namic interactions among biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Biological aging occurs mainly {{during the period}} of survival beyond the evolutionarily required essential lifespan (ELS). Natural se-lection processes for survival and successful reproduction have selected for a range of genetically determined ELS-assuring maintenance and repair systems (MRSs). The progressive failure <b>of</b> <b>MRSs,</b> and the con-sequent accumulation of molecular heterogeneity and damage, underlie the biological basis of aging, age-related diseases, and eventual death. However, the genetic processes <b>of</b> <b>MRSs</b> operate in a complex hierarchy of factors which range from intracellular molecular factors to physiologi-cal, psychological, environmental, and other stochastic factors, including chance. This view also facilitates setting up a framework for understand-ing, researching, and developing effective and realistic strategies for ag-ing intervention, prevention, and therapies. Manipulating genes and the milieu in which genes and gene products operate opens up novel possi-bilities of aging intervention and prevention. Gene therapy, stem cells, and modulation through functional foods, nutriceuticals, cosmeceuticals and lifestyle alterations, including mild stress-induced hormesis, are ex-amples of such strategies at various levels of development and practice...|$|R

It is shown that if there is reallocation of lifetime consumption and/or discounting of future utilities, then a TTO response that is not adjusted for these effects will unambiguously overestimate the ratios <b>of</b> individual <b>MRS.</b> While the effect of reallocation is likely to be very small, discounting can lead to significant overestimation, the magnitude of which depends in part upon the severity of the health state impairment...|$|R

40|$|Matrix {{attachment}} regions (MAR) are {{the sites}} on genomic DNA that {{interact with the}} nuclear matrix. A complex bipartite motif, the MAR recognition signature (MRS), has been proposed as a DNA sequence marker for MAR but its specificity and sensitivity remain unresolved. I describe here the distribution <b>of</b> the <b>MRS</b> in the genomes {{of a number of}} species from across animals and plants. The MRS is shown to have a distinctive, nonrandom distribution, with a particular relationship to genes. This relationship was studied in detail in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans, revealing striking peaks <b>of</b> average <b>MRS</b> frequency in the regions flanking C. elegans genes. The occurrence of similar peaks in C. briggsae, Danio rerio, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens was also investigated. The nucleotide content in the vicinity of genes is examined and it too is shown to have striking peaks in regions surrounding genes. C. elegans genes associated with MRS were found to be significantly enriched for receptor activity annotations but not for some other features. Using this analysis of the genomic distribution <b>of</b> the <b>MRS,</b> the relevance <b>of</b> the <b>MRS</b> as a marker for MAR is discussed. The potential for MRS to play a functional role, as indicated by their peculiar frequency in the vicinity of genes, is also explored. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|This {{proceedings}} volume contains papers {{presented at}} technology transfer seminars {{sponsored by the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) on New Technology for Ground Control in Retreat Mining. The seminars were conducted at five locations: Uniontown, PA (March 26, 1997), Norton, VA (April 8, 1997), Pikeville, KY (April 10, 1997), Charleston, WV (April 17, 1997), and Evansville, IN (April 22, 1997). The papers presented here describe several new, highly practical technologies developed by the NIOSH Pittsburgh and Spokane Research Centers 3 to improve safety during pillar retreat operations. Two central issues are addressed: pillar design and mobile roof supports (MRS's). Proper pillar sizing is essential for safe pillar extraction. The Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability (ARMPS) program and its large data base of actual mining case histories are presented. LAMODEL, a second computer program, {{can be used for}} analysis of multiple-seam and other complex mining situations. Other papers address pillar design to avoid massive pillar collapses and the proper role of coal strength testing. MRS's have greatly improved safety where they are used for pillar line support. We studied the application <b>of</b> <b>MRS's</b> at 20 mines throughout the Eastern United States. Conclusions regarding the most effective section layouts, cut sequences, and support placements are reported. Field and laboratory tests <b>of</b> <b>MRS's</b> are also described...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective Correlate {{the middle}} {{cerebral}} artery bifurcation aneurysm morphology with the pre-operative and intra-operative risk of rupture. Methods Forty patients with 46 middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysms were treated microsurgically {{by the same}} surgeon. Aneurysms were classified according to shape and the Fisher test was applied to analyze the effect of morphology on the pre-operative and intra-operative rupture. Results Pre-operative and intra-operative ruptures were observed in 8 / 46 patients (17. 4 %) and 14 / 46 patients (30. 4 %) respectively. Thirty-two cases (69. 6 %) had no symptoms postoperatively, modified Rankin score (<b>MRS)</b> <b>of</b> 0; 6. 5 % had <b>MRS</b> <b>of</b> 1 (no significant disability); 13 % had <b>MRS</b> <b>of</b> 2 (slight disability); 4. 3 % had moderately severe disability (<b>MRS</b> <b>of</b> 4); and there were 3 deaths (6. 5 %) post-operatively. The morphology was {{not directly related to}} the rupture rate. Conclusion In general, ruptures are not affected by the morphology or the studied variables.
