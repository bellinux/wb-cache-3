25|$|Reform {{mathematics}} is {{an approach to}} mathematics education, particularly in North America. It is based on principles explained in 1989 by the National Council <b>of</b> <b>Teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mathematics</b> (NCTM). The NCTM document, Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, attempted to set forth a vision for K-12 (ages 5-18) mathematics education in the United States and Canada. Their recommendations were adopted by many education agencies, from local to federal levels through the 1990s. In 2000, NCTM revised its standards {{with the publication of}} Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM). Like the first publication, these updated standards have continued to {{serve as the basis for}} many states' mathematics standards, and for many federally funded textbook projects. The first standards gave a strong call for a de-emphasis on manual arithmetic in favor of students' discovering their own knowledge and conceptual thinking. The PSSM has taken a more balanced view, but still emphasizes conceptual thinking and problem solving.|$|E

2500|$|In most countries, {{students}} use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial {{resistance to the}} idea {{out of fear that}} basic or elementary arithmetic skills would suffer. There remains disagreement {{about the importance of the}} ability to perform calculations in the head, with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching estimation methods and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in. Others have argued that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy, or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts. In December 2011 the UK's Minister of State for Schools, Nick Gibb, voiced concern that children can become [...] "too dependent" [...] on the use of calculators. As a result, the use of calculators is to be included as part of a review of the Curriculum.
