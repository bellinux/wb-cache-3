Translated {{excerpts}} from Hezbollah's original 1985 manifesto read:We are {{the sons of}} the umma (Muslim community)......We are an ummah linked to the Muslims of the whole world by the solid doctrinal and religious connection of Islam, whose message God wanted to be fulfilled by the Seal of the Prophets, i.e., Prophet Muhammad....

25|$|The basic case made by Ern's {{defenders}} {{was that}} his creation proved the validity of surrealist procedures: that in letting down their guard, opening themselves to free association and chance, McAuley and Stewart had reached inspiration by the side-door of parody; and though this can't be argued {{on behalf of all}} the poems, some of which are partly or wholly gibberish, it contains a ponderable truth... The energy of invention that McAuley and Stewart brought to their concoction of Ern Malley created an icon of literary value, and that is why he continues to haunt <b>our</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
25|$|As an {{integral}} part of human culture and civilization, shoes have found their way into <b>our</b> <b>culture,</b> folklore, and art. A popular 18th century nursery rhyme is There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe. This story tells about an old woman living in a shoe with a lot of children. In 1948, Mahlon Haines, a shoe salesman in Hallam, Pennsylvania, built an actual house shaped like a work boot as a form of advertisement. The Haines Shoe House was rented to newlyweds and the elderly until his death in 1962. Since then, it has served as an ice cream parlor, a bed and breakfast, and a museum. It still stands today and is a popular roadside attraction.|$|E

25|$|Simon rose to {{national}} {{attention in the}} 1960s, {{due in part to}} his well-researched book, Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years. Despite being published 100 years after Abraham Lincoln's death, it was the first book to exhaustively cite original source documents from Lincoln's eight years in the General Assembly. He later went on to write more than 20 books {{on a wide range of}} topics, including interfaith marriages (he was a Lutheran and his wife, Jeanne, was a Catholic), global water shortages, United States Supreme Court nomination battles that focused heavily on his personal experiences with Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas, his autobiography, and even a well-received book on slain Illinois preacher Elijah Lovejoy. His final book, <b>Our</b> <b>Culture</b> of Pandering, was published in October 2003, two months before his death.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s and 1990s saw a {{range of}} {{inquiries}} into many aspects of copyright law. A key driver for those reviews was {{the establishment of the}} Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC) in 1983 as an advisory body for copyright reform. The CLRC was disbanded in 2005 by the Australian government after it had produced a number of reports. Notable reports include: The meaning of Publication in the Copyright Act (1984), Use of Copyright materials by Churches (1985), Performers' Protection (1987), Moral Rights (1988), Report of Journalists' Copyright (1994), Computer Software Protection (1994), Simplification of the Copyright Act: Part 1 (1998), Simplification of the Copyright Act: Part 2 (1999), Jurisdiction and Procedures of the Copyright Tribunal (2002), Copyright and Contract (2002) and Crown Copyright (2005). The CLRC also published reports on specific areas of copyright, including Highways to Change: Copyright in the New Communications Environment: report by the Copyright Convergence Group on technological advancement and the ability of legislation to cope with change (1994), Stopping the Rip-Offs: intellectual Property Protection for Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Peoples (1994), the Simpson Report 1995, long title Review of Australian Copyright Collecting Societies, the Bently and Sherman Report 1995, long title Performers' Rights: Options for Reform, the Janke Report 1999, long title <b>Our</b> <b>Culture,</b> Our Future, and the Ergas Report 2000, long title Report on Intellectual Property legislation under Competition Principles Agreement.|$|E

500|$|Editor Ralph Rosenblum's first {{assembly}} of the film in 1976 left Brickman disappointed. [...] "I felt that the film was running off in nine different directions," [...] Brickman recalled. [...] "It was like a first draft of a novel... from which two or three films could possibly be assembled." [...] Rosenblum characterized the first cut, at two hours and twenty minutes, as [...] "the surrealistic and abstract adventures of a neurotic Jewish comedian who was reliving his highly flawed life {{and in the process}} satirizing much of <b>our</b> <b>culture...</b> a visual monologue, a more sophisticated and more philosophical version of Take the Money and Run".
