5|$|Early {{observations}} {{have revealed}} a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, {{but no more}} than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded interstellar space, they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive specific <b>orbital</b> <b>energy</b> and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or take one and perhaps two orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt formed from the primordial solar nebula {{as a group}} of planetesimals. Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much <b>orbital</b> <b>energy</b> for them to accrete into a planet. Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the {{asteroid belt}}'s original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that white dwarfs with surface temperatures of less than 10,000 kelvins could harbor a habitable zone {{at a distance of}} c. 0.005 to 0.02 AU that would last upwards of 3 billion years. The goal is to search for transits of hypothetical Earth-like planets that could have migrated inward and/or formed there. As a white dwarf has a size similar to that of a planet, these kinds of transits would produce strong eclipses. Newer research casts some doubts on this idea, given that the close orbits of those hypothetical planets around their parent stars would subject them to strong tidal forces that could render them unhabitable by triggering a greenhouse effect. Another suggested constraint to this idea is the origin of those planets. Leaving aside in-situ formation on an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf, there are two ways a planet could end in a close orbit around stars of this kind: by surviving being engulfed by the star during its red giant phase, and then spiraling towards its core, or inward migration after the white dwarf has formed. The former case is implausible for low-mass bodies, as they are unlikely to survive being absorbed by their stars. In the latter case, the planets would have to expel so much <b>orbital</b> <b>energy</b> as heat, through tidal interactions with the white dwarf, that they would likely end as uninhabitable embers.|$|E
40|$|The {{optimized}} effective potential (OEP) is (within {{a certain}} linear response approximation) the exact exchange-correlation potential of density-functional theory (DFT). In the program DEMON-DYNARHO, we have implemented the OEP at the exchange-only level without {{the evaluation of}} four-center integrals using resolution-of-the-identity techniques. We point out that great {{care must be taken}} in treating the asymptotic behavior of the OEP in finite basis set methods. Our results are compared with previous work using OEP-like potentials. Our OEP <b>orbital</b> <b>energies</b> are compared with experimental ionization potentials, Hartree-Fock (HF) <b>orbital</b> <b>energies,</b> and with <b>orbital</b> <b>energies</b> from the local density approximation (LDA) potential, with and without asymptotic correction (AC). We find that OEP <b>orbital</b> <b>energies</b> are a much better approximation to experimental ionization potentials than are HF <b>orbital</b> <b>energies.</b> LDA <b>orbital</b> <b>energies</b> also correlate well with OEP <b>orbital</b> <b>energies,</b> except for a molecule-dependent rigid shift, due to the well-known fact that the LDA potential falls off too rapidly at large distances. The resultant underbinding is largely corrected by the AC-LDA potential whose <b>orbital</b> <b>energies</b> correlate well with OEP <b>orbital</b> <b>energies,</b> with typical differences on the order of 0. 5 eV. However larger differences between AC-LDA and OEP <b>orbital</b> <b>energies</b> are also observed, particularly for unoccupied orbitals and {{the reason for this is}} discussed. As an illustration of how the OEP might be used in practical calculations, we give an example from time-dependent DFT where use of the OEP instead of the AC-LDA potential leads to significant improvement in a key sigma [...] >pi* excitation energy of ethylene.

25|$|One subtle {{feature of}} rockets relates to energy. A rocket stage, while {{carrying}} a given load, {{is capable of}} giving a particular delta-v.

25|$|The {{rotational}} {{angular momentum}} of Earth decreases and consequently {{the length of}} the day increases. The net tide raised on Earth by the Moon is dragged ahead of the Moon by Earth's much faster rotation. Tidal friction is required to drag and maintain the bulge ahead of the Moon, and it dissipates the excess energy of the exchange of rotational and <b>orbital</b> <b>energy</b> between Earth and the Moon as heat. If the friction and heat dissipation were not present, the Moon's gravitational force on the tidal bulge would rapidly (within two days) bring the tide back into synchronization with the Moon, and the Moon would no longer recede. Most of the dissipation occurs in a turbulent bottom boundary layer in shallow seas such as the European Shelf around the British Isles, the Patagonian Shelf off Argentina, and the Bering Sea.|$|E
25|$|The {{satellite}} system of Uranus is notably {{different from those}} of Jupiter and Saturn in that it lacks precise resonances among the larger moons, while the majority of the larger moons of Jupiter (3 of the 4 largest) and of Saturn (6 of the 8 largest) are in mean-motion resonances. In all three {{satellite system}}s, moons were likely captured into mean-motion resonances in the past as their orbits shifted due to tidal dissipation (a process by which satellites gain <b>orbital</b> <b>energy</b> {{at the expense of the}} primary's rotational energy, affecting inner moons disproportionately). In the Uranian system, however, due to the planet's lesser degree of oblateness, and the larger relative size of its satellites, escape from a mean-motion resonance is much easier. Lower oblateness of the primary alters its gravitational field in such a way that different possible resonances are spaced more closely together. A larger relative satellite size increases the strength of their interactions. Both factors lead to more chaotic orbital behavior at or near mean-motion resonances. Escape from a resonance may be associated with capture into a secondary resonance, and/or tidal evolution-driven increases in orbital eccentricity or inclination.|$|E

2500|$|Earth's {{companion}} object 3753 Cruithne is in {{a relationship}} with Earth that is somewhat trojan-like, but that is different from a true trojan. Cruithne occupies one of two regular solar orbits, one of them slightly smaller and faster than Earth's, and the other slightly larger and slower. It periodically alternates between these two orbits due to close encounters with Earth. When it is in the smaller, faster orbit and approaches Earth, it gains <b>orbital</b> <b>energy</b> from Earth and moves up into the larger, slower orbit. It then falls farther and farther behind Earth, and eventually Earth approaches it from the other direction. Then Cruithne gives up <b>orbital</b> <b>energy</b> to Earth, and drops back into the smaller orbit, thus beginning the cycle anew.
