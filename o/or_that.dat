5|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} and treatment are important {{in the care of}} TBI; if the injury is not diagnosed shortly after the injury, the risk of complications is higher. Bronchoscopy is the most effective method to diagnose, locate, and determine the severity of TBI, and it is usually the only method that allows a definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis with a flexible bronchoscope, which allows the injury to be visualized directly, is the fastest and most reliable technique. In people with TBI, bronchoscopy may reveal that the airway is torn, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> the airways are blocked by blood, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> a bronchus has collapsed, obscuring more distal (lower) bronchi from view.|$|E

5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, <b>or</b> <b>that,</b> rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} is any {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> has {{a mixture of}} them. There is neither a standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use {{in the literature of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced.

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{the fleet}} sent by Darius {{consisted}} of 600 triremes. There {{is no indication}} in the historical sources of how many transport ships accompanied them, if any. Herodotus claimed that 3,000 transport ships accompanied 1,207 triremes during Xerxes's invasion in 480 BC. Among modern historians, some have accepted this number of ships as reasonable; {{it has been suggested}} either that the number 600 represents the combined number of triremes and transport ships, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> there were horse transports in addition to 600 triremes.|$|E
5|$|According to Penton, Rutherford's austerity—evidenced by his {{distaste for}} Christmas, {{birthday}} parties and other popular customs that {{were described as}} of pagan origin <b>or</b> <b>that</b> encouraged creature worship and {{were not to be}} observed—led in turn to austerity becoming a part of Witness life. In 1938, he directed that singing be dispensed with at congregation meetings; singing was reinstated soon after his death.|$|E
