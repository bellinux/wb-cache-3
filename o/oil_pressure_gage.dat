40|$|The {{basis of}} {{the design of the}} oil system of a H. V. oil filled cable circuit is {{considered}} in particular the choice of oil feed locations along the cable route. Methods are established for determining the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tank requirements and the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> response on application of step or pulse loads for typical oil sections of a single core H. V. oil filled cable circuit. These methods are applied to an existing 132 KV installation and minimum <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tankage requirements and the maximum and minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> considering various loading conditions determined. To establish the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> the <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> occurring on switching off various continuous loads are compared to that occurring on switching off load shortly after having switched on. Recommendations are made for similar circuits based on the loading condition giving the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> Possible ways of verifying the theoretical methods and en electrical analogue of the oil system are considered...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{multiple}} acts of tatsumaki hit Kanagawa, Tokyo, Aichi and Kagoshima October 6 and 7, {{which is}} rare in Japan. This paper reports the weather information and structural damage at Kaseda and Sakurajima {{based on the information}} of governmental meteorological stations, AMeDAS and NeWMeK data. In early 2002 the authors have newly put atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>gages</b> on NeWMeK 2 Ì† 7 s observation sites and started its measurement. The records of the atmospheric <b>pressures</b> <b>gages</b> at the damaged area nearby suggest that other tatsumaki may have appeared besides the damage-reported regions. The wind damage in Kagoshima Prefecture was not so severe compared with the other places of the simultaneous multiple tatsumaki attacks and is estimated at FO or Fl of the Fujita scale...|$|R
50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is higher}} when {{the engine is}} cold due to the {{increased}} viscosity of the oil, and also increases with engine speed until the relief valve in the oil pump opens to divert excess flow. <b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is lowest under hot idling conditions, and the minimum pressure allowed by the manufacturer's tolerances is usually given at this point. Excessive <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may indicate a blocked filter, blocked oil gallery or the wrong grade of <b>oil.</b> Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> indicates worn bearings or a broken oil pump.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{control of}} <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> of wet-clutch {{is of great}} {{importance}} for improving shift quality. Based on dynamic models of two-gear planetary transmission and hydraulic control system, a trajectory tracking model of <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> was built by sliding mode control method. An experiment was designed to verify the validity of hydraulic control system, through which the relationship between duty cycle of on-off valve and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> of clutch was determined. The tracking effect was analyzed by simulation. Results showed that <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> could follow well the optimal trajectory and the shift quality was effectively improved...|$|R

50|$|There {{has been}} a {{technical}} {{change in the way}} <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is regulated in the clutch, i.e. FWD switching. <b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> on the clutch plates is now regulated by a centrifugal valve integrated in the electric axial six piston oil pump. Compared to the previous generation, the Haldex 5 system is 1.4 kg lighter (ca. 6.6 kg without oil) and simpler as it does not contain an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> accumulator.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> idiot light lights when engine <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{drops below}} a {{predetermined}} level. The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on, but {{the engine is}} not running, as it detects no <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> due to the oil pump not operating (the oil pump is powered off the crankshaft, so only operates when the engine is running). It normally turns off a few seconds after engine start as the oil pump starts working and building up <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> This tell-tale can bear the legend [...] or a pictogram of an oil can. Some cars illuminate the light red or yellow, depending on the action needed to be taken.|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> 1) no <b>oil</b> or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken pressure relief valve spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip. Also the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings will seize. Indications of low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may be that the warning light is on, a low pressure reading on the gauge, or clattering/clinking noises from the engine. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is a problem that must be addressed immediately to prevent serious damage.|$|R
