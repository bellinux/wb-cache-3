5|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, brevet {{promotions}} were {{common in the}} United States armed forces. New officers received brevet rank until authorized positions were made available, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> could be brevetted to fill higher positions for gallantry. During the American Civil War, most senior officers received a brevet promotion, particularly during the final months of the war.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are composed}} of several protein domains, i.e. segments of a protein that fold into distinct structural units. Domains usually also have specific functions, such as enzymatic activities (e.g. kinase) <b>or</b> <b>they</b> serve as binding modules (e.g. the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences in other proteins).|$|E
50|$|Some resisters {{refuse to}} willingly pay only certain taxes, either because those taxes are {{especially}} noxious to them, <b>or</b> because <b>they</b> present a useful symbolic target, <b>or</b> because <b>they</b> {{are more easily}} resisted.|$|R

5|$|Seeds of B.sessilis are short-lived, {{and must}} {{germinate}} {{in the winter}} following their release, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> die. They are also very sensitive to heating, and thus killed by bushfire; in one study, just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the germination rate from 85% to 22%, {{and not a single}} seed survived one minute of boiling.|$|E
5|$|The {{speakers}} {{for modern}} sirens can be {{integral to the}} lightbar, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> may be hidden in or flush to the grill to reduce noise inside the ambulance that may interfere with patient care and radio communications.

5|$|A {{game played}} under time control will end as {{a loss for}} a player who uses up all of their allotted time, unless the {{opponent}} cannot possibly checkmate him (see the Timing section above). There are different types of time control. Players may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game <b>or</b> <b>they</b> may {{have to make a}} certain number of moves within a specified time. Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.|$|E

50|$|They {{often seem}} to {{have no idea who}} <b>or</b> what <b>they</b> are, where <b>they</b> belong <b>or</b> where <b>they</b> want to go. They may {{withdraw}} from normal life, not taking action <b>or</b> acting as <b>they</b> usually would at work, in their marriage <b>or</b> at school. <b>They</b> may even turn to negative activities, such as crime or drugs, as a way of dealing with identity crisis. To someone having an identity crisis, it is more acceptable to them to have a negative identity than none at all.|$|R
5|$|Accounts vary, but historians {{estimate}} that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices <b>or</b> <b>they</b> would burn it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise. Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must breathe air periodically <b>or</b> <b>they</b> suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E

5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might bring}} to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms {{that do not}} harm its own biosphere. Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which would have no immunity to them, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship <b>or</b> <b>they</b> can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E
5|$|Apical abscesses {{can spread}} to involve {{periodontal}} pockets around a tooth, and periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen {{at the bottom}} of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.|$|E

5|$|At times, when a {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> might be broken. When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One {{of the most striking}} archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down. At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, where most of the stelae were found smashed.|$|E
5|$|Caesar's Legion – {{siding with}} the Legion will lead the Courier to help attack Hoover Dam. The Courier must also enter Oliver's {{compound}} where they have the choice to either convince him to retreat {{for the sake of}} his men, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> can kill him. The Legion seizes Hoover Dam, forcing the NCR to retreat, allowing Caesar's Legion to gain control over New Vegas and the Mojave Wasteland.|$|E
5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit <b>or</b> <b>they</b> may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
50|$|These birds forage {{in flight}} or pick up objects while swimming, walking <b>or</b> wading. <b>They</b> mainly eat insects, fish and eggs. They also {{scavenge}} at garbage dumps <b>or</b> docks. <b>They</b> may follow plows in fields for insects stirred up by this activity.|$|R
