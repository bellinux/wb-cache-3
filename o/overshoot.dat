5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during <b>overshoot</b> from an {{asymmetric}} power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the <b>overshoot</b> the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. The engines that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than the engines at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.|$|E

40|$|Several {{articles}} {{claim that}} Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) shows that nominal exchange rates experience a delayed version of Dornbusch <b>overshooting.</b> These same articles usually claim that impulse responses {{similar to those}} in Eichenbaum and Evans are evidence of such <b>overshooting.</b> But Eichenbaum and Evans never claim that their evidence implies <b>overshooting,</b> delayed or otherwise. More importantly, impulse response functions like those in Eichenbaum and Evans do not support <b>overshooting.</b> Three recent articles repeat this misinterpretation of the evidence. My objective is to use those articles to illustrate how the evidence about <b>overshooting</b> is widely misinterpreted.

5|$|Control {{systems have}} a need for {{smoothing}} filters in their feedback loops with criteria to maximise the speed of movement of a mechanical system to the prescribed mark {{and at the same}} time minimise <b>overshoot</b> and noise induced motions. A key problem here is the extraction of Gaussian signals from a noisy background. An early paper on this was published during WWII by Norbert Wiener with the specific application to anti-aircraft fire control analogue computers. Rudy Kalman (Kalman filter) later reformulated this in terms of state-space smoothing and prediction where it is known as the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem. Kalman started an interest in state-space solutions, but according to Darlington this approach can also be found in the work of Heaviside and earlier.|$|E
40|$|During {{currency}} crises, some currencies depreciate {{more than}} the post-crisis exchange rate level, which {{can be described as}} exchange rate <b>overshooting.</b> Previous studies have claimed that a tight monetary policy, represented by an increase in the interest rate, stabilizes an exchange rate by causing currency appreciation, thereby explaining <b>overshooting.</b> This paper tests the hypothesis that <b>overshooting</b> simply reflects the overreaction of investors due to financial panic during currency crises, regardless of subsequent domestic policies. Empirical results suggest that: (1) the positive relationship between monetary tightening and the <b>overshooting</b> measure is very sensitive to sample selection; and (2) the measure of financial panic has a significant and positive relationship with the measure of <b>overshooting</b> in non-European countries.

5|$|About 14:00 on 9 April, two Staffeln of German Messerschmitt Bf 109 {{fighters from}} II. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 54 were {{observed}} heading towards Nova Topola just as two IK-2s were landing after a patrol in poor flying weather. One of the IK-2s managed to <b>overshoot</b> and climbed to meet them, {{but the other}} was unable to, and had to complete its landing. Podnarednik (Junior Sergeant) Branko Jovanović used the extreme manoeuvrability of his IK-2 to avoid the nine Bf 109s that swooped in to attack, while a total of eight Hurricanes and five more IK-2s from the 4th Fighter Regiment scrambled to meet the Germans. For the following seven or eight minutes, a furious dogfight ensued over Novo Topola, during which two German aircraft were claimed and two Hurricanes and one IK-2 were lost. German records indicate that only one of their aircraft was lost, and that the pilot survived. Podnarednik Stikić survived {{the loss of his}} IK-2, but was badly wounded.

25|$|A {{system with}} an {{intermediate}} quality factor (Qnbsp&=nbsp&) {{is said to}} be critically damped. Like an overdamped system, the output does not oscillate, and does not <b>overshoot</b> its steady-state output (i.e., it approaches a steady-state asymptote). Like an underdamped response, the output of such a system responds quickly to a unit step input. Critical damping results in the fastest response (approach to the final value) possible without <b>overshoot.</b> Real system specifications usually allow some <b>overshoot</b> for a faster initial response or require a slower initial response to provide a safety margin against <b>overshoot.</b>|$|E

40|$|Helioseismic {{investigation}} has suggested {{to apply the}} turbulent convection models (TCMs) to the convective <b>overshooting.</b> Using the turbulent velocity in the <b>overshooting</b> region determined by the TCM, one {{can deal with the}} <b>overshooting</b> mixing as a diffusion process, which leads to incomplete mixing. It has been found that this treatment can improve the solar sound speed and the Li depletion in open clusters. In order to investigate whether the TCM {{can be applied to the}} <b>overshooting</b> mixing outside the stellar convective core, new observations of the eclipsing binary star HY Vir are adopted to calibrate the <b>overshooting</b> mixing parameter. The main conclusions are as follows: (i) the TCM parameters and the <b>overshooting</b> mixing parameter in the solar case are also suitable for the eclipsing binary system HY Vir; (ii) the incomplete mixing results in a continuous profile of the hydrogen abundance; (iii) the e-folding length of the region, in which the hydrogen abundance changes due to the <b>overshooting</b> mixing, increases during the stellar evolution.

25|$|A {{derivative}} term {{does not}} consider the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but {{the rate of change}} of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces <b>overshoot</b> (error on the other side because too great applied force). Applying too much impetus when the error is small and is reducing will lead to <b>overshoot.</b> After overshooting, if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly <b>overshoot</b> the desired position, the output would oscillate around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying sinusoid.

25|$|Another problem {{faced with}} PID {{controllers}} {{is that they}} are linear, and in particular symmetric. Thus, performance of PID controllers in non-linear systems (such as HVAC systems) is variable. For example, in temperature control, a common use case is active heating (via a heating element) but passive cooling (heating off, but no cooling), so <b>overshoot</b> can only be corrected slowly – it cannot be forced downward. In this case the PID should be tuned to be overdamped, to prevent or reduce <b>overshoot,</b> though this reduces performance (it increases settling time).|$|E

40|$|As a phenomena, {{the overall}} {{influence}} of <b>overshooting</b> convection {{on the water}} budget of the Tropical Tropopause/Transition Layer (TTL) is still open to question. While there have been arguments that <b>overshooting</b> convection either causes a net dehydration effect or a net moistening effect in the UTLS region, the primary mechanisms/processes governing such water vapour tendencies remain unclear. Given that global <b>overshooting</b> events are occurring more frequently than previously thought (e. g.

40|$|The helioseimic {{investigation}} {{shows that}} the convective <b>overshooting</b> can penetrate 0. 37 H_P to the location where the temperature is 2. 5 × 10 ^ 6 K which is the typical temperature of the reaction Li^ 7 (p,α) He^ 4. This indicates that the <b>overshooting</b> mixing {{should be involved in}} investigating the solar Li abundance problem. Observations of Li abundance of solar-twins show that the sun is not very peculiar. The <b>overshooting</b> mixing should be also involved in investigating Li abundance in clusters. However, the fully <b>overshooting</b> mixing with the length of 0. 37 H_P results in too much Li depletion to fit the observation in the solar case. Therefore, using the diffusive process to describe the <b>overshooting</b> is more suitable. The diffusive <b>overshooting</b> approach requires the turbulent r. m. s. velocity in the <b>overshooting</b> region to calculate the diffusion coefficient. Turbulent convection models(TCMs), which are suggested by helioseimic investigation, can provide the turbulent properties in the <b>overshooting</b> region. However, TCMs are often too complex to be applied in the calculations of the stellar evolution. It is an easier way to use the asymptotic solution of TCMs. In this paper, I use the asymptotic solution of Li & Yang's TCM, which results in agreements in both solar sound speed and solar Li abundance, to investigate Li abundance in clusters(Hyades, Praesepe, NGC 6633, NGC 752, NGC 3680 & M 67).
