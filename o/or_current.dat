5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (<b>or</b> <b>current)</b> and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (<b>or</b> <b>current).</b>|$|E

In particular, 87Rb is used with other alkali metals in the development of spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers.|$|E

5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent <b>or</b> <b>current</b> lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|Small {{changes in}} the voltage applied across the base–emitter {{terminals}} cause the current between the emitter and the collector to change significantly.
