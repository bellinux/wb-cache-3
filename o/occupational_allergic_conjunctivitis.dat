Approximately 40 % of individuals {{in the developed countries}} have <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis,</b> and as such, it is {{the most common form of}} ocular allergy. Seasonal <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> is the most prevalent type of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> that impacts the quality of life of patients. This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, clinical efficacy, and safety of alcaftadine. Histamine and the pathological mechanism of ocular allergy will be briefly reviewed with the intent of providing a background for the detailed discussion on the clinical utility of alcaftadine in <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis.</b> The Medline PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases were used to search for evidence-based literature on histamine and immunopathological mechanism of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis,</b> as well as on pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and clinical efficacy of alcaftadine. The treatment and management goals of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> are to prevent or minimize the inflammatory cascade associated with allergic response in the early stages of the pathological mechanism. It is of note that activation of histamine receptors on immune and nonimmune cells are associated with allergen-induced inflammation of the conjunctiva and its associated ocular allergic manifestations, including itching, edema, hyperemia, and tearing. Alcaftadine is an efficacious multiple action antiallergic therapeutic agent with inverse agonist activity on H 1, H 2, and H 4 receptors, as well as anti-inflammatory and mast cell stabilizing effects that could provide therapeutic benefits to patients with <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis.</b> Keywords: alcaftadine, <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis,</b> histamine, immunopathological mechanisms, ocular allergie...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{pathogenesis}} of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> has {{not been}} clearly established. Moreover, previous studies fail to consider human models of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis.</b> This study investigated the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoiet in TSLP and its downstream molecules in conjunctival scrappings and tear. Methods. This cross-sectional study compares patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), seasonal <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> (SAC), and perennial <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> (PAC) with normal controls. There are 80 people recorded in Shanxi Eye Hospital. Increasingly, 20 are with VKC, 20 are with SAC, 20 are with PAC, and the remaining 20 are normal controls. Conjunctiva were harvested for total RNA extraction and gene expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Epithelial cells were collected to make pathological sections for immunohistochemical staining. Human tears were evaluated by Luminex microbead assay. A P value less than 0. 05 from Dunnett’s post hoc test in SPSS means a statistical significant distinction. Results.

Association between signalling through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR- 4) and adaptive immune responses has been observed in allergic airway disease. We examined whether administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a prototypic bacterial product that activates immune cells via TLR- 4, could affect the development of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and modify the immune response to ovalbumin (OVA) allergen in an experimental <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> (EAC) model. Mice were challenged with two doses of OVA via conjunctival sac after systemic challenge with OVA in alum. Several indicators for allergy were evaluated in wild-type and TLR- 4 −/− mice with or without adding of different doses of LPS into OVA in alum. Mice challenged with OVA via conjunctival sac following systemic challenge with OVA in alum had severe <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis.</b> Of interest, LPS administration markedly suppressed immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated and eosinophil-dependent conjunctival inflammation.

40|$|Allergic {{eye disease}} is a common disorder, {{affecting}} 15 % to 40 % of the population. There are four main types of ocular allergy: seasonal <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis,</b> perennial <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis,</b> vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC). While seasonal <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and perennial <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> are self-limiting without threat to vision, VKC and AKC are more severe, chronic diseases with a severe late-phase reaction and may cause damage to sight. Common symptoms of allergic eye disease include itching, tearing, redness, and discomfort, caused by release of histamine, arachidonic acid metabolites, cytokines and chemokines from mast cells, T lymphocytes, and eosinophils, resulting in an inflammatory response within the ocular surface tissues [1 - 4]. Cytokines and chemokine release from immune cells in the conjunctiva {{plays a key role}} in the persistence of inflam-mation in ocular allergic disease, by eliciting an immune response from the conjunctival epithelium and fibroblasts.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the development and mechanism(s) of allergic diseases has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. With the advent of genetic studies it has now become clear that the linear model, {{as defined by the}} allergic march, is no longer tenable. Instead, we must consider all allergies as complex multi-compartment models in which genes which control IgE production and also genes which govern other aspects of allergic disease, such as epithelium integrity, both play an important role. To explore such possibilities, this chapter asks four questions: 1. Is there any evidence of an abnormality in the conjunctival or nasal mucosa which would allow increased allergen penetration? Epithelial changes which are likely to facilitate allergen penetration are present in both <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and rhinitis, but they appear different. For example, epithelial PAR- 2 expression is elevated in allergic rhinitis whereas in seasonal <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis,</b> many structural proteins, including E-cadherin, CD 44, desmosomes, keratins K 5 / 6, K 7, K 8, K 13, K 14, K 18 and PAR- 2 are all reduced. 2. What is known about the immunology of sensitization in <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and <b>allergic</b> rhinitis? Clearly, great strides are being made with respect to the biology of dendritic cells and T regulatory cells and to the possibility of local IgE production, but there is little evidence to suggest differences between the mechanisms of sensitization in the eye and nose. 3. What is the pattern of mediator release in the immediate allergic response and the development of allergic inflammation in <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and <b>allergic</b> rhinitis? The pattern of the early phase allergic response in the eye and nose seem similar. While an eosinophil dominated late phase response and allergic inflammation are present in allergic rhinitis, they are only present in the more severe forms of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> such as AKC and VKC. 4. Is there any evidence for clinically relevant persistent inflammation or organ remodelling in <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and <b>allergic</b> rhinitis? A sustained inflammation and tissue remodelling are well established in the lower airways in asthma where they contribute significantly to the symptoms. However, in upper airways, although there do appear to be functional changes in sensory neurone structure and function in the nose during prolonged allergen exposure, tissue damage seems to be more limited and overt remodelling does not appear to occur in <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and is questionable in allergic rhinitis...|$|R
