Sometime in January 1975, five MICAA teams met together at the old Elizalde canteen to sign a pre-organizational agreement for the formation of what is now known as the Philippine Basketball Association. Dante Silverio, Ricardo Silverio’s nephew, was the official representative of Toyota who signed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> line.|$|E
500|$|The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) {{replied in}} the New Statesman that Goldacre was [...] "stuck in {{a bygone era}} where {{pharmaceutical}} companies wine and dine doctors in exchange for signing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> line". The ABPI issued a press release, writing that the pharmaceutical industry {{is responsible for the}} discovery of 90 percent of all medicines, and that it takes an average of 10–12 years and £1.1bn to introduce a medicine to the market, with just one in 5,000 new compounds receiving regulatory approval. This makes research and development an expensive and risky business. They wrote that the industry {{is one of the most}} heavily regulated in the world, and is committed to ensuring full transparency in the research and development of new medicines. They also maintained that the examples Goldacre offered were [...] "long documented and historical, and the companies concerned have long addressed these issues". Goldacre argues in the book that [...] "the most dangerous tactic of all is the industry's enduring claim that these problems are all in the past".|$|E

60|$|This {{was not the}} case. The {{latest news}} which Vladimir Brusiloff had had from Russia had been {{particularly}} cheering. Three of his principal creditors had perished in the last massacre of the bourgeoisie, and a man whom he owed for five years for a samovar {{and a pair of}} overshoes had fled the country, and had not been heard of since. It was not bad news from home that was depressing Vladimir. What was wrong with him was {{the fact that this was}} the eighty-second suburban literary reception he had been compelled to attend since he had landed in the country on his lecturing tour, and he was sick to death of it. When his agent had first suggested the trip, he had signed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> line without an instant's hesitation. Worked out in roubles, the fees offered had seemed just about right. But now, as he peered through the brushwood at the faces round him, and realized that eight out of ten of those present had manuscripts of some sort concealed on their persons, and were only waiting for an opportunity to whip them out and start reading, he wished that he had stayed at his quiet home in Nijni-Novgorod, where the worst thing that could happen to a fellow was a brace of bombs coming in through the window and mixing themselves up with his breakfast egg.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{properties}} such as roughness, gloss, surface wettability {{and other}} factors have great influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> reproduction attributes of presswork, and different paper factor has different effect weight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> reproduction. <b>The</b> main {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a new method to analyze the influence of paper properties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> reproduction. <b>The</b> method is to apply the grey relational analysis to analyze the influence law and the effect weight of paper factors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> reproduction during inkjet printing, which could provide theoretical guidance for improving the printability of paper. The grey relational analysis is a multi-factor statistical analysis method, which is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sample data and the grey incidence of various factors and is used to describe the strength, size and the order of the relationship between the factors. In this experiment, five types of inkjet printing paper were used to test their printing performance, and then <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> gain data were dealt with by the grey relational analysis method. Results showed that paper properties had a great influence on ink setting. Ink drop diffused and deformed less and dot gain was small when paper had smooth surface. According to the correlation coefficient degree of paper properties which influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> gain of inkjet printing, the sequence was whiteness, roughness, surface wettability and gloss. Whiteness and roughness could significantly influence dot gain, followed by surface wettability, and gloss with minimal impact. Experiment indicated that the grey relational analysis was a simple and effective tool to analyze the influence of paper properties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> reproduction of presswork...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} transport {{through a}} single-level quantum dot coupled to noncollinearly magnetized ferromagnets {{in the presence}} of localized spins in either the tunnel barrier or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quantum <b>dot.</b> For a spin embedded in the tunnel barrier, we find an interplay between current-induced switching of the spin, spin-dependent tunneling through the barrier and spin accumulation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> resulting in characteristic signals in the current. We, furthermore, find huge Fano factors due to random telegraph noise. For noncollinear geometries, an exchange field that depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> impurity spin state leads to characteristic fingerprints in the transport properties. In the case of a spin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quantum <b>dot,</b> we find that the frequency-dependent Fano factor can be used to study the nontrivial dynamics of <b>the</b> spins <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> due to <b>the</b> interplay between exchange interaction and coupling to external and exchange magnetic fields.

40|$|Considering Rashba quantum wires with a proximity-induced superconducting gap as {{physical}} realizations of Majorana fermions and quantum <b>dots,</b> we calculate <b>the</b> overlap of the Majorana wave functions {{with the local}} wave functions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dot.</b> We determine <b>the</b> spin-dependent tunneling amplitudes between these two localized states and show that we can tune into a fully spin polarized tunneling regime by changing <b>the</b> distance between <b>dot</b> and Majorana fermion.
