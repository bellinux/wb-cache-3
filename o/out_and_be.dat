5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|Once {{diamonds}} {{have been}} {{transported to the}} surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may erode <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds {{is known as a}} primary source of diamonds. Secondary sources of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include alluvial deposits and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density. Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers (notably in Wisconsin and Indiana); in contrast to alluvial deposits, glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.|$|E
25|$|In Pinaceae, Araucariaceae, Sciadopityaceae {{and most}} Cupressaceae, the cones are woody, and when mature the scales usually spread open {{allowing}} the seeds to fall <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> dispersed by the wind. In some (e.g. firs and cedars), the cones disintegrate {{to release the}} seeds, and in others (e.g. the pines that produce pine nuts) the nut-like seeds are dispersed by birds (mainly nutcrackers, and jays), which break up the specially adapted softer cones. Ripe cones may remain on the plant for a varied amount of time before falling to the ground; in some fire-adapted pines, the seeds may be stored in closed cones for up to 60–80 years, being released only when a fire kills the parent tree.|$|E

Said Casey:"The conspiracy exists among prominent politicians to stifle any debate on the immigration issue, and among ethnic leaders in the community to diffuse any opposition to unlimited Asian immigration. The facts are plain to see. The majority of Australians are against it, but nothing is done to ensure their wishes are fulfilled. I spoke <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> vilified. Professor Blainey spoke <b>out</b> <b>and</b> lost his job. John Howard spoke <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> dumped as opposition leader.

500|$|Lord Fraser {{advocated}} {{that when}} [...] "construction management" [...] contracts were used, civil servants or local government officials should evaluate {{the risks of}} such a contract and set out {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of embarking upon such a route before their political superiors. Alongside that recommendation, Lord Fraser stated that independent advisors should be retained and have the ability to communicate their advice to ministers, without those views being [...] "filtered" [...] by public officials. Similarly, where civil servants are part of large project management contracts, clear guidelines of governance should be set <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> as rigorous as standards applied in the private sector.|$|E

Reviewers {{of the shows}} noted Ocean's low-key stage presence and observed crowd screams and audience members singing-along to songs. After his performance at the [...] in Washington, D.C., Ocean reflected on the tour and wrote on his Twitter account, [...] "This tourlife takes some getting used to. I get to zone <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> someones hero or deviant fantasy or whatever for a hour and some change every night though. That's special, and the women still scream in the front row." [...] Ocean cancelled his tour-closing show at Saint Andrew's Hall in Detroit on August 1 due to illness.|$|E
500|$|Afterward, during {{qualifying}}, forty-six {{cars were}} entered, but only forty-three {{were able to}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Edwards clinched his seventh pole position during his career, {{with a time of}} 26.395, which made a new track record. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Allmendinger. Kurt Busch qualified third, Biffle took fourth, and Jamie McMurray started fifth. Hamlin, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified seventeenth, while Johnson was scored twenty-first. The three drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Joe Nemechek, Michael McDowell, and Jason Leffler. Once the qualifying session completed, Edwards commented, [...] "The first thing that we’re going to have an advantage Sunday is with our pit stall, that’s going to help us a lot. I think we have an advantage because [...] {{have to be a little}} bit conservative. Guys like myself we’re really battling for fourth in points and battling for wins.

500|$|Thompson's only {{credit of}} 2002 was a vocal {{performance}} in Disney's Treasure Planet, {{an adaptation of}} Treasure Island, where she voiced Captain Amelia. The animation earned far less than its large budget and was considered a [...] "box office disaster". This failure was countered the following year by one of Thompson's biggest commercial successes, Richard Curtis's romantic comedy Love Actually. As part of an ensemble cast that included Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, and Colin Firth, she played a middle-class wife who suspects her husband (played by Alan Rickman) of infidelity. The scene in which her stalwart character breaks down was described by one critic as [...] "the best crying on screen ever", and in 2013, Thompson mentioned that she gets commended for this role more than any other. She explained, [...] "I've had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom then having to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer." [...] Her performance received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E
500|$|When the Rangers {{yelled to}} the POWs to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> rescued, {{many of the}} POWs feared {{that it was the}} Japanese {{attempting}} to trick them into being killed. Also, a substantial number resisted because the Rangers' weapons and uniforms looked nothing like those of a few years earlier; for example, the Rangers wore caps, earlier soldiers had M1917 Helmets and coincidentally, the Japanese also wore caps. The Rangers were challenged by the POWs and asked who they were and where they were from. Rangers sometimes had to resort to physical force to remove the detainees, throwing or kicking them out. Some of the POWs weighed so little due to illness and malnourishment that several Rangers carried two men on their backs. Once out of the barracks, they were told by the Rangers to proceed to the main, or front gate. Prisoners were disoriented because the [...] "main gate" [...] meant the entrance to the American side of the camp. POWs collided with each other in the confusion but were eventually led out by the Rangers.|$|E
500|$|Aden is characterised as a [...] "bad boy" [...] {{who goes}} on a journey {{to become one of}} the [...] "good guys". Aden's backstory played a {{substantial}} role in his early material. His childhood was plagued with sexual abuse at the hands of his grandfather, while Aden's father, Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson) became an alcoholic. Lasance and scriptwriters have both pointed out that these events impacted on Aden's life and contribute to his destructive personality. As Aden begins to trust others again, he gains a close circle of friends including Nicole Franklin (Tessa James), Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) and Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances). He also has a nemesis throughout his tenure in the form of Geoff Campbell (Lincoln Lewis). However, his main relationship is with Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey); when the actors first heard that their on-screen counterparts would enter a relationship, they both complained to producers. Both felt like it would not work <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> ill-received by viewers. However, the two realised they had chemistry as a duo and took a chance. The couple became popular with viewers and fans coined the term [...] "Adelle" [...] to refer to the pair.|$|E

500|$|In Game 6 of the series, the Express led by {{four points}} {{by the end}} of the first quarter, but the Rainmen responded with a 21–9 run and led by 12 points at halftime. Windsor, however, entered the fourth quarter with a score of 85–85 after {{dominating}} the third. In the third quarter, they shot 21 free throws. The Express kept it close in the final minutes of the game and held Halifax off to win the contest, 119–112, forcing a decisive Game 7. Quinnel Brown led the way for Windsor with 30 points, 16 of them off free throws. After the game, Rainmen head coach Josep Clarós expressed his unhappiness with the calls made by the referees against his team. Clarós said that rather than protesting to the league, he would [...] "send film to FIBA." [...] He commented on the officiating, [...] "It's ridiculous for a final of a professional league in Canada." [...] An anonymous referee later denounced the league's policy regarding player fines and suspensions. He said, [...] "So you could have a guy punch a guy in the face in Game 1, get kicked <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> playing in Game 2." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the fall}} of the Taliban, Pope John Paul II {{requested}} that Fr. Moretti return to Afghanistan. The first Mass in 9 years was celebrated on January 27, 2002, for members of the International Security Force and various members of foreign agencies. On May 16, 2002, a mission sui iuris was created for all of Afghanistan. There is only one functioning chapel in the country, in the Italian Embassy in Kabul. Projects of the new mission include a [...] "Peace School" [...] for 500 students that began construction in August 2003 and will be to [...] "European standards". Three religious sisters also work with those who have mental disabilities in the capital city, teaching those with cerebral palsy how to go to the toilet and how to eat on their own. The small community went through a period of crisis during the kidnapping on May 17, 2005, of Clementina Cantoni, a member of CARE International, by four gunmen in Kabul as she walked to her car. Sisters from the Missionaries of Charity had their house blessed on May 9, 2006, and have already started taking in street children. There had been fears that their distinctive blue and white habit would make them stand <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> harassed by Muslims, but their institute is generally respected. Jesuit Relief Services has also applied to join the growing number of religious institutes in the country. Jesuit Refugee Services has recently opened a technical school in Herat for 500 students including 120 girls.|$|E
500|$|The album's release {{generated}} much publicity over a sales {{competition with}} 50 Cent's Curtis. Three months that were {{prior to the}} September 11 release date, West extended his gratitude towards 50 Cent for the enthusiasm and excitement the friendly competition had produced. Though confident that he would emerge victorious, West {{said that he would}} be perfectly fine with losing to 50 Cent, saying that he'd rather, [...] "be #2 on that day rather than come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> #1 on a day nobody cares about." [...] In an interview for USA Today, 50 Cent expressed his view on the idea of a sales competition, stating [...] "It's great marketing — for Kanye West. But I sell way more records than Kanye West, and I generate way more interest than Kanye West. They think they can match us up, but they'll find out when that week goes by and the sales come back. This is no rivalry." [...] "Mine will sell and his will still be on the shelf," [...] 50 Cent tells ROLLING STONE". On August 10, 50 Cent confirmed during an interview with SOHH that he would end his career as a solo recording artist if Graduation were to sell more copies than Curtis in the United States. However, 50 Cent later retracted his statement within an MTV interview due to his contract agreements with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. [...] But most retailers and radio programmers interviewed pick Kanye, whose current single, [...] "Stronger," [...] is Number Six on BiIIboard's Hot 100 -while none of 50's four singles have climbed higher than thirty-two.

A month later, Farah won the silver medal in the European Championship 5000m in Gothenburg. Coaches Alan Storey and Mark Rowland made sure that Farah remained competitive and a few words from Paula Radcliffe before the 5000m final inspired Farah. He has stated that: [...] "She said to me, 'Go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> brave. Just believe in yourself'."

2500|$|Bader {{was born}} on 21 February 1910 in St John's Wood, London, the second son of Frederick Roberts Bader, a civil engineer, and his wife Jessie Scott MacKenzie [...] His first two years were spent with McCann {{relatives}} in the Isle of Man while his father, accompanied by Bader's mother and older brother Frederick (named after his father but called ‘Derick’ to distinguish the two), returned to his work in India {{after the birth of}} his son. At the age of two, Bader joined his parents in India for a year; however, when his father resigned from his job in 1913 the family moved back to London and settled in Kew. Bader's father saw action in the First World War in the Royal Engineers, and was wounded in action in 1917. He remained in France after the war, where, having attained the rank of major, he died in 1922 of complications from those wounds in a hospital in Saint-Omer, the same area where Bader would bail <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> captured in 1941.|$|E

[...] "People get put into groups. [...] "You’re a jock, you’re a cheerleader, you’re a freak, you’re in the drama department. I had a lot of trouble fitting into those groups when I was in high school because I {{wanted to be a part}} of all of them," [...] she said. [...] "I think that’s how a lot of people are.

2500|$|At 09:40 {{the signal}} to {{withdraw}} was sent to all the assault forces - [...] "Vanquish 1100 hours". This presented great difficulties for the LCAs as they were designed best to beach on rising tides and the tide would not rise again for some hours. A few soldiers managed to swim <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> picked up by friendly craft but many more {{were killed in the}} attempt. Unarmoured craft could not come near the beach because the fire was too heavy. Several LCAs went in to evacuate troops, including the four surviving craft of the 10th LCA Flotilla, but suffered due to the intense fire from mortars and machine-guns; two 10th Flotilla craft were sunk. When Ferguson saw that {{there was no sign of}} life on the beach, he reluctantly obeyed an order to withdraw. Only one craft, LCA 209, managed to touch down on Blue Beach for the evacuation and while taking wounded aboard it was unable to raise its ramp before it pushed off the beach. Grenades and mortar bombs added more casualties, and with men hanging on to LCA 209's sides, mortar bombs finally sank it. By 08:30 the Royal Regiment had surrendered.|$|E
