2500|$|Damage is Jimmy Eat World's first studio {{album to}} be {{released}} on RCA Records. Regarding this, vocalist and guitarist Jim Adkins noted: [...] "There's {{a lot of people}} there we've just crossed paths with over the years and who have been really supportive of us even if they didn't have a stake in how our records did. It's an interesting time. It's our best educated guess on where we feel comfortable being." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton stated: [...] " [...] we just toured, saved up all <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>money</b> and were able to save up enough money to record by ourselves, and then we shopped the record around. That's what we did for Bleed American too. We ended up signing to DreamWorks and eventually got bought out by Interscope and we were on Interscope for awhile [...] The fans basically made Damage for us by showing up to concerts and supporting us." [...] "I Will Steal You Back" [...] was released on April 16, 2013, and impacted radio the same day. Damage was released on June 11. [...] "Damage" [...] impacted radio on August 6, 2013.|$|E

"'It Is {{farther to}} be observed, that 21 shillings, {{which is the}} value of a guinea in England, makes in Ireland 22 shillings and 9 pence, whereas a guinea passes for 23 shillings with us, therefore, he who sends silver into England, gains three pence more by it than if he sent guineas; this advantage, though it may seem little, yet in a manner has entirely drained us <b>of</b> <b>our</b> English <b>money</b> which was given in lieu of foreign silver.|$|R

5000|$|Although the U.S. {{government}} receives income overall from seigniorage, {{there are}} {{costs associated with}} maintaining the money supply. Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, claims that [...] "over 95% <b>of</b> <b>our</b> broad <b>money</b> supply the United States is created by the private banking system (demand deposits) and bears interest {{as a condition of}} its existence," [...] a conclusion drawn from the Federal Reserve's ultimate dependence on increased activity in fractional reserve lending when it exercises open market operations. Economist Eric Miller criticizes Daly's logic because money is created in the banking system in response to demand for the money, which justifies cost.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show that money is not an entity but hic et nunc a genuine mode of {{circulation}} associated with a genuine social organisation. Criticising money hypostasis may help to to: (i) elucidate the ambivalence of monetary relations in our modern society (equivalence and subordination); (ii) criticise the idea that 'primitive monies' are nothing but imperfect forms <b>of</b> <b>our</b> modern <b>money</b> and show that exotic societies are worth studying for themselves; and (iii) relativise the knowledge we have about our societies and to develop comparative analysis. A sketchy comparison between wodani society and ours suggests that an abduction relation exists between money and society. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a model of}} the economy as a social network. Two agents are linked {{to the extent that they}} transact with each other. This generates well-defined topological notions of location, neighborhood and closeness. We investigate the implications <b>of</b> <b>our</b> model for monetary economics. When a central bank increases the money supply, it must inject the money somewhere in the economy. We demonstrate that the agent closest to the location where money is injected is better off, and the one furthest is worse off. This redistribution channel is independent from the ones previously noted in the literature. Symmetrically, any decrease in the money supply redistributes purchasing power in the other direction. We also outline the testable implications <b>of</b> <b>our</b> model. <b>Money,</b> redistribution, policy, central bank, social network, topology...|$|R
