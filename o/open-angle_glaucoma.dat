25|$|Glaucoma is a {{group of}} eye {{diseases}} which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. The most common type is <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma</b> with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. <b>Open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma</b> develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the several}} causes for glaucoma, ocular {{hypertension}} (increased pressure within the eye) {{is the most}} important risk factor in most glaucomas, but in some populations, only 50% of people with primary <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma</b> actually have elevated ocular pressure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma</b> {{accounts}} for 90% of glaucoma {{cases in the}} United States. Closed-angle glaucoma {{accounts for}} less than 10% of glaucoma cases in the United States, but {{as many as half}} of glaucoma cases in other nations (particularly East Asian countries).|$|E

25|$|Several {{diseases}} {{have been}} observed in patients with PMD. However, no causal relationships have been established between any of the associated diseases and the pathogenesis of PMD. Such diseases include: chronic <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> retinitis pigmentosa, retinal lattice degeneration, scleroderma, kerato-conjunctivitis, eczema, and hyperthyroidism.|$|E
25|$|In <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> {{the typical}} {{progression}} from normal vision to complete blindness takes about 25 years to 70 years without treatment, {{depending on the}} method of estimation used. The intraocular pressure can also have an effect, with higher pressures reducing the time until blindness.|$|E
25|$|Less-selective alpha agonists, such as epinephrine, {{decrease}} {{aqueous humor}} production through vasoconstriction of ciliary body blood vessels, useful only in <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma.</b> Epinephrine's mydriatic effect, however, renders it unsuitable for closed-angle glaucoma due to further narrowing of the uveoscleral outflow (i.e. further closure of trabecular meshwork, {{which is responsible}} for absorption of aqueous humor).|$|E
50|$|A trabeculoplasty is a {{modification}} of the trabecular meshwork. Laser trabeculoplasty (LTP) is {{the application of a}} laser beam to burn areas of the trabecular meshwork, located near the base of the iris, to increase fluid outflow. LTP is used in the treatment of various <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucomas.</b> The two types of laser trabeculoplasty are argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). As its name suggests, argon laser trabeculoplasty uses an argon laser to create tiny burns on the trabecular meshwork. Selective laser trabeculoplasty is newer technology that uses a Nd:YAG laser to target specific cells within the trabecular meshwork and create less thermal damage than ALT. SLT shows promise as a long term treatment. In SLT a laser is used to selectively target the melanocytes in the trabecular meshwork. Though the mechanism by which SLT functions is not well understood, it has been shown in trials to be as effective as the older Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty. However, because SLT is performed using a much lower power laser, it does not appear to affect the structure of the trabecular meshwork (based on electron microscopy) to the same extent, so retreatment may be possible if the effects from the original treatment should begin wear off, although this has not been proven in clinical studies. ALT is repeatable to some extent with measurable results possible.|$|R
40|$|The primary <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucomas</b> are a {{group of}} {{diseases}} that have in common characteristic morphological changes at the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer, progressive retinal ganglion cells death and characteristic visual field loss. The risk for primary open angle glaucoma rises continuously with the level of the intraocular pressure. The disease advances slowly and there are no symptoms. Primary open angle glaucoma is caused by abnormal aqueous humour outflow in the trabecular meshwork in the open angle. Etiopathogenesis of primary open angle glaucoma is unclear. The increased risk of glaucoma in relatives has long been recognized. Frequency for manifestation of the disease is 10 – 30 % in family members. The discovery of the specific gene loci responsible for the manifestation of glaucoma has helped us to understand its mechanism of origin and definitely confirmed the hereditary nature of this disease. Digito- -palmar dermatoglyphs were already used to determine hereditary base of many diseases and it was the reason for investigation of their qualitative patterns in patients with glaucoma (22 males and 23 females), their immediate relatives (19 males and 23 females) in comparison to {{a group of}} phenotypically healthy population (52 males and 56 females). The results pointed a connection with the dermatoglyphic traits of the digito-palmar complex between patients with glaucoma and their immediate relatives.

A 50-μm argon laser spot is aimed at the trabecular meshwork to stimulate the opening of the mesh to allow more outflow of aqueous fluid. Usually, half of the angle is treated at a time. Traditional laser trabeculoplasty uses a thermal argon laser in an argon laser trabeculoplasty procedure.|$|E

25|$|Secondary {{glaucoma}} {{refers to}} any {{case in which}} another disease, trauma, drug or procedure causes increased eye pressure, resulting in optic nerve damage and vision loss, and may be mild or severe. It can be due to an eye injury, inflammation, a tumor, or advanced cases of cataracts or diabetes. It can also be caused by certain drugs such as steroids. Treatment depends on whether it is <b>open-angle</b> or angle-closure <b>glaucoma.</b>|$|R
25|$|If treated early it is {{possible}} to slow or stop the progression of disease with medication, laser treatment, or surgery. The goal of these treatments is to decrease eye pressure. A number of different classes of glaucoma medication are available.

Treatment of closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency.|$|R
2500|$|Positive {{family history}} is {{a risk factor for}} glaucoma. The {{relative}} risk of having primary <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma</b> (P.O.A.G.) is increased about two- to four-fold for people who have a sibling with glaucoma. [...] Glaucoma, particularly primary <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> is associated with mutations in several genes, including MYOC, ASB10, WDR36, NTF4, TBK1, and RPGRIP1, although most cases of glaucoma do not involve these genetic mutations. [...] Normal-tension glaucoma, which comprises one-third of POAG, is also associated with genetic mutations (including OPA1 and OPTN genes).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma</b> is painless {{and does}} not have acute attacks, thus the lack of clear {{symptoms}} make screening via regular eye check-ups important. [...] The only signs are gradually progressive visual field loss, and optic nerve changes (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).|$|E
2500|$|Primary <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma</b> (also, primary glaucoma, chronic glaucoma) {{refers to}} slow {{clogging}} of the drainage canals resulting in increased eye pressure which causes progressive optic nerve damage. [...] This manifests as a gradual {{loss of the}} visual field, starting {{with a loss of}} peripheral vision, but eventually the entire vision will be lost if not treated. [...] This is {{the most common type of}} glaucoma, accounting for 90% of cases in the United States, but fewer in Asian countries.

50|$|Glaucoma {{is a group}} {{neurodegenerative}} diseases {{characterized by}} features including morphological changes in the optic nerve head and therefore in the visual fields of the patients.

2500|$|The {{underlying}} cause of <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma</b> remains unclear. Several theories exist on its exact etiology. However, the {{major risk factor}} for most glaucomas and the focus of treatment is increased intraocular pressure. Intraocular pressure {{is a function of}} production of liquid aqueous humor by the ciliary processes of the eye, and its drainage through the trabecular meshwork. Aqueous humor flows from the ciliary processes into the posterior chamber, bounded posteriorly by the lens and the zonules of Zinn, and anteriorly by the iris. It then flows through the pupil of the iris into the anterior chamber, bounded [...] posteriorly by the iris and anteriorly by the cornea.|$|E
2500|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{glaucoma}} include increased {{pressure in the}} eye, {{a family history of}} the condition, migraines, high blood pressure, and obesity. For eye pressures a value of greater than [...] is often used with higher pressures leading to a greater risk. However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage. Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma. The mechanism of <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma</b> is believed to be slow exit of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork while in closed-angle glaucoma the iris blocks the trabecular meshwork. Diagnosis is by a dilated eye examination. Often the optic nerve shows an abnormal amount of cupping.|$|E
2500|$|In angle-closure {{glaucoma}} (also closed-angle glaucoma, primary angle-closure glaucoma, acute glaucoma) {{the iris}} bows forward and causes physical {{contact between the}} iris and trabecular meshwork, which blocks the outflow of aqueous humor from within the eye. This contact may gradually damage the draining function of the meshwork until it fails {{to keep pace with}} aqueous production, and the intraocular pressure rises. [...] The onset of symptoms is sudden and causes pain and other symptoms that are noticeable; it is treated as a medical emergency. [...] Unlike <b>open-angle</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> angle-closure glaucoma {{is a result of the}} angle between the iris and cornea closing. [...] This tends to occur in the far-sighted, who have smaller-than-normal anterior chambers, making physical contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork more likely.|$|E
40|$|A REGULAR Mendelian {{dominant}} {{pattern of}} inheritance {{is characteristic of}} so-called juvenile glaucoma and some hundred genealogies have been recorded (Fran 9 ois, 1961), two-thirds showing one or two affected generations and the other third three to six generations.

40|$|Abstract Purpose. There {{has been}} {{undertaken}} in this research, {{in case of}} complicated cataracts, an attempt of definition of a role of prostaglandins Е 2 (PgЕ 2) in mechanisms of cancellation of immune responses, responsible for ACAID, in the early period of the aseptic uveitis course. Material and method. The patients with senile and complicated cataracts underwent the microaxial phonoemulsification. The first group included patients with senile uncomplicated cataract (400 eyes), the second one – with cataract, proceeding associated with primary open-angled glaucoma (200 eyes), the third group – with cataract, proceeding associated with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (200 eyes), the fourth group – with cataract, proceeding associated with arterial hypertension (300 eyes), the fifth one – with cataract, proceeding associated with diabetes mellitus (100 eyes), and the sixth group – with cataract, proceeding associated with previous trauma (100 eyes). The studied contingent of patients has been examined using subjective and objective methods of research standard in ophthalmology. Aqueous humor of patients of all six studied groups (80 tests in each group) was subjected to immunoenzymatic level definition of prostaglandins Е 2, using kits of the firm DRG International Inc. (USA). The content of prostaglandins Е 2 was expressed in pg/ml. Immunoenzymatic researches (ELISA) were conducted with the autoanalyzer «Stat Fax 3200 » (USA) in wavelengths of absorption of 420 - 450 nm. The obtained results were statistically analyzed, using the Student criteria and the SPSS- 13 software. Results. In case of complicated cataracts, namely cataracts, proceeding associated with <b>open-angle</b> and pseudoexfoliative <b>glaucoma,</b> and also in traumatic cataracts, an inflammatory process in form of anterior aseptic uveitis was observed in the early post-operative period. Relative high indices of prostaglandins Е 2 were determined in the aqueous humor of the above-mentioned contingent of patients. Conclusions. 1. An «inadequate» inflammatory reaction to the surgical intervention that we found in case of complicated cataracts testifies in favor of cancellation of the regional immune responses, responsible for an ACAID formation. 2. In the mechanism of disturbed ACAID function in case of cataracts, proceeding associated with primary <b>open-angle</b> and pseudoexfoliative <b>glaucoma,</b> {{as well as in}} traumatic cataracts, an important role should be given to prostaglandins Е 2 which high level in the aqueous humor can lead to an inhibition of active immunologic tolerance, lying {{at the heart of the}} above specified symptom-complex. ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} 5 -year {{effectiveness and}} cost between latanoprost or timolol monotherapy {{in a pilot}} trial. METHODS: A retrospective, multi-center trial performed at 6 sites in Germany of patients who had a diagnosis of primary <b>open-angle</b> or pigmentary <b>glaucoma,</b> {{in at least one}} eye, initiated on monotherapy with latanoprost or timolol maleate. Qualified consecutive charts were reviewed in which 5 -year efficacy, safety and cost data was abstracted. RESULTS: Seventy-seoen latanoprost and 49 timolol patients were included, at the final visit no difference existed between the two groups in disc parameters including:rim area, rim area/disc area ratio, cup volume or vertical cup/disc ratio (P> 0. 05). There was no difference in intraocular pressure (IOP) between the initial latanoprost (17. 4 ± 2. 6) and timolol (16. 3 ± 2. 8 mmHg) groups. There was less change in medicines over the follow-up period (0. 1 vs 0. 8) and fewer medications at the final visit (1. 2 vs 1. 8) with latanoprost compared to timolol. No patient treated with latanoprost discontinued therapy during follow-up, while 12 % discontinued timolol mostly due to inadequate IOP control. Cost/year was less with initial timolol ($ 458 ± 236) as compared to latanoprost ($ 552 ± 202). CONCLUSION:Patients begun on latanoprost or timolol and followed over 5 years may have similar clinical outcomes. However, timolol patients may require more medicines and medicine changes to control IOP for long-term, but at a lower cost...|$|R

More {{research is needed}} on effective recruitment strategies for this population, especially on approaches that supplement traditional clinic enrollment. This study evaluates the cost and efficacy of four supplemental recruitment methods employed by the Primary <b>Open-Angle</b> African American <b>Glaucoma</b> Genetics (POAAGG) study. Methods After enrolling 2304 patients from University of Pennsylvania ophthalmology clinics, the POAAGG study implemented four new recruitment methods to supplement clinic enrollment. These methods included: 1) outreach in the local community, 2) in-house screening of community members (“in-reach”), 3) expansion to two external sites, and 4) sampling of the Penn Medicine Biobank. The cost per subject was calculated for each method and enrollment among cases, controls, and suspects was reported. Results The biobank offered the lowest cost ($ 5 /subject) and highest enrollment yield (n =  2073) of the four methods, but provided very few glaucoma cases (n =  31). External sites provided 88 % of cases recruited from the four methods (n =  388; $ 85 /subject), but case enrollment at these sites declined over the next 9  months as the pool of eligible subjects was depleted. Outreach and in-reach screenings of community members were very high cost for low return on enrollment ($ 569 /subject for 102 subjects and $ 606 /subject for 45 subjects, respectively). Conclusions The biobank offered the most cost-effective method for control enrollment, while expansion to external sites was necessary to recruit richly phenotyped cases.

40|$|Glaucoma {{is a slow}} {{progressive}} degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and {{the optic}} nerve axons, leading to irreversible blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. Although increased intraocular pressure is a major risk factor of glaucoma, other factors include increased glutamate levels, alterations in nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, vascular alterations and oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, accounting for 12. 3 % of the total blindness. Glaucoma has been broadly classified as primary or secondary <b>open-angle</b> or angle-closure <b>glaucoma.</b> The primary goal in management of glaucoma is to prevent the risk factor, especially elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), using medications, laser therapy or conventional surgery. The first-line treatment of glaucoma usually begins {{with the use of}} a topical selective or nonselective blocker or a prostaglandin analog. Second-line drugs of choice include alpha-agonists and topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Cholinergic agonists are considered third-line treatment options. When a single therapy is not sufficient to lower the IOP, a combination therapy is indicated. To enhance the patient compliance, drug delivery systems like electronic devices, ocular inserts, tansdermal and mechanical drug delivery systems have been developed. Use of viscoelastic agents in ophthalmic formulations, emulsions and soluble ophthalmic drug inserts (SODI) enhance patience compliance and ocular drug delivery in patients in long-term glaucoma therapy. For patients who do not respond to antiglaucoma medications, laser trabeculoplasty and incisional surgery are recommended. Several nutrients and botanicals hold promise for the treatment of glaucoma, but most studies are preliminary, and larger, controlled studies are required. Future directions for the development of a novel therapy glaucoma may target glutamate inhibition, NMDA receptor blockade, exogenously applied neurotrophins, open channel blockers, antioxidants, protease inhibitors and gene therapy...|$|R
