5|$|A PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Oblivion was {{released}} on March 20, 2007 in North America, and April 27, 2007 in Europe, following delays similar to those for the Xbox 360 release. The PlayStation 3 release was touted for its improvement over the graphics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> and Xbox 360 versions, {{although some of the}} improved shader routines optimized for the PlayStation 3 release were set to be ported over to the other releases through patches. A plan to distribute content through downloads paid by micropayment was initially met with criticism by customers due to its alleged low value, but later releases—at a reduced price, and with more content—proved more popular.|$|E
5|$|A {{limited edition}} retail version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> game was {{released}} in April 2011. It included bonuses such as behind-the-scenes videos, a sample disc of the game's music, and a Super Meat Boy comic. In 2012 Team Meat began prototyping an iOS and Android version of the game. The game {{is intended to be}} a different take on the Super Meat Boy concept that is more adapted to touch-screen controls than a direct port would be. Later Team Meat released two images of the new game one with the new graphics and other with the new chapter named The Green Hills.|$|E

50|$|The People's Committees south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 38th Parallel in 1945 found {{themselves}} abutting the fiercely anticommunist American occupation {{forces and the}} nascent Southern System. The American Occupation was alarmed by the apparent red orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PCs</b> within their zone. Fears of communist control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PCs</b> and <b>the</b> standing policy <b>of</b> not recognizing pre-existing Korean governments led the occupation forces to ban the People's Committees and outlaw them throughout the American Occupation Zone.|$|R
5|$|Redemption {{was officially}} {{released}} to manufacturing on May 30, 2000. The game features 300,000 lines of code, with a further 66,000 lines for JAVA scripts.

5|$|The {{company was}} founded by Swedish {{programmer}} Magnus Högdahl. Högdahl was a former member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> demoscene group Triton, and specialized in making tech demos. He {{decided to leave the}} company after his project, an action role-playing game named Into the Shadows, was cancelled. He then decided to found his own studio and began crafting his own game engine. He actively recruited staff among his acquaintances and the studio was officially established in 1998 in Härnösand, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{development}} {{began in}} 2011. In {{order to create}} an accurate environment and be consistent with Tolkien's books, the developers consulted many people from Warner Brothers, as well as Peter Jackson, director of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies. They also received assistance from Weta Workshop, who advised on the special effects. Monolith focused on the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PC,</b> PlayStation 4, and Xbox One versions, while {{the development of the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions was outsourced to Behaviour Interactive.|$|E

5|$|Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game were published by Electronic Arts, while online distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced in March 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.|$|E
5|$|Shuffle! {{had much}} pre-sale hype as the {{development}} team was largely composed of {{former members of}} BasiL, including Hiro Suzuhira and Aoi Nishimata, the illustrators for Shuffle!. Shuffle! was released at {{around the same time}} as Fate/stay night, a highly anticipated visual novel by Type-Moon. The limited edition of Shuffle! was the second highest-selling computer game for the last two weeks of January 2004 the top 50 best-selling Bishōjo games semi-monthly sales chart in Japan, behind Fate/stay night. It then ranked 18th and 50th in February before dropping off the chart in {{the first two weeks of}} March at 40th. The regular edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> version of Shuffle! premiered at 9th in the chart in the last two weeks of February. It then ranked 5th and 40th in March, before its last appearance at 49th in the first half of April. Shuffle! On the Stage was released on October 20, 2005 and sold well (for a visual novel) during its first week, selling 29,732 copies by October 23.|$|E
5|$|Tory {{preparations}} {{for an upcoming}} election campaign were thrown into disarray in August 1956 when Drew fell ill. Tory leaders felt that the party needed vigorous leadership with a federal election likely to be called within a year. In September, Drew resigned. Diefenbaker, who had failed in two prior bids for the leadership, announced his candidacy, as did Tory frontbenchers Davie Fulton and Donald Fleming. Diefenbaker, a criminal defence lawyer from Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, was on the populist left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> party. Those Tory leaders who disliked Diefenbaker and his views, and hoped to find a candidate from Drew's conservative wing of the party, wooed University of Toronto president Sidney Smith as a candidate. However, Smith refused to run.|$|E

5|$|The PC port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos Montréal by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision to outsource the PC port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a computer keyboard. The initial response to the announcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>PC</b> port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne to the platform.|$|E

40|$|The thermotropic phase {{behavior}} of phthalocyanines (Pc's) with eight oligo(ethylene oxide) alkoxy side chains has been investigated. An increase in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> ethylene oxide units {{results in a}} decrease in the solid-to-mesophase and isotropization temperatures. The investigated compounds display a discotic hexagonally ordered (D-ho) mesophase. <b>The</b> solubilization <b>of</b> LiI/I- 2 into the polar side chains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pc's</b> has been studied both in solution and in spin-coated films, and the effect on the aggregate formation is discussed. At higher temperatures, <b>the</b> <b>Pc</b> - LiI/I- 2 complex is not stable and small crystallites are formed. The dark direct current conductivity of these films is reported as a function of LiI/I- 2 concentration in the polar side groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pc's.</b> <b>The</b> observed decrease in conductivity with increasing salt concentration is related to <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material.
