Additionally, alterations in the mechanical properties of cancer cells associated with metastatic transformation was characterized using this technology. Cell mechanical properties can be utilized as a quantitative measure for understanding the pathophysiological behavior of cells and evaluating pharmacological treatments that modify the cell structure. Thus, an oscillating <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer</b> capable of applying time varying force and manipulating the cell cytoskeleton was developed in order to measure the mechanical properties and structural changes of single epithelial cancer cells and blood cancer cells. Employing this device would be beneficial in differentiating between normal, cancer and metastatic cancer cells and evaluating the effectiveness of different chemotherapeutic approaches. To this end, the developed tool was utilized to conduct a systematic study of the mechanical properties of human epithelial cancer cells by mimicking the condition that causes cancer cell invasiveness and tumour cell transformation.

25|$|In <b>optical</b> <b>tweezers,</b> a {{continuous}} evanescent field {{can be created}} when light is propagating through an optical waveguide (multiple total internal reflection). The resulting evanescent field has a directional sense and will propel microparticles along its propagating path. This work was first pioneered by S. Kawata and T. Sugiura, in 1992, who showed that the field can be coupled to the particles in proximity {{on the order of}} 100 nanometers.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{updated version}} of the {{evanescent}} field <b>optical</b> <b>tweezers</b> makes use of extended optical landscape patterns to simultaneously guide {{a large number of}} particles into a preferred direction without using a waveguide. It is termed as Lensless Optical Trapping (“LOT”). The orderly movement of the particles is aided by the introduction of Ronchi Ruling that creates well-defined optical potential wells (replacing the waveguide). This means that particles are propelled by the evanescent field while being trapped by the linear bright fringes. At the moment, there are scientists working on focused evanescent fields as well.|$|E

Lastly, mechanical properties of these biopolymers can often be measured using <b>optical</b> <b>tweezers</b> or atomic-force microscopy. Dual polarization interferometry can be used to measure the conformational changes or self-assembly of these materials when stimulated by pH, temperature, ionic strength or other binding partners.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method to}} realize an <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer</b> {{involving}} optofluidic operation in a microchannel is proposed. To manipulate the <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer,</b> light from an optical fiber is passed through both PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) -air surface lenses and an optofluidic region, {{which is located}} in a control channel. Two liquids with different refractive indices (RIs) are introduced into the control channel to form two different flow patterns (i. e., laminar and segmented flows), depending on the liquid compositions, the channel geometry, and the flow rates. By altering the shapes of the interface of the two liquids in the optofluidic region, we can continuously or intermittently control the optical paths of the light. To demonstrate the functionality of the proposed method, <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer</b> operations on a chip are performed. Changing the flow pattern of two liquids with different RIs in the optofluidic region results in successful trapping of a 25 μm diameter microsphere and its displacement by 15 μm...|$|R

25|$|The main {{mechanism}} for sorting is {{the arrangement of}} the optical lattice points. As the cell flow through the optical lattice, there are forces due to the particles drag force that is competing directly with the optical gradient force (See Physics of <b>optical</b> <b>tweezers)</b> from the optical lattice point. By shifting {{the arrangement of the}} optical lattice point, there is a preferred optical path where the optical forces are dominant and biased. With the aid of the flow of the cells, there is a resultant force that is directed along that preferred optical path. Hence, there is a relationship of the flow rate with the optical gradient force. By adjusting the two forces, one will be able to obtain a good optical sorting efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Antimatter {{cannot be}} stored in a {{container}} made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and {{an equal amount of}} the container. Antimatter in the form of charged particles can be contained by a combination of electric and magnetic fields, in a device called a Penning trap. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which atomic traps are used. In particular, such a trap may use the dipole moment (electric or magnetic) of the trapped particles. At high vacuum, the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a magneto-optical trap or magnetic trap. Small particles can also be suspended with <b>optical</b> <b>tweezers,</b> using a highly focused laser beam.|$|E
25|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>tweezers</b> {{are capable}} of {{manipulating}} nanometer and micron-sized dielectric particles by exerting extremely small forces via a highly focused laser beam. The beam is typically focused by sending it through a microscope objective. The narrowest point of the focused beam, known as the beam waist, contains a very strong electric field gradient. Dielectric particles are attracted along the gradient to the region of strongest electric field, which {{is the center of}} the beam. The laser light also tends to apply a force on particles in the beam along the direction of beam propagation. This is due to conservation of momentum: photons that are absorbed or scattered by the tiny dielectric particle impart momentum to the dielectric particle. This is known as the scattering force and results in the particle being displaced slightly downstream from the exact position of the beam waist, as seen in the figure.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Studies of light-matter {{interactions}} in organic semiconductors and in <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer</b> trapping of nanoparticles are presented. In the {{research related to}} organic semiconductor materials, a variety of novel materials and their composites have been characterized, and physical mechanisms behind their optoelectronic properties have been established. Three novel functionalized hexacene derivatives were deemed sufficiently stable to enable characterization of these materials in devices. From dark current and photocurrent measurements of the hexacene thin-films, {{it was determined that}} all three derivatives are photoconductive in the near-infrared, and space charge limited mobility values were obtained. In addition, physical mechanisms behind charge transfer, charge carrier photogeneration, and charge transport in small-molecule donor/acceptor composite films have been systematically studied. In these studies, it was determined that the charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor molecule can result in either an emissive charge transfer exciton (exciplex) or a non-emissive charge transfer exciton formation, depending on the energy difference between LUMO of the donor and the acceptor. However, the most dramatic trends in photoluminescent and photoconductive properties of the donor/acceptor composites were correlated with the separation between the donor and acceptor molecules at the donor/acceptor interface. In particular, composite films with larger separations exhibited electric field-assisted charge transfer exciton dissociation, which contributed to nanosecond time-scale photocurrents under a 500 ps pulsed photoexciation. Large donor/acceptor separation also resulted in reduced charge carrier recombination, which led to a factor of 5 - 10 increase in continuous wave photocurrents in certain donor/acceptor composites, as compared to those in pristine donor films. In the <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer</b> based studies, work towards the development of high spatial resolution <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer</b> controlled nanoprobes is presented. In particular, the possibility of exploiting the optical resonance of a particle to increase the <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer</b> forces acting on it within the trap has been investigated. Such an increase in the force would improve the potential spatial resolution of an <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer</b> controlled probe. Experimental results and numerical simulations on micron sized resonant dielectric particles showed a small increase in the optical forces that confine such particles within the trap, when tweezer trapping is conducted at wavelengths on the red-side of the optical resonance.

40|$|A {{localized}} point-like force applied {{perpendicular to}} a vesicular membrane layer, using an <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer,</b> leads to membrane nanotubulation beyond a threshold force. Below the threshold, the force-extension curve shows an elastic response {{with a fine}} structure (serrations). Above the threshold the tubulation process exhibits a new reversible flow phase for the multilamellar membrane, which responds viscoelastically. Furthermore, with an oscillatory force applied during tubulation, broad but well-resolved resonances occur in the flow phase, presumably matching the time scales associated with the vesicle-nanotubule coupled system. These nanotubules, anchored to the <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer</b> also provide, for the first time, a direct probe of the real-time dynamics of DNA self-assembly on membranes.

40|$|An {{optically}} levitated nonspherical nanoparticle can exhibit both librational and translational vibrations due to orientational and translational confinements of the <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer,</b> respectively. Usually, {{the frequency}} of its librational mode in a linearly-polarized <b>optical</b> <b>tweezer</b> is much larger than {{the frequency of}} its translational mode. Because of the frequency mismatch, the intrinsic coupling between librational and translational modes is very weak in vacuum. Here we propose a scheme to couple its librational and center-of-mass modes with an optical cavity mode. By adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode, the beam splitter Hamiltonian between librational and center-of-mass modes can be realized. We find that high-fidelity quantum state transfer between the librational and translational modes can be achieved with practical parameters.

2500|$|A typical setup uses one laser {{to create}} one or two traps. Commonly, two traps are {{generated}} by splitting the laser beam into two orthogonally polarized beams. Optical tweezing operations with more than two traps can be realized either by time-sharing a single laser beam among several <b>optical</b> <b>tweezers,</b> or by diffractively splitting the beam into multiple traps. With acousto-optic deflectors or galvanometer-driven mirrors, a single laser beam can be shared among hundreds of <b>optical</b> <b>tweezers</b> in the focal plane, or else spread into an extended one-dimensional trap. Specially designed diffractive optical elements can divide a single input beam into hundreds of continuously illuminated traps in arbitrary three-dimensional configurations. The trap-forming hologram also can specify the mode structure of each trap individually, thereby creating arrays of optical vortices, <b>optical</b> <b>tweezers,</b> and holographic line traps, for example.
