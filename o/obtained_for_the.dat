5|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of partial sequences of 16S rDNA of 18 distinct species {{carried out by}} Sutcharit and colleagues (2007) indicate that Amphidromus is a monophyletic group. In their study, different cladograms obtained through distinct methods such as maximum parsimony, neighbor joining and maximum likelihood were congruent among themselves. Though the topology <b>obtained</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> subgenus Amphidromus was fairly consistent with current taxonomy, the phylogeny of sinistral Syndromus species showed no such correspondence. Also according to their results, enantiomorphy {{seems to be the}} ancestral state of shell coiling in the genus Amphidromus, which is contrary to the general expectation of dextrally coiled shells as an ancestral condition.|$|E

5|$|The 107-seater was {{launched}} on 26 April 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft. After {{three years of}} design, the maiden flight took place at Hamburg on 15 January 2002. Tests on the lead engine, the Pratt & Whitney PW6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption. Consequently, Pratt & Whitney abandoned the five-stage high pressure compressor (HPC) for the MTU-designed six-stage HPC. The 129 order book for the A318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other A320 family members. After 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, JAA certification was <b>obtained</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> CFM56-powered variant on 23 May 2003.
