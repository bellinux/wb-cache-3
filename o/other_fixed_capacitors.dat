40|$|The {{viability}} of <b>fixed</b> type power <b>capacitors</b> for loss reduction in low voltage (400 V) distribution networks of power utilities was studied. Usually, reactive {{power of the}} load is compensated at high voltage levels by utility operators, which requires high investment on equipment. This study reveals an alternative low cost reactive power compensation method, which will reduce the capacity requirements of HV reactive power installations. <b>Fixed</b> type power <b>capacitors</b> had been used at the secondary of few of earlier 11 kV/ 415 V distribution transformers in Colombo City distribution system. Most of these units are in operation, even after 20 years of service. But the practice of having <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitors</b> at distribution transformers was not continued thereafter. It was identified through model simulation and field measurements that installation of <b>fixed</b> value power <b>capacitors</b> at feeder pillars of the power distribution network is more economical compared to the earlier practice in Colombo City. The expected minimum energy saving is approximately 300 kWh/month with a 40 kvar, 440 V rated capacitor installed at the feeder pillar. The main advantages of the proposal are low capital requirement and shorter payback period. The expected maximum payback period is 7 months. In the proposed method, the temperature of operation of capacitors was more critical. The reliability of capacitors is to ensure by adapting measures to reduce the operating temperature of capacitor units, housed in steel enclosures. Encloses, housing capacitor units reduces the case temperature of capacitors. This arrangement was superior {{to the use of}} outdoor type capacitors without enclosures. Use of light coloured enclosure with holes for ventilation and thermal insulation will reduce the temperature of operation of capacitor unit at least by 10 oC, compared to dark green finished enclosure with louvers for ventilation and without thermal insulation on the internal surface. Field measurements confirmed that the lifetime of capacitors are not affected due to load harmonics. The maximum harmonic current absorbed by capacitors was 50 % lower than the continuous over current rating of the capacitor unit. The simulation of the model with different <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitor</b> sizes shows that there is no risk that transformers would fall into resonance along with <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitors</b> under the toed harmonics due to the selected size of capacitors and level of load harmonics. The voltage rise due to <b>fixed</b> type <b>capacitors</b> at no load condition is insignificant for the sizes of capacitors proposed in this study, Hence there is no risk that the power transformers would not fall into ferroresonance due to <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Practical difficulties of usage of LV <b>fixed</b> type <b>capacitors</b> were identified and solutions were recommended so that a cluster of <b>fixed</b> value shunt <b>capacitors</b> can be installed and operated effectively at low voltage distribution level for achieving greater economical benefits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{approved}} (Major prof es sor) The {{field-effect transistor}} offers advantages as a chopping de-vice since {{it does not}} have an offset voltage and it is not speed lirnited by its response tirne. Offset and drift are caused by Ieakage current and capacitive coupling between the control gate and the signal path. The capacitive component of this drift is proportional to frequency so in order to increase the chopping frequency and rnaintain low drift, it is neces-sary to cornpensate for the capacitive drifts. Two techniques of balancing a second capacitor against the detrirnental gate-drain capacitance of the chopper are investigated. First a <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitor</b> is used for balance, and capacitive off-set is reduced by about t / ZO. This balance is then irnproved by using the capacitance of a second FET for balance. This irnproves capacitive balance by a factor of two over the <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitor</b> technique and also allows for Redacted for Privacy cancellation of leakage currents.

So the power factor in this system gets reduced due to the inductive reactive power. But the electricity board has a standard limits regarding the power factor values and if the power factor goes below the specified limit; the electricity company charges the penalty to {{the industrial}} consumers. The automatic power factor correction panel provides the required compensation to overcome the inductive reactance by using the power capacitors. The microcontroller 8051 receives current signal from current transformer and simultaneously gives the signals to the various contactors to connect the capacitors in the line for the compensation. Thus by adding the capacitor to the line will compensate the reactive power and maintains the power factor near to unity.
