50|$|Concurrent to the {{collapse}} of Bear Stearns, the Fed announced {{the creation of a new}} lending facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. The PDCF provided overnight cash loans to primary dealers against <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{collateral}} for the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) {{also has}} been expanded; <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> will now include all investment-grade debt securities. Previously, only Treasury securities, agency securities, and AAA-rated mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities could be pledged. [...] This {{was one of many}} emergency lending programs of the Federal Reserve during the Financial crisis of 2008-2009.|$|R
25|$|The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) is an {{overnight}} loan facility {{that will provide}} funding to primary dealers {{in exchange for a}} specified range of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> and is intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. This new facility marks a fundamental change in Federal Reserve policy because now primary dealers can borrow directly from the Fed when this used to be prohibited.|$|R
50|$|The {{actions of}} the Federal Reserve, {{including}} {{the creation of the}} Primary Dealer Credit Facility, have expanded its balance sheet from $800 billion, consisting mainly of safe treasury bills, to over $2 trillion, consisting largely of riskier debt and mortgage-backed securities. The decision to expand the <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> was criticized for further weakening the Fed's balance sheet. Also, the Fed's actions have been criticized as a power grab to become more powerful relative to other financial regulators such as the SEC and the FDIC.|$|R
40|$|In our model, cross-currency basis, which {{captures the}} {{deviations}} from covered interest rate parity (CIP), reflects the relative {{value of the}} scarcer currency (US dollar) as collateral in funding constraints. Our empirical evidence shows that measures of dollar shortage derived from ECB tenders, and actions to move to fixed-rate tenders with full allotment and to expand the <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> by the ECB have significant power in explaining the cross currency basis. We show that the relaxation of Euro funding constraints through 3 -year Long Term Re-financing Operations (LTROs) does {{not contribute to the}} narrowing of the cross-currency basis, consistent with the theory developed in the paper...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are twofold: first, we attempt to express the {{threshold}} of a single “A” rating as issued by major international rating agencies in terms of annualised probabilities of default. We use data from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s publicly available rating histories to construct confidence intervals for the level of probability of default {{to be associated with}} the single “A” rating. The focus on the single “A” rating level is not accidental, as this is the credit quality level at which the Eurosystem considers financial assets to be <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> for its monetary policy operations. The second aim is to review various existing validation models for the probability of default which enable the analyst to check the ability of credit assessment systems to forecast future default events. Within this context the paper proposes a simple mechanism for the comparison of the performance of major rating agencies and that of other credit assessment systems, such as the internal ratings-based systems of commercial banks under the Basel II regime. This is done to provide a simple validation yardstick to help in the monitoring of the performance of the different credit assessment systems participating in the assessment of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> underlying Eurosystem monetary policy operations. Contrary to the widely used confidence interval approach, our proposal, based on an interpretation of p-values as frequencies, guarantees a convergence to an ex ante fixed probability of default (PD) value. Given the general characteristics of the problem considered, we consider this simple mechanism to also be applicable in other contexts. ...|$|R

The Collateral must meet the Eligibility criteria in the agreement, e.g., which currencies it may be in, what types of bonds are allowed, and which haircuts are applied. There are also rules for the settlement of disputes arising over valuation of derivative positions.|$|R

40|$|Central banks play {{a pivotal}} role in well-functioning {{payments}} systems by providing liquidity via collateralized lending. This article discusses the role of collateral and haircut policy in central bank lending, as well as the distinguishing features of the central bank’s policy relative to private sector practices. It presents a model that explicitly incorporates the unique role of central banks in the payments system and argues that central banks must consider how their haircut policies affect the relative price and liquidity of assets, the market’s asset allocation, and the likelihood of participants to default. Furthermore, under extraordinary circumstances, there is a rationale for the central bank to temporarily reduce haircuts or broaden the list of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> to mitigate the shortage of liquidity in the market. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{central banking}} {{literature}} regards central bank independence and a transparent monetary policy as {{best suited to}} achieve and safeguard monetary stability. The existing empirical literature, however, failed in establishing a solid ground for this consensus. This paper sheds some {{new light on the}} empirical evidence on determinants of monetary stability. In addition, it expands the current research agenda by considering a neglected factor: The quality of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> (QEC). Recently, the U. S. subprime crisis has shown that a weak collateralization of credits may have massive economic implications, entailing severe perturbations of the international financial system. This paper focuses on central bank lending and investigates to what extent the quality of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> is able to explain inflation employing the first comprehensive dataset to assess the significance of QEC for monetary stability. Data have been collected using an online questionnaire that was answered by central bank officials. For the period 1990 to 2003 and a sample of 62 countries a robust negative and statistically significant correlation between QEC and average inflation is found. This result is robust to the use of control variables from the literature on institutional determinants of monetary stability. These findings have to be regarded as establishing QEC as one pivotal element of a theory of central banking. Collateralisation of the issuance of money and the elimination of financing the government deficit directly via the central bank can be seen as necessary conditions for achieving monetary stability. Good central bank money should be backed by the liable property of creditors to safeguard monetary stability. This finding can be utilized by policy makers especially in less developed and transition countries on their way towards a more stable economic development...|$|R

30|$|Repurchase {{agreements}} (repos) are secured {{money market}} transactions. The cash taker provides collateral {{in the form}} of securities and in return receives money from the cash provider. To ensure the continuous covering of the cash amount, the definition of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral,</b> its handling and valuation play an important role. This is mainly because the collateral nearly eliminates credit risk. In Switzerland, Swiss franc repos are almost exclusively conducted via the highly standardized repo platform, with four different pre-defined collateral baskets. Each basket comprises different security categories, such as government bonds or covered bonds. This paper analyzes the interest rate setting on the repo market with data from June 1999 to June 2005. It evaluates if the securities provided as collateral influenced the repo rate or not. A price differentiation with respect to the collateral provided is found.|$|R
40|$|In {{times of}} {{financial}} distress, central banks provide unlimited liquidity to avoid fire sales. In response, banks raise their demand for collateral assets, and the short-term scarcity of collateral securities leads to higher prices, the Fire Buy premium. To avoid collateral scarcity, central banks increase {{the set of}} <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> assets. However, if the risk-shifting channel is open for these newly eligible securities, banks prefer to pledge them and pay another premium, the Risk-Shifting premium. With the full fixed-income trading book of 26 German banks, I identify each trade of each bank and investigate how unlimited liquidity provision affects collateral prices. Also, I match banks' trades with their balance sheet and show how funding liquidity impacts premia payment. I quantify the Fire Buy premium to be 15. 6 bps; and the Risk-Shifting premium on BBB-rated assets to be 65. 6 bps...|$|R

40|$|Collateral {{has been}} used {{for a long time in}} the cash market and we have also {{experienced}} significant increase of its use as an important credit risk mitigation tool in the derivatives market for this decade. Despite its long history in the financial market, its importance for funding has been recognized relatively recently following the explosion of basis spreads in the crisis. This paper has demonstrated the impact of collateralization on derivatives pricing through its funding effects based on the actual data of swap markets. It has also shown the importance of the "choice" of collateral currency. In particular, when a contract allows multiple currencies as <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> as well as its free replacement, the paper has found that the embedded "cheapest-todeliver" option can be quite valuable and significantly change the fair value of a trade. The implications of these findings for risk management have been also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of secured {{syndicated}} loans and data from two field studies, I explore whether the collateralization of intangibles was associated with risky lending in the syndicated loan market. While the predominant managerial and scholarly perspective suggests that intangible assets are not <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral,</b> I find that twenty-one percent of U. S. -originated secured loans include intangible assets as loan collateral, and the collateralization of intangibles has significantly increased in the recent decade. I hypothesize and find that intangible redeployability and borrower reputation are positively related to the probability of using intangibles as loan collateral. I further hypothesize and find that collateralizing loans by intangibles significantly increases loan pricing and the supply of credit to firms. Moreover, loans secured by intangibles perform no worse to other secured loans. Overall, {{the results suggest that}} the collateralization of intangible assets is an economically sustainable credit market innovation that alleviates financing frictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of a “single list” of <b>eligible</b> <b>collateral</b> common to all Eurosystem credit operations on January 1, 2007, replaced the two-tier framework in place until then. Euro area credit claims (i. e. bank loans) have become eligible for use as collateral under the single list, provided they fulfill conditions specified by the ECB. Even though credit claims are more complex than marketable securities in legal as well as administrative terms, their mobilization by Austrian banks as collateral in credit operations with the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) has surged {{since the beginning of}} 2007. Moreover, the conditions for the cross-border use of credit claims have been adapted for the new single framework; these procedures and euro area enlargement upon Slovenia’s accession lead to the expectation that the cross-border use of credit claims by OeNB counterparties in credit operations with the OeNB will increase. credit claims, single list, assignment for security purposes. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a small open economy model {{to analyze the}} role of central bank liquidity management in implementing “unconventional” monetary policies within an inflation targeting framework. In particular, the paper explicitly models the facilities that the central bank uses to manage liquidity in the economy, which creates a role for the central bank balance sheet in equilibrium. This permits the analysis of two “unconventional” policies: sterilized exchange-rate interventions and expanding the list of <b>eligible</b> <b>collaterals</b> accepted at the liquidity facilities operated by the central bank. These policies have been recently implemented by several central banks: the former {{as a way to}} counteract persistent appreciations in the domestic currency, and the latter {{as a response to the}} recent global financial crisis in 2008.
