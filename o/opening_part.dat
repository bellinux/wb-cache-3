25|$|Mark Winterbottom further {{extended}} his championship lead by winning both races of the Castrol Edge Townsville 400. He qualified second {{for the first}} race behind teammate Chaz Mostert but took the lead at the start and then held off David Reynolds in the closing stages of the race. Fabian Coulthard finished third while Mostert drifted to eighth late in the race due to a rear suspension problem. Scott McLaughlin took his first pole position {{of the season in}} qualifying for the second race ahead of Mostert and Reynolds. McLaughlin lost positions to Reynolds and Mostert in the <b>opening</b> <b>part</b> of the race before retiring when his car lost a power steering belt. Winterbottom moved up to second after the final pit stop and was able to take the lead from Reynolds. The Holden Racing Team drivers James Courtney and Garth Tander showed good pace late in the race, moving up to second and fourth respectively, but were unable to catch Winterbottom. Reynolds finished third while Mostert again faded in the closing stages, finishing sixth. With Craig Lowndes and Fabian Coulthard both experiencing difficulties during the weekend, Winterbottom left the event with a championship lead of 248 points.|$|E
500|$|The central {{character}} of A Christmas Carol is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based moneylender, {{described in the}} story as [...] "a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!" [...] Kelly writes that Scrooge may {{have been influenced by}} Dickens's conflicting feelings for his father, who he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, the professor of English literature, considers that in the <b>opening</b> <b>part</b> of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty [...] "is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.|$|E
2500|$|Gershwin's own Concerto in F {{was criticized}} for being related {{to the work of}} Claude Debussy, more so than to the {{expected}} jazz style. The comparison did not deter him from continuing to explore French styles. The title of An American in Paris reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer: [...] "The <b>opening</b> <b>part</b> will be developed in typical French style, in the manner of Debussy and Les Six, though the tunes are original." ...|$|E

Thus, these models have sealed bodies with few or no <b>opening</b> <b>parts</b> (The Anatomy 2006).|$|R

Its first single, [...] "Haven't Met You Yet" [...] was released 31 August 2009, and reached No.1 on Billboards Canadian Adult Contemporary chart. Most {{of the tracks}} off the album were recorded live because Bublé did not want his album to sound overproduced and slick. Bublé wrote the <b>opening</b> <b>part</b> for his cover on the single [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] in Bond-like theme because he wanted the song to sound very cinematic and bombastic.|$|E
2500|$|Two earlier {{versions}} of the poem can be found, the original typescript of the poem {{as well as that}} version with comments by Ezra Pound. In the typescript, the name of the poem is [...] "Gerousia", referring to the name of the Council of the Elders at Sparta. Pound, who was living in London in 1919, acted as Eliot's editor and influenced many of his works. When Eliot considered publishing the poem as the <b>opening</b> <b>part</b> of The Waste Land, Pound discouraged him from doing so saying, [...] "I do not advise printing Gerontion as preface. One don't miss it at all as the thing now stands. To be more lucid still, let me say that I advise you NOT to print Gerontion as prelude." [...] The lines were never added to the text and remained an individual poem.|$|E
2500|$|A made-for-television anime film titled [...] was {{produced}} {{to promote the}} game. It was animated by Ufotable, and distributed by Bandai Namco Games. The anime depicts the <b>opening</b> <b>part</b> of the game, where Sorey trains to become a Shepherd and first encounters Alisha and Lunarre. The anime was directed by Haruo Tonosaki, produced by Baba, and scored by Sakuraba and Shiina. Given {{the costs associated with}} including the anime with the game on a Blu-ray hybrid disc, the company was originally opposed to its creation and originally planned for a Tales of Berseria anime adaption. Despite this, Baba wanted to create the anime as part of the 20th anniversary series celebrations related to the game. It was first broadcast on 30 December 2014 on Tokyo MX and Kyoto Broadcasting System (KBS), and on 31 December on BS11. It was subsequently broadcast through January on Kochi TV, Okayama Broadcasting, Ehime Asahi Television and Bandai Channel. It was repeated again on 20 January to commemorate the release of the game. In Japan, the anime is included on the game's disc. For its western release, the anime was included in the European and North American Collector's Editions.|$|E

2500|$|A council {{probably}} held at Rome in 382 under St. Damasus gave {{a complete}} list of the canonical books of both the Old Testament and the New Testament (also known as the 'Gelasian Decree' because it was reproduced by Gelasius in 495), which is identical with the list given at Trent. American Roman Catholic priest and historian William Jurgens stated: [...] "The first part of this decree has long been known as the Decree of Damasus, and concerns the Holy Spirit and the seven-fold gifts. The second part of the decree is more familiarly known as the <b>opening</b> <b>part</b> of the Gelasian Decree, in regard to the canon of Scripture: De libris recipiendis vel non recipiendis. It is now commonly held that the part of the Gelasian Decree dealing with the accepted canon of Scripture is an authentic work of the Council of Rome of 382 A.D. and that Gelasius edited it again {{at the end of the}} fifth century, adding to it the catalog of the rejected books, the apocrypha. It is now almost universally accepted that these parts one and two of the Decree of Damasus are authentic parts of the Acts of the Council of Rome of 382 A.D.

2500|$|From {{the age of}} 9, Tull {{was brought}} up in the (Methodist) Children's Home and Orphanage (now known as Action for Children) in Bethnal Green, London, along with his brother, Edward, {{following}} the death of their parents. He joined Tottenham in the summer of 1909. His first senior games were in Argentina and Uruguay on the club's close season tour to South America. He made his home Football League debut against FA Cup holders, Manchester United, in front of over 30,000. His excellent form in this <b>opening</b> <b>part</b> of the season promised a great future. However, at a match away to Bristol City in October 1909 Tull was the target of vicious racist abuse. So incensed was the 'Football Star' reporter, DD, that his match report was headlined 'Football and the Colour Prejudice'. This is possibly the first time racial abuse was headlined in a football report. DD was keen to emphasis how Tull remained professional and composed despite the intense provocation. 'He is Hotspur's most brainy forward ... so clean in mind and method as to be a model for all white men who play football ... Tull was the best forward on the field'. However, soon after he was soon dropped from the first team and found it difficult to get a sustained run back in the side in which he started so well. He played most of his subsequent games for the reserves and was eventually transferred to Herbert Chapman's Northampton Town in 1911, where he made 111first-team appearances. Interestingly, Chapman – also a Methodist – was a former Spurs player and had played as a young man with Arthur Wharton at Stalybridge Rovers. He went on to manage both Huddersfield Town and Arsenal to FA Cup wins and League championships and is recognised {{as one of the great}} managers in the history of the Football League.|$|E

You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the <b>opening</b> <b>part</b> but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.
