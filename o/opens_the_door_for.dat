After Khione and her {{siblings}} attack the Argo II, trireme built by Leo, he falls into Ogygia – he manages to escape {{with the help of}} Calypso after they fall in love.

5|$|The {{university}} {{maintains a}} number of libraries, some general-purpose and some dedicated to specific topics such as architecture and law. Among the most notable of these are the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library and the Vietnam Center and Archive, the nation's largest and most comprehensive collections {{of information on the}} Vietnam War. On August 17, 2007, the Vietnam Center and Archive became the first US institution to sign a formalized exchange agreement with the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam. This <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> a two-way exchange between the entities.|$|E

25|$|One day, the {{landlord}} leaves his overcoat {{in the living}} room and in the pocket of the overcoat is the key to Xi'er's cell. Zhang Ershen is determined to help Xi'er. She takes the key and <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> Xi'er, and she flees. Shortly, {{the landlord}} finds Xi'er missing, and sends his accomplice, Mu Renzhi, and other men to chase her. Xi'er comes to a river that stops her. She takes off a shoe and leaves it at the river side, and then hides in the bush. Mu Renzhi and his men find the shoe and assume that Xi'er has drowned herself in the river, and they report to the landlord as such.|$|E
25|$|Now, however, with {{legitimacy}} being {{extended to}} non-state actors, {{as well as}} the opportunity for a minority to secede from a given state and form a new country there has been a dramatic shift in the international status quo. Moreover, the international community's model for conflict resolution is heavily influenced by academic thought developed in western countries. This model encourages intervening in civil wars in order to stop political violence and come to a negotiated settlement which often involves democratising efforts. Critics such as Christopher Clapham and David Shearer, argue that this intervention can provide mechanisms for continued conflict {{to the detriment of the}} civilian population. Clapham's argument is principally in relation to the situation in Rwanda leading up to the genocide, whereas Shearer focuses on the negative aspects of intervention, primarily regarding Sierra Leone, which prevents total victory by one side and results in the creation of asymmetries between belligerents which <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> continued bloodshed.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, however, Karros {{makes one}} of her rare mistakes, letting a senior Varrick {{executive}} testify on the company's record as a whole, rather than on Krayoxx only. This <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> David to [...] pounce and start a thorough cross-examination on Varrick's very shady past record, making the Varrick witness sweat for several hours. Knowing that the jury included several Catholics and several Blacks, David concentrates on one particularly atrocious aspect of Varrick's past record: clinical trials of an intended [...] "abortion pill" [...] which was tried on pregnant women in Africa and which resulted in severe bleeding, causing the deaths of eleven women. [...] David, {{along with some of}} his former colleagues watching the trial, realizes he has some serious untapped talent as a litigator.|$|E

6000|$|I {{agree that}} while I am about it I {{may as well}} see the other room, the third floor back. The landlady <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> me, but remains herself on the landing. She is a stout lady, and {{does not wish to}} dwarf the {{apartment}} by comparison. The arrangement here does not allow of your ignoring the bed. It is the life and soul of the room, and it declines to efface itself. Its only possible rival is the washstand, straw-coloured; with staring white basin and jug, together with other appurtenances. It glares defiantly from its corner. [...] "I know I'm small," [...] it seems to say; [...] "but I'm very useful; and I won't be ignored." [...] The remaining furniture consists of a couple of chairs--there is no hypocrisy about them: they are not easy and they do not pretend to be easy; a small chest of light-painted drawers before the window, with white china handles, upon which is a tiny looking-glass; and, occupying the entire remaining space, after allowing three square feet for the tenant, when he arrives, an attenuated four-legged table apparently home-made. The only ornament in the room is, suspended above the fireplace, a funeral card, framed in beer corks. As the corpse introduced by the ancient Egyptians into their banquets, it is hung there perhaps to remind the occupant of the apartment that the luxuries and allurements of life have their end; or maybe it consoles him in despondent moments with the reflection that after all he might be worse off.|$|E
6000|$|... "The truth, friend!" [...] Arthur said, imperturbably; [...] "where is the truth? Show it me. That is the {{question}} between us. I see it on both sides. I {{see it on the}} Conservative side of the house, and amongst the Radicals, and even on the ministerial benches. I see it in this man, who worships by Act of Parliament, and is rewarded with a silk apron and five thousand a year; in that man, who, driven fatally by the remorseless logic of his creed, gives up everything, friends, fame, dearest ties, closest vanities, the respect of an army of churchmen, the recognised position of a leader, and passes over, truth-impelled, to the enemy, in whose ranks he will serve henceforth as a nameless private soldier:--I see the truth in that man, as I do in his brother, whose logic drives him to quite a different conclusion, and who, after having passed a life in vain endeavours to reconcile an irreconcilable book, flings it at last down in despair, and declares, with tearful eyes, and hands up to heaven, his revolt and recantation. If the truth is with all these, why should I take side with any one of them? Some are called upon to preach: let them preach. Of these preachers there are somewhat too many, methinks, who fancy they have the gift. But we cannot all be parsons in church, that is clear. Some must sit silent and listen, or go to sleep mayhap. Have we not all our duties? The head charity-boy blows the bellows; the master canes the other boys in the organ-loft; the clerk sings out Amen from the desk; and the beadle with the staff <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> his Reverence, who rustles in silk up to the cushion. I won't cane the boys, nay, or say Amen always, or act as the church's champion and warrior, {{in the shape of the}} beadle with the staff; but I will take off my hat in the place, and say my prayers there too, and shake hands with the clergyman as he steps on the grass outside. Don't I know that his being there is a compromise, and that he stands before me an Act of Parliament? That the church he occupies was built for other worship? That the Methodist chapel is next door; and that Bunyan the tinker is bawling out the tidings of damnation on the common hard by? Yes, I am a Sadducee; and I take things as I find them, and the world, and the Acts of Parliament of the world, as they are; and as I intend to take a wife, if I find one--not to be madly in love and prostrate at her feet like a fool--not to worship her as an angel, or to expect to find her as such--but to be good-natured to her, and courteous, expecting good-nature and pleasant society from her in turn. And so, George, if ever you hear of my marrying, depend on it, it won't be a romantic attachment on my side: and if you hear of any good place under Government, I have no particular scruples that I know of, which would prevent me from accepting your offer." ...|$|E
