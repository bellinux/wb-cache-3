These theories have evolved and changed overtime, however, and thus the American public perception <b>of</b> <b>Nazis</b> has changed right along with them. This paper will explain the changing theories throughout the years as well as the American perceptions <b>of</b> <b>Nazis</b> that echo them...|$|R
