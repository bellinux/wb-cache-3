5|$|After leaving {{active duty}} in 1993, Bevin {{worked as a}} {{financial}} consultant for SEI Investments Company in Pennsylvania and Boston, then served as a vice president with Putnam Investments. In 1999, he was offered a stake in National Asset Management and moved to Kentucky to take the job. After the firm was sold in 2003, Bevin recruited a group <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> from National City Corp. to found Integrity Asset Management. The company was handling more than $1 billion in investments when Bevin sold it to Munder Capital Management of Michigan in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Construction of both Have Blue demonstrators used {{leftover}} tools {{from the}} C-5 program. Final assembly of HB1001 was originally scheduled {{to end in}} August 1977, before being ground tested until mid-October. The secret roll-out was envisaged to occur on 23October, after which the aircraft would be dismantled and flown to the test area. On 1September, however, with HB1001 partially complete, Lockheed machinists went on a four-month strike. A group <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> instead took over the job of assembly, which was completed in six weeks, with ground tests beginning on 17October.|$|E
5|$|In the 1900, a final {{attempt to}} {{increase}} the attendance of the camp meetings at Mountain Grove Campground {{was made by the}} Board <b>of</b> <b>Managers.</b> As well as general renovation, this included an addition of a building called the Preacher's Home, which was situated behind the auditorium. The purpose of this was to attract preachers to attend, thus inspiring locals to attend as well. This plan was not successful.|$|E

5|$|Progressive pop {{is a form}} of {{pop music}} which {{attempts}} to break with the genre's standard formula. Originally termed for early progressive rock music, some stylistic features of progressive pop include changes in key and rhythm, experiments with larger forms, and unexpected, disruptive, or ironic treatments of past conventions. Performers commonly produce their own material while opposing the influence <b>of</b> <b>managers,</b> agents, or record companies.|$|E
5|$|This chronological list <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> of Birmingham City Football Club {{comprises}} {{all those}} who have held the position of manager of the first team of Birmingham City and its predecessors Small Heath and Birmingham since the club was first admitted to the Football League in 1892. Each manager's entry includes his dates of tenure and the club's overall competitive record (in terms of matches won, drawn and lost), honours won and significant achievements while under his care. Caretaker managers are included, where known, {{as well as those}} who have been in permanent charge.|$|E
5|$|After {{one season}} in the Third Division South and {{eighteen}} in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, Palace's stay in the division was to {{last as long as}} the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to be promoted from, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Division Three South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth. Palace finished runners-up no less than three times, and when the 1939–40 season ended, Palace were sitting fourth. Unfortunately the season was only four matches old, cancelled with the onset of the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Albion {{had spent}} the {{majority}} of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992–93, Albion finished fourth and entered the playoffs for the first time, having just missed out the previous year. Albion's first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years – and their last ever at the original stadium – saw them beat Port Vale 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First Division. Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 through 2002, Banister {{worked as}} Pittsburgh's Major League Field Coordinator on the {{coaching}} staffs <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> Gene Lamont and Lloyd McClendon. He was then assigned {{the job of}} Minor League Field Coordinator, and served in that role from 2003 through 2010. In 2004, he served as the interim manager of Lynchburg when Jay Loviglio resigned from the position due to personal reasons. Banister became the interim pitching coach for Lynchburg in 2008 when Bob Milacki resigned from the position. Mike Steele then took the job from Banister in 2009. Banister managed the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League (AFL) in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 a new {{committee}} was formed, {{under which the}} club emerged from the doldrums. Manager Paul Ogden took over in 1969 and led the club to two Staffordshire County League championships, followed in quick succession by two Manchester League titles. After the second Manchester League win, Leek joined the Cheshire County League, where they were league champions at the second attempt in the 1974–75 season, but after Ogden left in 1975 to take over as manager of Northwich Victoria a series <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> came and went in quick succession {{without being able to}} maintain this level of success.|$|E

5|$|In November 1946, Cowan became Manchester City manager, {{succeeding}} Wilf Wild, {{who moved}} to a purely administrative role. Cowan had been known for his motivational skills as a player, and {{was part of a}} new generation <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> who took responsibility for tactics and team selection, of which Cowan's contemporary and former teammate Matt Busby became the most well-known. Cowan was given a salary of £2,000, and came to an agreement whereby he spent part of the week with the Manchester City team and part looking after his business interests in Brighton. His first match as manager was a 3–0 win against Newport County, and the team then embarked upon a run of 19 matches without defeat. Despite achieving the Division Two title in his first season in charge, Cowan resigned in June 1947 as his commute from Brighton caused tension with club officials.|$|E
5|$|Merrick {{concluded}} that his only {{escape from the}} workhouse might be through the world of human novelty exhibitions. He knew of a Leicester music hall comedian and proprietor named Sam Torr. Merrick wrote to Torr, who came and visited him at the workhouse. Torr decided {{that he could make}} money exhibiting Merrick; although, to retain Merrick's novelty, {{he would have to be}} a travelling exhibit. To this end, he organised a group <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> for Merrick: music hall proprietor J. Ellis, travelling showman George Hitchcock, and fair owner Sam Roper. On 3 August 1884, Merrick departed the workhouse to start his new career.|$|E
5|$|This chronological list <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> of Aston Villa Football Club {{comprises}} {{all those}} who have held the position of secretary or manager of the first team of Aston Villa since {{the formation of the}} club in 1874. From 1874 to 1934, the team was selected by a committee whose secretary had the same powers and role as a manager has today. There were two secretaries during this period, George Ramsay and W. J. Smith. The most successful person to manage the club was George Ramsay, who won six FA Cups and six First Division championships in his 42-year reign as secretary. Jimmy McMullan became the first full-time manager in 1934. Aston Villa were the first top-tier club to appoint a manager from outside the United Kingdom or Ireland when Jozef Vengloš was appointed in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Alonso quickly progressed {{through the}} youth ranks and the reserve team at Real Sociedad (winning the regionalised fourth tier in his single {{season with the}} latter) and {{impressed}} enough to earn a first team debut {{at the age of}} 18. He made his first senior appearance against Logroñés in December 1999 in a Copa del Rey match. Alonso failed to make another appearance in the season but the following year brought more opportunities. At the beginning of the 2000–01 season, Javier Clemente sent him to Segunda División team Eibar to gain experience. Alonso's father particularly felt the move to the smaller club improved him as a player. A quick turnover <b>of</b> <b>managers,</b> however, including a two-month period with Periko Alonso in charge, left Real Sociedad in a dire situation. By January 2001, Real Sociedad were bottom of the league and its new manager, John Toshack, turned to the prodigious Alonso in the hope of reversing the team's fortunes. In a surprise move, the Welsh manager made the 20-year-old the team captain, a position traditionally held by more senior players. By the end of the season, Sociedad had climbed out of the relegation zone and finished in 14th place. Toshack lauded Alonso, noting that the impression he had on the team was exceptional, especially for a player from the youth team.|$|E
5|$|As railroads {{began to}} become more common, {{attendance}} of the Mountain Grove Campground began to decline. The attendance of the campground dropped severely in 1891. On July 9, 1891, the campground placed an unusually large advertisement in a local newspaper. Attendance continued to drop in 1892. The decline continued, despite efforts by the campground directors {{to increase the number}} of Chautauqua speakers and religious speakers. Attempts were made throughout the 1890s to stave off the impending failure of the campground, but were largely unsuccessful. Later, the Board <b>of</b> <b>Managers</b> decided that they would open the campground specifically for special events, such as the Bloomsburg Methodist Church's plans for an eleven-car special train to carry picnickers and a band there. By the mid-1890s, it was permitted for visitors to bring their own supplies, rent multiple tents, and decide whether to stay for one or two weeks. A short branch line of the Danville, Hazleton, and Wilkes-Barre Railroad was then built to allow easier transport of visitors' baggage to the campground. Baggage carrying was also done for free and the attendance fee was also reduced. Only one of the twenty-five prominent local families who attended the camp meeting in the 1880s still attended it in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|One of Girdap's notable {{enterprises}} was {{the international}} transport company Transbalkania {{which had a}} capital of 100,000 leva. Of the company's 500 shares, 200 were owned by Girdap and another 170 were owned by three of the bank's managers or employees. Liquidated after World War I, Transbalkania was active as a carrier from Bulgaria to Edirne, Alexandroupoli, Thessaloniki and Niš and along the Danube. During the wars, Girdap was involved in tobacco trade and had warehouses in modern Dupnitsa, Blagoevgrad and Xanthi. This led {{to the establishment of}} another Girdap venture, the Bulgarian Macedonian Bank (Balgarska makedonska banka), on 21 May 1916. The Bulgarian Macedonian Bank was mostly active as a commercial bank, which is indicated by its capital of 46.95 million leva as opposed to only 13.31 million leva of deposits. Other banks more or less related to Girdap included the Sofia Bank (Sofiyska banka, established in 1906), the Bulgarian Forest Commercial Bank (Balgarska gorsko-targovska banka, established in 1917), and the Bulgarian Surety Bank (Balgarska garantsionna banka, established in 1912). The Pleven-based Lev cement factory was founded in 1917 with Girdap board <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> member Ivan Kovachev as chief shareholder. Ninety percent of the capital of the Kurilo mine in the Iskar Gorge was controlled by Girdap or its head figures Ivan Kovachev and Boncho Boev. Despite Girdap's active involvement in assistance to national industry, it failed to make a significant contribution and gradually minimized its participation due to insufficient profits.|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} here is {{to examine}} how the centralization or decentralization of decision-making authority affects the quality <b>of</b> the <b>managers</b> who are actually selected.

40|$|Women {{are heavily}} {{underrepresented}} in management positions. This paper investigates {{if there is}} state dependence in the share <b>of</b> female <b>manager</b> hires in German plants to assess if increased female representation in management positions is sustainable. Using administrative data from the Integrated Employment Biographies of the IAB, we apply dynamic tobit models and dynamic linear models taking unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of lagged dependent variables into account. We find that there is state dependence in the female share <b>of</b> <b>manager</b> hires. Dynamic linear models for the number <b>of</b> female <b>manager</b> hires also point to the sustainability <b>of</b> female <b>manager</b> hires showing that there is state dependence in the number <b>of</b> female <b>manager</b> hires. However, there is no state dependence in the number <b>of</b> male <b>manager</b> hires...|$|R
