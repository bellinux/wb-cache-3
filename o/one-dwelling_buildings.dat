Not since year 1990 there has been estimates made {{of the amount of}} people that are exposed to certain vibration velocities from railway traf-fic in Sweden. Furthermore there has never been any transfer factors published for the transmission of vibrations between the ground and the foundation of buildings in Sweden. By measuring ground-borne vibrations in the ground while doing mea-surements in the foundation, data for 51 buildings have been collected from which comparison of transfer factors between ground and foundation have been possible. The data have been analysed as an overall, as well as according to building size and foundation type. The transfer factor between ground and foundation of a building was found to be 0. 83 as an overall mean. The majority of the transmission factors are in the range 0. 7 - 1. 1 and the transmission factor {{does not seem to be}} depen-dent on if the foundation type is suspended foundation or basement. Multi-dwelling buildings seems to have much lower transfer factor than <b>one-dwelling</b> <b>buildings,</b> but more data for Multi-dwelling buildings is needed to establish if this is statistically correct. In order to estimate the amount of people that are exposed to certain vibration velocities from railway traÿc in Sweden, almost 3 000 measurements of vibrations have been classified according to geology at the receiving building. A simple model have been made based on the attenuation of vibrations with distance and on the geology-classified data. Based on geological maps and a database of all properties close to railways, the total number of exposed individuals in Sweden could be estimated. The amount of people where the rms-weighted comfort values are exceeding the vibration levels 0. 4, 0. 7, 1. 0 and 1. 4 mm/s were estimated to 54 100, 25 000, 14 200 and 7 300 people respectively. The model for estimation of exposed people could be improved by using more precise soil class information and by including the soil class under the railway in the model. The model could be used to simplify analyses of vibration exposed buildings and to make rough estimates of what vibration level that might a˙ect a building...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} of <b>one-dwelling</b> <b>building</b> is to conduct a study of thermal flux and {{diffusion}} of water vapour through {{a part of the}} building cladding. By means of a computer program, examples of structural complexes of flat roofs of two types are made – inverted flat roof and combined flat roof. By complying to the criteria of allowed thermal transmittance of flat roofs as are written in the PURES 2010 (Pravilnik o učinkoviti rabi energije v stavbah), including the corresponding technical directive and the treatment of calculation method of the thermal transmittance of building components set by the ISO 6946 standard, the effect of different ratios of thermal insulation between the two types of flat roof on the change of thermal flux and the corresponding needed change of the thermal insulation thickness of the material in the system of the roofs in consideration is studied. An appendix on inverted flat roofs is taken into account {{in the first part of}} the study of the thermal flux through structural complexes, a correction stated in the ISO 6946 standard. The latter contains a correction on the system’s thermal transmittance in regard to the additional heat loss due to the water percolation through the juncture of thermal insulation layer. Additionally, an appeal for the correction of the thermal conductivity in regard to the change of thermal conductivity of the thermal insulation is made in the aforementioned appendix, to integrate the possible increase of the moisture content due to the diffusion of water vapour. This subject is represented in the second part of the study...|$|R
