The study investigates usage patterns and adoption <b>of</b> mobile <b>money</b> <b>in</b> day-to-day person-to-person <b>money</b> transfers using mobile telephone, mobile {{payments and}} integration <b>of</b> mobile <b>money</b> <b>in</b> financial services in Kenya.

The study employs a survey questionnaire and two focus groups to collect data from mobile money users. The study result indicates that pre-usage methods <b>of</b> <b>money</b> transfers significantly influenced initial uptake <b>of</b> mobile <b>money</b> <b>in</b> Kenya while its technical attributes have sustained a positive influence on continuance intentions.

5|$|In 1976, workers' pay {{averaged}} between $11 and $18 per hour, {{depending on}} the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for many workers became {{what to do with}} so much extra money. Teamster Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a pay rate of $57,000 per year at a time when members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500. The large amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the pipeline camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games that sometimes involved tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work with no money remaining.|$|E

5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of King William I of England, Urse {{continued}} to serve William's sons and successors, Kings William II Rufus and Henry I.
