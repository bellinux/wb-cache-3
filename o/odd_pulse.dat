40|$|Two {{synchronized}} bus-clamping {{pulse width}} modulation (PWM) strategies based on the space vector approach are proposed for high-power induction motor drives. The two strategies together can produce PWM waveforms with any <b>odd</b> <b>pulse</b> number, preserving the waveform symmetries. The proposed strategies operate upto the six-step mode, maintaining the proportionality between the reference magnitude and the fundamental voltage generated throughout. These two strategies lead to lesser harmonic distortion as well as lesser peak current over the conventional space vector strategy (CSVS) in the high speed ranges of constant V/F drives. The reduction in the harmonic distortion over CSVS subject to a given maximum switching frequency (FSW(MAX)) of the inverter is demonstrated theoretically as well as experimentally for FSW(MAX) = 750 Hz and 450 Hz, both with and without overmodulation. The best reduction in the distortion {{is as high as}} 30 % to 50 % in the different cases considered. Further, these two PWM strategies are also useful in reducing the switching frequency of the inverter over sine-triangle PWM and CSVS subject to an upper limit on the harmonic distortion...|$|E
40|$|Synchronised PWM {{waveforms}} with 3 -phase, half-wave and quarter-wave symmetries {{are required}} in VSI-fed high-power ac drives. The flexibilities {{of the space}} vector approach to modulation can be utilised for real-time generation {{of more than one}} family of synchronised PWM waveforms, maintaining all the symmetries with any <b>odd</b> <b>pulse</b> number. Two such synchronised PWM strategies are proposed in this paper along with an overmodulation scheme for operation upto six-step mode, maintaining the modulator gain constant in the whole range. The proposed overmodulation scheme does not require any evaluation of quadratic or cubic expressions, or any look-up table except for storing sine values. These two strategies result in a harmonic distortion better than those of comparable ones at higher modulation indices for low pulse numbers of 5 and 7. A combination of these two strategies along with two other bus-clamping strategies and the conventional space vector strategy, leads to a significant reduction in the harmonic currents in constant V/f induction motor drives as shown by the theoretical as well as experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{cochlear}} implant performance requires adequate responsiveness of the auditory nerve to prolonged pulsatile electrical stimulation. Degeneration of the auditory nerve {{as a result}} of severe hair cell loss could considerably compromise this ability. The main objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the recovery of the electrically stimulated auditory nerve, as well as to evaluate possible changes caused by deafness-induced degeneration. To this end we studied temporal responsiveness of the auditory nerve in a guinea pig model of sensorineural hearing loss. Using masker-probe and pulse train paradigms we compared electrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAPs) in normal-hearing animals with those in animals with moderate (two weeks after ototoxic treatment) and severe (six weeks after ototoxic treatment) loss of spiral ganglion cells (SGCs). Masker-probe interval and pulse train inter-pulse interval was varied from 0. 3 to 16 ms. Whereas recovery assessed with masker-probe was roughly similar for normal-hearing and both groups of deafened animals, it was considerably faster for six weeks deaf animals (τ≈ 1. 2 ms) than for two weeks deaf or normal-hearing animals (τ≈ 3 - 4 ms) when 100 -ms pulse trains were applied. Latency increased with decreasing inter-pulse intervals, and this was more pronounced with pulse trains than with masker-probe stimulation. With high frequency pulse train stimulation eCAP amplitudes were modulated for deafened animals, meaning that amplitudes for <b>odd</b> <b>pulse</b> numbers were larger than for even pulses. The relative refractory period (τ) and the modulation depth of the eCAP amplitude for pulse trains, as well as the latency increase for both paradigms significantly correlated with quantified measures of auditory nerve degeneration (size and packing density of SGCs). In addition to these findings, separate masker-probe recovery functions for the eCAP N 1 and N 2 peaks displayed a robust non-monotonic or shoulder-shaped course in all animals. The time interval between the N 1 and N 2 correlated with neuronal refractoriness, suggesting that the N 2 peak reflects a second firing of part of the SGC population. We conclude that - compared to the commonly used masker-probe recovery functions - recovery functions obtained with pulse train stimulation may provide a means to augment differences and, by doing so, to more potently discriminate between auditory nerve conditions...|$|E

40|$|A sigma-delta (ΣΔ) based {{technique}} {{is used to}} embed a complex modulation scheme such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) into a single ONOFF bit stream operating at the carrier frequency. The amplitude of the signal {{is related to the}} pulse widths and the phase is related to the pulse positions. The pulse edges are time quantised to align with the system clock. The work is based on a Cartesian ΣΔ scheme which uses Cartesian filters and a polar quantiser to move quantisation noise away from the band of interest. The first contribution of this thesis is the introduction of an improved odd quantisation and joint quantisation process. <b>Odd</b> quantisation uses <b>pulse</b> widths constrained to an odd number of clock periods compared to the more traditional even quantisation with an even number of clock periods. Joint quantisation uses pulses of unrestricted widths. It is shown that the odd quantisation scheme outperforms the even quantisation scheme by about 2 dB in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and the joint quantisation scheme enhances this by a further 3 dB. The improvement comes at the expense of complexity. A joint quantiser requires a two dimensional (2 D) quantisation process, which for an oversampling ratio (OSRRF) of 8 involves 197 operations. A method that simplifies this to 44 operations is proposed. The second contribution involves {{the development of a new}} frequency tuning method. It involves phase rotators before and after the quantiser rotating at an intermediate frequency. Tuning spectrally shifts both the signal and noise null together, but the final phase conversion process generates an image and distortion products of both the noise and signal, resulting in a higher than expected noise floor and unwanted spurious signals. A deliberate choice of intermediate frequency (fIF) equal to or greater than the transmission bandwidth plus half of a channel bandwidth, will move all distortion products out of band. Unfortunately there is a deterioration in the in-band noise null compared to the non-shifted condition of about 8 dB and this worsens as the intermediate frequency increases. A mathematical derivation has been developed to predict the size and position of the unwanted images. The signal image can be removed by pre-distorting the input signal. A method for reducing noise enhancement caused by frequency tuning has also been developed. It involves distorting the feedback signal in the ΣΔ converter. The above improvements will enhance the use of all-digital ΣΔ based transmitters in future wireless communication system...|$|R
