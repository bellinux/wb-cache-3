5|$|Each {{subsequent}} {{line was}} built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station.

5|$|A {{drawback}} to {{the device was}} found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that day <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> two major surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E
5|$|As he {{attempted}} to withdraw with the wounded soldier, Bleak was confronted by two more Chinese. Putting down the wounded soldier, Bleak reportedly surprised the Chinese soldiers by charging them and smashing their heads together {{with such force that}} he may have fractured the skulls of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the assailants before pushing them out of his way. Eventually, all 20 men of the patrol returned to the UN lines, but a third of them were wounded.

5|$|Examples of glycerophospholipids {{found in}} {{biological}} membranes are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, GPCho or lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PS or GPSer). In addition to {{serving as a}} primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of or, themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, {{but there are also}} alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|Handled {{the ball}} is Law 33 in the laws of cricket {{established}} by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A batsman can be given out for handling the ball if, while playing a delivery, the batsman intentionally touches the ball with <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> their hands not holding the bat. A decision of not out must be reached if the batsman handles the ball to avoid incurring an injury. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion.|$|E

Often, Khandoba {{is depicted}} as a warrior seated on horseback with <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> his wives and accompanied {{with one or more}} dogs. He is also worshipped as the aniconic Lingam, the symbol of Shiva. Often in Khandoba temples, both representations of Khandoba— the aniconic lingam and the anthropomorphic horseback form.|$|E

This is expected under Marcan posteriority, assuming the Marcan account can more easily refer to Matthew from memory, but more difficult to explain under Marcan priority.|$|R

5|$|The {{line was}} built by the mining company Sydvaranger, who started {{construction}} in 1907 and inaugurated the railway in 1910. From 1912, the port network received electrification, as did the mainline in 1920. Originally, free passenger trains services were also offered. During the Second World War, the line was largely destroyed, but rebuilt afterwards and re-opened in 1952. Electric traction was abandoned in 1955 when two EMD G12 diesel locomotives were bought. The line closed in 1997, but was reopened in 2009, following a change in ownership of the mine. There are proposals to connect the line to either <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the Finnish and Russian railway networks.|$|E

Tucker played only one game for the Indians, on April 29 when he recorded a strikeout in his lone at-bat. In early May, the Indians sent him to their Triple-A minor league affiliate, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League; his last major league game was April 29.|$|E

5|$|Mary Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's older sister, {{had earlier}} been {{recalled}} from France in late 1519, ostensibly for her affairs with the French {{king and his}} courtiers. She married William Carey, a minor noble, in February 1520, at Greenwich, with Henry VIII in attendance; soon after, Mary Boleyn became the English King's mistress. Historians dispute King Henry VIII's paternity of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> Mary Boleyn's children born during this marriage. Henry VIII: The King and His Court, by Alison Weir, questions the paternity of Henry Carey; Dr. G.W. Bernard (The King's Reformation) and Joanna Denny (Anne Boleyn: A New Life of England's Tragic Queen) argue that Henry VIII was their father. Henry did not acknowledge either child, as he did his son Henry Fitzroy, his illegitimate son by Elizabeth Blount, Lady Talboys.|$|E
