The jewelry schedule was very complicated, because pieces had to go from Switzerland to Paris, and the shooting schedule was changing constantly. It was really a house of cards. There were a couple <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>we</b> got caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry. When you see Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, her black and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.|$|E

[...] Speaking about the record's long gestation period, Bono said, [...] "Rumour has it we haven't made a U2 album in the last five years. We have. We've made several.

He came down, rewrote the scene, and before {{he got back to}} his plane I sort of grabbed him and said, 'And this scene and this scene?' And he rewrote two other scenes that I thought had problems." [...] In October 2013, Tony Curran tweeted that he would be portraying Odin's father, Bor, in a flashback sequence. In November 2013, Feige stated that the film was intended to be the conclusion of the [...] "Loki trilogy", which examined the relationship of Thor and Loki throughout Thor, The Avengers and this film.

We were confident we could stay alive for forty-eight hours. The high pressure and foul air gave us severe headaches. We did very little moving or talking; it excited our hearts too much. We heard scraping on the hull for hours. A couple <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>we</b> felt the O-5 being lifted, and then we got tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed our hopes [...] for rescue tremendously. Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly. We felt we would escape this time, but it seemed like forever. The last 20 minutes were unbearable. We heard our comrades walking on deck. Breault opened the hatch and we could see daylight. [...] We were saved!!! ...|$|E
2500|$|Cantrell was a {{close friend}} of former Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, who he {{described}} as his best friend. Staley died in April 2002 at the same time of Cantrell's Degradation Trip tour, but Cantrell opted not to cancel any shows, stating, [...] "It's difficult to do interviews - it's hard to talk about it [...] I'm just thankful to have a tour and work - something I can focus on.". [...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>we</b> would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E
