5|$|Following the {{transfer}} to local authority control, {{much of the}} property <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> {{was found to be}} in poor condition. In 1971 a report by the London Borough of Haringey found that half the properties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> were still lacking basic facilities such as baths, internal toilets and hot water. Houses were systematically extended to the rear to accommodate modern bathrooms.|$|E

5|$|The estate had a role, {{together}} with the Acland family's other Exmoor estate of Pixton, as a home of West Country staghunting in the 18th century. There was some controversy locally and nationally when the National Trust banned staghunting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> in the early 21st century.|$|E

5|$|A {{site for}} a church had been set aside <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> from the outset, and in 1884 Plumbe {{submitted}} designs for a church and mission hall. The mission hall opened in March 1885 with room for 350, and soon began to suffer from overcrowding. The people of Noel Park started a fund {{to pay for the}} church, which was consecrated on 1 November 1889 as St Mark's.|$|E

5|$|As {{the city}} of Toronto {{expanded}} eastward and encroached <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> Elizabeth and Wellington Ashbridge subdivided and sold off much of the family's land for residential subdivisions. The Duke of Connaught Public School (1912) and S.H. Armstrong Community Recreation Centre were built on land {{that had been the}} Ashbridges' orchard. Woodfield Road, {{on the east side of}} the current property, was originally the farm lane going to the fields farther north.|$|E

In September 1940, during {{a raid on}} the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton, bombs cut off the estate's water supply, and during a later raid, one bomb badly damaged the lantern roof light over the hallway. In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down. As a result damp, and latterly birds, entered the house through the roof light, until the house came into the {{ownership}} of the National Trust and was repaired.|$|E
5|$|By the Elizabeth period, Dunham Massey Castle {{had been}} demolished. Probably during the medieval period, Dunham Massey Hall became {{the home of}} the manorial lord, and a centre of power in the area. The hall was rebuilt in 1616, leaving no remains of the old medieval manor house. A mill at Dunham was {{documented}} in 1353, although the its present structure dates to the 1860s. It lies on the River Bollin, opposite Little Bollington. The first record of Dunham's deer park was also in 1353. The settlement at Dunham Woodhouse (named after an outlying lodge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate)</b> dates from the 15th century. During the medieval period, the primary source of employment was agriculture, mainly arable farming.|$|E

They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto. Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at Los Alamos, the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa.

5|$|However, Wason had {{expected}} the Methven Branch railway {{to be built}} near Barrhill, {{but when it was}} built on a more southerly route along Thompsons Track and what was later to become known as Lauriston, the village began to decline. Dwindling population forced the closure of the school in 1938, although the Church of St John the Evangelist is still in use. Most of the buildings were constructed from pine wood grown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> but the three original concrete buildings remain: church, school and schoolhouse.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{as part of}} its {{campaign}} for the Three Fs (fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale) and specifically in resistance to proposed evictions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> local activists of the Irish Land League encouraged Boycott's employees (including the seasonal workers required to harvest the crops on LordErne's estate) to withdraw their labour, and began a campaign of isolation against Boycott in the local community. This campaign included shops in nearby Ballinrobe refusing to serve him, and the withdrawal of services. Some were threatened with violence to ensure compliance.|$|E

The castle was heavily involved in the border wars with Scotland, usually holding a garrison of 100 men and forming an important strategic defensive location, one step removed from the fortifications along the border itself.|$|E

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>estate,</b> Wason built a {{model village}} called Barrhill, with avenues forming a grid layout and a central market square. Barrhill had 28 sections, {{including}} a post office, bakery, school, church, other facilities, and fifteen cottages were built.
