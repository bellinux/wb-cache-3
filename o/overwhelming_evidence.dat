5|$|Philip Marc Smith (born July 10, 1965 in Willenhall , England) is an English spree killer {{serving a}} life {{sentence}} for the murders of three women in Birmingham. A former fairground worker employed at the Rainbow public house in the Digbeth area of the city, Smith killed his victims over a four-day period in November 2000, befriending two of them at the Rainbow before carrying out the crimes. All three victims were mutilated almost beyond recognition, but Smith was quickly identified as the killer because of the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidence</b> linking him to the deaths.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidence</b> that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 Allison {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in 1942, and the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor of Physics in 1959. He studied the Compton effect and the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction. At the time x-rays were an important means of investigating atomic structures, but the concept that light had both wave and particle properties, as demonstrated by Arthur Compton, was not universally accepted. William Duane from Harvard spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong, and Allison became part of this effort. Duane carried {{out a series of}} meticulous experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidence</b> that Compton was correct. To his credit, Duane conceded that this was the case.|$|E

5|$|There is <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidence</b> {{of global}} {{disruption}} of plant communities at the K–Pg boundary. Extinctions are seen both {{in studies of}} fossil pollen, and fossil leaves. In North America, the data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at the K–Pg boundary sections, although there were substantial megafloral changes before the boundary. In North America, approximately 57% of plant species became extinct. In high southern hemisphere latitudes, such as New Zealand and Antarctica, the mass die-off of flora caused no significant turnover in species, but dramatic and short-term changes in the relative abundance of plant groups. In some regions, the Paleocene recovery of plants began with recolonizations by fern species, represented as a fern spike in the geologic record; this same pattern of fern recolonization was observed after the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption.|$|E
5|$|After the Nuremberg rallies trilogy and Olympia, Riefenstahl {{began work}} on the movie she had {{tried and failed to}} direct once before, namely Tiefland. On Hitler's direct order, the German {{government}} paid her seven million Reichsmarks in compensation. From 23 September until 13 November 1940, she filmed in Krün near Mittenwald. The extras playing Spanish women and farmers were drawn from gypsies detained in a camp at Salzburg-Maxglan who were forced to work with her. Filming at the Babelsberg Studios near Berlin began 18 months later in April 1942. This time Sinti and Roma people from the Marzahn detention camp near Berlin were compelled to work as extras. Almost to the end of her life, despite <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidence</b> that the concentration camp occupants had been forced to work on the movie unpaid, Riefenstahl continued to maintain all the film extras survived and that she had met several of them after the war. Riefenstahl sued filmmaker Nina Gladitz, who said Riefenstahl personally chose the extras at their holding camp; Gladitz had found one of the Gypsy survivors and matched his memory with stills of the movie for a documentary Gladitz was filming. The German court ruled largely in favour of Gladitz, declaring that Riefenstahl had known the extras were from a concentration camp, but they also agreed that Riefenstahl had not been informed the Gypsies would be sent to Auschwitz after filming was completed.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{algorithm}} for two-sided matching problems with some compromise. We dis-cuss the self-interested hypothesis vs. human sociality hypothesis. It {{is an important}} issue such as how far agents seek their own interest in a competitive environment? There are <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidences</b> that support peoples are also motivated by concerns for fairness and reciprocity. We showed that compromise, an indi-vidually irrational behavior, improves the welfare of others. We also obtain large-scale properties of some two-sided matching algorithms. We show some compromises of individuals increase global welfare. The op-timal compromise level is designed so that the social utility is maximized. ...|$|R

Ashley repeatedly escaped from various local jails and eluded law enforcement until he was gunned down at the Sebastian river bridge at Roseland. Although he was incarcerated for other crimes, Ashley never served any time for the murder of Desoto Tiger.|$|E

However, despite <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidence</b> that the AR-15 could bring more firepower to bear than the M14, the Army opposed the adoption of the new rifle. In January 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara concluded that the AR-15 was the superior weapon system and ordered a halt to M14 production. At the time, the AR-15 was the only rifle available that could fulfill the requirement of a universal infantry weapon for issue to all services.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the constitutional basis for establishing an institution for women, several other factors came into play. First, there was an extensive need for qualified public school teachers, a career path assumed to be especially attractive to women. Also, there was <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{the public school system}} in North Carolina was among the worst in the nation. For example, the average national expenditure per student enrolled in the public schools was $17.62, but North Carolina spent only $3.36 per student. Similarly, the average national length of the school year was 135 days, but it was only 60 days in North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|A {{modified}} version of this theory was advanced in an influential 1955 review of Pictish by Kenneth Jackson. Jackson proposed a two-language model: while Pictish was undoubtedly P-Celtic, it {{may have had a}} non-Celtic substratum and a second language may have been used for inscriptions. Jackson's hypothesis was framed in the then-current model that a Brittonic elite, identified as the Broch-builders, had migrated from the south of Britain into Pictish territory, dominating a pre-Celtic majority. He used this to reconcile the perceived translational difficulties of Ogham with the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidence</b> for a P-Celtic Pictish language. Jackson was content to write off Ogham inscriptions as inherently unintelligible.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the deep and systematic relations between dialogicity and grammar, highlighting how dialogicity {{is not only}} a feature of linguistic use, but is always {{at the very heart of}} a linguistic system. There are <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidences</b> of this in all natural languages, even if they are often underrated or blurred in most traditional grammars, and a coherent reception of pragmatic researches is still lagging behind or far from being soundly integrated in general descriptive grammars. The discussion focuses on two specific cases: a) the relationships between information-structure and diverse grammatical features in Italian; b) the problems inherent to the traditional classification of sentence types in Italian, which are partly due to a still partial reception of the speech act theory, and partly to the inertial force of older descriptive tradition...|$|R

Genesis of the solar cycle and activity phenomena-one of the major unsolved problem in solar physics- remains elusive to the solar community. Presently there are two schools of thoughts viz., turbulent dynamo and MHD oscillation mechanisms that explain the solar cycle and activity phenomena. Both the mechanisms are critically examined and fundamental difficulties are presented. By keeping in mind the more advantages of having MHD oscillation mechanism, compared to the turbulent dynamo mechanism, following new ideas on the genesis of the solar cycle and activity phenomena are presented.

25|$|Book Nine {{introduces}} {{the details of}} Fyodor's murder and describes the interrogation of Dmitri as he is questioned for the crime he maintains he did not commit. The alleged motive for the crime is robbery. Dmitri was {{known to have been}} completely destitute earlier that evening, but is suddenly seen on the street with thousands of rubles shortly after his father's murder. Meanwhile, the three thousand rubles that Fyodor Karamazov had set aside for Grushenka has disappeared. Dmitri explains that the money he spent that evening came from three thousand rubles Katerina gave him to send to her sister. He spent half that at his first meeting with Grushenka—another drunken orgy—and sewed up the rest in a cloth, intending to give it back to Katerina in the name of honor, he says. The lawyers are not convinced by this. All of the evidence points against Dmitri; the only other person in the house {{at the time of the}} murder was Smerdyakov, who was incapacitated due to an epileptic seizure he apparently suffered the day before. As a result of the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidence</b> against him, Dmitri is formally charged with the patricide and taken away to prison to await trial.|$|E

40|$|A {{new model}} based on space charge {{dynamics}} under very high dc electric field {{has been proposed}} to explain thickness dependent dielectric breakdown. Space charge phenomenon under high electric field has been studied for several decades thanks {{to the development of}} new charge mapping techniques. <b>Overwhelming</b> <b>evidences</b> show that the charge packet can be formed in the material under high electric field. The formation and dynamics of the charge packet will result in local electric field enhancement that has a direct impact on breakdown. It has been found that the key factors leading to the formation of charge packet are negative differential mobility and low trapping coefficient. Take these factors into the space charge based model, our simulation results clearly show that the breakdown is dependent on the sample thickness. Through the simulation, it has been noticed that the electrical breakdown field reduction depends on several parameters such as the onset of critical electric field when breakdown occurs. By varying the ramp rate of dc applied voltage, simulation has also shown that the breakdown strength increases with the voltage ramp rat...|$|R

First, there is <b>overwhelming</b> <b>evidences</b> in support {{of at least one}} break in betas for all the portfolios under investigation. Second, in most but not all cases, there exist asymmetries in betas, indicating that the risk measures can be different depending on the market conditions. Finally, in contrast to the findings that all the testing results by single regressions cannot reject the CAPM, we find that the CAPM can be consistent with the data in some regimes but may appear to be inconsistent with the data in some other regimes once the possibility of simultaneous nonlinearity and parameter instability are taken into account. This particularly appealing feature has been completely ruled out under the conventional single-equation framework. ...|$|R
