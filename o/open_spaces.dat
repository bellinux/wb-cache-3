40|$|This {{research}} uses {{a sequence}} of hedonic housing price regressions to estimate <b>open</b> <b>space</b> amenity values. The iterative approach empirically identifies the range of distance over which <b>open</b> <b>space</b> affects housing values. After controlling for numerous other factors in the spatial hedonic model, simple functional relationships were established between the implicit prices of developed <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> forest-land <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> and agriculture-wetland <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and the buffer radius of the area surrounding a given location. In the case of Nashville-Davidson County, Tennessee, households place a positive value on additional developed <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and forest-land <b>open</b> <b>space</b> up to distances of 2. 2 miles and 1. 5 miles, respectively, and a negative value for additional agriculture-wetland <b>open</b> <b>space</b> up to 0. 8 -miles from their location. Implicit-price-buffer-size functional relationships {{found in this study}} may be useful to local planners or policymakers. For example, local policymakers can identify the set of homeowners who would receive positive amenity values from developed <b>open</b> <b>space</b> or from preservation of forest-land <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> given the distance thresholds determined. Estimates of amenity and disamenity values of homeowners would allow the aggregate value generated by a particular open-space site to be estimated. The aggregate value consumers receive reflects the value residents place on neighborhood <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and is an estimate of the value of open-space as a public good. Thus, decision makers can prioritize specific open-space establishment or preservation decisions by not only accounting for the costs of establishing or preserving <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> but also estimating the public value of <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> agriculture-wetland <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> amenity value, developed <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> forest-land <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> hedonic spatial model, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Urban <b>open</b> <b>space</b> which {{maintaining}} {{the diversity of}} the urban ecosystem, is an important structural element of the city. Urban development led to the isolation of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> between one another, and the ecological function and environmental function of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> greatly reduced. This article pointing out that we should protect and restore urban ecological structure, improve the <b>open</b> <b>space</b> network, strengthen the links between <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> take low impact development approach to reduce the impact of urban development on the natural environment and restore the ecological functions of <b>open</b> <b>space...</b>|$|R
40|$|There is {{widespread}} {{public support for}} <b>open</b> <b>space</b> provision and for efforts by government to limit sprawl. We demonstrate that <b>open</b> <b>space</b> policies should {{not be viewed as}} independent of—or necessarily compatible with—growth management goals. We examine the impacts of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> designation on the urban landscape in a spatial city model with two important and empirically-relevant features: (1) residents prefer to live close to <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and (2) <b>open</b> <b>space</b> amenities attract migrants to the city. Our main findings are that <b>open</b> <b>space</b> designation can produce leapfrog development when it is located outside of the city; the effect of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> on the total area of developed land in the city is ambiguous; the location, size and configuration of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> can all affect development densities throughout the city. Our analysis identifies the key factors that determine the impacts of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and yields insights into the design of effective land-use policies...|$|R

50|$|A {{certain amount}} of overlap occurs with similar {{planning}} and conservation terms. Protected areas are <b>open</b> <b>space</b> reserves in which certain resources indigenous to the landscape are protected as opposed to conserved. Urban <b>open</b> <b>space</b> specifically refers to <b>open</b> <b>space</b> reserves within an urban setting; such may include natural landscapes or manicured urban parkland. Greenways are linear <b>open</b> <b>space</b> reserves, linear corridors that span interconnected <b>open</b> <b>space</b> reserves, or linear chains of connected <b>open</b> <b>space</b> reserves. A green belt is a general area of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> surrounding an urban area. Green infrastructure is the total mass and viability of undeveloped, natural, and agricultural land and waterways, protected or not protected, within a particular community or region. Nature reserves and wildlife refuges are areas of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> {{set aside for the}} sake of protecting non-human species. National parks, state parks, and municipal parks, recreation areas, and reservations are types of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> reserves managed by government agencies for the primary purpose of passive or active human enjoyment. National forests, state forests, and municipal forests are types of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> reserves set aside for the primary purpose of forest conservation. Flood control projects and protected ecological research areas may also be considered <b>open</b> <b>space</b> reserves secondary to their primary purpose.|$|R
5|$|As one of {{the largest}} <b>open</b> <b>spaces</b> close to Manchester, the moor has a history of use for army {{manoeuvres}} and large public gatherings. In his book The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, Friedrich Engels referred to it as the Mons Sacer of Manchester. This was a reference to the hill to which the plebs (common citizens) of Rome withdrew en masse in 494 BC as an act of civil protest.|$|E
5|$|The City of London had few <b>open</b> <b>spaces,</b> and the {{proposal}} {{to build on the}} north of the park was extremely unpopular with local residents, workers and social reformers.

5|$|A postwar {{review of}} {{inadequate}} housing {{led to the}} clearance and redevelopment of {{areas of the city}} in a postwar style, often at variance with the local Georgian style.

In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and <b>open</b> <b>spaces.</b> In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{considers}} the changing concepts of local <b>open</b> <b>space</b> {{in relation to}} the demand, supply and standards of <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> The development of parks in Britain first are contrasted with the development of parks in the United States, noting the legacies in both nations. After the historical resume, the changing attitudes to leisure and recreation in Britain and the United States which have occurred in the last fifteen years are considered. The numerous studies, both in Britain and in the United States, detailing the demand for <b>open</b> <b>space</b> are followed by supply studies of <b>open</b> <b>space,</b> which expose the deficiencies of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and express people's desires for <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> A comparison of the ideal <b>open</b> <b>space</b> standards to the actual supply and deficiencies of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> are analysed in further local studies. Both private and public organisations in Britain and the United States have carefully fostered ideal standards, which have been unattainable by any of the major cities in Britain or in the United States. The need for new standards and new approaches to local <b>open</b> <b>space</b> designs in inner urban areas is discussed in the chapter on current policies on <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> Different design concepts and methods are suggested for solving the present problems. The concepts particularly emphasised are small parks, greenways and adventure playgrounds, but other suggestions are made. An appraisal of the financial, legal and administrative difficulties is followed by a study of the availability of urban wasteland for public <b>open</b> <b>space.</b> New methods of assessing the multi-purpose use of existing <b>open</b> <b>space</b> and discovering potential new <b>open</b> <b>space</b> sites on a case-study basis are suggested.
