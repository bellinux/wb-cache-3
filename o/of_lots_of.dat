A commission was established and Commissioner James Blake offered a $150 prize to the architect who could design the best statehouse. The firm of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis created the winning design. Their plans were for a structure that was inspired by the ancient Greek Parthenon. The building looked very much like the Parthenon except for a large central dome. Town and Davis was awarded the contract to construct the building, and completed it ahead of schedule in 1835.|$|E

Most of the principal buildings were to be constructed along or within easy reach of the campus's main west-east pedestrian way, which became known as University Walk. The measure of 300 feet was chosen as it was seen to represent a 1-minute walk, and Abraham wanted to aim for a design where no two points on campus {{were more than a}} maximum 10-minutes' walk from each other.|$|E

One of the dresses consisted of purple colored hot pants, fishnets, and a mask, all covered with purple roses, along with a metallic purple jacket to top it off. Photographer Terry Richardson took photos of the backstage activities which revealed that a second purple jacket was also worn by Gaga and it was bejeweled and emblazoned with the word [...] "Gaga" [...] on the rear side.

500|$|Marjorie Baumgarten of Austin Chronicle {{referred}} to the film as being [...] "neither a true concert film nor a strict behind-the-scenes documentary, This Is It is, like Jackson himself, a real hybrid" [...] and felt that while the film's [...] "made up <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> grainy footage, which Ortega has edited together seamlessly" [...] it will also [...] "provide a fitting farewell."

[...] Joe Morgenstern, of The Wall Street Journal, felt the film was [...] "expertly packaged—brilliantly packaged," [...] and noted that the film [...] "quite convincingly" [...] had emphasized that Jackson had enough energy to perform, even with his [...] "wraith-thin body".

[...] She described Ortega's editing to make the film feel like a real concert film as being [...] "almost too good to believe." [...] Powers praised the film for showing [...] "intimate views" [...] of Jackson, like his [...] "vulnerable moments" [...] during performances and felt the film was made [...] "to honor not just the memory of Jackson but the hard work of a big cast and crew that never made it to opening night," [...] which she felt mostly is a tribute to the [...] "power of Jackson's body and voice." [...] Powers stated she had felt the film was such [...] "a tragic teaser for the shows that might have been, 'This Is It' hurts. If Jackson had been able to perform as he frequently does during these scenes, he would have accomplished the comeback for which he was so hungry." [...] She noted that Jackson's [...] "total lack of engagement with the cameras adds to the unreal mood" [...] because he was always performing — [...] "but for the imagined masses, not for the filmgoer" [...] and that the film does not [...] "entirely acknowledge that reality, and that's a little odd." ...|$|E

Lacking the advantage of air observation for reconnaissance and artillery-observation in the poor weather, the infantry had struggled to advance towards German defences protected by machine-guns, which had been moved back to concealed positions beyond the depth of the British barrages, to sweep the attack front from long-range. Rawlinson decided that the German defences would have to be subjected to a methodical bombardment and that the infantry must prepare more routes of supply from the rear and dig assembly trenches parallel to their objectives; Cavan suggested beginning a creeping barrage just beyond objectives and the firing <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> smoke shells to hamper German observation but none were available. By mid-October, air reconnaissance was impossible because of rain and mist and artillery-observation could not be conducted on any great scale. Shell bursts were smothered and guns too worn for accurate fire and sank into mud; the supply of ammunition was slowed by the condition of the ground and German bombardments.|$|E
