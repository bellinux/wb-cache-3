50|$|The SAP {{reflects}} the objectives, principles and functions that are {{set out in}} the Benguela Current Convention. It provides policy direction for the period 2015 to 2019. The content of the SAP is derived from the Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA), a scientific and technical assessment that identifies and ranks transboundary problems and proposes remedial actions. A first TDA was developed for the BCLME in 1999 and this document was updated in 2013, following a series of consultative workshops. The SAP is supplemented by an Implementation Plan, an <b>operational</b> <b>document</b> that details the activities required to implement the policy actions. The Implementation Plan provides a framework for the BCC to develop detailed scientific or management projects that help to meet its objectives.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{predominant}} {{challenge of}} knowledge management in A/E/C is {{to overcome the}} inter- and intra-organisational barriers of knowledge exchange within project-centred and fragmented organisations. This paper discusses the necessary knowledge transformation processes in corporate and project organisations {{as well as the}} potentials for its support by information and communication technology. Critical aspects for supporting the identification and externalisation of knowledge in A/E/C are discussed. A framework for combining several knowledge management services towards an organisational memory system is proposed. A first prototype of a document modelling (DocMo) service integrated with <b>operational</b> <b>document</b> management and e-learning systems is presented. The service allows for evaluating various methodologies within the context of an organisational memory system implementing various methods for manual as well as for (semi-) automatic knowledge externalisation from text documents. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Regional Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Plan (RHMEPP) is to {{coordinate}} the planning and response actions of the Mid-America Local Emergency Planning District, {{commonly referred to as}} the Mid-America Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This plan provides an administrative framework for hazardous materials planning and response in the areas served by the Mid-America LEPC including Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte, and Ray counties in Missouri; and Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte counties in Kansas. The RHMEPP is not intended to serve as an <b>operational</b> <b>document</b> although some aspects will be a valuable planning resource for operations plans. Rather, it provides an administrative framework and guidance to assist emergency response agencies, local governments, and the private sector in understanding concepts underlying the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to Know Act (EPCRA) (Superfund Amendment Reauthorization Act Title III) and its dictates for planning for hazardous materials emergencies. The document serves as an emergency planning tool to facilitate an effective, coordinated, multi-jurisdictional response by all personnel during a hazardous materials emergency.

40|$|Work {{supported}} by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission. ABSTR!ICT The two-mile accelerator at SLAC is an electron linac capable of producing a beam power of 500 kW at an energy as high as 20 GeV. When a high power electron beam interacts with matter, lethal dose levels can be created {{in a short period}} of time. For example, when one kilowatt of electrons produces an electromagnetic shower in 15 radiation lengths of iron, the bremsstrahlung dose rate at one meter in the forward direction is about lo 5 rad/hr. The Health Physics group at SLAC actively participates with the Research Area Department (RAD) in problems related to safe beam transport and shielding. The result of such planning and design is set forth in an <b>operational</b> <b>document</b> known as the Beam Authorization Sheet (BAS), which, along with the SLAC Radiation Rule Book, provides the guidelines through which the accelerator, beam switchyard, and research area safely operate, The purpose of this paper is to describe the planning and operational phases of radiation protection at SLAC with regards to: 1. primary electron and positron beam containment; 2. control of dangerous secondary beam areas, or ones that are potentially dangerous; 3. radiation and shielding calculations; 4. beam check-out procedures and measurements; 5. routine monitoring. Several classic examples will illustrate the ingenuity required in order to, satisfy the safety criteria established at SLAC.
