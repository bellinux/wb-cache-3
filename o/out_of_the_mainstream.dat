5|$|Djajakusuma often {{included}} traditional arts in his films, {{and two of}} them (Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda) {{were based}} on traditional wayang stories and used wayang-inspired costumes and tempos. This focus on aspects of traditional culture fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> after 1965, having been replaced by films about city life. Djajakusuma's theatrical productions experimented with new storytelling techniques, adapting the traditional styles for the modern world. As a lecturer teaching screenwriting and the history of theatre, Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts. He argued that Indonesians should rely on local culture, not continuously look towards the West. In other areas he was mostly apolitical.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> for decades.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{poetry in}} the {{contemporary}} era has been moving <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> and onto the college and university campus. The growth in the popularity of graduate creative writing programs has given poets {{the opportunity to make}} a living as teachers. This increased professionalization of poetry, combined with the reluctance of most major book and magazine presses to publish poetry, has meant that, for the foreseeable future at least, poetry may have found its new home in the academy and in small independent journals.|$|E
25|$|The republican {{agitation}} is {{no longer}} emphasized in Caragiale's later works, as republicanism slowly faded <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> liberal discourse. Noting this, several critics believe that, in his O scrisoare pierdută, which depicts the battle between two unnamed political camps, the dramatist alluded to the conflict between Brătianu's moderates and Rosetti's extremists (as indicated {{by the fact that}} all the main characters attend the same rallies). This view was disputed by Zarifopol, who argued that the more pragmatic grouping stands for the Conservatives, and the demagogic one for the National Liberals as a whole.|$|E
25|$|One of the Copenhagen Consensus panel experts later distanced {{himself from}} {{the way in which}} the Consensus results have been {{interpreted}} in the wider debate. Thomas Schelling now thinks that it was misleading to put climate change at the bottom of the priority list. The Consensus panel members were presented with a dramatic proposal for handling climate change. If given the opportunity, Schelling would have put a more modest proposal higher on the list. The Yale economist Robert O. Mendelsohn was the official critic of the proposal for climate change during the Consensus. He thought the proposal was way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> and could only be rejected. Mendelsohn worries that climate change was set up to fail.|$|E

25|$|Spock {{advocated}} {{ideas about}} parenting that were, at the time, considered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b> Over time, his books helped {{to bring about}} major change. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to {{sleep through the night}} (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, Beiderbecke's music continued to reside mostly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> and some of the facts of his life are still debated, but scholars largely agree—due in part to the influence of Sudhalter and Evans—that he was an important innovator in early jazz; jazz cornetists, including Sudhalter (before his death in 2008), and Tom Pletcher, closely emulate his style. In 2003, to mark the hundredth anniversary of his birth, the Greater Astoria Historical Society and other community organizations, spearheaded by Paul Maringelli and The Bix Beiderbecke Sunnyside Memorial Committee, erected a plaque in Beiderbecke's honor at the apartment building in which he died in Queens. That same year, Frederick Turner published his novel 1929, which followed the facts of Beiderbecke's life fairly closely, focusing on his summer in Hollywood and featuring appearances by Al Capone and Clara Bow. The critic and musician Digby Fairweather sums up Beiderbecke's musical legacy, arguing that [...] "with Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke was the most striking of jazz's cornet (and of course, trumpet) fathers; a player who first captivated his 1920s generation and after his premature death, founded a dynasty of distinguished followers beginning with Jimmy McPartland and moving on down from there." ...|$|E
500|$|The Veddas {{who have}} kept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> culture of Sri Lanka do not {{subscribe}} to Kataragama deviyo as their deity. Unassimilated Veddas consider Kande Yakka or Gale Yakka (Lord of the Rock) as their primarily deity to be propitiated before hunts. They propitiate the deity {{by building a}} shrine made out of thatched leaves with a lance or arrow planted {{in the middle of}} the structure. They dance around the shrine with the shaman becoming possessed with the spirits of the dead ancestors who guide the hunting party in techniques and places to go hunt. Anthropologist Charles Gabriel Seligman felt that the Kataragama deviyo cult has taken on some aspects of the Kande Yakka rituals and traditions. A clan of Veddas who lived near to the shrine was known as Kovil Vanam (Temple precincts). As a clan they are extinct but were to be found in the eastern province during the 19th century. [...] Local Veddas believed that the nearby mountain peak of Vaedihitti Kande (The Mountain of Veddas) was the abode of the deity. The deity after coming over the shore married a local Vedda woman named Valli, a daughter of a Vedda chief and resided in the mountain. Eventually he was coaxed into settling down at the current location.|$|E
5000|$|An {{economic}} bill {{of rights}} was never passed, and leaders spoke with regret about the occupation. SCLC director Bill Rutherford described the campaign as the movement's [...] "Little Bighorn."

2500|$|The Hugh Hewitt Award, {{introduced}} in June 2008 and {{named after a}} man Sullivan described as an [...] "absurd partisan fanatic", was for the most egregious attempts to label Barack Obama as un-American, alien, treasonous, and far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> of American life and politics.|$|E
2500|$|Students {{were taught}} through reading treatises, {{approximately}} two hours worth of recitations each morning, and a mandatory moot court program. Caruthers considered the law a {{science and the}} Socratic Method a necessity. The cost was $50 a session and a $5 [...] "contingent fee". After the Civil War, this treatise method, the legal formalism of the school's approach, and Nathan Green Jr.'s unwillingness to make changes, were all considered reasons for Cumberland's drift <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Beatnik" [...] {{was coined}} by Herb Caen of the San Francisco Chronicle on April 2, 1958, a {{portmanteau}} {{on the name}} of the recent Russian satellite Sputnik and Beat Generation. This suggested that beatniks were (1) [...] "far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> of society" [...] and (2) [...] "possibly pro-Communist." [...] Caen's term stuck and became the popular label associated with a new stereotype—the man with a goatee and beret reciting nonsensical poetry and playing bongo drums while free-spirited women wearing black leotards dance.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{peoples who}} {{settled in the}} Levant had traditions that may connect them to Crete: the Tjeker and the Peleset. The Tjeker may have left Crete to settle in Anatolia, and left there to settle Dor. According to the Old Testament, the Israelite God brought <b>the</b> Philistines <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Caphtor. <b>The</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>of</b> Biblical and {{classical}} scholarship accepts Caphtor to refer to Crete, but there are alternative minority theories.

50|$|The fat {{acceptance}} {{movement has}} been criticised {{from a number of}} perspectives.

2500|$|Many Hokkien-speaking {{immigrants}} entered Taiwan {{during the}} 1750s, {{and with them}} they brought puppet theatre. The stories were based mainly on classical books and stage dramas, and were very refined. Artistry focused on {{the complexity of the}} puppet movements. [...] Musical accompaniment was generally Nanguan and Beiguan music. According to the Records of Taiwan Province, Nanguan was the earliest form of puppet theatre in Taiwan. Although this kind of puppet theatre fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream,</b> it can still be found in a few troupes around Taipei today.|$|E
2500|$|Dirac's {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) made {{predictions}} that were – {{more often than}} not – infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as renormalisation was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. [...] "I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation", he said in 1975, [...] "because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small – not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!" [...] His refusal to accept renormalisation resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Wray wrote {{three of}} the {{collection}} films celebrated in Martin Scorsese’s 2007 documentary film , two of them groundbreaking screenplays that helped define the genre of the psychological thriller and establish Lewton's reputation as the master of horror. [...] In Wray, Lewton found a writer with a gift for character development who was also {{willing to take on}} challenging or controversial subject matter: the supernatural, a serial killer, the plagues of war and superstition, and the relationships in the notorious Borgia family -- all were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> when Wray sat down to write about them. [...] Her ability to seduce 1940's audiences into following Lewton down a path to some of the darker corners of human experience was evident in the unexpected critical and box office success of those films.|$|E

25|$|Morgan {{was forced}} by post-lingual {{deafness}} {{as an early}} teen to communicate by letters throughout his professional life. This effort created a written network for scholars interested in Western American themes. Vast stores of correspondence indicate his willingness to help another writer or scholar, to provide information on sources and materials, or offer advice on projects. Many emerging scholars, particularly those <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic <b>mainstream,</b> considered him a mentor. As a result, Morgan stood in <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> a scholarly group of literary figures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1930s through 1960s involved in history and biography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American West. These individuals included Juanita Brooks, Fawn Brodie, Bernard DeVoto, Charles Kelly, J. Roderic Korns, A. Russell Mortensen, William Mulder, and Harold Schindler.|$|R
2500|$|Fleetwood himself later {{remarked on}} the growing stature of Green's difficulties: [...] "I think there is {{certainly}} some credence given {{to the idea that}} Peter's condition could in some way be blamed on a bad acid trip he had in Germany...

[...] He also recalled in 1995 that [...] "Peter basically ceased to see the light with Fleetwood Mac and had aspirations of playing for nothing in strange places—none of which really happened. He made several interesting albums after he left, then basically took a left turn in terms of his psyche. He pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> and chose to stay at home. He doesn't play much anymore, which is certainly a shame, because he's my mentor, and he's the reason that Fleetwood Mac became what we became." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although REZ {{had been}} left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> success which arguably the band had spearheaded for others, REZ was {{nevertheless}} more interested in using its music to speak plainly to both non-Christians about the reality of God and to Christians about their responsibility to the disenfranchised and hurting {{in the world around}} them. [...] To that end, REZ returned to the studio in 1988, and the result was Silence Screams, a hybrid of blues, hard rock and heavy metal that served as a musical blueprint for all of the band's successive releases. [...] Sporting unsettling cover art, Silence Screams deals forcefully with social concerns such as abortion, greed, racial profiling and even terrorism, proving that—as they did with confronting apartheid in 1979—the band was once again ahead of the curve. [...] The album is also unique in that it is the first to have been released on the band's own record label, Grrr Records, a wordplay on Myrrh Records, the most successful Contemporary Christian record label at that time. [...] Now, the band could exercise complete creative and financial control over their music.|$|E
