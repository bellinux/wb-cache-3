50|$|Perfluoroalkanes do not bioaccumulate; {{those used}} in medical {{procedures}} are rapidly excreted from the body, primarily via expiration with the rate of excretion {{as a function of}} the vapour pressure; the half-life for <b>octafluoropropane</b> is less than 2 minutes, compared to about a week for perfluorodecalin.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the fluorocarbon industry coincided with World War II. Prior to that, fluorocarbons were prepared by reaction of fluorine with the hydrocarbon, i.e., direct fluorination. Because C-C bonds are readily cleaved by fluorine, direct fluorination mainly affords smaller perfluorocarbons, such as tetrafluoromethane, hexafluoroethane, and <b>octafluoropropane.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{the high}} {{electronegativity}} of fluorine reduces the polarizability of the atom, fluorocarbons are only weakly {{susceptible to the}} fleeting dipoles that {{form the basis of}} the London dispersion force. As a result, fluorocarbons have low intermolecular attractive forces and are lipophobic in addition to being hydrophobic and non-polar. Reflecting the weak intermolecular forces these compounds exhibit low viscosities when compared to liquids of similar boiling points, low surface tension and low heats of vaporization. The low attractive forces in fluorocarbon liquids make them compressible (low bulk modulus) and able to dissolve gas relatively well. Smaller fluorocarbons are extremely volatile. There are five perfluoroalkane gases; tetrafluoromethane (bp −128 °C), hexafluoroethane (bp −78.2 °C), <b>octafluoropropane</b> (bp −36.5 °C), perfluoro-n-butane (bp −2.2 °C) and perfluoro-iso-butane (bp −1 °C). Nearly all other fluoroalkanes are liquids; the most notable exception is perfluorocyclohexane, which sublimes at 51 °C. Fluorocarbons also have low surface energies and high dielectric strengths.|$|E

40|$|It is a now {{well-established}} {{fact that}} chlorofluorohydrocarbons, once emitted to the atmosphere, {{can lead to}} ozone depletion in the stratosphere due to their long atmospheric life times. When looking for new candidates for replacing the chlorofluorohydrocarbons (CFC) as refrigerants partly fluorinated hydrocarbons (HFC) and mixtures of these have been proposed. These substances are said {{not to participate in}} ozone degradation and - hydrogen being only partly substituted - show reduced atmospheric life time. Components with higher hydrogen content, however, tend to be combustible at atmospheric conditions. To prevent this to occur, mixtures made up of HFC have come to life as promising candidates. In some earlier papers, flammability limits and minimum ignition energies have been reported for pure and mixed HFC [l- 41. All these mixtures, however, imply only partly fluorinated candidates. Therefore, {{it would be interesting to}} investigate the flammabilitybehavior of a fully fluorinated compound (FC) mixed with a nonhalogenated compound and compare it to the above-mentioned. In some recent papers, mixtures including a FC have been discussed as a possible candidate for refrigeration application [5, 6].

Case presentation A 45 -year-old man complained of blurred vision, and ophthalmoscopy revealed a retinal detachment and retinoschisis extending from an optic disc pit through the macula in his left eye. He was diagnosed with optic disc pit maculopathy, and vitrectomy was performed. A posterior vitreous detachment was created, glial tissue at the optic pit was removed, and <b>octafluoropropane</b> (C 3 F 8) was injected as a gas tamponade. The retinal detachment and retinoschisis disappeared after six months, and vision improved to 20 / 20 without any visual field defects (Goldmann perimetry). A cataractous lens was extracted 2 years after the vitrectomy, and vision has remained 20 / 20 for 10 years without any recurrence.

40|$|The {{toxicological}} assessment of air samples returned {{at the end}} of the STS- 100 (6 A) flight to the ISS is reported. ISS air samples were taken in March and April 2001 from the Service Module, FGB, and U. S. Laboratory using grab sample canisters (GSCs) and/or formaldehyde badges. An unplanned "first-entry" sample of the MPLM 2 (multipurpose logistics module) atmosphere was taken with a GSC, and preflight and end-of-mission samples were obtained from Endeavour using GSCs. Analytical methods have not changed from earlier reports, and all quality control measures were met for the data presented herein. The two general criteria used to assess air quality are the total-non-methane-volatile organic hydrocarbons (NMVOCs) and the total T-value (minus the CO 2 and formaldehyde contribution). Because of the Freon 218 (<b>octafluoropropane,</b> OFP) leak, its contribution to the NMVOC is indicated in brackets. When comparing the NMVOC values with the 25 mg/cubic m guideline, the OFP contributions should be subtracted.

40|$|Superheated {{emulsion}} detectors are suspensions of metastable liquid droplets in a compliant inert medium. Upon {{interaction with}} ionizing radiation, the droplets evaporate, generating visible bubbles. Bubble expansion {{associated with the}} boiling of the droplets is accompanied by pressure pulses in both the sonic and ultrasonic frequency range. In this work, we analyzed the signal generated by bubble evaporation in the frequency and time domain. We used <b>octafluoropropane</b> (R- 218) based emulsions, sensitive to both photons and neutrons. The frequency content of the detected pulses appears to extend well into the hundreds of kHz, beyond the range used in commercial devices to count bubbles as they are formed (typically 1 - 10 kHz). Kilohertz components characterize {{the early part of}} the waveforms, potentially containing information about the energetics of the explosive bubble initial growth phase. The power spectral density of the acoustic signal produced by neutron-induced evaporation shows a characteristic frequency pattern in the 200 - 400 kHz range, which is not observed when bubbles evaporate upon gamma ray-induced irradiation. For practical applications, detection of ultrasonic pulses associated with the boiling of the superheated drops can be exploited as a fast readout method, negligibly affected by mechanical ambient noise...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{fluorocarbon}} thin filmsweredepositedonthe surfaceofwhite spruce andBrazilian cedarwoods via {{atmospheric pressure}} dielectric barrier discharge in the afterglow mode with <b>octafluoropropane</b> gas. A pretreatment with oxygen plasma was introduced before the thin film deposition {{to determine if}} this plasma condition could increase the wood nano/micro roughness, helping to improve the hydrophobicity of the surface. The optimal conditions of water repellency for both woods were examined {{in terms of their}} resistance to aging in controlled conditions. The water contact angle measurements showed a hydrophobic surface with a stable angle for both woods. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the presence of CF, CF 2 and CF 3 functional groups after the Ar/C 3 F 8 plasma, especially for longer treatments. The open-air system of the plasma reactor leads to the simultaneous fluorination and incorporation of oxygen-containing groups. The pre-treatment of oxygen plasma increases the wood roughness; however, the chemical attachment of oxygen molecules is more significant, negatively affecting the degree of repellency of the plasma-coated woods. On the other hand, the fluorocarbon deposition increases the wood roughness and creates a hydrophobic surface simultaneously. Even with partial defluorination after aging, both plasma-coated woods retain a similar degree of water repellency, which partially avoid chemical reorganization of their surface due to environmental exposure. 201...|$|E
40|$|Fluorocarbon (FC) {{films have}} been {{deposited}} using pulsed and continuous wave (cw) radio frequency (rf) plasmas fed with hexafluoroethane (C 2 F 6), <b>octafluoropropane</b> (C 3 F 8), or octafluorocyclobutane (C 4 F 8). The effects of feed gases used, discharge pressure, rf power, substrate positions and discharge modes (pulsed or cw) on the deposited films are examined. Film properties are determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and static contact angle measurements. The contact angles of FC films are well {{related to their}} compositions and structures. Feed gases used, discharge pressure, rf power, substrate positions and discharge modes strongly affect the morphology of the resulting film, as revealed by atomic force microscopy. Optical emission spectrometry measurements were performed to in-situ characterize the gas-phase compositions of the plasmas and radicals' emission intensities during film deposition. Correlations between film properties, gas-phase plasma diagnostic data, and film growth processes were discussed. The film growth in pulsed or downstream plasmas was controlled by the surface migration of radicals, such as CF 2 towards nucleation centers, which result in the deposition of FC films with less cross-linked nature and rougher surfaces. These results demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to control film compositions and surface structure by changing deposition parameters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Surrogate standard recoveries from the SSAS tubes were 66 - 76 % for 13 C-acetone, 85 - 96 % for fluorobenzene, and 73 - 89 % for chlorobenzene. Post-flight flows were far below pre-flight flows and {{an investigation of the}} problem revealed that the reduced flow was caused by a leak at the interface of the pump inlet tube and the pump head. This resulted in degradation of pump efficiency. Further investigation showed that the problem occurred before the SSAS was operated on orbit and that use of the post-flight flows yielded consistent and useful results. Recoveries from formaldehyde control badges were 86 to 104 %. The two general criteria used to assess air quality are the total-non-methane-volatile organic hydrocarbons (NMVOCs) and the total T-value (minus the CO 2 and formaldehyde contributions). The T values will not be reported for these data due to the flow anomaly. Control of atmospheric alcohols is important to the water recovery system engineers, hence total alcohols (including acetone) are also shown for each sample. <b>Octafluoropropane</b> (OFP) is not efficiently trapped by the sorbents used in the SSAS.

40|$|We {{describe}} a combined ultrasonic instrument for continuous gas flow measurement and simultaneous real-time binary gas mixture analysis. In the instrument, sound bursts are transmitted in opposite directions, {{which may be}} aligned with the gas flow path or {{at an angle to}} it, the latter configuration being the best adapted to high flow rates. The combined flow measurement and mixture analysis algorithm exploits the phenomenon whereby the sound velocity in a binary gas mixture at known temperature and pressure is a unique function of the molar concentration of the two components. The instrument is central to a possible upgrade to the present ATLAS silicon tracker cooling system in which <b>octafluoropropane</b> (C F) evaporative cooling fluid would be replaced by a blend containing up to 25 % hexafluoroethane (C 2 F 6). The instrument has been developed in two geometries following computational fluid dynamics studies of various mechanical layouts. An instrument with 45 crossing angle has been installed for commissioning in the ATLAS silicon tracker cooling system. It can be used in gas flows up to 20 000 l. min- 1 and has demonstrated a flow resolution of 2. 3 % of full scale for linear flow velocities up to 10 m. s in preliminary studies with air. Other instruments are currently used to detect low levels of C 2 F 8 vapor leaking into the N 2 environmental gas surrounding the ATLAS silicon tracker.

40|$|Space-faring crews {{must have}} safe {{breathing}} air throughout their missions to ensure adequate performance and good health. Toxicological assessment of air quality {{depends on the}} standards that define acceptable air quality, measurements of pollutant levels during the flight, and reports from the crew on their in-flight perceptions of air quality. Air samples returned from ISS on flights 8 A, UF 2, 9 A, and 11 A were analyzed for trace pollutants. On average, the air {{during this period of}} operations was safe for human respiration. However, about 3 hours into the regeneration of 2 Metox canisters in the U. S. airlock on 20 February 2002 the crew reported an intolerable odor that caused them to stop the regeneration, take refuge in the Russian segment, and scrub air in the U. S. segment for 30 hours. Analytical data from grab samples taken during the incident showed that the pollutants released were characteristic of nominal air pollutants, but were present in much higher concentrations. The odors reported by the crew were due to relatively high concentrations of n-butanol, and possibly other pollutants in the mixture. Later data taken during regeneration of Metox canisters that had not been subject to long-term flows showed minimal effects on air quality. Long-term trending data suggest that a disruption in atmospheric mixing between the Service Module and the U. S. Laboratory has occurred and that formaldehyde concentrations are gradually increasing in the U. S. Laboratory. Trending data also show that the releases of <b>octafluoropropane</b> (OFP) have subsided...|$|E
40|$|TiO 2 -assisted {{photocatalytic}} oxidation (PCO) is {{an emerging}} technology for {{indoor air quality}} control and is also being evaluated as an alternative trace contaminant control technology for crew habitats in space exploration. Though there exists a vast range of literature {{on the development of}} photocatalysts and associated reactor systems, including catalyst performance and performance-influencing factors, the critical question of whether photocatalysts can sustain their initial catalytic activity {{over an extended period of}} operation has not been adequately addressed. For a catalyst to effectively serve as an air quality control product, it must be rugged enough to withstand exposure to a multitude of low concentration volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over long periods of time with minimal loss of activity. The objective of this study was to determine the functional lifetime of a promising photocatalyst - the silica-titania composite (STC) from Sol Gel Solutions, LLC in a real-world scenario. A bench-scale STC-packed annular reactor under continuous irradiation by a UV-A fluorescent black-light blue lamp ((lambda) max = 365 nm) was exposed to laboratory air continuously at an apparent contact time of 0. 27 sand challenged with a known concentration of ethanol periodically to assess any changes in catalytic activity. Laboratory air was also episodically spiked with halocarbons (e. g., <b>octafluoropropane),</b> organosulfur compounds (e. g., sulfur hexafluoride), and organosilicons (e. g., siloxanes) to simulate accidental releases or leaks of such VOCs. Total organic carbon (TOC) loading and contaminant profiles of the laboratory air were also monitored.

40|$|The ATLAS silicon tracker {{community}} foresees {{an upgrade}} {{from the present}} <b>octafluoropropane</b> (C 3 F 8) evaporative cooling fluid to a composite fluid with a probable 10 - 20 % admixture of hexafluoroethane (C 2 F 6). Such a fluid will allow a lower evaporation temperature and will afford the tracker silicon substrates a better safety margin against leakage current-induced thermal runaway caused by cumulative radiation damage as the luminosity profile at the CERN Large Hadron Collider increases. Central {{to the use of}} this new fluid is a new custom-developed speed-of-sound instrument for continuous real-time measurement of the C 3 F 8 /C 2 F 6 mixture ratio and flow. An acoustic vapour mixture analyzer/flow meter with new custom electronics allowing ultrasonic frequency transmission through gas mixtures has been developed for this application. Synchronous with the emission of an ultrasound `chirp' from an acoustic transmitter, a fast readout clock (40 MHz) is started. The clock is stopped on receipt of an above threshold sound pulse at the receiver. Sound is alternately transmitted parallel and anti-parallel with the vapour flow for volume flow measurement from transducers that can serve as acoustic transmitters or receivers. In the development version, continuous real-time measurement of C 3 F 8 /C 2 F 6 flow and calculation of the mixture ratio is performed within a graphical user interface developed in PVSS-II, the Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition standard chosen for LHC and its experiments at CERN.

Because formaldehyde is quantified from sorbent badges, its concentration is listed separately. The table shows that the air quality in general was acceptable for crew respiration; however, certain values shown in bold require further explanation. The 1. 05 T value on 2 / 28 / 02 was caused by an unusually high measurement ofhexamethylcyc 1 otrisiloxane (T value = 0. 50), which is not a concern. The MPLM T value of 1. 42 and the alcohol level of 7. 5 mg/cu m were due to an overall polluted atmosphere, which was expected at first entry. The major T-value component was carbon monoxide at a contribution of 0. 44 units. Since the crew was only exposed momentarily to the polluted atmosphere, no health effects are expected. The formaldehyde value of 0. 060 mg/cu m found in the Lab sample from 3 / 27 / 02 is cause for concern because the Lab consistently shows higher concentrations of formaldehyde than the SM and occasionally the concentrations are above the acceptable guideline.

Pre-industrial background values of 34. 7 ± 0. 2 ppt CF 4 and 0. 1 ± 0. 02 ppt C 2 F 6 were measured in air extracted from Greenland ice and Antarctic firn. Anthropogenic sources {{are thought to be}} primary aluminum production (CF 4, C 2 F 6, C 3 F 8), semiconductor production (C 2 F 6, CF 4, C 3 F 8) and refrigeration use (C 3 F 8).

The sum of CF 4 and C 2 F 6 emissions estimated from aluminum production and non-metal production are lower than observed global top-down emissions, with gaps of ~ 6 Gg/yr CF 4 in recent years. The significant discrepancies between previous CF 4, C 2 F 6, and C 3 F 8 emission estimates and observed global top-down emissions estimated from AGAGE measurements emphasize the need for more accurate, transparent, and complete emission reporting, and for verification with atmospheric measurements to assess the emission sources of these long-lived and potent greenhouse gases, which alter the radiative budget of the atmosphere, essentially permanently, once emitted.

Surrogate standard recoveries from the GSCs were 79 - 120 % except {{as noted in the}} table. One sample was returned with the valve opened. The two general criteria used to assess air quality are the total-non-methane-volatile organic hydrocarbons (NMVOCs) and the total T-value (minus the CO 2 and formaldehyde contributions). Control of atmospheric alcohols is important to the water recovery system engineers, hence total alcohols (including acetone) are also shown for each sample. <b>Octafluoropropane</b> (OFP) has leaked from heat-exchange units in large quantities, so its concentration is tracked separately. Because formaldehyde is quantified from sorbent badges, its concentration is also listed separately. The table shows that the air quality in general was acceptable for crew respiration through the middle of December 2002. No conclusions can be made about the air quality after that date due to NASA's inability to return air samples from the ISS. Alcohols are not being controlled to the recently lowered guideline of 5 mg/m 3, which was recommended to protect the water recovery systems. The airlock sample was taken during the regeneration of Met ox canisters in the adjacent Node. The trace pollutants were not increased above background; however, inspection of table 1 in the appendix shows a CO 2 concentration of 17, 000 mg/cu m, which is a relatively high concentration, but still below the 24 -hour SMAC of 23, 000 mg/cu m. The control of OFP continues to be adequate at least through December 2002. Formaldehyde concentrations suggest that the high levels that were being found in the Lab atmosphere have subsided. This is probably attributable to the restoration of IMV in early February 2003. Before the obstructing material was removed from ducts the Lab formaldehyde concentrations approached 0. 06 mg/cu m, whereas after the repair the levels were near 0. 04 mg/m 3. This does not mean that local sources in the Lab have been reduced, only that the excess of formaldehyde produced in the Lab is distributed into the whole volume of the ISS...|$|E
40|$|Freezing and ablating using {{cryosurgery}} {{is becoming}} a promising surgical tool {{for the treatment of}} tumours. For improving the efficiency of the cryosurgical procedure, different approaches have been implemented till now. Most of these techniques have focussed on the freezing process, without giving adequate attention to the damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. In this study, a novel concept is proposed which achieves the desired freezing while protecting the surrounding healthy tissue through the use of low thermal conductivity liquid layer (perfluorocarbons) around the interface of the tumour. Numerical modelling has been done to determine the location of the ice fronts in the presence of this perfluorocarbon layer around the boundary of the tumour. It is noticed that this method leads to a higher ablation rate substantially reducing the surgical time. Also, an optimal offset, i. e. the minimum distance between the tip of the cryoprobe and the boundary of the tumour, is identified for a given tumour radius and active length which gives maximum tumour necrosis in minimum time. It is also observed that for a 2 mm increase in the active length of the cryoprobe, the decrease in optimal offset is approximately 1 mm. Furthermore, for the tumour with different radii (between 10 mm and 15 mm), with same active length of the cryoprobe, the time taken for complete ablation of the larger tumour is nearly 2. 7 times the time taken for the smaller one for every 2. 5 mm increase in the tumour radius. The results also reveal that there exists an optimal thickness of the perfluorohexane layer around the tumour interface. It is also seen that among perfluorohexane, <b>octafluoropropane</b> and water, perfluorohexane acts as the best substitute for the formation of an insulating layer around the tumour interface. Experiments have been performed to prepare pefluorocarbon (perfluorohexane and perfluorodecalin) emulsions in varied concentration (i. e. 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 % (w/v)) through probe sonication. Further, this study reports the particle size, emulsion stability, functional group analysis, thermophysical properties of both perfluorodecalin and perfluorohexane emulsions. With regard to thermal conductivity, it is observed that perfluorodecalin emulsions possess a marginally lower thermal conductivity than perfluorohexane emulsions. It {{is interesting to note that}} during cryosurgery of gel phantom in the presence of low thermal conductivity perfluorodecalin emulsion (90 % (w/v)), it is observed that the freezing front is not able to penetrate the gel while in its absence, there is a temperature of 4 oC at the same thermocouple location of 10 mm (in the axial direction). Cryosurgery of glycine-containing gels is carried out in presence and absence of perfluorohexane layer, and the thermal history is measured using K-type thermocouples connected to a data acquisition system. The presence of glycine causes rapid freezing during cryosurgery with an ice ball depth of 16 mm, while with a perfluorohexane layer at this gel interface, this depth is 13 mm, indicating the ability of this layer to limit freezing. In this study, alumina has also been utilised for the preparation of adjuvant containing gel phantoms. After cryosurgery, it is clearly evident that a temperature decrease is observed in the alumina consisiting gel phantoms when compared to the agarose gel phantoms. It is also noticed that with the increase in insertion depth of the cryoprobe (from 1 to 1. 5 cm), there is a decrease in temperature at each thermocouple location in the gel phantoms. This study also demonstrates that in the presence of perfluorohexane layer, when the alumina consisting gel phantoms are cryosurgically cooled; even with the increase in insertion depth, the thermocouple placed axially at 10 mm which is inside the perfluorohexane solution layer indicates a temperature of 25 oC. However, in its absence, the temperature is found to be 5 : 47 oC at the same position, suggesting that the freezing is limited within the gel. Furthermore, this work also proposes a new approach that utilises glycine-alumina emulsions as an adjuvant. After cryosurgery of glycine-alumina containing gel, a substantial temperature decrease is observed at all thermocouples placed nearer to the probe, thus indicating an enhancement in freezing. In conclusion, this study proposes novel approaches to improve the cryosurgical procedure through numerical modelling and experiments in gel phantoms, thus, providing newer approaches to improve the cryosurgical outcome...|$|E
