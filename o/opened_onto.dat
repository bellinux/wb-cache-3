5|$|Isaac Ellwood's 1898-1899 renovations were superficial, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the alterations his son made to the original design a decade later. He had the bracketed cornice replaced with a Classical cornice with dentils and a projecting molding. The window lintels were altered in a style similar to the new cornice. On the tower, the two windows on the first floor were replaced with one larger window while the projecting bay over the east portico was removed and made flush {{with the rest of the}} house. The windows over that portico were replaced with a heavy double door that <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> the roof over the veranda, which had been built over the entire front of the house. It was during this time that the first porte-cochere was built on the south side of the home.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (n√©e Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, the front entrance <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> a square entrance hall. A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the entrance hall were used as office space. A broad staircase led from the entrance hall up to the second floor, where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting the second floor to be opened up into something approaching a single large ballroom. The windows on the second floor reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire second floor. The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained much the same as it always had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E

One of its doors <b>opens</b> <b>onto</b> the street, while the two other <b>open</b> <b>onto</b> the inner courtyard of the mosque. The library is undergoing repairs, and the books are under protection at the Suleymaniye Library.|$|R
5|$|Structure C8 is a {{residential}} compound that was accessed from the alley {{running to the}} East Plaza from behind Pyramid C1. The entrance <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> the alley from a patio situated in the southern portion of the compound. This patio was surrounded on the east, west and north sides by rooms, with the alley to the south. It was floored with stucco and Structure C8 was the only stuccoed residential building {{in the whole of}} the city. The north range of rooms backed directly onto the ravine immediately to the north of Group C; the lower portion of the walls of the west room and of half of the north room still stand. The west room was square while the north room was narrow and probably extended the entire width of the patio. Wear marks in the stucco floor indicate that a door once accessed the north room from the west. The workmanship of Structure C8 was of very high quality and indicates that it was the residence of a member of the city's elite. Its proximity to the large pyramid-temple C1 has led archaeologist Henri Lehmann to speculate that it was once the house of the high priest.|$|E
5|$|The central aisle had {{a higher}} ceiling than the side-aisles. Light was {{provided}} by clerestory windows in {{the upper part of}} the central hall. It is also possible that an apse stood at the eastern wall of the Stoa. Josephus describes the columns as Corinthian in style and Corinthian capitals have indeed been found in excavations along the mount's southern wall, as well as reused in later Roman, Byzantine and Islamic structures. The ceilings were ornamented with deeply cut wood-carvings while other parts of the interior were apparently covered with stucco. The southernmost row of columns was incorporated into the southern wall of the Temple mount, while the northern side <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> the plaza in the middle of which stood the Temple. From the outside, the southern wall was distinguished from the retaining wall of the platform by a series of pilasters running along the length of the superstructure. The main entry to the Stoa from the city was via a monumental staircase which led up from the Tyropoeon Valley and then across Robinson's Arch, passing over the street and shops below.|$|E
25|$|In 1774, when Squire fled a ransacked house, he ran {{straight}} into {{several members of}} the local constabulary and was arrested for highway robbery. This was actually a lucky break. By escaping through the front door, which <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> the highway, he avoided a more serious charge of stealing. Although Squire was sentenced to be transported to America for 7 years, he elected to serve in the army and returned to Kingston as a free man within 4 years.|$|E

25|$|Built before modern {{artificial}} ventilation, {{the building}} {{was designed to maximize}} air circulation: all offices not only had exterior windows, but also <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> the court, which was designed to admit cool air at ground level and exhaust hot air at the roof. Made of brick and tile, the stairs were designed for the limitations of disabled and aging veterans, having a gradual ascent with low steps. In addition, each step slanted slightly from back to front to allow easy drainage: a flight could be washed easily by pouring water from the top.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{inmates were}} housed in cells {{that could only}} be {{accessed}} by entering through a small exercise yard attached {{to the back of the}} prison; only a small portal, just large enough to pass meals, <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> the cell blocks. This design proved impractical, and in the middle of construction, cells were constructed that allowed prisoners to enter and leave the cell blocks through metal doors that were covered by a heavy wooden door to filter out noise. The halls were designed to have the feel of a church.|$|E
25|$|The {{windows and}} {{front door of}} Bag End were round, a typical feature of hobbit-architecture. Its tunnels and rooms, also typically, were all built on one level. However, only lavish smials like Bag End had many rooms and cellars, with {{high-quality}} fixtures, fittings, and furniture. Its front door (on the south) and the porthole-like windows (all on the west) <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> Bag End's lawns and gardens, the Party Field, and the distant countryside beyond. The main entrance sat {{on the end of}} a gated path at the end of a lane leading from the Hill Road.|$|E

25|$|The Shanyang Canal {{originally}} <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> the Yangtze a {{short distance}} south of Yangzhou. As {{the north shore of}} the Yangtze gradually silted up to create the sandbank island of Guazhou, it became necessary for boats crossing to and from the Jiangnan Canal to sail the long way around the eastern edge of that island. After a particularly rough crossing of the Yangtze from Zhenjiang, the local prefect realised that a canal dug directly across Guazhou would slash the journey time and so make the crossing safer. The Yilou Canal was opened in 738 AD and still exists, though not as part of the modern Grand Canal route.|$|E
25|$|By mid-afternoon, {{thousands}} of Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus had {{gathered in the}} Jallianwala Bagh (garden) near the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar. Many who were present had earlier worshipped at the Golden Temple, and were passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and is) an open area of six to seven acres, roughly 200 yards by 200 yards in size, and surrounded by walls roughly 10 feet in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> it, several with locked gates. During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting-area and playground {{for much of the}} year. In the center of the Bagh was a samadhi (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water and about 20 feet in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Along the {{southwest}} {{side of the}} peristyle, is the 2nd largest room in the Palace, the cenatio (or Triclinium) or Banqueting Room. Like the Aula Regia, it was extravagantly decorated, with several tiers of columns in exotic marbles and a frieze. It <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> two courtyards with oval fountains {{to the north and}} south visible from the windows of the dining room. The centre of the southern wall of the hall has an apse surrounded by two passages which allow access to the library of the temple of Apollo. The floor of the hall is covered with marble concealing a hypocaust whose bricks date from the reign of Maxentius. This heating system suggests that this hall served as a banqueting hall in the winter and has been identified with the Cenatio Iovis mentioned in ancient literary sources.|$|E

25|$|The {{art gallery}} was another extravagance of Strousberg's for {{the display of}} his {{painting}} and sculpture collection. East of the gallery, the Billiards room provided a convenient entertaining room, which led back through the walnut paneled dining room to either the drawing room or into the library. Above the library's panelling, which was again carved from walnut, were murals and a skylight set into the ceiling. At night this room, like the others, was lit by gas light. The rest of the Palais's ground floor accommodation served as anterooms and work rooms for the Ambassador. Above the small windows of the Servants' quarters in the basement; {{the windows of the}} great hall, its anteroom and the portrait gallery, stood more than 3 metres tall, overlooking and visually connected the rooms with each other and the gardens in the large courtyard. The facades that faced onto this courtyard were given a unifying treatment with Corinthian columns dividing the glazing. Originally it was open to the west, where a curved terrace <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> a garden. Its location can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. Its plan shape can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. The terrace was adjacent to the garden of the Palais Redern and effectively extended the small garden of the Palais Strousberg into the generous garden of the Palais Redern.|$|E

500|$|In 1123, {{the area}} near Aldersgate was granted by King Henry I for the {{foundation}} of St Bartholomew's Priory {{at the request of}} Prior Rahere in thanks for his being nursed back to good health. The Priory exercised its right to enclose land between Aldersgate (to the east), Long Lane (to the north) and modern-day Newgate Street (to the south), erecting its main western gate which <b>opened</b> <b>onto</b> Smithfield, and a postern on Long Lane. The Priory thereafter held the manorial rights to hold weekly fairs, which initially took place in its outer court on the site of present-day Cloth Fair, leading to [...] "Fair Gate".|$|E

500|$|Beatles biographer Bob Spitz {{described}} Starkey's upbringing as [...] "a Dickensian {{chronicle of}} misfortune".

[...] Crawford commented: [...] "Like all of the families {{who lived in the}} Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive." [...] The children who lived there spent much of their time at Princes Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in {{one of the oldest and}} poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool. Starkey later commented: [...] "You kept your head down, your eyes open, and you didn't get in anybody's way." ...|$|E
