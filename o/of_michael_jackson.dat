25|$|According to Ne-Yo, {{the idea}} for the album emerged from three influences: his desire to do {{something}} different instead of a standard compilation; his interest in science fiction, comic books and Japanese animation; and inspiration from the works <b>of</b> <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson,</b> particularly Thriller, Moonwalker, and Bad. Originally a short movie was to accompany the album, but such proved not to be viable given time and monetary constraints, so Ne-Yo chose to develop a series of six extended music videos instead. Nevertheless, the film concept continues to influence the work, as he has stated the songs on the album are inspired by the script of the film that he wrote. The album features a number of songs which follow the story of Jerome and Pretti Sinclair.|$|E
