50|$|Vacuum {{pumps are}} {{combined}} with chambers and operational procedures {{into a wide}} variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in series or in parallel) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a positive displacement pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive displacement pump). Some examples might be use of an <b>oil</b> <b>sealed</b> rotary vane pump (the most common positive displacement pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump. There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.|$|E

Santa Ines pluriparous sheep (n= 5) were synchronized with intravaginal devices containing 0. 3 mg progesterone (CIDR®, Pfizer, Netherlands) for 10 days. Thirty-six hours prior to progesterone device removal and follicular aspiration, 0. 04 mg d-cloprostenol sodium (Ciosin®, Coopers, Brasil), 200 IU FSH (Folltropin®, Bioniche, Canada) and 300 IU eCG (Novormon®, Syntex, Argentina) were administered intramuscularly. Oocyte retrieval was performed via mid-ventral laparotomy, under general anesthesia. The oocytes were evaluated and classified under a stereomicroscope and placed in cryovials with TCM 199, aerated with 5 % CO 2, covered with mineral <b>oil,</b> <b>sealed,</b> wrapped with parafilm and stored in a transport incubator at 38. 5 °C. Oocytes were then transported via the road for 14 h to the laboratory, where the oocytes then completed more than 10 h of IVM.

40|$|SOME {{factors that}} {{influence}} albumen quality changes during storage of shell eggs have long been known. Tem-perature control and, to some extent, evaporation control {{have been used as}} methods of preserving quality. Reduction of carbon dioxide loss from the albumen and the prevention of evaporation have been made possible by sealing the shell with oil. Oil processing has been success-ful in reducing albumen liquefaction, but undesirable side effects have been found. Fletcher et al. (1959) report that oil treated eggs pick up foreign flavors readily and that the process tends to lower quality. Swanson (1959) reports that these eggs do not peel well after hard cooking. The relationship between the rise in pH of the albumen and albumen liquefac-tion was reported by Sharp (1929). This rise is caused by release of carbon dioxide from the egg. He found that this could be prevented by holding eggs in an atmos-phere containing higher than normal con-centrations of carbon dioxide or by plac-ing freshly laid eggs in a carbon-dioxide-tight container in which the carbon di-oxide content of the eggs quickly reaches equilibrium with that of the surrounding atmosphere.

40|$|LecturePg. 41 - 50 The {{cause and}} effects of a large subsynchronous {{vibration}} (3. 5 mils at 3490 cpm) in an FCC wet gas compressor are examined. The compressor is driven at 7850 rpm by a 6000 hp electric motor, through a speed-increasing gearbox, and compresses hydrocarbon gases from 20 psig to 235 psig. A rotordynarnic analysis of the compressor determined {{that even though the}} compressor had a long history (approximately 25 years) of smooth operation (overall amplitudes less than 0. 5 mils), it had a very low margin of stability. This lack of stability was caused by a high bearing to shaft stiffness ratio as well as destabilizing forces in the balance piston and shaft seals. The pressure dam bearing design is not destabilizing to the rotor system because the journal is very heavily loaded; however, the high direct stiffness that is produced reduces the effective damping of the system. Labyrinth and <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> are usually not considered to have large effects on a compressor with such low pressures. However, the atmospheric side of the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> was determined to contribute the largest destabilizing effect. The effective length to diameter (LID) ratio of the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> was reduced by 50 percent to lower the amount of cross-coupled stiffness the seal produces. This modification reduced the subsynchronous vibration from 3. 5 mils to 0. 1 mils. The rotordynarnic analysis also identified other modifications to the bearing and balance piston design that should be made to increase the rotor's margin of stability. Both steady-state and transient spectral vibration data are provided before and after the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> modification to validate the rotordynarnic model of the compressor...|$|R
40|$|In Squeeze Film Dampers, (SFD), grooves (deep or shallow) {{are used}} to feed oil into the damper and prevent oil {{starvation}} within the fluid film lands. In <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> with film land of clearance c, short shallow grooves (depth ? 15 c, length ? 30 c) are machined to reduce the cross-coupled stiffness coefficients, and thus improve the seal stability characteristics. Moreover, test stands for these devices can also incorporate grooves or recesses as part of oil feeding/ discharge arrangements. A common assumption is that these grooves do not influence the test system forced response. However, unexpected large added mass coefficients are reported in these configurations and not adequately predicted. In the case of grooved <b>oil</b> <b>seals,</b> experimental results also show that circumferential grooves do aid to reduce cross-coupled force coefficients but {{to a lesser extent}} than predictions otherwise indicate. A linear fluid inertia model for analysis of multiple-groove SFD or <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> configurations is advanced. A perturbation analysis for small motion about a journal centered and off-centered position yields zeroth and first order flow equations defined at each individual flow region (land and grooves) of constant clearance (c). The analysis considers both the circumferential and axial dynamic pressure variations across the groove and land regions. At the groove regions, an effective groove depth (d?) and effective clearance (c d c ? ? = +) are defined based on qualitative observations of the laminar flow pattern through annular cavities. This depth differs from the actual physical groove depth. The boundary conditions at the inlet and exit plane are a function of the geometric configuration. Integration of the resulting dynamic pressure fields on the journal surface yields the force coefficients (stiffness, damping, and inertia). Comparisons between predicted and experimental force coefficients for a grooved <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> and a SFD show excellent correlation over a narrow range of effective groove depths. The results confirm that large added mass coefficients are associated to the feed/discharge grooves in the scrutinized test configurations. Furthermore, predictions, benchmarking experimental data, corroborate that short inner land grooves in an <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> do not isolate the pressure field of the adjacent film lands, and hence contribute greatly to the force response of the seal...|$|R
30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and <b>oil</b> edge <b>sealing,</b> the <b>oil</b> chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R
