40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow-diverting stents {{can be used}} {{to treat}} {{intracranial}} aneurysms that are not amenable to treatment with coils. We analyzed <b>ophthalmic</b> consequences due to coverage of the origin of the <b>ophthalmic</b> artery by flow-diverting stents for the treatment of internal carotid artery aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2009 to April 2013, the clinical and angiographic outcomes of all 28 patients treated for aneurysms with flow-diverting stents covering the origin of the <b>ophthalmic</b> artery were prospectively collected. The origin of the <b>ophthalmic</b> artery in relation to the target aneurysmwas classified by using a 4 -type classification. A complete <b>ophthalmic</b> examinationwas performed by a single ophthalmologist 48 hours before and 1 week after covering the <b>ophthalmic</b> artery. RESULTS: <b>Ophthalmic</b> artery patencywas normal at the end of endovascular treatment in 24 / 28 cases (85. 7 %). With extensive <b>ophthalmic</b> examinations, 11 patients (39. 3 %) showed new <b>ophthalmic</b> complications. Patients with the <b>ophthalmic</b> artery originating from the aneu-rysm sac were at high risk for retinal emboli (4 / 5, 80 %). Patients with the <b>ophthalmic</b> artery originating from the inner curve of the carotid siphon were at high risk for optic nerve ischemic atrophy (3 / 4, 75 %). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study shows that covering the <b>ophthalmic</b> artery with a flow-diverting stent is not without potential complications. <b>Ophthalmic</b> complications can occur but are often not diagnosed. The anatomic disposition of the <b>ophthalmic</b> artery in relation to the carotid siphon and aneurysm should be clearly understood because some configurations have a higher risk. When no...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{removal of}} {{diclofenac}} sodium <b>ophthalmic</b> solution {{as a viable}} pharmaceutical entity in September 1999 from the US market spurred considerable interest in the general safety and effectiveness of topical <b>ophthalmic</b> NSAIDs for treatment of anterior segment inflammation. In late 1999 the use of topical ocular NSAIDs declined in the US {{as a result of}} incidents involving corneal melts and toxicity surrounding use of generic diclofenac. However, since the removal of diclofenac sodium <b>ophthalmic</b> solution from the marketplace, <b>ophthalmic</b> NSAIDs have regained use as viable pharmacotherapeutic entities. Moreover, several new <b>ophthalmic</b> NSAID products have recently been introduced for commercial use in the US including the novel chemical entity nepafenac. The purpose of this report is to revisit the use of topical <b>ophthalmic</b> NSAIDs for the treatment of surgically induced anterior segment inflammation with a particular focus on nepafenac. Nepafenac is unique among <b>ophthalmic</b> NSAIDs in that it is a prodrug deaminated to amfenac, a highly effective non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor. In the case of topical <b>ophthalmic</b> NSAIDs, practitioners should carefully weigh the cost-benefit of implementing “highly potent ” new drug products because perturbations in pharmacodynamic response due to the inherent novelty in terms of chemical designs may outweigh the demonstrated replicative pharmacologic action of all topical <b>ophthalmic</b> NSAIDs...|$|R

Pharmaceutical industry and pharmacy compounding isolators are used for maintaining sterility of a drug, {{and that is the}} focus of this article. This type of strict design and control is important when producing sterile medicines because consumers receiving injections, surgical irrigants, or other [...] "parenterally"-administered drugs are often highly vulnerable to infection. As a result, contaminated drugs have caused grave (e.g., permanent injury, death) consequences for the consumer.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} the in vitro efficacy of six novel <b>ophthalmic</b> clarithromycin formulations {{and to explore}} the pharmaceutical aspects of these formulations that may influence patient tolerability. Because clarithromycin <b>ophthalmic</b> formulations are not registered in Europe, we manufactured several extemporaneous <b>ophthalmic</b> formulations. DESIGN AND METHODS Six clarithromycin <b>ophthalmic</b> formulations were prepared aseptically: three clear eye drops, two <b>ophthalmic</b> suspensions and one <b>ophthalmic</b> ointment. In vitro efficacy was tested by inoculating agar plates with Moraxella catarrhalis and determining growth inhibition. Bonferroni adjusted one-way ANOVA was used to statistically compare growth inhibition of the <b>ophthalmic</b> solutions. Formulations were tested for pH, presence of particles, and osmolarity. RESULTS All six <b>ophthalmic</b> formulations resulted in significant growth inhibition of M. catarrhalis (P < 0. 001). Clear eye drops based on clarithromycin powder for solution for injection performed best in terms of growth inhibition, followed by two suspension eye drops and preserved eye drops based on oral tablets (P < 0. 001). The preserved eye drop was the only <b>ophthalmic</b> formulation that met the ideal pharmaceutical criteria (pH 6. 9, osmolarity 0. 319 osmol/L). The patient’s ocular infection successfully resolved after intensive treatment with no significant residual ocular damage at two months. CONCLUSION Clear clarithromycin eye drops based on oral tablets {{seem to be the}} most suitable ocular clarithromycin formulation: they showed excellent growth inhibition and met product specifications that are favourable for the prevention of ocular irritation. We therefore advocate the use of this extemporaneously prepared solution in absence of registered clarithromycin <b>ophthalmic</b> formulations or powder for solution for injection...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Late {{infantile}} {{neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis}} (LINCL), {{one form}} of Batten's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from a CLN 2 gene mutation. The spectrum of <b>ophthalmic</b> manifestations of LINCL and the relationship with neurological function has not been previously described. METHODS: Patients underwent <b>ophthalmic</b> evaluations, including anterior segment and dilated exams, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography. Patients were also assessed with the LINCL Neurological Severity Scale. <b>Ophthalmic</b> findings were categorized into one of five severity scores, and the association {{of the extent of}} ocular disease with neurological function was assessed. RESULTS: Fifty eyes of 25 patients were included. The mean age at the time of exam was 4. 9 years (range 2. 5 to 8. 1). The mean <b>ophthalmic</b> severity score was 2. 6 (range 1 to 5). The mean neurological severity score was 6. 1 (range 2 to 11). Significantly more severe <b>ophthalmic</b> manifestations were observed among older patients (p< 0. 005) and patients with more severe neurological findings (p< 0. 03). A direct correlation was found between the <b>Ophthalmic</b> Severity Scale and the Weill Cornell Neurological Scale (p< 0. 002). A direct association was also found between age and the <b>ophthalmic</b> manifestations (p< 0. 0002), with older children having more severe <b>ophthalmic</b> manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Ophthalmic</b> manifestations of LINCL correlate closely with the degree of neurological function and the age of the patient.
