40|$|Abstract — Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{has been}} adopted by telecom Next Generation Networks (NGN) and 3 rd Generation Partnership Project’s IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).

In the context of all-IP paradigm with the IP Multimedia System introduction, and the consequent revolution in terms of applications more perceived as multimedia sessions evolving many types of media and many stakeholders at the same time, the concept of rating evolved as well to tackle the challenge of multimedia complex applications and quality of service in packet switched networks.

40|$|The {{functioning}} of the online charging {{is important for the}} efficient work of mobile operator. The main disadvantage of a modern system service calls is that they do not consider the important technical and charging parameters of services, as the result, there is not enough rational utilization of server resources. The article proposes a method of distribution of system resources to ensure efficient processing of applications that allows to monitor the quality of services, taking into account the required number of resources to serve one application and statistics about the number of applications of each type of service received in a given time interval. It will allocate resources in proportion to the requirements of the service and configure the distribution of inputs respectively of the input stream, and to ensure the maximization of economic efficiency of service delivery. In the section "Modern problems of service calls" the main disadvantages of modern systems of billing were analyzed. The work of the billing server is described in the section "Processing of calls in <b>Online</b> <b>Charging</b> <b>System.</b> The problem of resource allocation system is solved in the third section, called "The problem of distribution of server resources". ? ?????? ????????? ????? ????????????? ???????? ??????? ??? ??????????? ??????????? ????????? ??????, ??????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????, ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ??? ???????????? ????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ???? ??????? ??????????? ? ???????? ????????? ???????. ????? ????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ??????????????? ??????????? ???????, ? ????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????? ? ???????????? ? ???????? ???????? ??????, ? ?????????? ???????????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. Electrical Engineering. A virtual Mobile Voice over IP (MVoIP) {{service can}} be {{implemented}} by a Mobile VoIP Operator (MVoIPO) {{in conjunction with a}} Mobile Network Operator (MNO). MVoIPOs do not operate their own mobile network infrastructure. Instead, they use the MNO's packet-based cellular network. However, the coexistence between the MVoIPO and the MNO raises two related problems: first, how to handle interconnection settlements, and second, how to (inter) connect the two operators to make such settlements. This dissertation uses a game-theoretic modelling approach to show that it is mutually beneficial economically if the MNO allows the MVoIPO to operate on its network. Further, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) -based Transparent Settlement Agreement (TSA) model is proposed to solve the first problem. The TSA model algorithm calculates the MVoIPO's throughput distribution {{at the edge of a}} UMTS Core Network (CN). This facilitates the determination of levels of conformance to the pre-set throughput thresholds and, subsequently, the issuing of compensation to the MVoIPO by the MNO after generating an economically acceptable volume of traffic. Further, possible network architecture to solve the second problem is suggested, by combining the TSA model algorithm, the UMTS CN, the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), and the <b>Online</b> <b>Charging</b> <b>System</b> (OCS...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{the list}} of telecom services, their {{functionality}} and requirements for Service Execu-tion Environment (SEE) are changing extremely fast. Especially when it concerns require-ments for charging as they have a high influence on business. This results in the need for constant adaptation and reconfiguration of <b>Online</b> <b>Charging</b> <b>System</b> (OCS) used in mobile operator networks. Moreover any new functionality requested from a service {{can have an impact}} on system behavior (performance, response time, delays) which are in general non-functional requirements. Currently, this influence and reconfiguration strategies are poorly formalized and validated. Current state-of-the-art approaches are considered methodolo-gies that can model non-functional or functional requirements but these approaches don’t take into account interaction between functional and nonfunctional requirements and col-laboration between services. All these result in time and money consuming service devel-opment and testing, and cause delays during service deployment. The balancing method proposed in this paper fills this gap. It employs a well-defined workflow with predefined stages for development and deployment process for OCS. The applicability of this novel ap-proach is described in a separate section which contains an example of GPRS service charging. A tool, based on this method will be developed, providing automation of service functionality influence on non-functional requirements and allowing to provide a target de-ployment model for a particular customer.

40|$|Abstract—An <b>online</b> <b>charging</b> {{strategy}} is an efficient approach to provide charging plans for electric vehicles (EVs) from a global point of view, aiming to improve energy efficiency while avoiding overloading {{of an electric}} power system. However, designing an efficient <b>online</b> <b>charging</b> strategy to achieve optimal energy utilization remains a challenging problem, especially when the coordinated behaviors of both EVs and charging stations are taken into consideration. In this paper, we first introduce an intelligent power distribution system which utilizes vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to enable communication among EVs on roads, road-side units (RSUs), and a vehicle-traffic server. Then, we propose a globally optimal <b>online</b> EV <b>charging</b> strategy, which not only improves energy utilization of the whole system but also prevents charging stations from overloading, which may cause a voltage drop in the power distribution system. Lagrange duality optimization techniques are exploited to address the associated optimal EV charging problem. The performance of our proposed {{strategy is}} evaluated by extensive simulations, {{and the results are}} compared with that of the traditional autonomous offline charging strategy. I...|$|R
