5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on VHS, Betamax and VideoDisc in pan and scan only, and on laserdisc in both pan and scan and widescreen. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in THX and made available in widescreen. The <b>outer</b> <b>package</b> was retitled Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark for consistency with the film's prequel and sequel. The subsequent DVD release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. In the DVD, two subtle digital revisions were added. First, a connecting rod from the giant boulder to an offscreen guidance track in the opening scene was removed from behind the running Harrison Ford; second, a reflection in the glass partition separating Ford from the cobra in the Well of Souls was removed. Shortly before the theatrical release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Raiders (along with The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade) was re-released on DVD with additional extra features not included on the previous set on May 13, 2008. The film {{was released on}} Blu-ray Disc in September 2012. Previously, only Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had been available on Blu-ray.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{concept was}} {{a candy bar}} that would have three main components, a heavy texture, rich flavor, and a reasonable price; {{the combination of these}} qualities would ensure that it would be an easily marketable product. [...] It was later decided it should be appealing to as many demographic groups as possible, including children. [...] A candy bar was developed with a dark cocoa-flavored cookie pieces mixed with Japanese-style crisped rice, and finally coated with dark milk chocolate. [...] The cookie bar is pressed relatively flat on five sides; however, the top of the bar presents an uneven surface, even with the chocolate coating. [...] When it came to a name for the product, it was decided that the keyword should be the color [...] "black", which would allude to the dark chocolate flavor. [...] This is in keeping with other marketing trends in Japan, where the color [...] "black" [...] is associated with dark or bittersweet chocolate, such as the popular Meiji Black chocolate bar. [...] To give the product some [...] "impact" [...] with consumers, it was decided to name it after the Japanese god of thunder, Raijin. [...] Although the name of the product uses the English words [...] "Black Thunder" [...] (pronounced or transliterated as Burakku Sandah), the <b>outer</b> <b>package</b> also carries the Japanese kanji term for the product in a smaller font (...) , so that the meaning would not be lost on consumers. [...] An advertising slogan recorded from the development period translates to, [...] "Delicious taste like a flash of lightning!" [...] ( [...] ), but was initially rejected in favor of the basic one-line descriptive [...] "Black cocoa crunch".|$|E

50|$|As with {{previous}} releases, the band chose a non-standard packaging {{instead of the}} conventional jewel case. The <b>outer</b> <b>package</b> is a small box with flap, containing a foldout multipanel slipcover with information, and a CD holder in the last section.

50|$|Many times {{cosmetic}} products are packaged in multiple layers. Whenever {{it is difficult}} to detect for the consumer, the number of units should be listed on the <b>outer</b> <b>package,</b> which should contain details about how to use the product and warnings on what to do if it is misused. It is essential that the product is protected from environmental elements such as mould and bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Features remakes of all {{the songs}} from the Korean soundtrack (including the main theme). The largest remake so far.The <b>outer</b> <b>{{packaging}}</b> (box) is dark green, while the inner packaging (a booklet with photos which holds the CD) is mint green, a unique combination of colors unlike the first two albums.|$|R
50|$|The album artwork is Oldfield's {{trademark}} bent tubular bell {{shape in}} silver, {{based upon the}} original 1973 Tubular Bells album cover, set upon a grey background.

5000|$|Entrepreneur BJ Cunningham {{invested}} {{his life}} savings {{to create and}} market an additive-free smoking product called Death. He founded the Enlightened Tobacco Company in 1991. [...] Its product disclosed its hazardous nature by prominently displaying skull and crossbones on its <b>outer</b> <b>package</b> and came in two varieties; Death, and Death Lights. [...] The product was marketed to the “young underground punk rock” consumer market. [...] The products were sold for a time via mail order from Luxembourg to avoid the United Kingdom's excise tax, however after some time the Customs and Excise department disallowed this sales channel.|$|E
50|$|Thousands of tons {{of medical}} {{supplies}} are discarded in the United States every day. This occurs largely because U.S. government regulations force hospitals to discard any unused medical supplies in an opened <b>outer</b> <b>package,</b> even if the remaining items are individually wrapped and sterile. These supplies are either incinerated or deposited in landfills. Meanwhile, in developing nations, thousands of patients are turned away from hospitals and medical centers {{due to a lack}} of supplies. Charash created Doc to Dock to rectify this imbalance. The organization also benefits the U.S. environment by reducing the strain on landfills.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II, Steinweiss became Columbia Records' {{advertising}} manager. He {{left for}} {{a job at the}} Navy's Training and Development Center in New York City, where he produced teaching materials and cautionary posters. [...] After the war, Steinweiss freelanced for Columbia. During one lunch meeting there, the company's president, Ted Wallerstein, introduced him to an innovation that the company was about to unveil: the long-playing record. But there was a problem. The heavy, folded kraft paper used to protect 78 rpm records left marks on the vinyl microgroove when 33 1/3 rpm LPs were stacked. [...] Steinweiss was asked to develop a jacket for the new format and, with help from his brother-in-law, found a manufacturer willing to invest about $250,000 in equipment. Steinweiss had the original patent for what became the industry packaging standard (he did not develop the inner sleeve, only the <b>outer</b> <b>package),</b> but under his contract with Columbia he had to waive all rights to any inventions made while working there.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s, ABC became {{state-owned}} {{during the}} revolution. Mickey Mouse {{was seen as}} a symbol for worshiping foreign countries, so the packaging was redesigned to feature a naturalistically-drawn White Rabbit and an artist's paint palette with Chinese and English hand-lettering in a color scheme of red, blue and black against a white background. The result was a distinctive candy label design that became instantly recognizable around the world. The packaging and brand logo have changed over the years: When the candies were first marketed, the White Rabbit on the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> was lying down; however, this was changed to an image of the rabbit jumping. Currently, the trade mark animal on the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> has been given enormous neotenic, forward-facing eyes in the style of Disney or Japanese manga, while the inner wrapping retains its classic art deco look and naturalistic rabbit.|$|R
50|$|The album {{packaging}} makes only sparing {{reference to}} either the band or the album title: the <b>outer</b> <b>packaging</b> does not make any reference to Godspeed, but mentions them in the liner notes; the album title is only shown on {{the spine of the}} album cover. The song titles are not listed anywhere on the cover.|$|R

5000|$|One-way kegs, {{also known}} as {{disposable}} kegs or PET kegs, were invented in 1996. They are usually made of plastic. Some types have a cardboard <b>outer</b> <b>packaging,</b> which makes them easier to stack and transport, and also protects the plastic container. Some may use either bag in ball or spear technology. A stronger, more pressure resistant type of one way kegs make use of a double wall technology.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{represents}} the extended {{version of the}} conference paper "Developing highly-integrated subcutaneous biochips for remote monitoring of human metabolism" presented at the IEEE Sensors Conference 2012, and presents data on assembly, packaging and short term in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility evaluation of a fully implantable biosensor array. The device was realized integrating three building blocks: 1) a multielectrode platform; 2) an inductive coil; and 3) an integrated circuit. The entire system measures 2. 2 mm x 2. 2 mm x 15 mm. Corrosion of electronic components and leaking of potentially hazardous substances in the body is prevented with a conformal coating of Parylene C, while an <b>outer</b> <b>package</b> of medical grade silicone was employed to create a soft shell suitable for implantation.

40|$|High-temperature hybrids {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be the most}} reliable packaging method for down-hole circuits which will be subjected to elevated temperatures, thermal cycling and/or high shock and vibration. However, one cannot simply take a standard surface mount circuit and repackage it in hybrid form and expect good results. The circuit designer must consider issues such as die availability and active component functionality at high temperature. Passive components may also need to be changed: considerations include the availability of resistors and capacitors of appropriate physical size in hybrid-compatible packages, component tolerances over the temperature range and the effects of aging on these components. Practical hybrid package size limitations are driven by ceramic processing capabilities, dimensional tolerances, and thermal expansion mismatch between the substrate, the components, and the <b>outer</b> <b>package.</b> Circuit size reductions are not always realized as allowances must be made for package wall thicknesses, I/O pins, clearance between components and clearance for automated wire bond tools. Ten years of continuous hybrid process development and extensive circuit reliability testing has exposed several limitations on assembly reliability. Lessons learned and statistical failure data will be presented [...] Limitations of SMT technology Most down-hole electronics circuits used today are made using surface-mount technology (SMT).
