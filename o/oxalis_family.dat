The <b>Oxalis</b> <b>family</b> has nearly 900 species, most are herbaceous perennials or annuals native from tropical and semitropical locations though a number also grow {{in other parts of}} the world. Averrhoa has sometimes been placed in the family Averrhoaceae. Averrhoa carambola is one of two {{species in the}} genus Averrhoa, both have edible fruit; the other species Averrhoa bilimbi, which is sometimes called the Bilimbi or the Cucumber Tree, is limited to tropical regions. The fruits of A. bilimbi are too sour to be eaten raw, while the sweet forms A. carambola are eaten raw. The fruits of A. bilimbi and the sour forms, which have high oxalic acid content, of A. carambola are pickled and made into jelly, jam, and juice. The genus was named after Abū 'l-Walīd Muḥammad bin Aḥmad bin Rushd (better known just as Ibn Rushd), who was called Averroes in European literature - a famous Arabian physician, astronomer and philosopher of the 12th century.|$|E
