25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} a simple dish, but comes in many varieties {{due to its}} versatility. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. Pasta is also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand <b>or</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> and served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, color and texture. When choosing which type of pasta and sauce to serve together, {{there is a general}} rule regarding compatibility. Simple sauces like pesto are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. The extra sauce left on the plate after all of the pasta is eaten is often mopped up with a piece of bread. Pasta is largely carbohydrates (mainly as starch), with moderate amounts of protein and manganese.|$|E

Commonly used in baking and mixed drinks, it is sold as [...] "superfine" [...] sugar in the United States. Because of its fineness, it dissolves more quickly than regular white sugar and is thus especially useful in meringues and cold liquids. Castor sugar can be prepared at home by grinding granulated sugar {{for a couple of minutes}} in a mortar <b>or</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The US defines {{irradiated}} foods as {{foods in}} which the irradiation causes a material change in the food, or a material change in the consequences that may result {{from the use of}} the food.

50|$|Foreign {{visitors}} to some Latin American countries have demonstrated {{an interest in}} commercial and cultural uses of the stimulant properties of the coca plant, which are less harmful than cocaine which is highly and unnaturally refined. A few websites depict a mild modern preparation of the powdery ypadu mixture using plastic jars and coffee grinders <b>or</b> <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> rather than the traditional implements such as clay vessels and mortar-and-pestles fashioned from wood. Peruvian coca of the genus Erythroxilum coca var has reportedly been used in this adaptation to produce effective mixtures with pleasant taste.|$|R

5000|$|A Victoria sponge is {{made using}} one of two methods. [...] The {{traditional}} method involves creaming caster sugar with fat (usually butter), mixing thoroughly with beaten egg, then folding flour and raising agent into the mixture. The modern method, using an electric mixer <b>or</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> involves simply whisking all the ingredients together until creamy. [...] Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra raising agent, and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine. Both the traditional and modern methods are relatively quick and simple, producing consistent results, making this type of mixture {{one of the most}} popular for children and people in a hurry. This basic [...] "cake" [...] mixture has been made into a wide variety of treats and puddings, including cupcakes, chocolate cake, and Eve's pudding.|$|E

Konjac gel (known as moyu tofu in Chinese Mandarin, mo wu dau fu in Chinese Cantonese, and konnyaku in Japanese) {{can also be used}} as a substitute for shark fin once it is shredded into thin strands using a grater <b>or</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> While cellophane noodles are also often used as an alternative to shark fins, some cooks find them too soft and unable to withstand longer cooking that allows flavors to be absorbed. Other substitutes for shark fin are cucurbita ficifolia (shark fin melon), chicken breast, jinhua ham, vermicelli, soy, and pig's skin or gelatin. As with shark fin soups, ingredients such as edible mushrooms, kelps, seaweeds, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and beaten eggs may be used to improve the taste.|$|E

Cooking nasi goreng usually employs strong fire, while {{authentic}} rendang for example requires small fire for slow cooking of beef, spices, and coconut milk until the meat is caramelised and all the coconut milk's liquid has evaporated. Traditional Indonesian dapur (kitchen) usually employs firewood-fuelled kitchen stove, while the contemporary household today uses liquefied petroleum gas-fuelled stove or an electric stove. The ingredients could be cut in pieces, sliced thinly, or ground into a paste. Cooking utensils are wajan (wok), penggorengan (frying pan), panci (cauldron), knives, several types of spoon and fork, parutan (shredder), cobek and ulekan (stone mortar and pestle). Traditionally Indonesians use a stone mortar and a pestle to grind the spices and ingredients into coarse or fine pastes. Today most households use blender <b>or</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> for the task. Traditional Indonesian cookingwares are usually made from stone, earthenware pottery, wood, and woven bamboo or a rattan container or filter, while contemporary cookingwares, plates and containers use metals - iron, tin, stainless steel, aluminium, ceramics, plastics, and also glass.|$|E
