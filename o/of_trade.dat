5|$|There {{is little}} {{documentary}} {{evidence about the}} nature <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in Æthelberht's Kent. It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> by the late seventh century, {{but it is not}} known how early this control began. There is archaeological evidence suggesting that the royal influence predates any of the written sources. It has been suggested that one of Æthelberht's achievements was to take control <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> away from the aristocracy and to make it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods which gave it an advantage in trading with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself.|$|E

5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E

Moreover, the generated time series are long-range correlated.

5|$|From a low base at the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, trade expanded in the 1530s, but suffered from the English invasions of the Rough Wooing in the 1540s. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The fortunes of Scottish burghs in the export trade changed across the century. Haddington, which had been one of the major centres <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in the late Medieval period, saw its share of foreign exports collapse in the sixteenth century. Aberdeen's share <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> remained stable for most of the century, but slumped in the last decade. The small Fife ports grew in significance and Edinburgh took an increasing share <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> through its port of Leith. This forced smaller ports to diversify into other commodities and to undertake more coastal trading. Overall there was an increase in foreign trade from the 1570s, of which Edinburgh received the major share.|$|E

In developing this argument we show how different modes of collaboration result in different kinds <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> zone, how different kinds <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> zone may be ‘nested’ inside each other and discuss how a single collaboration might move between different kinds <b>of</b> <b>trading</b> zone over time.
