25|$|The {{chemical}} composition may vary between end member species {{of a solid}} solution series. For example, the plagioclase feldspars comprise a continuous series from sodium-rich end member albite (NaAlSi3O8) to calcium-rich anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): <b>oligoclase,</b> andesine, labradorite, and bytownite. Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the wolframite series of manganese-rich hübnerite and iron-rich ferberite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oligoclase</b> {{is common}} in granite, syenite, diorite, and gneiss. It is a {{frequent}} associate of orthoclase. The name <b>oligoclase</b> {{is derived from the}} Greek for little and fracture, in reference to the fact that its cleavage angle differs significantly from 90°. Sunstone is mainly <b>oligoclase</b> (sometimes albite) with flakes of hematite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oligoclase</b> occurs, often {{accompanying}} orthoclase, as {{a constituent}} of plutonic igneous rocks such as granite, syenite, and diorite. It occurs in porphyry and diabase dikes and sills {{as well as}} in the volcanic rocks andesite and trachyte. It also occurs in gneiss. The best developed and largest crystals are those found with orthoclase, quartz, epidote, and calcite in veins in granite at Arendal in Norway. The distinctive texture of rapakivi granite is due to <b>oligoclase</b> rims on orthoclase phenocrysts. <b>Oligoclase</b> is also found in metamorphic rocks formed under transitional greenschist to amphibolite facies conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Mugearite (...) {{is a type}} of oligoclase-bearing basalt, {{comprising}} olivine, apatite, and opaque oxides. The main feldspar in mugearite is <b>oligoclase.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Huttenlocher (found in bytownite, Anorthite {{composition}} An55-95.), Boggild (in labradorite, An39-48 and An53-63.) and Peristerite (in <b>oligoclase,</b> ~An5-15.) miscibility {{gaps in the}} plagioclase feldspars.|$|E
5000|$|From 5 {{million years}} ago {{to the present day}} the rate of uplift has accelerated. <b>Oligoclase</b> and biotite schist have also been pushed {{to the surface of the}} Earth.|$|E
50|$|Trondhjemite is a leucocratic (light-colored) {{intrusive}} igneous rock. It is {{a variety}} of tonalite in which the plagioclase is mostly {{in the form of}} <b>oligoclase.</b> Trondhjemites are sometimes known as plagiogranites.|$|E
5000|$|The {{feldspar}} {{which usually}} displays the aventurine appearance is <b>oligoclase,</b> though {{the effect is}} sometimes seen in orthoclase: hence two kinds of sunstone are distinguished as [...] "oligoclase sunstone" [...] and [...] "orthoclase sunstone".|$|E
50|$|<b>Oligoclase</b> is a rock-forming mineral {{belonging}} to the plagioclase feldspars. In chemical composition and in its crystallographic and physical characters it is intermediate between albite (NaAlSi3O8) and anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8). The albite:anorthite molar ratio ranges from 90:10 to 70:30.|$|E
5000|$|The Haast Schist is a New Zealand schist that {{is found}} {{on the eastern side}} of the Alpine Fault. Metamorphic grade {{progresses}} from greenschist through biotite schist to garnet schist. Myrmekitic textures occur within <b>oligoclase</b> within the garnet zone.|$|E
50|$|LL chondrites have Low total {{iron and}} Low metal {{contents}} (3-5% Fe-Ni metal by mass of which 2% is metallic Fe {{and they also}} contain bronzite, <b>oligoclase</b> and olivine.). Only 1 in 10 ordinary chondrite falls belong to this group.|$|E
50|$|Tonalite is an igneous, {{plutonic}} (intrusive) rock, of felsic composition, with phaneritic texture. Feldspar {{is present}} as plagioclase (typically <b>oligoclase</b> or andesine) with 10% or less alkali feldspar. Quartz is present {{as more than}} 20% of the rock. Amphiboles and pyroxenes are common accessory minerals.|$|E
5000|$|Essexite is an {{alkaline}} {{igneous rock}} equivalent to an alkaline basalt. The presence of nepheline, a feldspathoid mineral, indicates that essexites are silica undersaturated. The presence of orthoclase {{indicates that it}} contains sufficient potassium to favor production of orthoclase over microcline or potassic <b>oligoclase.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Oligoclase</b> {{is a high}} sodium {{feldspar}} crystallizing in the triclinic system. The Mohs hardness is 6 to 6.5 and {{the specific}} gravity is 2.64 to 2.66. The refractive indices are: nα=1.533-1.543, nβ=1.537-1.548, and nγ=1.542-1.552. In color it is usually white, with shades of grey, green, or red.|$|E
50|$|Quartz diorite is an igneous, {{plutonic}} (intrusive) rock, of felsic composition, with phaneritic texture. Feldspar {{is present}} as plagioclase (typically <b>oligoclase</b> or andesine) with 10% or less potassium feldspar. Quartz is present at between 5 and 20% of the rock. Biotite, amphiboles and pyroxenes are common dark accessory minerals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{moonstone}} {{is of the}} mineral adularia, named for an early mining site near Mt. Adular in Switzerland, now the town of St. Gotthard. [...] The plagioclase feldspar <b>oligoclase</b> also produces moonstone specimens. Moonstone is feldspar with a pearly and opalescent schiller. An alternative name is hecatolite.|$|E
5000|$|... {{plagioclase}} - 47.5 volume percent. Present as subhedral to euhedral, tabular <b>oligoclase</b> with An27-29. Shows normal zoning with calcium-rich cores and sodium-rich rims. Exhibits simple carlsbad and albite twinning. Grain size varies between 1 and 15 millimeters. Can be cataclastically {{broken and}} infiltrated/replaced by microcline in shear zone.|$|E
50|$|Trachyte tuffs contain {{little or}} no quartz but much {{sanidine}} or anorthoclase and sometimes <b>oligoclase</b> feldspar, with occasional biotite, augite and hornblende. In weathering they often change to soft red or yellow clay-stones, rich in kaolin with secondary quartz. Recent trachyte tuffs are found on the Rhine (at Siebengebirge), in Ischia, near Naples, Hungary, etc.|$|E
50|$|Micrographic {{differs from}} graphic granite in being so much finer-grained that the texture {{can only be}} seen in a {{petrographic}} thin section with a microscope. The feldspar is usually orthoclase, but can also be albite, <b>oligoclase</b> or microcline. In at least some instances, quartz is so disposed that the two minerals have a definite relation between their crystallographic axes.|$|E
50|$|The name <b>oligoclase</b> {{was given}} by August Breithaupt in 1826 from the Greek oligos, little, and clasein, to break, because the mineral was thought to have a less perfect {{cleavage}} than albite. It had previously been recognized as a distinct species by J. J. Berzelius in 1824, and was named by him soda-spodumene (Natron-spodumen), because of its resemblance in appearance to spodumene.|$|E
50|$|The aplites {{associated}} with diorites and quartz-diabases differ in minor respects {{from the common}} aplites which accompany granites. The accessory minerals of these rocks are principally <b>oligoclase,</b> muscovite, apatite and zircon. Biotite and all ferromagnesian minerals rarely appear in them, and never in considerable amounts. Riebeckite-granites have close affinities to aplites, shown especially in the prevalence of alkali feldspars. Tourmaline also occurs in some aplites.|$|E
50|$|It is a metasomatic {{rock with}} a {{microscopic}} or very-fine grain size produced by hydrothermal alteration of basalt, and composed of albite or <b>oligoclase,</b> together with chlorite, epidote, calcite, and actinolite. Spilite is veined by calcite or chalcedony, and vesicles and cavities {{are filled with}} secondary minerals. It is generally classed with basalts, and it often retains many textural and structural features characteristic of basalt.|$|E
50|$|Puntukas is a glacial erratic—it {{was brought}} by glaciers {{during the last}} glacial period (18th-12th {{millennium}} BC) probably from Finland. It measures 6.9 m in length, 6.7 m in width, and 5.7 m in depth (including 1.5 m underground). It weighs about 265 tons. It is made of Rapakivi granite. Its reddish mass includes large crystals of potassium feldspar surrounded by green rings of <b>oligoclase.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Fresh magma {{changes the}} {{composition}} of the melt, changing the chemistry of the phases which are being precipitated. For instance, plagioclase conforms to the liquid line of descent by forming initial anorthite which, if removed, changes the equilibrium mineral composition to <b>oligoclase</b> or albite. Replenishment of the magma can see this trend reversed, so that more anorthite is precipitated atop cumulate layers of albite.|$|E
5000|$|Mugearite {{is a type}} of oligoclase-bearing basalt, {{comprising}} olivine, apatite, and opaque oxides. The main feldspar in mugearite is <b>oligoclase.</b> It {{was first}} identified by Alfred Harker in 1904 from formations in the vicinity of Mugeary, making this remote spot the rock's [...] "type locality". It occurs in a variety of locations worldwide, including outcrops near Dunedin in New Zealand and in the Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
5000|$|Rapakivi granite is a hornblende-biotite granite {{containing}} large rounded crystals of orthoclase {{each with}} a rim of <b>oligoclase</b> (a variety of plagioclase). The name {{has come to be}} used most frequently as a textural term where it implies plagioclase rims around orthoclase in plutonic rocks. Rapakivi is Finnish for [...] "crumbly rock", because the different heat expansion coefficients of the component minerals make exposed rapakivi crumbly.|$|E
5000|$|The Purico complex has erupted various {{different}} magmas, {{ranging from}} the dacitic Purico ignimbrite over rhyolitic pumices contained in the ignimbrite to the andesitic-dacitic post-ignimbrite volcanics. Dacite is the dominant component and forms a crystal-rich potassium-rich suite. Varying amounts of phenocrysts occur in the Purico complex rocks, the minerals they are formed of include augite, biotite, clinopyroxene, hornblende, hypersthene, iron oxides, <b>oligoclase,</b> orthopyroxene, plagioclase, quartz and titanium oxides.|$|E
5000|$|Myrmekite {{describes}} a , or wormy, intergrowth of quartz in plagioclase. The intergrowths are microscopic in scale, typically with maximum dimensions less than 1 millimeter. The plagioclase is sodium-rich, usually albite or <b>oligoclase.</b> These quartz-plagioclase intergrowths {{are associated with}} and commonly in contact with potassium feldspar. Myrmekite is formed under metasomatic conditions, usually in conjunction with tectonic deformations. It has to be clearly separated from micrographic and granophyric intergrowths, which are magmatic.|$|E
5000|$|The term “sandstone” is {{somewhat}} misleading, because the formation is clearly {{dominated by the}} rhyodacitic tuffs of volcanic origin, all the other facies merely being alteration products. The once sodium-rich rhyodacitic tuffs have now become dark, massive and thickly bedded rocks. Lodged within a fine-grained matrix of chlorite, white mica, quartz and albite are millimeter-sized clasts of quartz, plagioclase (albite or <b>oligoclase)</b> and epidote. The following observations underline the explosive character of the volcanic rocks: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} composition may vary between end member species {{of a solid}} solution series. For example, the plagioclase feldspars comprise a continuous series from sodium-rich end member albite (NaAlSi3O8) to calcium-rich anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) with four recognized intermediate varieties between them (given in order from sodium- to calcium-rich): <b>oligoclase,</b> andesine, labradorite, and bytownite. Other examples of series include the olivine series of magnesium-rich forsterite and iron-rich fayalite, and the wolframite series of manganese-rich hübnerite and iron-rich ferberite.|$|E
50|$|If {{the rock}} is granite {{consisting}} of biotite (sp. gr. 3.1), muscovite (sp. gr. 2.85), quartz (sp. gr. 2.65), <b>oligoclase</b> (sp. gr. 2.64), and orthoclase (sp. gr. 2.56), the crushed minerals float in methylene iodide. On gradual dilution with benzene they precipitate {{in the order}} above. Simple in theory, these methods are tedious in practice, especially as {{it is common for}} one rock-making mineral to enclose another. However, expert handling of fresh and suitable rocks yields excellent results.|$|E
50|$|Variolites are {{a type of}} radiate fibrous growth, {{resembling}} spherulites in many respects, {{consisting of}} minute feathery crystals spreading outwards through a fine grained or glassy rock. In variolites there are straight or feathery feldspar crystals (usually <b>oligoclase)</b> forming pale-colored spherulites a quarter to half an inch in diameter. The same rocks often contain similar aggregates of plumose skeleton crystals of augite. Many volcanic rocks have small lath-shaped crystals of feldspar or augite diverging from a common center.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} variety Na- and Ca-bearing fluids truly act together. This leads via the {{replacement}} of primary K-feldspar (perthitic and non-perthitic microcline) {{to the formation of}} plagioclase (albite or <b>oligoclase)</b> and in certain places also to the formation of myrmekite. The myrmekite does not show wartlike tapering vermicules, but vermicules that are nearly constant in size because the host plagioclase containing the quartz vermicules has nearly a constant Na/Ca composition. These vermicules are confined and scattered entirely within the interior of the plagioclase forming irregular spindles, arcuate patterns and ovals.|$|E
50|$|The {{feldspar}} of the granulites {{is mostly}} orthoclase or cryptoperthite; microcline, <b>oligoclase</b> and albite are also common. Basic feldspars occur only rarely. Among accessory minerals, {{in addition to}} apatite, zircon, and iron oxides, the following may be mentioned: hornblende (not common), riebeckite (rare), epidote and zoisite, calcite, sphene, andalusite, sillimanite, kyanite, hercynite (a green spinel), rutile, orthite and tourmaline. Though occasionally we may find larger grains of feldspar, quartz or epidote, it is more characteristic of these rocks that all the minerals are in small, nearly uniform, imperfectly shaped individuals.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} pink and red aplite veins in the igneous {{complexes}} up to 5 cm wide. The aplite {{is the lowest}} melting remanent of the granite magma, that is poor in volatiles. The aplite minerals include tourmaline, topaz and fluorite. At St Brelade's Bay there are two aplogranites: Beau Port Granite and La Moye Granite. This is coloured yellow brown to pink and contains fine crystals of perthite, and <b>oligoclase</b> and quartz, coloured by limonite. Other parts more rich in volatiles have formed pegmatites featuring milky quartz and pink orthoclase.|$|E
5000|$|Dacite {{consists}} {{mostly of}} plagioclase feldspar with biotite, hornblende, and pyroxene (augite and/or enstatite). It has quartz as some rounded, corroded phenocrysts, {{or as an}} element of the ground-mass.The relative proportions of feldspars and quartz in dacite, and in many other volcanic rocks, are illustrated in the QAPF diagram. The TAS classification, based on silica and alkali contents, puts dacite in the O3 sector [...]The plagioclase ranges from <b>oligoclase</b> to andesine and labradorite. Sanidine occurs, although in small proportions, in some dacites, and when abundant gives rise to rocks that form transitions to the rhyolites.|$|E
