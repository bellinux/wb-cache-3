5|$|In 1775, Carl Linnaeus was {{the first}} to scientifically {{describe}} a halfbeak, Esox brasiliensis. In 1775 Peter Forsskål described two more species as Esox, Esox far and Esox marginatus. It was not until 1816 that Georges Cuvier created the genus Hemiramphus; from then <b>on,</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> were classified as Hemiramphus. In 1859, Gill erected Hemiramphidae, deriving its name from Hemiramphus, the family's type genus. The name comes from the Greek hemi, meaning half, and rhamphos, meaning beak or bill.|$|E

In other cases, the Red Army suppressed secessionist movements; by 1921 they had defeated the Ukrainian national movements and occupied the Caucasus, although fighting in Central Asia lasted until the late 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points {{for each of the}} three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> lines (Figure6).|$|E

5|$|In the U.S. Virgin Islands, heavy {{rainfall}} associated with Otto shattered numerous records for October across the US Virgin Islands, {{with a maximum}} total of 21.52in (547mm) reported in Red Hook, Saint Tomas. The rain flooded roads and prompted officials opened shelters <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> islands on October6. In Saint Croix, a roadway section leading into Enfield Green collapsed, temporarily cutting the neighborhood off to traffic until a makeshift roadway was created the next day. In La Vallée, on the island's north shore, floods and landslides affected low-lying areas. Traffic on Saint Thomas and Saint John initially remained unhindered; however, as the rain continued for several days, flooding, rockslides and asphalt erosion forced authorities to close several roads and highways. Damage estimates from the storm reached $2million across the islands.|$|E
