50|$|To {{preserve}} return-signal strength, Quill’s {{range from}} its target areas had been minimized {{by using an}} unusually steep depression angle. The resulting images therefore had slant-range scales that were much foreshortened versions of the ground-range (mapping) scale of level terrain. While slant-range images provide a realistic perspective of terrain elevation variations, users of imagery usually prefer map-like images having nearly matching scales in both ground-range and along-track directions. Because the <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> of that time {{did not have the}} capability to make full expansions to ground-range scale, only partially expanded images were made during processing of the original images.|$|E
40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>processors</b> are {{attractive}} {{because of their}} ability to perform massively parallel operations such as matrix vector products. The inherently analog nature of optical calculations requires that <b>optical</b> <b>processors</b> be based on analog computations. While the speed at which such analog operations can be performed as well as the natural parallelism of optical systems are great advantages of <b>optical</b> <b>processors,</b> the analog representation of values severely limits the achievable accuracy. Furthermore, <b>optical</b> <b>processors</b> are limited by the need to convert information to and from the intensity of light. Digitization can be used to increase the accuracy of <b>optical</b> matrix-vector <b>processors,</b> but causes a severe reduction in speed. This paper compares the throughput and power requirements of <b>optical</b> and electronic <b>processors,</b> showing that <b>optical</b> matrix-vector <b>processors</b> can provide a greater number of operations/Watt than conventional electronics...|$|R

40|$|The Photonic Processing {{group is}} engaged in applied {{research}} on <b>optical</b> <b>processors</b> {{in support of the}} Ames vision to lead the development of autonomous intelligent systems. <b>Optical</b> <b>processors,</b> in conjunction with numeric and symbolic processors, are needed to provide the powerful processing capability that is required for many future agency missions. The research program emphasizes application of analog optical processing, where free-space propagation between components allows natural implementations of algorithms requiring a large degree of parallel computation. Special consideration is given in the Ames program to the integration of <b>optical</b> <b>processors</b> into larger, heterogeneous computational systems. Demonstration of the effective integration of <b>optical</b> <b>processors</b> within a broader knowledge-based system is essential to evaluate their potential for dependable operation in an autonomous environment such as space. The Ames Photonics program is currently addressing several areas of interest. One of the efforts is to develop an optical correlator system with two programmable spatial light modulators (SLMs) to perform distortion invariant pattern recognition. Another area of research is optical neural networks, also for use in distortion-invariant pattern recognition...|$|R
50|$|Signal {{film from}} all of the three {{recording}} sources was developed at a ground processing facility. At that point, the optical appearance of the SAR data on the film in no way resembled an image of the terrain illuminated by the radar. Instead, it appeared visually nearly like noise, except that it was striated lengthwise of the film. Each striation represented a different radar range and contained long sequences of overlapping radar-return signals from many (literally thousands) of terrain points at that range. Further data- processing was needed to separate those signals from each other and to create, from each of the many distributed signal contributions, one spot of the proper intensity at each image point corresponding to a terrain point. At that time, the only technique available for the job was a high-quality optical data-processor (the Precision <b>Optical</b> <b>Processor,</b> or POP) that had been developed specifically for both airborne and orbiting SAR systems.|$|E

40|$|A {{principle}} {{scheme of}} a lensless <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> for synthetic-aperture imaging ladar (SAIL) is proposed. The collected data from SAIL is initially digitally {{added with a}} quadratic phase in the range direction. These data are then uploaded on a liquid crystal spatial light modulator to modulate the incident light. The target image is obtained through two-dimensional (2 D) free-space Fresnel diffraction. The imaging process is mathematically analyzed using a 2 D data-collection equation of strip-mode side-looking SAIL. The design equation, imaging resolutions, and target-image compression ratios are presented. Based on this principle scheme, we construct an experimental optical SAIL processor and present the imaging result of data obtained from one SAIL demonstrator. The <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> is found to exhibit the flexible property of digital processing, {{as well as the}} fast processing capability of optical means, because this <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> is a lensless system.

40|$|An all-optical {{photonic}} microwave {{phase shifter}} that can realize a continuous 360 ° phase shift {{over a wide}} frequency range is presented. It {{is based on the}} new concept of controlling the amplitude and phase of the two RF modulation sidebands via a Fourier-domain <b>optical</b> <b>processor.</b> The operating frequency range of the phase shifter is largely increased compared to the previously reported Fourier-domain <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> based phase shifter that uses only one RF modulation sideband. This is due to the extension of the lower RF operating frequency by designing the amplitude and phase of one of the RF modulation sidebands while the other sideband is designed to realize the required RF signal phase shift. The two-sideband amplitude-and-phase-control based photonic microwave phase shifter has a simple structure as it only requires a single laser source, a phase modulator, a Fourier-domain <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> and a single photodetector. Investigation on the bandwidth limitation problem in the conventional Fourier-domain <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> based phase shifter is presented. Comparisons between the measured phase shifter output RF amplitude and phase responses with theory, which show excellent agreement, are also presented for the first time. Experimental results demonstrate the full − 180 ° to + 180 ° phase shift with little RF signal amplitude variation of less than 3 dB and with a phase deviation of less than 4 ° over a 7. 5 GHz to 26. 5 GHz frequency range, and the phase shifter exhibits a long term stable performance...|$|E

40|$|A {{ground-based}} {{adaptive optics}} imaging telescope system attempts to improve image quality by detecting and correcting for atmospherically induced wavefront aberrations. The required control computations during each cycle {{will take a}} finite amount of time.

Thus an <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> may be well-suited for this task. This paper presents {{a study of the}} accuracy requirements in a general <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> that will make it competitive with, or superior to, a conventional digital computer for the adaptive optics application.

40|$|Based on a-SiC:H technology, {{we present}} an <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> for data error {{detection}} and correction using a suitable (9, 5) Hamming binary code generator and the syndrome decoding process. The <b>optical</b> <b>processor</b> {{consists of an}} a-SiC:H double p-i-n photodetector with two ultraviolet light biased gates. The relationship between the optical inputs (transmitted data) and the corresponding output levels (the received data) is established and decoded. Results show that under irradiation the device acts as an active filter. Under front irradiation {{the magnitude of the}} short wavelength is quenched and in the long wavelength range is enlarged, while the opposite happens under back lighting. Parity bits are generated and stored simultaneously with the data word. Parity logic operations are performed and checked for errors together.
