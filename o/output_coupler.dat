50|$|In {{its most}} common form, an <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> {{consists}} of a partially reflective mirror, sometimes called a beamsplitter. The reflectance and transmittance of the mirror is usually determined by the gain of the laser medium. In some lasers the gain is very low, so the beam must make hundreds of passes through the medium for sufficient gain. In this case the <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> may {{be as high as}} 99% reflective, transmitting only 1% of the cavity's beam to be used. A dye laser has very high gain compared to most solid-state lasers, so the beam needs to make just a few passes through the liquid to reach its optimum gain, thus the <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> is typically around 80% reflective. In others, such as an excimer laser, the 4% reflectivity of uncoated glass provides enough of a mirror, transmitting nearly 96% of the intracavity beam.|$|E
50|$|The <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> may {{be either}} flat or curved, {{depending}} {{on the design of}} the optical cavity. The face of the <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> facing into the cavity is the side with the applied partially reflective coating. This is the side which partially determines the laser modal properties. If this inner surface is curved then so must be the outer surface. This will stop the OC performing as a lens. The curvature of the outer surface can be designed to give a collimated laser output. This outer surface generally has an anti-reflection coating applied to maximise the output power.|$|E

The <b>output</b> <b>couplers</b> {{are implemented}} using periodic relief gratings on a planar waveguide. Design {{theory of the}} couplers {{is based on the}} perturbation approach. Coupling of light from waveguide propagation modes to output radiation modes is described by coupled mode theory and the transmission line approximation of the perturbed area (grating structure). Using these concepts, gratings can be accurately designed to output a minimum number of modes at desired <b>output</b> angles. Waveguide <b>couplers</b> were designed using these concepts. These couplers were fabricated and analyzed for structural accuracy, output beam accuracy, and output efficiency. The results for the two different materials are compared...|$|R

50|$|An <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> (OC) is the {{component}} of a optical resonator that allows the extraction of {{a portion of the}} light from the laser's intracavity beam. An <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> most often consists of a partially reflective mirror, allowing a certain portion of the intracavity beam to transmit through. Other methods include the use of almost-totally reflective mirrors {{at each end of the}} cavity, emitting the beam either by focusing it into a small hole drilled in the center of one mirror, or by redirecting through the use of rotating mirrors, prisms, or other optical devices, causing the beam to bypass one of the end mirrors at a given time.|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} {{form of a}} CO2 laser {{consists}} of a gas discharge (with a mix close to that specified above) with a total reflector at one end, and an <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> (a partially reflecting mirror) at the output end.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coupling}} parameter [...] of a {{laser resonator}} determines, {{what part of}} the energy of the laser field in the cavity goes out at each round-trip. This output can be determined by the transmitivity of the <b>output</b> <b>coupler,</b> or the magnification coefficient in the case of unstable cavity.|$|E
50|$|Instead of a {{metallic}} coating, a dichroic optical coating may be used. Depending on its characteristics, {{the ratio of}} reflection to transmission will vary {{as a function of}} the wavelength of the incident light. Dichroic mirrors are used in some ellipsoidal reflector spotlights to split off unwanted infrared (heat) radiation, and as <b>output</b> <b>couplers</b> in laser construction.|$|R

The method to make bead pull measurements for such devices is described...|$|R
50|$|At the {{continuous}} wave operation, the round-trip gain {{is determined by}} the coupling parameter and the round-trip loss. In simple configurations of the laser cavity or laser resonator, the coupling parameter may be just the transmission coefficient of the <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> or just square of the magnification coefficient in the case of unstable resonator.|$|E
50|$|The optical resonator, or optical cavity, in its {{simplest}} form is {{two parallel}} mirrors placed around the gain medium which provide feedback of the light. The mirrors are given optical coatings which determine their reflective properties. Typically {{one will be}} a high reflector, and the other will be a partial reflector. The latter is called the <b>output</b> <b>coupler,</b> because it allows some of the light to leave the cavity to produce the laser's output beam.|$|E
50|$|Lasers operate by {{reflecting}} light {{between two}} or more mirrors that have an active laser medium between them. The medium amplifies the light by stimulated emission. For lasing to occur, the gain of the active medium must be larger than the total loss, which includes both unwanted effects such as absorption, emission in directions other than the beam path, and the intentional release of energy through the <b>output</b> <b>coupler.</b> In other words, the laser must attain threshold.|$|E
25|$|Transmissivity is {{determined}} by the percentage of light transmitted per the incident light. Transmissivity is usually the same from both first and second surfaces. The combined transmitted and reflected light, subtracted from the incident light, measures the amount absorbed by both the coating and substrate. For transmissive mirrors, such as one-way mirrors, beam splitters, or laser <b>output</b> <b>couplers,</b> the transmissivity of the mirror is an important consideration. The transmissivity of metallic coatings are often determined by their thickness. For precision beam-splitters or <b>output</b> <b>couplers,</b> the thickness of the coating must be kept at very high tolerances to transmit the proper amount of light. For dielectric mirrors, the thickness of the coat must always be kept to high tolerances, but it is often more the number of individual coats that determine the transmissivity. For the substrate, the material used must also have good transmissivity to the chosen wavelengths. Glass is a suitable substrate for most visible-light applications, but other substrates such as zinc selenide or synthetic sapphire may be used for infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths.|$|R

50|$|Liquid dyes {{have very}} high gain as laser media. The beam {{needs to make}} only a few passes through the liquid to reach full design power, and hence, the high {{transmittance}} of the <b>output</b> <b>coupler.</b> The high gain also leads to high losses, because reflections from the dye-cell walls or flashlamp reflector cause parasitic oscillations, dramatically {{reducing the amount of}} energy available to the beam.

50|$|The {{most common}} type of laser uses {{feedback}} from an optical cavity—a pair of mirrors on either end of the gain medium. Light bounces {{back and forth between the}} mirrors, passing through the gain medium and being amplified each time. Typically one of the two mirrors, the <b>output</b> <b>coupler,</b> is partially transparent. Some of the light escapes through this mirror. Depending on the design of the cavity (whether the mirrors are flat or curved), the light coming out of the laser may spread out or form a narrow beam.

5000|$|Recently the {{development}} of high power fiber lasers has generated {{a new set of}} applications for fiber Bragg gratings (FBG’s), operating at power levels that were previously thought impossible. In the case of a simple fiber laser, the FBG’s can be used as the high reflector (HR) and <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> (OC) to form the laser cavity. The gain for the laser is provided by a length of rare earth doped optical fiber, with the most common form using Yb3+ ions as the active lasing ion in the silica fiber.

5000|$|The {{power of}} such lasers is limited {{not only by}} the power of pump available, but also by overheating, amplified {{spontaneous}} emission (ASE) andthe background round-trip loss.To avoid overheating, the size [...] should be increased with power scaling.Then, to avoid strong losses due to the exponential growth of the ASE, the transverse-trip gain [...] cannot be large.This requires reduction of the gain this gain is determined by the reflectivity of the <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> and thickness [...] The round-trip gain [...] should remain larger than the round-trip loss (the difference [...] determines the optical energy,which is output from the laser cavity at each round-trip).The reduction of gain , in a given round-trip loss ,requires increasing the thickness [...]Then, at some critical size, the disk becomes too thick and cannot be pumped above the threshold without overheating.|$|E
5000|$|A cavity dumper is an <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> that {{performs}} {{the function of}} a Q-switch. It allows the energy to build up in the optical cavity and then releases it at a specifically timed interval. This allows the beam to build up to high levels and then be released {{in a very short}} time; often within the time it takes a light wave to complete one round-trip through the cavity, hence the name. After building in intensity the cavity suddenly [...] "dumps" [...] its energy. Cavity dumpers usually use a high-reflective mirror on each end of the cavity, allowing the beam to receive full gain from the medium. At a specific interval, the beam is redirected, using a device such as a Pockels cell, an acousto-optic modulator, or a fast-rotating prism or mirror. This redirected beam bypasses the end mirror, allowing a very powerful pulse to be emitted. Cavity dumpers can be used for continuous-wave operation, but their most common use is with mode-locked lasers, to extract a very short pulse at its peak intensity.|$|E
50|$|The {{gain medium}} of the laser, as {{suggested}} by its name, {{is a mixture of}} helium and neon gases, in approximately a 10:1 ratio, contained at low pressure in a glass envelope. The gas mixture is mostly helium, so that helium atoms can be excited. The excited helium atoms collide with neon atoms, exciting some of them to the state that radiates 632.8 nm. Without helium, the neon atoms would be excited mostly to lower excited states responsible for non-laser lines. A neon laser with no helium can be constructed but it is much more difficult without this means of energy coupling. Therefore, a HeNe laser that has lost enough of its helium (e.g., due to diffusion through the seals or glass) will lose its laser functionality because the pumping efficiency will be too low. The energy or pump source of the laser is provided by a high voltage electrical discharge passed through the gas between electrodes (anode and cathode) within the tube. A DC current of 3 to 20 mA is typically required for CW operation. The optical cavity of the laser usually consists of two concave mirrors or one plane and one concave mirror, one having very high (typically 99.9%) reflectance and the <b>output</b> <b>coupler</b> mirror allowing approximately 1% transmission.|$|E
