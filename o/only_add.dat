5|$|Imelda {{knew that}} her husband Ferdinand Marcos had dreamed of {{becoming}} {{the president of the}} Philippines ever since he was a congressman. One reason why Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, was because she was a Romualdez—an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos believed she would not <b>only</b> <b>add</b> light to his daily life but also to his political career.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} SmarTrip {{features}} {{that were supposed}} to be introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could <b>only</b> <b>add</b> value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, after years of delays, WMATA announced that customers would have the ability to add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online reload feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers to load a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|The European Cup was {{retained}} in 1980, this time against Kevin Keegan's Hamburger SV at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Clough and Taylor then {{began the process}} of breaking up the championship winning team, selling off Martin O'Neill, Ian Bowyer, Garry Birtles, and Larry Lloyd; as a new team was built based around youngsters such as Gary Mills, Stuart Gray, Colin Walsh, and Bryn Gunn. New signings included striker Ian Wallace and Switzerland international Raimondo Ponte. Taylor retired in May 1982 after Forest finished 12th in the league, with recent signings Justin Fashanu and Raimondo Ponte proving to be unsuccessful. Clough would stay at Forest for another 11 seasons, but without Taylor would <b>only</b> <b>add</b> two League Cups and two Full Members Cups to the club's trophy cabinet, and would struggle against alcoholism.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} engine {{consists of}} a number of columns, numbered from 1 to N. The machine is able to store one decimal number in each column. The machine can <b>only</b> <b>add</b> the value of a column n+1 to column n to produce the new value of n. Column N can only store a , column 1 displays (and possibly prints) the value of the calculation on the current iteration.|$|E
25|$|A {{remarkable}} {{difference between}} tableau with unification {{and the other}} two calculi is that the latter two calculi only modify a tableau by adding new nodes to it, while the former one allows substitutions to modify the existing part of the tableau. More generally, tableau calculi are classed as destructive or non-destructive depending on whether they <b>only</b> <b>add</b> new nodes to tableau or not. Tableau with unification is therefore destructive, while propositional tableau and tableau without unification are non-destructive.|$|E

A state certificate was filed because the hospital saw a record number of patients in December. Accounting for an annual 4.5% growth rate, the hospital would be at 100% capacity by 2011. The hospital, however, has been achieving a 10% annual growth rate. The hospital is currently at 85% capacity.|$|E

25|$|On October 6, 1986, WCIX {{became a}} charter {{affiliate}} {{of the newly}} launched Fox Broadcasting Company, {{and was one of}} a handful of VHF stations to affiliate with the network, though the station was essentially still independent since Fox offered only an hour of late night programming at the time (consisting of the talk show The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers) and would <b>only</b> <b>add</b> two nights of primetime programming by the end of the station's tenure with the network.|$|E
25|$|When NOR flash was developed, it was envisioned {{as a more}} {{economical}} and conveniently rewritable ROM than contemporary EPROM and EEPROM memories. Thus random-access reading circuitry was necessary. However, {{it was expected that}} NORflash ROM would be read much more often than written, so the write circuitry included was fairly slow and could erase only in a block-wise fashion. On the other hand, applications that use flash as a replacement for disk drives do not require word-level write address, which would <b>only</b> <b>add</b> to the complexity and cost unnecessarily.|$|E
25|$|Egypt's fertile area totals about 3.3 million {{hectares}} (8.1 million acres), {{about one-quarter of}} which is land reclaimed from the desert. However, the reclaimed lands <b>only</b> <b>add</b> 7 percent to {{the total value of}} agricultural production. Even though only 3 percent of the land is arable, it is extremely productive and can be cropped two or even three times annually. Most land is cropped at least twice a year, but agricultural productivity is limited by salinity (which afflicts an estimated 35% of cultivated land) and drainage issues.|$|E

25|$|ENIAC was a modular computer, {{composed}} of individual panels to perform different functions. Twenty of these modules were accumulators {{which could not}} <b>only</b> <b>add</b> and subtract, but hold a ten-digit decimal number in memory. Numbers were passed between these units across several general-purpose buses (or trays, as they were called). In order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer and trigger the next operation, all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to branch; it could trigger different operations, depending on {{the sign of a}} computed result.|$|E
25|$|The mass of all {{the objects}} of the {{asteroid}} belt, lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, {{is estimated to be}} about 2.8–, or about 4% of the mass of the Moon. Of this, Ceres comprises , a third of the total. Adding in the next three most massive objects, Vesta (9%), Pallas (7%), and Hygiea (3%), brings this figure up to 51%; whereas the three after that, 511 Davida (1.2%), 704 Interamnia (1.0%), and 52 Europa (0.9%), <b>only</b> <b>add</b> another 3% to the total mass. The number of asteroids then increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{frustrated}} both Australia {{and neutral}} fans {{on the morning}} of the fourth day, but after four hours the sun finally broke through and the covers were taken off. It only took ten overs for Australia to wrap up England's innings, McGrath taking four of the five wickets required and Warne the last – Giles, Hoggard, Harmison and Simon Jones all gone for ducks – as England could <b>only</b> <b>add</b> 24 runs, 22 of them from Pietersen who was left stranded on an unbeaten 64 to have a Test batting average of 121 after the first match.|$|E

25|$|The bat {{dominated}} {{on a cold}} third day, with runs {{coming at}} around 5 an over, though this was aided by there being short boundaries. This allowed 362 runs to be scored, even though almost all the third session was lost to bad light. In the morning, Warwickshire's runs flowed freely. Although Powell <b>only</b> <b>add</b> 2, Brown moved on to 122, and Heath Streak had time to score 41 not out before Warwickshire declared on 564 for 8, 366 ahead. Elliott and David Hemp put on 162 for the second wicket. However, Matthew Maynard went for a duck, leaving Glamorgan on 213 for 4 at close.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{got their}} third {{successive}} draw against a county side at Leyton, with Victor Trumper making {{a pair of}} hundreds. Essex lost five wickets on the first day, with Frederick Fane, Charlie McGahey and Charles Kortright all passing 50. Jones took four wickets as Essex could <b>only</b> <b>add</b> a further 34 on the second day, before Australia were bowled out 113 short; Trumper made nearly half the total, while no Essex bowler took more than two wickets. Three more half-centuries, from Alfred Lucas, Percy Perrin and McGahey followed before Essex declared, and Australia batted out the day for a draw, Trumper making 119.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{that operate}} strong CSR {{activities}} tend to drive customer's attention to buy {{products or services}} regardless of the price. As a result, this increases competition among firms since customers {{are aware of the}} company's CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential differentiator because they not <b>only</b> <b>add</b> value to the company, but also to the products or services. Furthermore, firms under intense competition are able to leverage CSR to increase the impact of their distribution on the firm's performance. For instance, lowering the carbon footprint of a firm's distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential differentiators to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario, customers can observe the company's commitment to CSR while increasing company sales.|$|E
