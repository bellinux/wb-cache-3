50|$|In 1946 {{a number}} of Finnish {{state-owned}} heavy industry enterprises were combined to a single conglomerate called Valtion Metallitehtaat (State Metalworks), which acquired several shipyards in Helsinki, Turku and Uusikaupunki. The first ships were <b>oceangoing</b> <b>fishing</b> trawlers built in Suomenlinna for the Soviet Union {{as part of the}} Finnish war reparations. In 1950 the company was incorporated and its name was shortened to Valmet Oy, and in the following year a new shipyard was built in Katajanokka in downtown Helsinki. After the war reparations had been paid in full, the future of the state-owned shipyard remained uncertain until the Suez Crisis in 1956, which increased the worldwide demand for new ships and brought new contracts for Valmet as well. Later the company constructed a long series of accommodation ships for the Soviet Union.|$|E

Over a United States holiday period this vessel was sold to an associate of Weiner for $100 using the amended name of Litchfield I, even though the vessel was still registered in Panama to its original owners under its correct name. Through this strange paper trail the vessel eventually came into the physical possession of Weiner, who renamed it yet again as Sarah after his ex-wife. Weiner then asked Hungerford to register this vessel under the name of Sarah with Honduran Consulate officials in New York. This registration was later considered to be fraudulent, and the Honduran officials deleted their registration.|$|E

Subsequently, to meet the increased demand of trained manpower for manning <b>oceangoing</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels, two units were started, one at Madras (1968) and the other at Visakhapatnam (1981) ...|$|E
