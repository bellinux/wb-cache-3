5|$|From 1953 to 1957 Kerst was {{technical}} {{director of the}} Midwestern Universities Research Association, where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts, most notably the FFAG accelerator. He was then employed at General Atomics's John Jay Hopkins Laboratory from 1957 to 1962, where he worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of plasma physics. With Tihiro Ohkawa he invented toroidal devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields. Their devices {{were the first to}} contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs, and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, Oppenheimer reorganized the {{laboratory}} to focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of building an implosion-type nuclear weapon, which was necessary because the gun-type design {{would not work}} with plutonium. P Division was broken up, and Bacher became {{the head of the}} G (for Gadget) Division. This much larger division contained eleven groups headed by leaders who included William Higinbotham, Seth Neddermeyer, Edwin McMillan, Luis Alvarez and Otto Frisch.|$|E
5|$|The main {{design feature}} of the Mk. XIV was that it gave the bomb aimer more time to work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of {{bringing}} the aircraft to the proper location to drop the bombs. As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected crosshairs into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus {{their eyes on the}} target and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E

5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} touches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will {{to the human}} soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar {{to the formation of}} habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E
5|$|During the revolt, {{the ships}} were noted by many {{observers}} {{to be well}} handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, {{which led to a}} suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while São Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, while {{studying}} mathematics at Poznań University, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course {{conducted by the}} Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski to work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring {{after only a few}} weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages. His contributions included the cryptologic card catalog, derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, Fred Hoyle worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of how the various observed elements in the universe were produced. In 1946 he proposed that a massive star could generate the necessary thermonuclear reactions, and the nuclear reactions of heavy elements were responsible for the removal of energy necessary for a gravitational collapse to occur. The collapsing star became rotationally unstable, and produced an explosive expulsion of elements that were distributed into interstellar space. The concept that rapid nuclear fusion was the source of energy for a supernova explosion was developed by Hoyle and William Fowler during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{spent the}} rest of her life in Normandy, often acting as Henry's {{representative}} and presiding over the government of the Duchy. Early on, Matilda and her son issued charters in England and Normandy in their joint names, dealing with the various land claims that had arisen during the wars. Particularly in the initial years of his reign, the King drew on her for advice on policy matters. Matilda was involved in attempts to mediate between Henry and his Chancellor Thomas Becket when the two men fell out in the 1160s. Matilda had originally cautioned against the appointment, but when the Prior of Mont St Jacques asked her for a private interview on Becket's behalf to seek her views, she provided a moderate perspective <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Matilda explained that she disagreed with Henry's attempts to codify English customs, which Becket was opposed to, but also condemned poor administration in the English Church and Becket's own headstrong behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|The {{classification}} of birds is a contentious issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark {{work on the}} {{classification of}} birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about {{the relationships between the}} orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of delay line memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line, developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E
