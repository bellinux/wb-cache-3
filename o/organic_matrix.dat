5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the <b>organic</b> <b>matrix</b> or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E
5|$|Dentin is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with an <b>organic</b> <b>matrix</b> of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 μm near the pulp, to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900nm near the dentino-enamel junction. Although {{they may have}} tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.|$|E
5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an <b>organic</b> <b>matrix</b> is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E

30|$|From Fig.  7 one can {{see clearly}} that {{the surface of the}} raw fiber pulled out from the matrix was not {{subjected}} to any abrasion. This {{can be explained by the}} lack of compatibility between the fiber and the matrix. The residues of the <b>organic</b> <b>matrices</b> can be clearly seen on the surface of the fibers. This means the existence of a strong attachment between the two materials translated by the formation of strong links to the interface. These observations explain the increase in interfacial stress between DPFs and <b>organic</b> <b>matrices</b> after organosilane treatment.|$|R
25|$|Odontoblasts, the dentin-forming cells, {{differentiate}} from {{cells of the}} dental papilla. They begin secreting an <b>organic</b> <b>matrix</b> around the area directly adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium, closest {{to the area of}} the future cusp of a tooth. The <b>organic</b> <b>matrix</b> contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1–0.2μm in diameter). The odontoblasts begin to move {{toward the center of the}} tooth, forming an extension called the odontoblast process. Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix. This area of mineralization is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 150μm thick.|$|E
25|$|After dentin {{formation}} begins, {{the cells}} of the IEE secrete an <b>organic</b> <b>matrix</b> against the dentin. This matrix immediately mineralizes and becomes the initial layer of the tooth's enamel. Outside the dentin are the newly formed ameloblasts in response to the formation of dentin, which are cells that continue the process of enamel formation; therefore, enamel formation moves outwards, adding new material to the outer surface of the developing tooth.|$|E
25|$|Whereas mantle dentin forms {{from the}} preexisting ground {{substance}} of the dental papilla, primary dentin forms through a different process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an <b>organic</b> <b>matrix</b> for mineralization. Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause collagen to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous nucleation that is used for mineralization. Other materials (such as lipids, phosphoproteins, and phospholipids) are also secreted.|$|E

500|$|Also defined herewith: eggshell, yolk, albumen; chalaza. The organic vessel {{containing}} the zygote, in which birds develop until hatching. Eggs are usually oval in shape, {{and have a}} base white colour from the predominant calcium carbonate makeup of the outer shell, called the eggshell, though [...] birds especially may have eggs of other colours, such as through deposition of biliverdin and its zinc chelate, which give a green or blue ground colour, and protoporphyrin which produces reds and browns. A viable bird egg (as opposed to a non-viable egg: see [...] ) consists {{of a number of}} structures. The eggshell is 95–97% calcium carbonate crystals, at least in chickens, stabilized by a protein matrix, without which the crystalline structure would be too brittle to keep its form; the <b>organic</b> <b>matrix</b> is thought to have a role in deposition of calcium during the mineralization process. The structure and composition of the avian eggshell serves to protect the egg against damage and microbial contamination, prevention of desiccation, regulation of gas and water exchange for the growing embryo, and provides calcium for embryogenesis. Inside the eggshell are two shell membranes (inner and outer), and at the center is a yolk—a spherical structure, usually some shade of yellow, to which the fertilized gamete attaches and which the embryonic bird uses as sustenance as it grows. The yolk is suspended in the albumen (also called egg white or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. The albumen protects the yolk and provides additional nutrition for the embryo's growth, though it is made up of approximately 90% water in most birds. Prior to fertilization, the yolk is a single cell ovum or egg cell; one of the few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adjacent}} layer of {{cells in the}} dental papilla suddenly increases in size and differentiates into odontoblasts, which are the cells that form dentin. Researchers believe that the odontoblasts would not form {{if it were not}} for the changes occurring in the IEE. As the changes to the IEE and the formation of odontoblasts continue from the tips of the cusps, the odontoblasts secrete a substance, an <b>organic</b> <b>matrix,</b> into their immediate surrounding. The <b>organic</b> <b>matrix</b> contains the material needed for dentin formation. [...] As odontoblasts deposit <b>organic</b> <b>matrix</b> termed predentin, they migrate toward the center of the dental papilla. Thus, unlike enamel, dentin starts forming in the surface closest to the outside of the tooth and proceeds inward. Cytoplasmic extensions are left behind as the odontoblasts move inward. The unique, tubular microscopic appearance of dentin is a result of the formation of dentin around these extensions.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{amino acid}} {{composition}} of <b>organic</b> <b>matrices</b> associated with calcium carbonate precipitates in microbialites built by different Phormidium species (cyanobacteria) {{has been compared}} for samples recovered in lagoonal settings from two regions of the Southern Tropical Pacific separated by more than 4000 km: New Caledonia (Nouméa lagoon) and French Polynesia (Tikehau atoll). Calcium carbonate precipitation in these microbial structures was observed mainly {{in the interior of}} the domes and clearly separated from the photosynthetically active surface layer. This study focuses on the hydrolysable amino acid composition of the associated <b>organic</b> <b>matrices</b> that are typically rich in cysteine, leucine, alanine and arginine in New Caledonia, whereas they are particularly rich in dicarboxylic amino acids in French Polynesia. This striking difference is seemingly related to different environmental conditions that characterize the two reef settings. The high cysteine content suggests an origin from metallothioneins produced by the cyanobacteria and/or by epiphytic diatoms that were observed on the top layer, {{as the result of the}} input of metals from terrestrial origin in the Nouméa lagoon. In addition, we analysed the bulk organic matter of the photosynthetically active surface layer and of the interior of the domes. The former showed remarkable variations of amino acid composition throughout the year 2001, which may potentially reflect the impact of climatological events (e. g. cyclones) and/or a much stronger seasonality in New Caledonia than in French Polynesia.
