5|$|Space Travel is a spaceflight {{simulation}} video game, {{presented in}} a two-dimensional top-down view, with monochrome graphics consisting of white lines on a black background. In it, the player controls a spaceship as it flies through {{a representation of the}} solar system. The game has no specific objectives, other than to attempt to land on the various planets and moons of the system. The planets and most of the moons in the solar system are represented to scale both in size and distance from each other, though the orbits are simplified to be circles. To land on a body, the player's ship must cross the line representing the surface while moving at a low enough speed. The player is able to control the ship to go forwards and backwards and turn. The ship moves at a constant level of acceleration relative to the scale of the screen, which the player can control; scaling the screen up high enough allows the player to travel across the solar system in seconds, though they risk <b>overshooting</b> their target and becoming unable to find the solar system again, and scaling down allows the player to be moving slowly enough to land. The ship is always {{in the center of the}} screen, facing the top; turning the ship right or left therefore rotates the solar system around the ship instead.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, {{acting as}} Squadron Leader, No. 825 Squadron FAA {{took off with}} his Fairey Swordfish {{formation}} at 12:25 to attack the ships. No. 411 and 64 Squadron were to escort the FAA but arrived over Manston 15 minutes late and missed the rendezvous. The only unit to keep to mission orders was Squadron Leader Brian Kingcome's No. 72 Squadron. Unaware of the Swordfish squadron's location, they ran into each other by fortunate accident. Owing to low cloud cover, they dropped to between 50 and 100 feet. The heavy German fighter cover {{put an end to}} the protection the Spitfire's could provide as the RAF fighters now had to look after themselves. The Spitfires and Swordfish were engaged by Fw 190s of 8 staffel and 9 staffel./JG 26 led by Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Gerhard Sch√∂pfel of III./JG 26. The Fw 190s were just relieving fighters of JG 2. Frail and slow, the Swordfish forced German pilots to lower their undercarriages to prevent <b>overshooting</b> the biplanes. In the event all six Swordfish were shot down. The Spitfires destroyed three Fw 190s in return. Several Swordfish managed to fire off their torpedoes but none found their mark. Lieutenant Commander Esmonde was shot down and killed by an Fw 190. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. Only five of the original eighteen Swordfish crew survived. No. 41 Squadron RAF claimed three Bf 109s (most likely from JG 1) destroyed and one damaged off the Belgian coast. No. 72 Squadron claimed three Fw 190s destroyed and four damaged in the battles around 13:00. No. 410 Squadron claimed two Bf 109s destroyed and two damaged in the same dogfights. The German ships consumed very little ammunition, as the action had been carried out largely by the Luftwaffe.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{biological}} {{systems can be}} modeled by Markov chains. Recently, {{there has been an}} increasing concern about when biological systems modeled by Markov chains will perform a dynamic phenomenon called <b>overshoot.</b> In this article, we found that the steady-state behavior of the system will have a great effect on the occurrence of <b>overshoot.</b> We confirmed that <b>overshoot</b> in general cannot occur in systems which will finally approach an equilibrium steady state. We further classified <b>overshoot</b> into two types, named as simple <b>overshoot</b> and oscillating <b>overshoot.</b> We showed that except for extreme cases, oscillating <b>overshoot</b> will occur if the system is far from equilibrium. All these results clearly show that <b>overshoot</b> is a nonequilibrium dynamic phenomenon with energy consumption.

Except for some high-traffic sections around large cities and junctions, the network does not use automatic block systems. However, the signals at stations are almost invariably interlocked with the setting of points (routes) and so safety {{does not depend on}} the skill of the station masters.

Many reports from surviving passengers indicate that the train was travelling faster than normal. Plus, the driver might have been stressed because he would be punished both for having passed by a red light and for having overshot the platform at Itami Station. Ten months before the crash, Takami had been reprimanded for <b>overshooting</b> a station platform by 100 meters.

25|$|A {{derivative}} term {{does not}} consider the error (meaning it cannot bring it to zero: a pure D controller cannot bring the system to its setpoint), but {{the rate of change}} of error, trying to bring this rate to zero. It aims at flattening the error trajectory into a horizontal line, damping the force applied, and so reduces overshoot (error on the other side because too great applied force). Applying too much impetus when the error is small and is reducing will lead to overshoot. After <b>overshooting,</b> if the controller were to apply a large correction in the opposite direction and repeatedly overshoot the desired position, the output would oscillate around the setpoint in either a constant, growing, or decaying sinusoid. If the amplitude of the oscillations increase with time, the system is unstable. If they decrease, the system is stable. If the oscillations remain at a constant magnitude, the system is marginally stable.|$|E
25|$|Because of bad {{information}} {{and lack of}} reconnaissance, two of the Union divisions in the infantry attack did not hit the Confederate left flank, but their movement by chance helped them to roll up the Confederate line by coming {{at it from the}} end and rear. The first division in the attack under Brigadier General Romeyn B. Ayres alone overran the short right angled line {{on the left side of}} the Confederate main line. Sheridan's personal leadership helped encourage the men and focus them on their objective. Brigadier General Charles Griffin's division recovered from <b>overshooting</b> the Confederate left and helped roll up additional improvised Confederate defense lines. Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Samuel W. Crawford's division swept across north of the main battle but then closed off Ford's Church Road, swept down to Five Forks and helped disperse the last line of Confederate infantry resistance. The Union cavalry was somewhat less successful. Although they pushed the Confederate cavalry back, most escaped while most of the Confederate infantry became casualties or prisoners.|$|E

25|$|One {{practice}} session lasting {{half an hour}} was held on Thursday before the two races. Leimer for Racing Engineering set a benchmark which was the fastest time in the sole {{practice session}}‚Äîheld in variable weather conditions and warm track temperatures‚Äîwith a lap of one minute and 41.361 seconds on the hard compound tyres, one second faster than any one else on the track. His closest challenger was Sam Bird in second in front of third-placed Coletti and Rossi in fourth position. Marcus Ericsson was fifth-fastest, ahead of Nasr. Calado was seventh-fastest, Tom Dillmann eighth, Johnny Cecotto Jr. ninth and Daniel Abt completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Frijns spun early on but recovered without needing external assistance. Smoke bellowed out of Cecotto's car while driving at high-speed and later locked his tyres at the first corner before <b>overshooting</b> into the sand. Juli√°n Leal stalled at the exit of the pit lane and {{this led to a}} stewards investigation over whether his team's mechanics restarted the car outside of the limits of the pit lane.

His suspension broke while attempting {{to return to the}} pit lane, prematurely ending his race. F√©lix da Costa was able to reduce the time deficit to Sette Camara to be 0.7 seconds behind at the end of lap four until the safety car was deployed following a crash by Mazepin at Faraway corner; the accident was caused by Mazepin <b>overshooting</b> the turn. At the lap-seven restart, Sette C√£mara reacted late to the safety car driving into the pit lane, and F√©lix da Costa ran near his teammate, drafted him heading into Mandarin corner, and turned right onto the outside line to gain the lead before the braking point going into Lisboa corner. F√©lix da Costa began to pull away from Sette C√£mara, leading the driver by 1.7 seconds by the start of lap 10 which saw the second deployment of the safety car when Cassidy (who started from 28th after changing his engine) impacted the Paiol corner barrier. The race restarted three laps later with F√©lix da Costa leading Sette C√£mara. The Brazilian driver drew alongside his Carlin teammate driving towards Lisboa corner but F√©lix da Costa held the lead by moving to the inside line.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Daytona, Johnson started 12th and led 35 laps before {{finishing}} {{second to}} Dale Earnhardt, Jr., in {{a repeat of}} the Talladega race. At Kentucky, Johnson started sixth and ran inside the top ten for most of the night, finishing ninth. At the second stop in Pocono, Johnson, along with two of his Hendrick teammates, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Earnhardt, Jr, took advantage of several cars running out of fuel to finish in the Top 6 (Gordon finished 3rd, Dale Jr. took 4th, Johnson grabbed 6th). At Watkins Glen, despite suffering two penalties (lap 3: <b>Overshooting</b> the entrance to the inner loop, and caution No. 1 (lap 26-28): Speeding through pit road) Johnson rallied to finish 10th. He wasn't so lucky at Michigan; late in the race, he got loose and spun in turn 3, and damaged the splitter on his car, resulting in a 39th-place finish (10 laps down). He rebounded at Bristol by finishing 4th, but had bad luck once more at Darlington. He spun out on lap 134 in turn 4, bringing out the 7th caution, and was never a real threat. He ended up 19th.

25|$|Yet the {{majority}} of World War II engines used superchargers, because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers, which were larger, involved extra piping, and required exotic high-temperature materials in the turbine and pre-turbine section of the exhaust system. The size of the piping alone is a serious issue; American fighters Vought F4U and Republic P-47 used the same engine, but the huge barrel-like fuselage of the latter was, in part, needed to hold the piping {{to and from the}} turbocharger {{in the rear of the}} plane. Turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines. Pilots must make smooth, slow throttle adjustments to avoid <b>overshooting</b> their target manifold pressure. The fuel/air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of stoichiometric combustion needs to avoid pre-ignition or detonation in the engine when running at high power settings. In systems using a manually operated wastegate, the pilot must be careful not to exceed the turbocharger's maximum rpm. The additional systems and piping increase an aircraft engine's size, weight, complexity and cost. A turbocharged aircraft engine costs more to maintain than a comparable normally aspirated engine. The great majority of World War II American heavy bombers used by the USAAF, particularly the Wright R-1820 Cyclone-9 powered B-17 Flying Fortress, and Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp powered Consolidated B-24 Liberator four-engine bombers both used similar models of General Electric-designed turbochargers in service, as did the twin Allison V-1710-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning American heavy fighter during the war years.|$|E

40|$|The {{detached}} {{eclipsing binary}} stars with convective cores {{provide a good}} tool to investigate the convective core <b>overshoot.</b> It has been performed on some binary stars to restrict the classical <b>overshoot</b> model which simply extends the boundary of fully mixed region. However, the classical <b>overshoot</b> model is physically unreasonable and inconsistent with the helioseismic investigation. An updated model of the <b>overshoot</b> mixing was established recently. There is a key parameter in the model. In this paper, we use the observations of four eclipsing binary stars, i. e., HY Vir, YZ Cas, œá^ 2 Hya and VV Crv, to investigate the suitable value for the parameter. It is found that the suggested value by the calibrations on eclipsing binary stars is same as the recommended value by other ways.
