Emerald, while escorting a Spanish polacca that she had taken, spotted and captured the privateer on 14 April after a ten-hour chase. Austerlitz had been out of port two days but had made no captures; the polacca was the Spanish ship Prince of Asturias, which had sailed from La Guayra with a cargo <b>of</b> <b>cocoa,</b> bark and indigo.

Atangana also received 2% of all taxes collected by lower chiefs, pay for his legal role, and stipends for organising road construction. Oral informants have reported that as early as 1924, he owned enormous plantations with as much as 1km² <b>of</b> <b>cocoa,</b> 1.1km² of palms, 5km² of food crops, and 500 head of livestock. The amounts may be exaggerated, but Atangana was by all accounts a wealthy man. He owned two lorries and a car by 1926, which he used to haul produce from his plantations. By the 1930s, important chiefs such as Atangana could earn more than 400,000francs per year on tax collecting alone.|$|E

5|$|Attacks on two brigantines were {{reported}} by Renato Beluche on February 12, 1824, and published in El Colombiano several days later. The first was Boniton, captained by Alexander Murdock, which sailed with a load <b>of</b> <b>cocoa</b> from Trinidad and was intercepted en route to Gibraltar. The second, Bonne Sophie, sailed from Havre de Grace {{under the command of}} a man named Chevanche with dry goods bound for Martinique. In both cases, the sailors were beaten and imprisoned and the ships plundered. The ships were part of a convoy escorted by the Bolívar off Puerto Real, Cabo Rojo, and Cofresí captained a ship identified by Beluche as a pailebot (a small schooner). Although Bolívar could not capture her, her crew described the vessel as painted black, armed with a rotating cannon and having a crew of twenty unidentified Puerto Rican men. Cofresí was presumably leading the vessels to dock at Pedernales, where Mendoza and his brother could facilitate the distribution of loot with the aid of official inertia. From there, other associates usually used Boquerón Bay for transportation and ensured that the loot reached stores in Cabo Rojo and nearby towns.|$|E

Moreover, 540 acres <b>of</b> <b>cocoa,</b> 580 acres of papaya, and at least 382 acres of lemon trees were also destroyed by Eugene.

One man died in Venustiano Carrazano when a palm tree was blown over. Another man perished in Manzanillo when he was struck by a fallen palm tree. Over 5,000people were left homeless (mostly from poor and rural areas), including 60people in Manzanillo.
