40|$|Some new oxime ethers {{of types}} 7 and 8, {{in which the}} methyleneaminoxy group, CN−O, of <b>oxiconazole</b> 6 is in an {{inverted}} atomic sequence, were synthesized and tested for their antifungal activities. Among them, the type 7 compounds, such as the N-ethoxy-morpholino-substituted derivatives 7 l−o (Table 1), showed good antifungal properties against the Candida strains tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values {{similar to those of}} the reference drug 6. A remarkable result was obtained with these types of azoles, which had shown a cidal character against Candida albicans, while the reference drug <b>oxiconazole</b> was only fungistatic in the same tests. This fact may be seen from a comparison of the MIC values with those of the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values for most of the type 7 compounds assayed that have shown differences between the MIC and the MFC, which are lower than three double diluitions. A simple molecular modeling of the P 450 14 -α-sterol demethylase from C. albicans (Candida P 450 DM) was built in order to understand how the structural differences between type 7 compounds and <b>oxiconazole</b> 6 can induce different antifungal profiles. The results of this work seem to confirm that it is possible to reverse the atomic sequence of the methyleneaminoxy group, CN−O, of 6, obtaining new imidazoles possessing good antifungal properties...|$|E
40|$|After {{clinical}} diagnosis and microscopic confirmation, tinea cruris is best {{treated with a}} topical allylamine or an azole antifungal (strength of recommendation: A, based on multiple randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). Differences in current comparison data are insufficient to stratify the 2 groups of topical antifungals. Determining which group to use depends on patient compliance, medication accessibility, and cost. The fungicidal allylamines (naftifine and terbinafine) and butenafine (allylamine derivative) are a more costly group of topical tinea treatments, yet they are more convenient as they allow for a shorter duration of treatment compared with fungistatic azoles (clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, <b>oxiconazole,</b> miconazole, and sulconazole) ...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{infections are}} a major burden {{to the health and}} welfare of modern humans. They range from simply cosmetic, non-life-threatening skin infections to severe, {{systemic}} infections that may lead to significant debilitation or death. The selection of chemotherapeutic agents useful for the treatment of fungal infections is small. In this overview, a major chemical group with antifungal activity, the azole derivatives, is examined. Included are historical and state of the art information on the in vitro activity, experimental in vivo activity, mode of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical studies, and uses and adverse reactions of imidazoles currently marketed (clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, bifonazole, butoconazole, croconazole, fenticonazole, isoconazole, <b>oxiconazole,</b> sulconazole, and tioconazole) and under development (aliconazole and omoconazole), as well as triazoles currently marketed (terconazole) and under development (fluconazole, itraconazole, vibunazole, alteconazole, and ICI 195, 739) ...|$|E
40|$|While {{many members}} of the black yeasts genus Cladophialophora have been {{reported}} to cause diseases in humans, understanding of their natural niche is frequently lacking. Some species can be recovered from the natural environment by means of selective isolation techniques. The present study focuses on a Cladophialophora strain that caused an interdigital tinea nigra-like lesion in a HIV-positive Brazilian child. The fungal infection was successfully treated with <b>oxiconazole.</b> Similar strains had been recovered from the environment in Brazil, Uruguay and the Netherlands. The strains were characterized by sequencing the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions and the small subunit (SSU) of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene, as well as the elongation factor 1 -alpha (EF 1 alpha) gene. Since no match with any known species was found, it is described as the new species, Cladophialophora saturnica...|$|E
40|$|Pregnane X {{receptor}} (PXR, NR 1 I 2) {{is activated}} by various chemically unrelated compounds, including environmental pollutants and drugs. We proceeded here to in vitro screening of 28 pesticides {{with a new}} reporter system that detects human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) activators. The cell line was obtained by a two-step stable transfection of cervical cancer HeLa cells. The first transfected cell line, HG 5 LN, contained an integrated luciferase reporter gene {{under the control of}} a GAL 4 yeast transcription factor–binding site. The second cell line HGPXR was derived from HG 5 LN and stably expressed hPXR ligand-binding domain fused to GAL 4 DNA-binding domain (DBD).

40|$|Azole {{antifungal}} drug ketoconazole {{has recently}} been demonstrated as an inhibitor of a ligand-induced pregnane X receptor (PXR) -medi-ated transcriptional regulation of the CYP 3 A 4 gene through disrup-tion of PXR interaction with steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) - 1. In contrast, other clotrimazole-derived antifungal agents are known as potent inducers of CYP 3 A 4 through PXR. In the present study, we examined effects of azole antimycotics clotrimazole, ketoconazole, econazole, <b>oxiconazole,</b> miconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole on PXR-mediated expression of CYP 3 A 4. We investigated individual effects of the tested azoles {{as well as their}} action on rifampicin-induced PXR-mediated transactivation and expression of CYP 3 A 4 in LS 174 T cell line and primary human hepatocytes, their interactions with PXR ligand-binding domain, and azole-mediated recruitment of SRC- 1 to PXR.

40|$|Nitrobenzimidazole and nitroindole derivatives, {{related to}} <b>oxiconazole</b> and {{characterized}} by an oxyiminic function, have been synthesized as novel antimycotics and their mutagenk activity tested in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 100 and TA 98 with and without an exogenous metabolizing system. TA 98 NR and TA 98 / 1, 8 -DNP 6 strains were employed to identify a specific metabolic reaction which governs the mutagenk potency. Active compounds are weak direct-acting mutagens. Only derivatives bearing a nitro group on the phenyl ring linked to the oxyiminic function and lacking halogenated substituents show mutagenk activity. Metabolism by bacterial enzyme systems {{is important to the}} expression of genotoxicity. The reductive activation of nltro-benzimidazoles and nitroindoles carried out by the 'classical' nitroreductase of Salmonella, whkh is defective in TA 98 NR, is required of mutagenkity. Similarly, the 0 -acetyltransferase defective in TA 98 / 1, 8 -DNP 6 is required for the efficient production of the ultimate electrophilic nitrogen species, which react with DNA. The role of bacterial metabolism in mutation induction needs careful consideration to assess the potential risk to humans from nitrobenzimidazole and nitroindole antimycotics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{currently}} available antifungal drugs suffer from toxicity, greatest potential drug interactions with other drugs, insufficient pharmacokinetics properties, {{and development of}} resistance. Thus, development of new antifungal agents with optimum pharmacokinetics and less toxicity is urgent task. In the search for new azole antifungals, we have been previously described azolylchromanone oxime ethers as rigid analogs of <b>oxiconazole.</b> In continuation of our work, we incorporated phenylhydrazone moiety instead of oxime ether fragment in azolylchromanone derivatives. Methods The 3 -azolyl- 4 -chromanone phenylhydrazones were synthesized via ring closure of 2 -azolyl- 2 '-hydroxyacetophenones and subsequent reaction with phenylhydrazine. The biological activity of title compounds was evaluated against different pathogenic fungi including Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, and Microsporum gypseum. Docking study, in silico toxicity risks and drug-likeness predictions were used to better define of title compounds as antifungal agents. Results The in vitro antifungal activity of compounds based on MIC values revealed that all compounds showed good antifungal activity against C. albicans, S. cerevisiae and M. gypseum at concentrations less than 16 μg/mL. Among the test compounds, 2 -methyl- 3 -imidazolyl derivative 3 b {{showed the highest values}} of drug-likeness and drug-score. Conclusion The 3 -azolyl- 4 -chromanone phenylhydrazones considered as analogs of 3 -azolyl- 4 -chromanone oxime ethers basically designed as antifungal agents. The antifungal activity of title compounds was comparable to that of standard drug fluconazole. The drug-likeness data of synthesized compounds make them promising leads for future development of antifungal agents. </p...|$|E
40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Although the {{majority}} of Lyme patients can be cured with standard 2 – 4 week antibiotic treatment, 10 %– 20 % of patients continue to suffer from prolonged post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the cause for this is unclear, persisting organisms not killed by current Lyme antibiotics may be involved. In our previous study, we screened an FDA drug library and reported 27 top hits that showed high activity against Borrelia persisters. In this study, we present {{the results of an}} additional 113 active hits that have higher activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi than the currently used Lyme antibiotics. Many antimicrobial agents (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, anthelmintics or antiparasitics) used for treating other infections were found to have better activity than the current Lyme antibiotics. These include antibacterials such as rifamycins (3 -formal-rifamycin, rifaximin, rifamycin SV), thiostrepton, quinolone drugs (sarafloxacin, clinafloxacin, tosufloxacin), and cell wall inhibitors carbenicillin, tazobactam, aztreonam; antifungal agents such as fluconazole, mepartricin, bifonazole, climbazole, <b>oxiconazole,</b> nystatin; antiviral agents zanamivir, nevirapine, tilorone; antimalarial agents artemisinin, methylene blue, and quidaldine blue; antihelmintic and antiparasitic agents toltrazuril, tartar emetic, potassium antimonyl tartrate trihydrate, oxantel, closantel, hycanthone, pyrimethamine, and tetramisole. Interestingly, drugs used for treating other non-infectious conditions including verteporfin, oltipraz, pyroglutamic acid, pidolic acid, and dextrorphan tartrate, that act on the glutathione/γ-glutamyl pathway involved in protection against free radical damage, and also the antidepressant drug indatraline, were found to have high activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Among the active hits, agents that affect cell membranes, energy production, and reactive oxygen species production are more active against the B. burgdorferi persisters than the commonly used antibiotics that inhibit macromolecule biosynthesis. Future studies are needed to evaluate and optimize the promising active hits in drug combination studies in vitro and also in vivo in animal models. These studies may have implications for developing more effective treatments of Lyme disease...|$|E
