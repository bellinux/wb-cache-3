40|$|Seismic {{velocity}} {{models of}} the near-subsurface (< 30 m) better explain seismic velocities when all elements of total effective stress are considered, especially in materials with large cohesive and capillary pressures such as clays. Current constitutive elastic models that predict velocities in granular materials simplify the effect of total effective stress by equating it to net <b>overburden</b> <b>stress,</b> excluding interparticle stresses. A new proposed methodology calculates elastic moduli of granular matrices in near-surface environments by incorporating an updated definition of total effective stress into Hertz-Mindlin theory and calculates the elastic moduli of granular materials by extending Biot-Gassmann theory to include pressure effects induced by water saturation changes. At shallow depths, theoretically calculated seismic velocities decrease in clay and increase in sand {{with an increase in}} water saturation because interparticle stresses suppress the Biot-Gassmann effect. For standard sand and clay properties, net <b>overburden</b> <b>stress</b> becomes more influential than interparticle stresses at depths greater than 1 m in sand and 100 m in clay. In clays, the variation of seismic velocity with water saturation is almost double the range predicted when only net <b>overburden</b> <b>stress</b> is considered to influence stress at the grain contacts.

In this paper, the results of large-scale (2 m sample diameter) tests to investigate the compressibility of 50, 200 and 450 mm nominal-size tyre shreds are compared with data from the literature for smaller-size shreds and whole tyres. Tests were carried out at vertical stresses up to 600 kPa, representing landfill depths of up to about 60 m. Generally whole tyres and larger-size segments compress more in overall volume terms on initial loading than smaller size shreds. At vertical stresses greater than about 80 kPa, however, the differences on a graph of dry density or porosity plotted against vertical stress are much smaller. The proportion of voids that are not free-draining decreases with compression for whole tyres, as cup-like structures capable of retaining water flatten out. For tyre chips, the proportion of non-drainable voids increases with compression, suggesting that flow pathways are being lost. The dependence of the compressive behaviour of tyres and tyre chips on the particle shape is discussed, and the need for a more detailed and rigorous way of characterising particle size and shape is highlighted...|$|R
