5|$|Maurice Princet {{joined us}} <b>often...</b> <b>it</b> was {{as an artist}} that he {{conceptualized}} mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked n-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.|$|E

On other occasions he visited his parents in Lexington, Kentucky. In both places, Union spies attempted to capture Hines, but he always escaped, even after {{his father had been}} captured and his mother was sick in bed.|$|E

5|$|Royal {{intermarriage}} is {{the practice}} of members of ruling dynasties marrying into other reigning families. It was more commonly {{done in the past}} as part of strategic diplomacy for national interest.

5|$|Solitary {{bees are}} {{important}} pollinators; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. <b>Often</b> <b>it</b> {{is mixed with}} nectar to form a paste-like consistency. Some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. A very few species of solitary bees are being cultured for commercial pollination. Most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences, namely: carpenter bees, sweat bees, mason bees, polyester bees, squash bees, dwarf carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, alkali bees and digger bees.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin mostly pounces on prey on the ground, {{although}} it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. Less <b>often,</b> <b>it</b> gleans (takes prey while perched) in low-lying vegetation, almost always less than 3m (10ft) above the ground. The prey is most commonly on the ground when caught, although airborne insects are sometimes taken. A low branch {{may be used as}} a vantage point in hunting.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most <b>often</b> <b>it</b> is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the {{subjects}} of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but <b>often</b> <b>it</b> does.|$|E
5|$|Like most shooter games, first-person {{shooters}} involve an avatar, {{one or more}} ranged weapons, and a varying {{number of}} enemies. Because they {{take place in a}} 3D environment, these games tend to be somewhat more realistic than 2D shooter games, and have more accurate representations of gravity, lighting, sound and collisions. First-person shooters played on personal computers are most often controlled with a combination of a keyboard and mouse. This system has been claimed as superior to that found in console games, which frequently use two analog sticks: one used for running and sidestepping, the other for looking and aiming. It is common to display the character's hands and weaponry in the main view, with a head-up display showing health, ammunition and location details. <b>Often,</b> <b>it</b> is possible to overlay a map of the surrounding area.|$|E

5|$|Mainly nocturnal, {{the female}} redback {{lives in an}} untidy web in a warm {{sheltered}} location, commonly near or inside human residences. It preys on insects, spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites, before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. <b>Often,</b> <b>It</b> first squirts its victim with what resembles 'superglue' from its spinnerets, immobilising the prey by sticking the victim's limbs and appendages to its own body. The Redback Spider then trusses the victim with silk. Once its prey is restrained, it is bitten repeatedly on the head, body and leg segments and is then hauled back to the Redback Spider's retreat. Sometimes a potentially dangerous victim can be left to struggle for hours until it is exhausted enough to approach safely. Male spiders and spiderlings often live {{on the periphery of}} the female spiders' web and steal leftovers. Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The redback is one of few arachnids that usually display sexual cannibalism while mating.|$|E
5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting {{for one to}} make the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. <b>Often</b> <b>it</b> would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. <b>Often</b> <b>it</b> occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts {{for more than a few}} minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E

5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that <b>often</b> <b>it</b> may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.|$|E
5|$|The Draupadi cult {{emphasizes}} another boon: Krishna allows Aravan {{to witness}} the entire duration of the Mahabharata war {{through the eyes of}} his severed head. In another 18-day festival, the ceremonial head of Aravan is hoisted on a post {{to witness the}} ritual re-enactment of the Mahabharata war. The head of Aravan is a common motif in Draupadi temples. <b>Often</b> <b>it</b> is a portable wooden head; sometimes it even has its own shrine in the temple complex or is placed on the corners of temple roofs as a guardian against spirits. Aravan is worshipped in the form of his severed head and is believed to cure disease and induce pregnancy in childless women.|$|E
5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are little known, {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More <b>often</b> <b>it</b> would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E

5|$|The script {{received}} constant {{input from}} the producers and from Shatner and Nimoy. The discussions led to repeated rewrites, {{right up to the}} day the pages were to be shot. At one point, scenes were being rewritten so <b>often</b> <b>it</b> became necessary to note on script pages the hour of the revision. Though changes were constant, the biggest push for alteration revolved around the ending. Much of the rewriting {{had to do with the}} relationships of Kirk and Spock, Decker and Ilia, and the Enterprise and Vger. A final draft of the third act was approved in late September 1978, but had it not been for a Penthouse interview where NASA director Robert Jastrow said that mechanical forms of life were likely, the ending may not have been approved at all.|$|E
5|$|The severed head of Aravan is {{a common}} motif in Draupadi's temples. <b>Often</b> <b>it</b> is a {{portable}} wooden head; sometimes this even has its own shrine in the temple complex. Icons of Aravan's head are also often placed on the corners and edges of Draupadi temple roofs. As a pey or bhuta (spirit), Aravan acts as a guardian against other spirits, for the temple itself, and also for the Patukalam ceremony. Patukalam, in the Draupadi cult, is the symbolic ground on which the Mahabharata war is ritually re-enacted. In the taluks of Thajavur, Kumbhakonam and Pattukkotai, Aravan's head is enshrined permanently in a mandapa or within a temple niche. The largest known Aravan head is found at the Hajiyar Teru temple in Kumbhakonam.|$|E
5|$|Tigers {{generally}} do not prey on fully grown adult Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros but incidents have been reported. More <b>often,</b> <b>it</b> is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken. Tigers have been reported attacking and killing elephants ridden by humans during tiger hunts in the 19th century. When {{in close proximity to}} humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys. Old or wounded tigers, unable to catch wild prey, can become man-eaters; this pattern has recurred frequently across India. An exception is in the Sundarbans, where healthy tigers prey upon fishermen and villagers in search of forest produce, humans thereby forming a minor part of the tiger's diet. Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for dietary fibre such as fruit of the slow match tree.|$|E
