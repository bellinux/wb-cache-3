5|$|Mrs Beeton's Book <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> Management, also {{published}} as Mrs Beeton's Cookery Book, is an extensive guide to running a household in Victorian Britain, edited by Isabella Beeton and first published {{as a book}} in 1861. It had previously been published in parts. It was originally entitled Beeton's Book <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> Management, {{as one of the}} series of guide-books published by her husband, Samuel Beeton. The recipes were highly structured, in contrast to earlier cookbooks. It was illustrated with many monochrome and colour plates.|$|E
5|$|The format {{remained}} largely unchanged from previous seasons. HouseGuests were incarcerated in the Big Brother House with no contact {{to and from}} the outside world. Each week, the HouseGuests took part in several compulsory challenges that determined who would win food, luxuries and power in the House. The winner of the Head <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> competition was immune from nominations and was instructed to nominate two fellow HouseGuests for eviction. After a HouseGuest became Head <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> he or she was ineligible {{to take part in the}} next Head <b>of</b> <b>Household</b> competition.|$|E

5|$|Generally, each {{household}} prepares one badnjak, {{although more}} are cut in some regions. Depending {{on the local}} custom, Montenegrin Serbs may fell two, three, an arbitrary number greater than two, or the number equal to the male members <b>of</b> <b>household</b> plus one. The latter means {{that each of the}} males has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the head <b>of</b> <b>household</b> and the thinnest linked to the family's prosperity. If there is only one man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree. In parts of the Bay of Kotor, each household prepares four sets of badnjaks, as they are burned there not only on Christmas Eve, but also on the eves of New Years Day, Epiphany, and the Feast of Saint Sava.|$|E
