40|$|Bi-fuel spark {{ignition}} engines, nowadays widely spread, are usually equipped with two independent injection systems, in order run the engine either with gasoline or with gaseous fuel, {{which can be}} Natural Gas (NG) or Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). These gases, besides lower cost and environmental impact, are also characterized by a higher knock resistance with respect to gasoline that allows to adopt a stoichiometric proportion with air also at full load. Gasoline, on the other hand, being injected as liquid, maintains higher volumetric efficiency and hence higher power output. As a compromise solution, it could be desired to exploit the advantages of both gasoline and gas (NG or LPG), thus performing a Double- Fuel injection: as already experimented by the authors [1, 2], the addition of gaseous fuel to the gasoline/air mixture increases knocking resistance, allowing to run the engine with both “overall stoichiometric” mixture (thus lowering fuel consumption and emissions) and better spark advance (which increases engine efficiency) even at full load: the results showed high improvements in engine efficiency without noticeable power losses respect to the pure gasoline operation. Since no references {{have been found in}} literature on the Octane Number of both NG-gasoline and LPGgasoline blends, the authors decided to experimentally determine the knock resistance increase due to gaseous fuel addition to normal air-gasoline mixtures. A wide experimental campaign has been carried out in order to evaluate the correlation between the gaseous fuel-gasoline mixture composition and its overall knock resistance measured in terms of Motor Octane Number (MON). To this purpose, a CFR engine was endowed with two independent injection systems in order to realize mixtures with different proportion between gaseous fuels and gasoline and control the <b>overall</b> <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio.</b> The experimental results presented in this paper are quite innovative and will be fundamental for future study on the simultaneous combustion of gaseous fuel and gasoline. The experimental results showed that the relationship between the mixture MON and gaseous fuel concentration in the blend is not linear and is quite different between NG-gasoline and LPG-gasoline blends...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{pressure}} {{development in a}} combustion chamber is uniquely related to the combustion process, substantial variations in the combustion process on a cycle-by-cycle basis are occurring. To this end, an experimental study of cycle-by-cycle variation in a direct injection spark ignition engine fueled with natural gas-hydrogen blends combined with exhaust gas recirculation at relative <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratios</b> was conducted. The impacts of relative <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratios</b> (i. e. λ = 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 3 and 1. 4 which represent stoichiometric, moderately lean, lean and very lean mixtures respectively), hydrogen fractions and EGR rates were studied. The results showed that increasing the relative <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> increases the COVIMEP. The behavior is more pronounced at the larger relative <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratios.</b> More so, for a specified EGR rate; increasing the hydrogen fractions decreases the maximum COVIMEP value just as increasing in EGR rates increases the maximum COVIMEP value. (i. e. When percentage EGR rates is increased from 0 % to 17 % and 20 % respectively. The maximum COVIMEP value increases from 6. 25 % to 6. 56 % and 8. 30 % respectively).

40|$|Abstract This study {{presents}} {{a method for}} calculating the spatially resolved, time or phase averaged heat release of an unconfined, turbulent methane-air swirl flame from laser optical and chemiluminescence measurements. For optimal optical access the perfectly premixed flame is operated unconfined. As a consequence the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> of the flame is not constant due to ambient air entrainment. Therefore, the unconfined flame is a realistic model flame for technical applications with <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> gradients. The heat release is calculated from a formulation of the first law of thermodynamics, using {{the density of the}} air-fuel mixture, the heat capacity, the fluid velocity and the fluid temperature. Since density, heat capacity and temperature are functions of the local <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> and the reaction progress of combustion, the fluid velocity, the reaction progress of combustion and the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> are measured in this study. Optical methods are most suitable to obtain these values, as they are non-invasive and can provide spatially resolved data at high repetition rates. The flow velocity is measured via Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and the reaction progress of combustion via planar Laser Induced Fluorescence of the OH radical (OH-PLIF). The <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> is determined from spectrally resolved chemiluminescence measurements. In former studies complete chemiluminescence spectra were measured. Because of the limitation of spectrometers to 1 -dimensional spatial resolution, the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> of the complete flame volume could only be obtained by the sequential measurement of different planes of the flame volume. Thus, the achievable spatial resolution was only in the range of several millimeters. In this study a newly developed chemiluminescence measurement technique is presented, which overcomes this limitation. Measurements of a spectrometer are combined with bandpass filtered camera measurements to obtain the desired spectrally resolved information with high spatial resolution...|$|R

40|$|This thesis embraces {{simulations}} of NOx emissions from a partially premixed 20 kW swirl burner. The simulations {{were carried out}} in the commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLUENT. The concept of partial premixing air and fuel before adding additional air for complete combustion has proven promising with a view on the NOx emissions. However, little research has been done on reach premixing of fuel and air and therefore further investigation of this topic is of interest. In most experiments in the literature methane is used as fuel, but due to problems with stability and blow off in the 20 kW swirl burner propane were chosen as fuel. Simulations of eight different <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratios</b> have been performed, ranging from diffusion flame to a mass based <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> of four. The results from these simulations proved satisfactory when comparing with previous experimental and simulated work, except from the calculations of the exact NOx concentration. This difference in the concentration was one the other hand expected since the power of FLUENT and similar software is to predict variation trends and not the exact value itself. The simulations showed that the NOx concentration increased with increasing premixing, reaching a local peak at an <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> of two. After this a local minimum in the NOx concentration was observed before a strong increase when further raising the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio.</b> This is the same trends that are observed in the literature when using methane as fuel, but for propane there is no global reduction in the NOx emissions when applying premixing. This increase in the NOx emission was found to be due to an expansion of the high temperature flame zone with increasing premixing, which benefits the thermal NOx formation mechanism. The NOx reducing effect of swirl generation observed to decrease when the <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> was increased. For subsequent experimental work it is recommended to perform a high amount of experiments at different <b>air-fuel</b> <b>ratios,</b> especially in the ratio range where the NOx concentrations starts to fluctuate...|$|R
