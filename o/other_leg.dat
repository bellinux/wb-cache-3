5|$|As {{it existed}} before the {{designation}} was removed, M-114 {{started at the}} corner of BYP US16 (28th Street) and what is now East Beltline Avenue in Paris Township (now Kentwood) and ran northward. The trunkline intersected the mainline for US16/M-50 at Cascade Road and the mainline for M-21 at Fulton Street near East Grand Rapids in Grand Rapids Township. Further north, the highway split into two. In Plainfield Township, a leg of M-114 continued west along the modern 3Mile Road through an intersection with US131 to terminate at Coit Avenue near the Grand River and the <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> continued north to a terminus with US131 at Northland Drive and Plainfield Avenue.|$|E
5|$|At Cyber Sunday during DX's {{feud with}} Rated-RKO, special guest referee Eric Bischoff allowed the illegal {{use of a}} weapon to give Rated-RKO the win. At Survivor Series, DX got their revenge when their team {{defeated}} Edge and Orton's team in a clean sweep during their five-on-five elimination match. In January 2007, at New Year's Revolution, DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps (similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his <b>other</b> <b>leg)</b> 15 minutes into the match. Surgery was successfully performed on January 9, 2007 by Dr. James Andrews.|$|E
5|$|To promote Since I Left You the Avalanches {{organised}} {{their first}} Australian head-lining tour in October 2000 planning {{to head to}} all the capital cities. All dates on the tour were sold out. In their Brisbane show, Seltmann broke his leg in an on-stage collision with bass guitarist and singer, Tony Di Blasi. In January–February 2001, the Avalanches toured with the Big Day Out festival in Australia, visiting four capital cities. While on tour in Europe, Seltmann broke his <b>other</b> <b>leg,</b> thereafter {{the rest of the}} tour's shows were DJ sets. The British dance music magazine Muzik awarded the Avalanches as best live act.|$|E
40|$|Anterior extreme {{position}} (AEP) and posterior {{extreme position}} (PEP) {{of the legs}} of stick insects were measured during walking on a treadwheel or on a slippery glass plate. In several experiments, either protraction or re-traction of a middle or hind leg was interrupted. The AEP of <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> was independent of a protraction interruption but PEP was displaced backward in the leg anterior to the interrupted leg. When a leg was standing on a fixed platform (interruption of retraction) no changes were found in AEP and PEP for the <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> but if the platform was slowly moved, PEP of leg on the platform was moved forward. These results disagree with several pub-lished hypotheses. The results suggest the hypothesis of a position-dependent threshold value for protraction which is modulated by co-ordinating influ-ences from <b>other</b> <b>legs...</b>|$|R

25|$|Where {{the heel}} {{is up for}} one foot, the thigh for that leg is {{typically}} more {{parallel to the ground}} than the <b>other</b> <b>leg,</b> additionally the heel up foot is typically planted further back than the heel down foot.|$|E
25|$|Another {{departure}} from traditional parts {{was the use}} of spring-loaded legs. These legs are joined together at the top. These legs were only featured in basketball sets, 2002-2003. <b>Other</b> <b>leg</b> variations include short legs for children or dwarfs, or long legs (used in the Toy Story theme).|$|E

25|$|Crouching {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be synonymous with squatting. It is common to squat with one leg and kneel with the <b>other</b> <b>leg.</b> One or both heels may be up when squatting. Young children often instinctively squat. Among Chinese, Southeast Asian, and Eastern European adults, squatting often {{takes the place of}} sitting or standing.|$|E
25|$|The most usual leg {{movement}} {{with the front}} crawl is called the flutter kick. The legs move alternately, with one leg kicking downward while the <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> moves upward. While the legs provide {{only a small part}} of the overall speed, they are important to stabilize the body position. This lack of balance is apparent when using a pull buoy to neutralize the leg action.|$|E
25|$|The parsec {{is defined}} as being equal {{to the length of}} the longer leg of an {{extremely}} elongated imaginary right triangle in space. The two dimensions on which this triangle is based are its shorter leg, of length one astronomical unit (the average Earth-Sun distance), and the subtended angle of the vertex opposite that leg, measuring one arcsecond. Applying the rules of trigonometry to these two values, the unit length of the <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> of the triangle (the parsec) can be derived.|$|E
50|$|They {{usually have}} squarish {{carapace}}s with forward-pointing spines along {{the upper front}} edges. The animal's chelipeds are shorter than their <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> (the back pair are short, thin and doubled back on themselves). The animal's carapace grows to 2 in long.|$|R
5000|$|In season 1, {{teams were}} told to [...] "Find Allan Wu" [...] {{only to find out}} {{that it was not a}} Pit Stop. In this season, a [...] "superleg" [...] is merely one leg that is longer than the <b>other</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Barbaro's {{injuries}} were life-threatening. Unlike other mammals, such as dogs, a horse cannot survive in humane circumstances on three legs. A broken leg in a horse {{can lead to}} complications as the <b>other</b> <b>legs</b> attempt to bear {{the weight of the}} horse's body.|$|R
25|$|In partial {{suspension}} {{the person}} is bound {{in a way that}} part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains. The classic partial suspension position is to have the person balancing on one foot with part of their weight supported through a chest harness and the <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> pulled up in some direction. A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.|$|E
25|$|All other {{variants}} fail {{to increase}} the frontal area, yet swimmers using them still generate some thrust by the velocity variation and do not drown. Another variant of the breaststroke kick is the scissor kick, however, this kick violates {{the rules of the}} FINA as it is no longer symmetrical. Swimming teachers put a great effort into steering the students away from the scissor kick. In the scissor kick, one leg moves as described above, but the <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> does not form an elliptical movement but merely an up-down movement similar to the flutter kick of front crawl. Some swimming teachers believe that learning the front crawl first gives a higher risk of an incorrect scissor kick when learning breaststroke afterwards.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as his}} Test career Warne {{has been}} highly {{effective}} bowling in one-day cricket, something few <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> spin bowlers have managed. He also captained Australia on several occasions in One Day Internationals, winning ten matches and losing only one. Warne was instrumental in helping Australia win the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England. His performances in the semifinal against South Africa and in the final against Pakistan helped him get Man of the Match Awards. Warne had intended to retire from ODI cricket {{at the end of}} the 2003 World Cup: as it transpired, his last game for Australia was in January 2003. However, he did appear for the ICC World XI for the Tsunami benefit match in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Bayern Munich (2012–13, 2013–14) and Real Madrid (2013–14, 2014–15) {{hold the}} record of ten {{consecutive}} wins in the Champions League. Bayern Munich's run started on 2 April 2013 in the 2–0 win against Juventus in {{the first leg of}} the quarter-final of the 2012–13 season after losing 2–0 against Arsenal three weeks earlier. The run continued in the other three knockout matches and the final of the 2012–13 season. The run continued in the first five group stage matches of the 2013–14 season, but ended with the sixth in a 2–3 home defeat against Manchester City on 10 December 2013. Real Madrid's run started on 23 April 2014 in the 1–0 win against Bayern Munich in the first leg of semi-final of the 2013–14 season after losing 2–0 against Borussia Dortmund two weeks earlier in the second leg of the quarter-final. The run continued in the <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> of the semi-final, the final against Atlético Madrid, the six group stage matches of the 2014–15 season, and the first leg of round of 16 of the 2014–15 season, against Schalke 04.|$|E
500|$|In January 1801, Benedict Arnold's health {{began to}} decline. He had {{suffered}} from gout since 1775, and the condition attacked his unwounded leg {{to the point}} where he was unable to go to sea. The <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> ached constantly, and he walked only with a cane. His physicians diagnosed him as having dropsy, and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition. He died after four days of delirium on June 14, 1801, at the age of 60. Legend has it that, when he was on his deathbed, he said, [...] "Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles. May God forgive me for ever having put on another," [...] but this story may be apocryphal. Arnold was buried at St. Mary's Church, Battersea in London, England. As a result of a clerical error in the parish records, his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later. His funeral procession boasted [...] "seven mourning coaches and four state carriages"; the funeral was without military honors.|$|E
500|$|Residual {{complications}} of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process. Muscle paresis and paralysis can sometimes result in skeletal deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once {{the muscles in}} the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is equinus foot (similar to club foot). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the Achilles tendons {{at the back of}} the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed. In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the <b>other</b> <b>leg</b> continues to grow normally. The result is that one leg is shorter than the other and the person limps and leans to one side, in turn leading to deformities of the spine (such as scoliosis). Osteoporosis and increased likelihood of bone fractures may occur. An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an epiphysiodesis on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of epiphyseal (growth) plate closure, the legs are more equal in length. Alternatively, a person can be fitted with custom made footwear which corrects the difference in leg lengths. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful. [...] Extended use of braces or wheelchairs may cause compression neuropathy, as well as a loss of proper function of the veins in the legs, due to pooling of blood in paralyzed lower limbs. Complications from prolonged immobility involving the lungs, kidneys and heart include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, paralytic ileus, myocarditis and cor pulmonale.|$|E
