5|$|Whatever {{the true}} events, {{military}} historian David A.

In addition, the heterogeneous nature of the Xia army, containing as it did the forces of various rebel leaders Dou had defeated <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> and whose loyalty was doubtful, prevented Dou from dividing his army and sending various detachments on independent missions.|$|E

5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Cornell, Chamberlin {{was hired by}} the University of Utah, where he worked from 1904 to 1908, as an assistant professor (19041905) then full professor. He soon began improving biology courses, which at the time were only of high school grade, to collegiate standards, and introduced new courses in vertebrate histology and embryology. He was the first dean of University of Utah School of Medicine, serving from 1905 to 1907. During the summer of 1906, his plans to teach a summer course in embryology at the University of Chicago were cancelled when he suffered a serious accident in a fall, breaking two leg bones and severing an artery in his leg. In 1907, University officials decided to merge the medical school into an existing department, which made Chamberlin's deanship obsolete. He resigned as dean in May, 1907, although remained a faculty member. The medical students strongly objected, crediting the school's gains <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> largely to his efforts.|$|E
