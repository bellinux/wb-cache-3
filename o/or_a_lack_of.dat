5|$|There is {{evidence}} that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress, alcohol abuse, flickering light, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sleep, among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary {{to bring about a}} seizure. Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{believed}} to occur when there is susceptibility, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> immune system resistance, to DPB-causing bacteria or viruses, caused by several genes that are found predominantly in individuals of East Asian descent. The highest incidence occurs among Japanese people, followed by Koreans. DPB occurs more often in males, and usually begins around age 40. It was recognized as a distinct new disease in the early 1960s, and was formally named diffuse panbronchiolitis in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Sigmund Freud, {{the founder}} of psychoanalytic theory, {{discussed}} the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic, and found that impulsivity, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable. Finally, environmental and social factors play a role; for example, delay {{is affected by the}} self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency, by the degree of task engagement required during the delay, by early mother-child relationship characteristics, by a person's previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards (e.g., in poverty), and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms. Research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples, such as ecological factors affecting the skill.|$|E
5|$|The war also {{provided}} opportunities for advancement onto the General Staff, {{especially in the}} early days, when many former senior officers were recalled from retirement. Some of these were found wanting, due to their advanced age, their unwillingness to serve, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> competence and fitness; most were sent back into retirement before {{the first year of}} the war was over, leaving a gap that had to be filled by lower-ranking officers. Criticism of the quality of staff work in the Crimean War and the Second Boer War had led to sweeping changes under Haldane. The Staff College, Camberley was greatly expanded and Lord Kitchener established another staff college at Quetta for Indian Army officers in 1904. Nonetheless, when war broke out in August 1914, there were barely enough graduates to staff the BEF. Four-month-long staff courses were introduced, and filled with regimental officers who, upon completing their training, were posted to various headquarters. As a result, staff work was again poor, until training and experience slowly remedied the situation. In 1918, staff officers who had been trained exclusively for static trench warfare were forced to adapt to the demands of semi-open warfare.|$|E
5|$|The (as McKay {{liked to}} point out, undefeated) team made their game debut against the Los Angeles Rams in an {{exhibition}} at the Los Angeles Coliseum on July 31, losing 26-3. McKay called the players’ performance “unaggressive, uninspiring, lethargic, and unacceptable”, and cut 15 players one day prior to the following Tuesday’s cutdown date. McKay {{was pleased with the}} following week’s improved performance against the Green Bay Packers, a 10–6 loss in which a late interception of a Parnell Dickinson pass prevented a likely Buccaneer victory. After the Packers referred to them as the “Tampa Buccaneers”, the Buccaneers threatened to introduce the “Green Packers” at their next meeting. The Buccaneers’ first victory came in a 17–3 preseason win over the favored Atlanta Falcons, in which they scored on runs by Steve Spurrier and Essex Johnson, and a Mirro Roder field goal. Although the win had no official significance, it raised optimism among fans, particularly due to the team’s defensive performance. McKay himself was puzzled, unsure whether the win was due to a superior performance by Tampa Bay, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> effort by the Falcons. Their home debut came in a 28–21 loss to the Miami Dolphins, in front of a crowd of 71,718, a crowd which Dolphins owner Joe Robbie said proved his longtime prediction that a Bay Area team would be a success.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} fossil species of callichthyid is Corydoras revelatus from Salta, Argentina, {{of the late}} Paleocene. This species is {{tentatively}} placed in Corydoras, but is unambiguously {{a member of the}} subfamily Corydoradinae.

Metal fire rings generally {{do a good job}} of keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.|$|E

25|$|Fatigue is {{generally}} considered a more long-term condition than sleepiness (somnolence). Although sleepiness can be a symptom of medical issues, it usually results from lack of restful sleep, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> stimulation. Chronic fatigue, on the other hand, {{is a symptom of}} a greater medical problem in most cases. It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to complete tasks at normal performance. Both are often used interchangeably and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.' Oftentimes fatigue is described as an uncomfortable tiredness, whereas sleepiness is comfortable and inviting.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} AOM {{is related to}} {{childhood}} anatomy and immune function. Either bacteria or viruses may be involved. Risk factors include exposure to smoke, use of pacifiers, and attending daycare. It occurs more commonly among Indigenous peoples {{and those who have}} Down syndrome. OME frequently occurs following AOM and may be related to viral upper respiratory infections, irritants such as smoke, or allergies. Looking at the eardrum is important for making the correct diagnosis. Signs of AOM include bulging <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> movement of the tympanic membrane from a puff of air. About 4.4% of the population develop CSOM.|$|E
25|$|During sea trials, the {{submarine}} was often forced back to port because of equipment problems, where the Navy personnel found that ASC engineers would diagnose and repair systems {{using a combination}} of supplier data and diagnostic tools not available to the sailors. Problems with the training were compounded by an attitude from ASC that problems were always the fault of the Navy operators. However, most were the result of equipment failure, and the problems caused by operator error could be attributed to poor training <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> training, both of which were the responsibility of ASC.|$|E

25|$|The nightwatchman {{is usually}} a lower-order batsman, able to protect his wicket {{primarily}} by defending dangerous balls and leaving non-dangerous ones rather than looking to produce {{a large number of}} runs for his team, but not a complete rabbit, liable to expose other batsmen late in a day. This move prevents a regular batsman from having to face the last few overs left in the day or bat early the following morning; however, some teams do not employ a nightwatchmen for various reasons, including a belief that middle-order batsmen should be able to protect their wicket in poor conditions as well as good, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> defensively minded lower-order batsmen.|$|E
25|$|Scavenging of {{abandoned}} radioactive material {{has been the}} cause of several other cases of radiation exposure, mostly in developing nations, which may have less regulation of dangerous substances (and sometimes less general education about radioactivity and its hazards) and a market for scavenged goods and scrap metal. The scavengers and those who buy the material are almost always unaware that the material is radioactive and it is selected for its aesthetics or scrap value. Irresponsibility {{on the part of}} the radioactive material's owners, usually a hospital, university or military, and the absence of regulation concerning radioactive waste, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> enforcement of such regulations, have been significant factors in radiation exposures. For an example of an accident involving radioactive scrap originating from a hospital see the Goiânia accident.|$|E
25|$|Species {{specific}} defense {{responses are}} created out of fear, and {{are essential for}} survival. Rats that lack the gene stathmin show no avoidance learning, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> fear, and will often walk directly up to cats and be eaten. Animals use these SSDR to continue living, to help increase their chance of fitness, by surviving long enough to procreate. Humans and animals alike have created fear to know what should be avoided, and this fear can be learned through association {{with others in the}} community, or learned through personal experience with a creature, species, or situations that should be avoided. SSDRs are an evolutionary adaptation that has been seen in many species throughout the world including rats, chimpanzees, prairie dogs, and even humans, an adaptation created to help individual creatures survive in a hostile world.|$|E
