Operation Sana, alongside concurrent HV and HVO offensives, sparked debate among military analysts {{as to whether the}} ground assaults or NATO's airstrikes were more responsible for ending the Bosnian War. Also in question was to what extent the advances of the ARBiH, HVO and HV were assisted by the airstrikes, and conversely, to what extent they hampered the VRS.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} commenced {{during a}} North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) air {{campaign against the}} VRS codenamed Operation Deliberate Force, targeting VRS air defences, artillery positions and storage facilities largely in the area <b>of</b> <b>Sarajevo,</b> but also elsewhere in the country.

5|$|In MarchNovember 1994, the ARBiH {{conducted}} {{a series of}} attacks with relatively limited objectives, attacking the VRS at the Vlašić Mountain, the Stolice Peak of the Majevica Mountain and Donji Vakuf, {{as well as in the}} area between Tešanj and Teslić, near Brčko, Kladanj, Sarajevo, on the Bjelašnica and the Treskavica Mountain, Gračanica, Vareš, Konjic and Doboj. Further efforts were made, together with the HVO, against the VRS near Nevesinje in SeptemberNovember, but most of the offensives made little or no gains. At the same time, VRS attacks north <b>of</b> <b>Sarajevo</b> were successfully repulsed.

Little territory changed hands as a result of the ARBiH offensive by the end of October, but the VRS shortage of troops worsened.|$|E
