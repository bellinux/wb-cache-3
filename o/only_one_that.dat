5|$|Olde Idlewild {{contained}} a Caterpillar ride until 2013. Built in 1947, Idlewild's model {{was one of}} three similar rides still in operation in North America, one of two featuring a working canopy that covers the riders, and the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> still utilized an undercarriage fan. The ride was removed to be refurbished and returned in the future.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{construction}} headquarters was at Fort Wainwright near Fairbanks, where Alyeska {{leased land}} and buildings from the U.S. Army. Vacant barracks were converted into housing, and vacant offices were given to oil workers. As air traffic increased, Alyeska arranged {{for the use of}} Fort Wainwright's airfield to relieve the burden on Fairbanks International Airport. The camp at Wainwright was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> did not use prefabricated buildings.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Hamilton's lead in the Drivers' Championship was cut down to 41 points, with Rosberg still in second place. Sebastian Vettel moved closer as well, now being 49 points behind Hamilton. Felipe Massa's {{retirement}} saw him drop from fourth to sixth in the standings, being overtaken by both Räikkönen and Bottas. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari closed the gap to leaders Mercedes, now trailing 310 to 463 points. This race would prove to be the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> Lewis Hamilton did not finish in the season.|$|E
5|$|Bodrog {{was sent}} to Reni {{near the mouth of}} the Danube to protect {{withdrawing}} Austro-Hungarian troops, arriving there on 1 October. She then sailed upstream, reaching Rustschuk on 11 October, and Giurgiu two days later. On 14 October, she was deployed at Lom. She was the last Austro-Hungarian monitor to withdraw towards Budapest and was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> failed to reach the city. On 31 October 1918, Bodrog collided with a sand bank while navigating through heavy fog near Vinča. She was later captured by the Serbian Army.|$|E

Callie also left Arizona at therapy, telling her that she was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> needed to go. After being hit by a lawsuit, her father, Carlos, visits and tells Callie that he cheated on her mother but she took him back and Callie wouldn't be here if her mother didn't give Carlos a second chance. Callie goes to Arizona's apartment and invites her to come back home. Callie finds out during surgery that Arizona was sleeping with Leah, a second year resident, while separated. Although angry at Arizona, Callie still agrees to work things out.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) turns {{himself in}} at the FBI headquarters. Suffering from effects of being teleported out of his German prison cell by Walter's technology, he insists on only {{speaking}} to Olivia, warning {{that she is the}} <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> can stop a bomb from going off in 36 hours. Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston) instead orders Olivia to join other agents in raiding a warehouse which they believe Jones and his men used. Evidence confirms Jones had been there, but an agent dies from suffocation after finding another two-dollar bill.|$|E
5|$|Hanson and Hawk later {{reformed}} {{their team}} and competed {{together in the}} Amarillo, Texas-based NWA Western States Sports. While there, they won the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship three times. Hanson's final title reign was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> did not involve Hawk, as he teamed with The Hangman in Montreal, Quebec to win the Canadian International Tag Team Championship in 1981. Hanson then returned to McMahon's New England-based Capitol Wrestling, which had since become the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Using the gimmick of a redneck, complete with long hair and a Confederate flag, he competed for the WWF as a face {{until his retirement in}} 1986.|$|E

5|$|In {{reviewing}} Allen Barra's Inventing Wyatt Earp. His Life and Many Legends, William Urban, a Professor of History at Monmouth College in Warren County, Illinois, {{pointed out}} a number of factual inaccuracies in the book. One inconsistency by Barra, pointed out by another reviewer, includes a description of the poker game the night before the shootout. Ike Clanton's account of the game (the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> exists) gives the participants as John Behan, Virgil Earp, Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, and a fifth man Ike did not recognize, while Barra wrote that Holliday had attended the game.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid's {{spectrum}} of activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{is similar to that}} of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include teicoplanin (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid is the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> can be taken by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolid—both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E
5|$|MOHH {{may have}} been the first hip-hop dance {{convention}}, {{but it is not the}} <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> exists. Urban Dance Camp (UDC) is a six-week-long German-based dance convention held every year in Lörrach, a small town on the border of France and Switzerland. In a report on the event by a local paper, Bettina Kraft, the manager of UDC, estimated that 85% of the participants were from outside of Germany. In 2009 Kraft created Urban Dance Showcase, a parallel event to UDC reserved only for performances by professional choreographers, dance crews, and UDC teachers. Dancers such as Shaun Evaristo, Les Twins, I.aM.mE, b-boy Lilou, and b-boy Hong 10 have performed at the showcase in the past.|$|E

When Michael and Dave are betrayed by Steve and become caught in a Mexican standoff between the FIB, IAA, and Merryweather, Trevor, feeling {{that he is the}} <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> has the right to kill Michael, comes to their aid. Despite not forgiving Michael, Trevor agrees to perform the Union Depository heist and part ways with him afterwards.|$|E
5|$|One of Speer's first {{commissions}} after Troost's {{death was}} the Zeppelinfeld stadium—the Nürnberg parade grounds seen in Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda masterpiece Triumph of the Will. This huge work {{was able to}} hold 340,000 people. Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the individual Nazis, {{many of whom were}} overweight. Speer surrounded the site with 130 anti-aircraft searchlights. Speer described this as his most beautiful work, and as the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> stood the test of time.|$|E
5|$|Sihanaka culture {{traditionally}} {{adhered to}} a wide variety of fady, some of which are still respected to varying degrees by more traditional families to the present day. Many of their fady in the early 1900s were documented by historian Van Gennep. The most absolute fady and the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> was seemingly practiced by all Sihanaka was a prohibition against working in a paddy field on Tuesdays; sub-groups among the Sihanaka also practiced other taboos associated with particular days of the week, such as not leaving the house or not cleaning floor mats on certain days. A fady was placed on consumption of any new or foreign products, including Western medicines. Another common fady was a taboo against watching the rising or setting of the sun, staring at anything red, or falling asleep at sunset.|$|E
