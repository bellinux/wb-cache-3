5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>world,</b> but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
5|$|Employing the Sub Intelligent Numbers Selector {{theory that}} {{assigned}} non-descript unit names and randomized numerical designations to formations {{in order to}} disguise their role from the enemy, the company was designated the 8213th Army Unit. Upon formation, {{it was decided that}} the company would be considered an ad hoc, or provisional unit, which meant it did not have a permanent lineage and was only a temporary formation, akin to a task force. This decision was unique to the Eighth Army Ranger Company, as subsequent companies assumed the lineage of Ranger units from World War II, and veterans later expressed resentment with the choice as it prevented the company from accruing its own campaign streamers or unit decorations. While subsequent Ranger companies were authorized shoulder sleeve insignia with the distinctive black and red scroll <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>World</b> War II predecessors, the Eighth Army Ranger Company wore the shoulder patch of the Eighth United States Army, which commanded all UN troops in Korea.|$|E
5|$|The team's strong stretch did not continue, however, as the Phillies {{entered the}} second period of interleague play with five {{consecutive}} series against the American League East. While they managed a single win against the Boston Red Sox, {{it was followed by}} a six-game losing streak wherein the Phillies were swept by the Toronto Blue Jays and the Baltimore Orioles; Philadelphia was outscored 38–19 over the two series. The team showed promise in the first game <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>World</b> Series rematch series with the Tampa Bay Rays, winning 10–1, but were defeated in the last two games of the series and lost a fourth straight game to Toronto on June 26. However, the Phillies were able to exact a modicum of revenge for both their 1993 World Series defeat and the first series sweep by the Jays by winning the last two games. Happ played the role of stopper by pitching his first career complete game shutout, and Moyer followed by earning his 252nd victory in the following game. To close the month, the Phillies lost the opener of their next series with the Braves to finish the month with a 10–16 record.|$|E

25|$|Cape St. Vincent {{was already}} sacred ground in Neolithic times, as {{standing}} menhirs {{in the neighborhood}} attest.
