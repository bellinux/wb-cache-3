5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the bottom and arching her tail; this may reflect mate choice <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>part.</b> The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads pressed against the bottom and their bodies at an upward angle.|$|E
5|$|The nature {{artist and}} the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be {{humanised}} while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, an affront to the reader's sense of social right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>part</b> to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E

25|$|During {{the press}} conference called by defense attorneys, one of Meinhof's lawyers, Michael Oberwinder, stated that {{it was less than}} a week before Meinhof's death that they had a very {{involved}} conversation.

He had been investigated by the Holy Inquisition for proclaiming that sin belonged to the lower sensual part of man and was not subject to man's free will. Christina sent him food and hundreds of letters when he was locked up in Castel Sant'Angelo.|$|E

25|$|Livia {{played a}} vital role in the {{formation}} of her children Tiberius and Drusus. Attention focuses <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>part</b> in the divorce of her first husband, father of Tiberius, in 39/38 BC. It would be interesting to know her role in this, as well as in Tiberius' divorce of Vipsania Agrippina in 12 BC at Augustus' insistence: whether it was merely neutral or passive, or whether she actively colluded in Caesar's wishes. The first divorce left Tiberius a fosterchild at the house of Octavian; the second left Tiberius with a lasting emotional scar, since he had been forced to abandon the woman he loved for dynastic considerations.|$|E

In 1904 the two returned from Berlin and settled for two years in Springfield, Illinois, where Lena taught piano in public schools and Agnes painted in a rented studio. At this time Lena changed her name to Helen. In 1905 they moved to Chicago where Agnes studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago under John Vanderpoel, Nellie Walker, and others.|$|E

50|$|On Friday, 22 January 2010, Shazia's step-father, Bashir Masih, {{received}} a call from Chaudhry Naeem reporting that she had fallen down the stairs. She was admitted to Jinnah Hospital. Doctors at Jinnah Hospital initially told her parents and the media that Shazia was dead on arrival, and that she may have died about four days earlier based {{on the state of the}} body. Shazia's killer had broken her jaw, ribs and right arm, and she bore signs of blunt force trauma <b>on</b> <b>her</b> sensitive <b>parts,</b> including kidneys, neck and forehead.

25|$|Alexios and Malik Shah met, Alexios {{throwing}} his own costly cloak around the sultan's shoulders. A peace involving an undertaking by Malik Shah to stop Turkish raiding and an admission by {{the sultan of}} some measure of, largely theoretical, dependence on the Byzantine emperor was made. Anna Komnene records that the peace treaty involved an undertaking by Malik Shah to evacuate Anatolia, but this is unlikely in the extreme and must represent hyperbole <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>part.</b> The campaign was remarkable for {{the high level of}} discipline shown by the Byzantine army. Alexios had demonstrated that he could march his army with impunity through Turkish dominated territory. The reverse suffered by Malik Shah at Philomelion and the consequent loss of prestige probably contributed to his demise as he was soon deposed, blinded and eventually murdered by his brother Mas'ud.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} evidence indicates a construction {{date in the}} Antonine or early Severan period (late 2nd or early 3rd century AD). The scaenae frons (stage front) was certainly put up at this time, as the style of both sculpture and architectural ornament suggest. Statue bases terminating the retaining walls of the auditorium bore the names of two brothers, senators in the early Severan period, and two inscribed bases placed symmetrically against the exterior facade held statues of Aphrodisian benefactors, Claudia Antonia Tatiana and her uncle Lucius Antonius Dometinus, who were active {{at the end of}} the 2nd century. Tatiana is known to have had close ties with Ephesus, and it is possible that the striking similarities between this building and the bouleuterion on the civic agora there, dated by inscription to the mid-2nd century, are due to some initiative <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>part.</b> We do not know what stood here before the 2nd century AD, but it is likely that the present building replaced a smaller one contemporary with the laying out of the agora in the late 1st century BC.|$|E
500|$|Cultural aspects also {{increase}} the prevalence of HIV infection. The insistence of a woman {{for a man to}} use a condom could imply promiscuity <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>part,</b> and thus may hamper the usage of protective barriers during sex. [...] Furthermore, one of the primary methods of contraception among women has historically been sterilisation, which does not protect against the transmission of HIV.|$|E

500|$|Kunis starred as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 comedy film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, co-produced by Judd Apatow. The role, {{which she}} won after unsuccessfully auditioning for Knocked Up, entailed {{improvisation}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>part.</b> The film garnered positive reviews, {{and was a}} commercial success, grossing $105million worldwide. Kunis's performance was well-received; Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal praised her [...] "fresh beauty and focused energy", while James Berardinelli wrote that she is [...] "adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing". She {{was nominated for a}} Teen Choice Award. In an interview, Kunis credited Apatow with helping her to expand her career from That '70s Show.|$|E

500|$|In June 1822, Mary Shelley {{suffered}} a miscarriage {{that left her}} depressed and irritable. After the conflicts this caused in her marriage, Percy Shelley developed strong feelings for Jane. He was particularly taken by her musical gifts and skill as a housewife. Shelley saw Jane as an ideal or even utopian woman, {{the embodiment of the}} qualities that he had always sought in a woman. This attraction and the close quarters in which the couples lived caused what has been described as [...] "an extraordinary and mounting tension within the isolated household". Though she was flattered by the attention, Jane was careful not to reciprocate openly in order to avoid arousing her husband's suspicions. She was successful in her attempts to prevent Edward from suspecting infidelity <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E
500|$|Ethologists {{expressed}} concern about the adequacy of some research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalization to humans from animal studies. Schur, discussing Bowlby's use of ethological concepts (pre-1960) commented that concepts used in attachment theory had not kept up with changes in ethology itself. Ethologists and others writing in the 1960s and 1970s questioned and expanded the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment. Observational studies of young children in natural settings provided other behaviours that might indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>part</b> and picking up small objects, bringing them to the mother but not to others. Although ethologists tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, they pressed for more data, objecting to psychologists writing as if there were an [...] "entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures." [...] Robert Hinde considered [...] "attachment behaviour system" [...] to be an appropriate term which did not offer the same problems [...] "because it refers to postulated control systems that determine the relations between different kinds of behaviour." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, another poet, Elizabeth F. Ellet, became enamored of Poe and jealous of Osgood. Though, {{in a letter}} to Sarah Helen Whitman, Poe called her love for him [...] "loathsome" [...] and wrote that he [...] "could do nothing but repel [...] with scorn", he printed many of her poems to him in the Broadway Journal while he was its editor. Ellet was known for being meddlesome and vindictive and, while visiting the Poe {{household}} in late January 1846, she saw one of Osgood's personal letters to Poe. According to Ellet, Virginia pointed out [...] "fearful paragraphs" [...] in Osgood's letter. Ellet contacted Osgood and suggested she should beware of her indiscretions and asked Poe to return her letters, motivated either by jealousy or by a desire to cause scandal. Osgood then sent Margaret Fuller and Anne Lynch Botta to ask Poe on her behalf to return the letters. Angered by their interference, Poe called them [...] "Busy-bodies" [...] and said that Ellet had better [...] "look after her own letters", suggesting indiscretion <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>part.</b> He then gathered up these letters from Ellet and left them at her house.|$|E
