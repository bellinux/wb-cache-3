5|$|As they left, {{thousands}} of National Guardsmen {{who had heard}} the news were assembling at the Place de Grève. The Marquis de Lafayette, in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely {{in favor of the}} march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the Parisian municipal government told Lafayette to guide their movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette contemplated the near mutiny of his men: he was aware that many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead <b>or</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the way. At four o'clock in the afternoon, fifteen thousand guards with several thousand more civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.|$|E

500|$|Personnel {{changes and}} label {{interference}} frustrated The Black Crowes' attempts {{to follow up}} their 1996 album Three Snakes and One Charm. [...] During May and June 1997, they recorded an album called Band, but it was rejected by their label, American Recordings. [...] Lead singer Chris Robinson said American [...] "couldn't go with the vibe" [...] and wanted something more [...] "safe". [...] In August, guitarist Marc Ford was fired due to a heroin habit that impaired his performances. [...] Guitarist Rich Robinson said, [...] "We would be onstage playing 'Remedy', {{and he would be}} playing a completely different song.... We told him to clean up <b>or</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> [...] We assumed, since he loved music and the band, that he would clean up." [...] Bassist Johnny Colt had been losing interest in the band since the recording of Three Snakes and One Charm; his contributions to that album were minimal, as Rich played bass in his stead on all but one track. Colt quit in October to become a yoga instructor.|$|E

2500|$|For several initial {{months of}} the Syrian {{uprising}} that began in March 2011, the U.S. administration headed by Barack Obama, despite pressure from some political groups, refrained from outright calls for Bashar Assad′s ouster, a move then opposed by key regional U.S. allies such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia. First, limited sanctions against the Assad government were imposed by the U.S. in April 2011, followed by Obama′s executive order as of 18 May 2011 targeting Bashar Assad specifically and six other senior officials. In July 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said president Assad had “lost legitimacy.” On 18 August 2011, Barack Obama issued a written statement echoed by {{the leaders of the}} UK, France, and Germany, that inter alia said: “The future of Syria must be determined by its people, but President Bashar al-Assad is standing in their way. His calls for dialogue and reform have rung hollow while he is imprisoning, torturing, and slaughtering his own people. [...] We have consistently said that President Assad must lead a democratic transition <b>or</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the way. [...] He has not led. [...] For the sake of the Syrian people, {{the time has come for}} President Assad to step aside." [...] On the same day the U.S. president signed executive orders that froze all Syrian government assets that were under U.S. jurisdiction, barred Americans from doing business with the government, and prohibited the import of Syrian oil and petroleum products to the United States. The U.S. sanctions were called by Syria’s U.N. ambassador Bashar Jaafari [...] "a humanitarian and diplomatic war against us." [...] Under the administration's division of labor, the State Department is in charge of supplying nonlethal aid (includes food rations and pickup trucks, not tanks and bullets), while the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) runs a covert program to arm and train the Syrian rebels.|$|E
