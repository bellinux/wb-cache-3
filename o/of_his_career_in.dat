He recorded the first two 20-goal seasons <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>career</b> <b>in</b> 2008–09 and 2009–10, and increased his shot totals.|$|E

5|$|Arcadelt wrote over 200 madrigals {{before he}} left Italy in 1551 to return to France, where he spent the {{remainder}} of his life; his numerous chansons date from this and subsequent years. In 1557 he published a book of masses, dedicated to his new employer, Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine (Arcadelt was maître de chapelle, i.e. choirmaster for him). In this publication he was mentioned {{as a member of the}} royal chapel, and therefore must have served both Henry II (died 1559) and Charles IX during this late phase <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>career.</b> <b>In</b> Paris he employed the publishing house of Le Roy and Ballard, who printed his abundant chansons, masses and motets just as the Venetian printers had earlier printed his madrigals.|$|E
