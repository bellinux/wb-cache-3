5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, {{regardless of whether or not}} he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee. Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Barnette {{was accused}} of embezzling money from the Fairbanks bank he operated, and he was sued {{by the man who}} had funded the venture that led to the {{founding}} of Fairbanks. During the lawsuit, it was revealed that Barnette had been convicted of larceny in Oregon. As his legal bills added up, Barnette decided to lease the Fairbanks Daily News to a group of local businessmen. On June 15, 1908, Barnette ended the lease agreement by selling the newspaper to J. Harmon Caskey and Henry Roden. That same year, the campaign to elect Alaska's first delegate to Congress was under way, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates,</b> Jack Corson, purchased one-third of the newspaper. Corson's campaign manager promptly was named the editor of the Daily News, and the paper switched to actively supporting Corson's candidacy.|$|E

Miller then captained the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay, top-scoring with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In a match against India, Miller took two wickets. At this point, {{with most of the}} team {{suffering}} from dysentery and the leadership not permitting the team to travel by air, some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed from the captaincy, with Miller as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> to replace him.

5|$|Osbert de Bayeux (floruit 1121 to 1184) was {{a medieval}} English cleric and archdeacon in the Diocese of York. A {{relative}} of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, Osbert probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative. After Thurstan's death, Osbert {{was opposed to}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> for the archbishopric, William fitzHerbert, and worked to secure fitzHerbert's deposition and replacement by Henry Murdac. After Murdac's death in 1153, Osbert tried to prevent the return of fitzHerbert, but these attempts were unsuccessful. When fitzHerbert died suddenly in 1154, Osbert was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop. Although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an ecclesiastical court, he was stripped of his clerical status and became a layman before 1158. He died after 1184, perhaps even after 1194.|$|E
5|$|Pope Gregory XIII {{appointed}} Báthory cardinal {{during his}} visit to Rome in 1584. A year later, he was installed as coadjutor bishop of Warmia. He was in Rome again when Stephen Báthory died in 1586. Andrew was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> to succeed him in Poland and Lithuania, but Jan Zamoyski, the Chancellor of Poland, convinced him to support another candidate, Sigismund Vasa, and to demonstrate the Báthorys' claim to the crown only through nominating his minor cousin, Sigismund Báthory, Prince of Transylvania. After Sigismund Vasa was elected king in 1587, Báthory convinced his cousin's advisors to send reinforcements to Poland to fight against Maximilian of Habsburg, who also claimed the throne. Báthory became Prince-Bishop of Warmia after the death of Bishop Marcin Kromer in 1589.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund {{adopted the}} title of Prince of Transylvania after Stephen Báthory died on 13 December 1586. He was still a minor, and Ghyczy {{continued}} to rule as regent. Sigismund was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> to the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His advisors {{knew that he had}} little chance to win, but they wanted to demonstrate that the Báthorys had a valid claim to rule the Commonwealth. Kovacsóczy officially announced Sigismund's application at the Sejm (or general assembly) on 14August 1587. Five days later, the assembly elected Sigismund III Vasa king. During the ensuing war of succession, Transylvanian troops supported SigismundIII against Maximilian of Habsburg, who had also laid claim to Poland and Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two types}} of {{constituencies}} (electoral divisions) in Singapore: Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) and Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). In SMCs candidates vie individually for parliamentary seats, whereas in GRCs the contest is between teams of candidates. Under the GRC scheme, which came into effect on 1 June 1988, the Government may, having regard to the number of voters in a particular constituency, advise the President to declare it to be a GRC and designate it as a constituency in which at least <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> is from the Malay community, or from the Indian or some other minority community in Singapore.

5|$|There are no {{recorded}} {{campaigns in}} Syro-Palestine during Amenhotep I's reign. However, {{according to the}} Tombos Stela of his successor, Thutmose I, when Thutmose led a campaign into Asia {{all the way to}} the Euphrates, he found no one who fought against him. If Thutmose did not lead a campaign which has not been recorded into Asia before this recorded one, it would mean that the preceding pharaoh would have had to pacify Syria instead, which would indicate a possible Asiatic campaign of Amenhotep I. Two references to the Levant potentially written during his reign might be contemporary witnesses to such a campaign. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> for Amenhotep's tomb contains a reference to Qedmi, which is somewhere in Canaan or the Transjordan, and Amenemhet's tomb contains a hostile reference to Mitanni. However, neither of these references necessarily refer to campaigning, nor do they even necessarily date to Amenhotep's reign. The location of Amenhotep's tomb is not certain, and Amenemhet lived to serve under multiple kings who are known to have attacked Mitanni. Records from Amenhotep's reign are simply altogether too scant and too vague to reach a conclusion about any Syrian campaign.|$|E
5|$|Miller, the vice-captain of the team, almost {{missed the}} trip to India after turning up late for the voyage. The {{servicemen}} arrived in Bombay and took a two-day train journey to Lahore to play North Zone. Miller scored 46 in a drawn match. The Australians headed to Delhi, but Miller missed the tour match due to food poisoning. He then led the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay with Hassett being rested. Miller top-scored with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In the first match against India at Bombay's Brabourne Stadium, regarded as unofficial Tests, Miller took two wickets: Rusi Modi in the first innings and Abdul Hafeez Kardar in the second. The match ended in a high-scoring draw with Miller unbeaten on 15 as Australia were 1/31 in pursuit of 112 for victory. At this point, {{with most of the}} team suffering from dysentery, some of the Australians became disenchanted with the long train journeys across the subcontinent, and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel. When this was rejected, some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed, with Miller as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> to replace him. With Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand, the Services captain {{would be one of the}} leading candidates to lead Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Squadron Leader Stan Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team. On the first flight to Calcutta, the squad survived an electrical storm that caused the plane to drop altitude.|$|E
