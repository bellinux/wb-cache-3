50|$|The mitotic {{checkpoint}} {{complex is}} composed of BUB3 together with MAD2 and MAD3 bound to Cdc20. MAD2 and MAD3 have distinct binding sites on CDC20, and act synergistically to inhibit APC/C. The MAD3 complex {{is composed of}} BUB3, which binds to Mad3 and BUB1B through the short linear motif known as the GLEBS motif. The exact <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachments</b> which must take place in order to form the MCC remains unknown. It is possible that Mad2-Cdc20 form a complex {{at the same time}} as BUBR1-BUB3-Cdc20 form another complex, and these two subcomplexes are consequently combined to form the mitotic checkpoint complex. In human cells, binding of BUBR1 to CDC20 requires prior binding of MAD2 to CDC20, so it is possible that the MAD2-CDC20 subcomplex acts as an initiator for MCC formation. BUBR1 depletion leads only to a mild reduction in Mad2-Cdc20 levels while Mad2 is required for the binding of BubR1-Bub3 to Cdc20. Nevertheless, BUBR1 is still required for checkpoint activation.|$|R

40|$|Glycosyl transferases which {{recognize}} identical substrates (nucleotide-sugars and lipid-linked carbohydrates) {{can substitute}} {{for one another}} in bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis, even if the enzymes originate in different genera of bacteria. This substitution {{can be used to}} identify the substrate specificities of uncharacterized transferase genes. The spsK gene of Sphingomonas strain S 88 and the pssDE genes of Rhizobium leguminosarum were identified as encoding glucuronosyl-(β 1 → 4) -glucosyl transferases based on reciprocal genetic complementation of mutations in the spsK gene and the pssDE genes by segments of cloned DNA and by the SpsK-dependent incorporation of radioactive glucose (Glc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) into lipid-linked disaccharides in EDTA-permeabilized cells. By contrast, glycosyl transferases which form alternative sugar linkages to the same substrate caused inhibition of polysaccharide synthesis or were deleterious or lethal in a foreign host. The negative effects also suggested specific substrate requirements: we propose that spsL codes for a glucosyl-(β 1 → 4) -glucuronosyl transferase in Sphingomonas and that pssC codes for a glucuronosyl-(β 1 → 4) -glucuronosyl transferase in R. leguminosarum.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} history of intimacy from late humanism through the Enlightenment by examining how the abstract concept <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> becomes both a primary preoccupation and a crucial stumbling block in imagining subjectivity throughout the period. Examining a series of authors (Shakespeare, Descartes, Milton, and Rousseau) who ask {{what it would mean}} to be essentially without social ties, this project reveals the early modern period's ongoing conflict between a primary solitude associated with autonomy, isolation, and detachment and a primary sociality that assumes a natural <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachments,</b> bonds, and interdependence. This dissertation challenges the conventional story of the birth of "interiority" or "the invention of the human" with Shakespeare (or even Montaigne) by revealing a resistance to a conception <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> that assumes inwardness; instead, it uncovers a more gradual historical shift in models <b>of</b> primary <b>attachment</b> from external to internal bonds, from attachments understood to occur outside the subject to those forged by an immanent or internal principle of relationship. Chapter one argues that Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and King Lear reveal a commitment to exteriority rather than the interiority so often attributed to Shakespeare as it attempts to conceal the fragility of social bonds and the ease with which they - and social life - can be destroyed. Chapter two examines Descartes' Meditations and locates in the defensive strategies of the meditator an attempt to evade the threats <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> through a negotiation with poetics that leaves dependency precariously outside the self. Chapter three finds in Milton's Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained a turn to an immanent sociality in the figure of the Son; in Milton's monism, a principle of relation inheres in all matter, suggesting that even total isolation is attended by this principle of relation. Chapter four studies Rousseau's Émile and shows how the autonomy and even the solitude of the subject is secured by placing a relational principle around the subject's soul. Finally, a speculative coda turns to Kant to consider the legacy of solitude and autonomy in the Enlightenment's most famous moral philosopher...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{morphology}} in word recognition {{has been}} plagued by conflicting results (McQueen & Cutler, 1998, give a recent review). Some findings suggest that words are accessed as full forms, while others suggest that words are accessed in terms of their component morphemes. The answer may lie in the properties of the affixes themselves: Kiparsky’s (1982) Lexical Phonology and Morphology assigns affixes in English to different ‘‘levels’ ’ of attachment, based on their productivity, <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> and phonological interaction with roots.

Historically, two competing models have characterized morphological structure during lexical access.

Butterworth’s (1983) Full Listing Hypothesis maintains that words are available for recognition in the lexicon with their morphology complete. More recently, several mixed models have been proposed.

The attachment was inhibited by preincubation of granulosa cells with anti-chicken fibronectin antibody (approximately 70 % reduction in attachment) or preincubation with a 14 -kDa fimbrial protein isolated from S. enteritidis (68 % reduction in attachment). Treatment of bacterial cells with the tetrapeptide RGDS before addition to granulosa cells resulted in inhibition of attachment (60 % inhibition when 2 x 10 (7) CFU of bacteria {{was treated with}} 500 microg of peptide). Treatment with the peptide GRGD resulted in similar magnitude of inhibition, indicating that extracellular matrix proteins play significant roles in the interaction of S. enteritidis with granulosa cells. In contrast, treatment of the bacterial cells with the peptide GRAD {{did not result in}} significant inhibition of attachment to the granulosa cells. S. enteritidis was found to attach specifically to fibronectin, collagen IV, and laminin-coated microtiter plate wells, with the rank <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> as follows: fibronectin > laminin > collagen IV. Light and transmission electron micrographs of S. enteritidis invasion of granulosa cells showed organisms with or without a surrounding membrane in the cytoplasm of granulosa cells.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into the interactions of some cations with the sodium pump of red blood cell membranes. Two mechanisms for this system have been proposed previously: one is a two- step (consecutive) mechanism in which sodium ions are transported in one step and then potassium ions in a separate, second step. An alternative mechanism involves simultaneous attachment and transport of both ions. The experiments presented involve studies of pump activation by either reactant at various concentrations of the other. A requirement for these studies is that products of the reaction be absent. This indicates the use of a cellular system with its inherent asymmetry and the modification of such a system to allow changes in intracellular ionic composition. This has been achieved with human and pig red blood cells modified by a cation loading procedure involving the sulphydryl inhibitor p-chloromercuribenzene sulphonic acid. Pump activity has been measured mainly as the ouabain-sensitive influx of 42 K+-labelled potassium and 134 Cs+-labelled caesium, which is a congener for potassium. The results presented in the first section of the thesis confirm and extend a previous result showing that the affinity for external potassium or caesium is dependent on the intracellular sodium concentration. The second section of results demonstrates that the reverse trans-membrane influence applies - that is, a dependence of intracellular sodium affinity on the extracellular cation concentration. These results, together with those in a third section which demonstrate an influence of intracellular magnesium levels on external cation binding, are consistent with and explicable in terms of not only simultaneous binding of sodium, potassium or caesium and magnesium to the pump, but also a random <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>attachment...</b>|$|E
40|$|Stick insects (Carausius morosus) {{have two}} {{distinct}} types <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> pad per leg, tarsal "heel" pads (euplantulae) and a pre-tarsal "toe" pad (arolium). Here {{we show that}} these two pad types are specialised for fundamentally different functions. When standing upright, stick insects rested on their proximal euplantulae, while arolia were the only pads in surface contact when hanging upside down. Single-pad force measurements showed that the adhesion of euplantulae was extremely small, but friction forces strongly increased with normal load and coefficients of friction were [Formula: see text] 1. The pre-tarsal arolium, in contrast, generated adhesion that strongly increased with pulling forces, allowing adhesion to be activated and deactivated by shear forces, which can be produced actively, or passively {{as a result of}} the insects' sprawled posture. The shear-sensitivity of the arolium was present even when corrected for contact area, and was independent of normal preloads covering nearly an <b>order</b> <b>of</b> magnitude. <b>Attachment</b> <b>of</b> both heel and toe pads is thus activated partly by the forces that arise passively in the situations in which they are used by the insects, ensuring safe attachment.

40|$|ABSTRACT In humans, {{synthetic}} vascular grafts heal with {{a limited}} ingrowth of endothelium. This fact might be responsible for inferior performance of synthetic grafts compared with native artery. Endothelial cells can be autotransplanted (seeded) into the graft {{in an effort to}} improve graft function. The <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> endothelial cells to different graft materials was investigated in vitro (I). In <b>order</b> <b>of</b> decreasing <b>attachment</b> the grafts were albumin-coated dacron, pre-clotted dacron, gelatin-coated dacron, gelatin-coated polyurethane, collagen-coated dacron and preclotted PTFE. The loss of seeded cells was studied in sheep (II). A low blood flow velocity did not improve cell retention. The early thrombogenicity was studied in arterial (III) and venous (IV) conduits in sheep. No difference in the attachment platelets, leukocytes and fibrinogen could be demonstrated. The conduit in the vein caused an activation and <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> platelets on the vein wall downstream from the graft. Seeded and unseeded grafts were implanted in sheep for three (V) or twelwe (VI) weeks. After three weeks seeded grafts had a higher endoluminal release of prostacyclin and a higher endothelial coverage. After twelwe weeks this difference was no longer obvious.
