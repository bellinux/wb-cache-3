40|$|People {{living in}} endemic areas often habour several malaria infections at once. High-resolution {{genotyping}} can distinguish between infections by detecting {{the presence of}} different alleles at a polymorphic locus. However the number <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> may not be accurately counted since parasites from multiple infections may carry the same allele. We use simulation to determine {{the circumstances under which}} the number of observed genotypes are likely to be substantially less than the number <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> present and investigate the performance of two methods for estimating the numbers <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> from high-resolution genotyping data. The simulations suggest that the problem is not substantial in most datasets: the disparity between the mean numbers <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> and <b>of</b> observed genotypes was small when there was 20 or more alleles, 20 or more blood samples, a mean number <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> 6 or less and where the frequency of the most common allele was no greater than 20 %. The issue <b>of</b> multiple <b>infections</b> carrying the same allele is unlikely to be a major component of the errors in PCR-based genotyping. Simulations also showed that, with heterogeneity in allele frequencies, the observed frequencies are not a good approximation of the true allele frequencies. The first method that we proposed to estimate the numbers <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> assumes that they are a good approximation and hence did poorly in the presence of heterogeneity. In contrast, the second method by Li et al estimates both the numbers <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> and the true allele frequencie...|$|R

40|$|Background : Empirical {{estimates}} of the female-to-male ratio <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> in generalized HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa range from 1. 31 in Zambia to 2. 21 in Ivory Coast. Inequalities in the gender ratio <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> can arise because of differences in exposure (to HIV-positive partners), susceptibility (given exposure), and survival (once infected). Differences in susceptibility have to date received most attention, but neither the relatively high gender ratio <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> nor the heterogeneity in empirical estimates is fully understood. Objective : Demonstrate the relevance of partnership network attributes and sexual mixing patterns to {{gender differences in the}} exposure to HIV-positive partners and the gender ratio <b>of</b> <b>infections.</b> Methods : Agent-based simulation model built in NetLogo. Results : The female-to-male ratio <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> predicted by our model ranges from 1. 13 to 1. 75. Gender-asymmetric partnership concurrency, rapid partnership turnover, elevated partnership dissolution in female-positive serodiscordant couples, and lower partnership re-entry rates among HIV-positive women can produce (substantial) differences in the gender ratio <b>of</b> <b>infections.</b> Coital dilution and serosorting have modest moderating effects. Conclusions : Partnership network attributes and sexual mixing patterns can have a considerable effect on the gender ratio <b>of</b> HIV <b>infections.</b> We need to look beyond individual behavior and gender differences in biological susceptibility if we are to fully understand, and remedy, gender inequalities in HIV infection in generalized epidemics...|$|R
