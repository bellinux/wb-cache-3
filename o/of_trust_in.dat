Domínguez later revealed that the club's lack <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> academy players had contributed to his decision to sign for Gladbach.|$|E
5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of power into the hands of provincial governors, the use of military power to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and centralisation of authority into fewer and fewer men would, with the collapse <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E

2500|$|Groh (faith) - [...] Contains a wider notion <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> or faith <b>in</b> God (known as [...] "Allah" [...] in Arabic and [...] "Khudai" [...] in Pashto). The notion <b>of</b> <b>trusting</b> <b>in</b> one Creator {{generally}} comports to the Islamic idea {{of belief}} in only one God (tawhid).|$|R
5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he {{was said to have}} heard a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with the first day of Baisakhi.|$|E

However, after Shinji and Rei successfully defeat the Angel Ramiel, she takes a friendly liking to him. Towards the end of the series it is revealed that she is one of many clones, whose use is to replace the currently existing Rei if she is killed.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} Dutch threat, Oerip {{intended}} to attack while the former colonists were still consolidating their forces, {{a plan that}} was quashed by the government's attempts at diplomacy. He preferred guerrilla tactics to formal military conflicts, once telling a subordinate that the best attack would be one with a hundred snipers hidden behind enemy lines. Oerip was strongly against the Renville Agreement, an ultimately unsuccessful treaty {{that led to the}} withdrawal of 35,000troops from western Java and the formalisation of the Van Mook Line between Dutch and Indonesian forces. He saw the agreement, ratified on 17January 1948, as a stalling tactic, giving the Dutch the chance to strengthen their forces. Meanwhile, Amir Sjarifuddin– by then also serving as prime minister– began culling the army, predominantly keeping leftist-leaning troops. Disgusted with what he perceived as the government's lack <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> the military, Oerip tendered his resignation, although he continued to serve as an advisor to the Minister of Defence, Vice President Hatta.|$|E

5|$|The band Pylon was {{a long-standing}} and {{influential}} {{part of the}} Athens scene, and became critical darlings in the 1980s, but never achieved significant mainstream success. This was partially because they eschewed several record contracts from the major labels {{due to a lack}} <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> their corporate goodwill. Pylon's dance rock style was not very accessible or commercial, and was accompanied grating, chanting-style vocals, funky guitars and bass-heavy beats. Other 1980s local bands with nationwide alternative followings included Love Tractor, Oh-OK, with Michael Stipe's sister Lynda Stipe, vocalist Linda Hopper (later of Magnapop) and future solo performer Matthew Sweet, Dreams So Real. The members of R.E.M. have remained fixtures in Athens as they have also become international stars, helping out local performers like Vic Chesnutt, the Chickasaw Mudd Puppies and Jack Logan. The Elephant 6 Collective, a group of like-minded indie bands, gained limited nationwide exposure starting in the mid-1990s with the rise of Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and Olivia Tremor Control. The same period saw the Kindercore Records roster find critical acclaim, including the bands Sunshine Fix, Masters of the Hemisphere, Japancakes, Love Tractor, Gresham Disco and Of Montreal. Candy, a DJ store owned by Michael Lachowski of Pylon, opened in 1998; the store became {{an important part of the}} burgeoning dance music scene that produced Danger Mouse, Phungus and DJ 43.|$|E

Since it may be hard for an employee to achieve a similar level <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> a new organization, increased autonomy may also help improve retention.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> schools facilitates collaboration, school health, elementary student achievement, and school effectiveness. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate predictors <b>of</b> faculty <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> the principal, in colleagues, and in clients (students and parents). Moreover, it was hypothesized that because of a "trust spillover " phenomenon, each of the aspects <b>of</b> faculty <b>trust</b> would be moderately correlated with one another.

25|$|Dynasty trust (also {{known as}} a generation-skipping trust): A type <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> which assets are passed down to the grantor's grand{{children}}, not the grantor's children. The children of the grantor never take title to the assets. This allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred {{to his or her}} children first. Generation-skipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantor's children, however, because any income generated by the trust's assets can be made accessible to the grantor's children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren.|$|E
25|$|One {{significant}} problem the migrant domestic workers {{are subjected to}} is physical abuse, the problem mainly lies in {{that there are no}} repercussions from the behalf of the government. There have been many cases of migrant domestic workers’ deaths even and despite that the police does not properly investigate the cases and no employee gets prosecuted for the death. The ministry of labour did take some initiative in creating a hotline for a dispute resolution system, but it is not working effectively because there is a lack <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> the system and as well a lack of knowledge on the process to state a complaint.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{commercial}} treaty {{in the early}} 17th century between Mughal emperor Jahangir and James I of England, the East India Company obtained the exclusive rights to reside and build factories in Surat and other areas. Many Parsis, who until then {{had been living in}} farming communities throughout Gujarat, moved to the English-run settlements to take the new jobs offered. In 1668 the English East India Company leased the Seven Islands of Bombay from Charles II of England. The company found the deep harbour on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the sub-continent, and in 1687 they transferred their headquarters from Surat to the fledgling settlement. The Parsis followed and soon began to occupy posts <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> connection with government and public works.|$|E

25|$|Despite this {{objective}} lack of accountability for policing practice, levels <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> police remain amongst {{the highest in}} the EU, only behind Scandinavian countries and Switzerland. This allows Germany to maintain one of the lowest levels of public order and safety spending in the EU, at 1.5 percent of gross domestic profit, as compared to the EU average of 1.8 percent. As a result, Germany has a police force of only 300 officers per 100,000 of its population. These numbers are only less in Scandinavian countries and the UK, highlighting that despite these instances of police brutality, Germany is attempting to build the impression of having a more laissez-faire approach to policing. Additionally, German police officers rarely use their guns, as there have only been 8 fatalities {{in the past two years}} and only 109 deaths by service weapons since 1998.|$|E
25|$|On October 12, 2007, Nas {{announced}} that his next album {{would be called}} Nigger. Both progressive commentators, such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, and the conservative-aligned news channel Fox News were outraged; Jackson called on entertainers to stop using the epithet after comedian Michael Richards used it onstage in late 2006. Controversy escalated as the album's impending release date drew nearer, going {{as far as to}} spark rumors that Def Jam was planning to drop Nas unless he changed the title. Additionally, Fort Greene, Brooklyn assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries requested New York's Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli to withdraw $84,000,000 from the state pension fund that has been invested into Universal and its parent company, Vivendi, if the album's title was not changed. On {{the opposite side of the}} spectrum, many of the most famous names in the entertainment industry expressed a sense <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>in</b> Nas for using the racial epithet as the title of his full-length LP. Nas's management worried that the album would not be sold by chain stores such as Wal-Mart, thus limiting its distribution.|$|E
