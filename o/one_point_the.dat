5|$|Although the Sabres {{held the}} Flyers to two {{shots in the}} first period of game one, eight in the second, and were the {{beneficiaries}} of a 1:04 two-man advantage at <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> game remained scoreless until the third period when the Flyers connected four times in a 4–1 victory. In game two, the Sabres were held to 19 shots on goal with none coming after Bobby Clarke scored at the 6:43 mark of the third period.|$|E
5|$|As in 1906, {{the race}} was decided by a points system. At {{the end of every}} stage, the winner was given <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> next cyclist two points, and so on. After the eighth stage, when there were only 49 cyclists left in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the {{remaining}} cyclists, according to their positions in those stages.|$|E
5|$|At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> pair split up, {{but soon}} reunited. The {{relationship}} became more serious as she accompanied {{him in his}} efforts to break through in the music industry, and by 1979 they were discussing marriage, conditional upon his career becoming established. In the meantime she worked in a motor insurance company and in her father's electrical business.|$|E

5|$|At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> {{prices for}} his {{pictures}} were exceeded only {{by those of}} renowned English artists Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. Despite his many commissions, however, Stuart was habitually neglectful of finances and {{was in danger of}} being sent to debtors' prison. In 1787, he fled to Dublin, Ireland where he painted and accumulated debt with equal vigor.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria played without Ivan Cheparinov and Kiril Georgiev, {{the former}} due to {{monetary}} disputes, {{and the latter}} because the Bulgarian Chess Federation considered him banned. At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> entire Bulgarian team was rumored not to be coming (similarly they were absent from the 2015 European Team Chess Championship), as was Greece.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, many {{residential}} buildings {{were located in}} the Fortezza. Following the end of World War II, the city began to expand {{and many of the}} inhabitants moved elsewhere in the city. Rethymno's landward fortifications and many houses within the Fortezza were demolished at this point, but the walls of the Fortezza were left intact. At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> local prison was housed within the Fortezza.|$|E

5|$|Darkwatch {{was officially}} {{unveiled}} on January 12, 2004, its announcement {{accompanied by a}} showing of its playable multiplayer deathmatch mode, and was originally slated for a Q4 2004 release.

5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E

50|$|Nebraska {{scored a}} {{touchdown}} with 48 seconds remaining, putting them within <b>one</b> <b>point</b> of <b>the</b> Hurricanes. Despite knowing a tie would still give Nebraska the national title, Coach Tom Osborne {{decided to go}} for two <b>points</b> and <b>the</b> win rather than <b>one</b> <b>point</b> and <b>the</b> tie. Miami was able to hold, snapping Nebraska's 22-game winning streak and launching Miami as a powerhouse program.|$|R

5|$|Prior to Mubarak's speech, {{contradictory}} {{reports from}} various media sources {{around the world}} stated that either Suleiman or Tantawi was expected to take over.

5|$|Since 1980, each voter names three rookies: a first-place {{choice is}} given five points, a second-place choice three points, and a third-place choice <b>one</b> <b>point.</b> <b>The</b> award {{goes to the}} player who {{receives}} the most overall points. Edinson Vólquez received three second-place votes in 2008 balloting despite no longer being a rookie under the award's definition.|$|E
5|$|The American robin has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at , {{and a large}} population of about 320million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> bird was killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Act.|$|E

5|$|The league ranks {{the teams}} by points. A {{regulation}} time win is worth three points. If {{the teams are}} tied {{at the end of}} regulation, both teams receive <b>one</b> <b>point.</b> <b>The</b> team which is victorious either in the overtime period or overtime shoot-out receives an additional point. A regulation time loss is worth zero points.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} fraught with irregularities. All three judges were pro-Goebel Democrats, and at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> juror pool of 368 people {{was found to}} have only eight Republicans. Republican appeals courts {{overturned}} Powers' and Howard's convictions, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two convictions and a hung jury and Howard was tried and convicted twice more. Both men were pardoned in 1908 by Governor Augustus E. Willson.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. Some {{of them were}} already used by the IIHF, such as the shootout and making the two-line pass legal. Others which were not {{picked up by the}} IIHF, such as {{requiring}} smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender trapezoid to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding and interference penalties. In 2006, the IIHF voted to eliminate tie games and institute a three-point system: wins in regulation time would be worth three points, overtime wins would be two points and over-time losses would be worth <b>one</b> <b>point.</b> <b>The</b> system was first used at the 2007 World Championships.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, reform {{movements}} in the U.S. (the so-called Progressive movement) made most forms of gambling illegal in most communities. Gambling continued illegally in many places, though, creating new opportunities for criminal enterprises. The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1919, outlawed the manufacture, transportation, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages and initiated the Prohibition era. The new law was widely unpopular, and bootlegging became rampant. Galveston's already lax social attitudes allowed this, as well as brothels and other illegal businesses, to blossom in the city. These institutions were so accepted that at <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> city required health inspections for prostitutes {{to ensure the safety}} of their clients.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Brown enters another room {{surrounded}} by people in animal heads, and performs the third dance sequence in the video with his backup dancers. Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside the main room and continue dancing. At <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with a cane in a rain-filled room, wearing white dress pants, a black tank top and a fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off his shirt and throws it at the camera, causing its lens to crack.|$|E
