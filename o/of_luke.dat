5|$|The Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> {{says the}} census from Caesar Augustus took place when Quirinius was {{governor}} of Syria. Tipler suggests this took place in AD 6, nine years {{after the death of}} Herod, and that the family of Jesus left Bethlehem shortly after the birth. Some scholars explain the apparent disparity as an error {{on the part of the}} author of the Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Luke,</b> concluding that he was more concerned with creating a symbolic narrative than a historical account, and was either unaware of, or indifferent to, the chronological difficulty.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then be beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from {{the windows of the}} bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image <b>of</b> <b>Luke,</b> and one tears up the photograph <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> with the women.|$|E
5|$|Doggett and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) try to {{get more}} help from Hayes. He tells them that the killer {{they are looking for}} is a {{criminal}} linked to organized crime. The two agents later meet up with Nicholas Regali, a former mobster who claims he is looking for a job in the area. They later find out that Hayes's intuition about Regali was correct. Meanwhile, Hayes returns to his apartment complex where walls are covered with crime scene photos related to the death <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> Doggett. Eventually, Doggett asks Hayes for help solving the case about his son's death. Hayes tells Doggett that he believes that Robert Harvey was behind the kidnapping <b>of</b> <b>Luke,</b> but that Regali killed him.|$|E

5|$|Also {{during his}} time in Africa, after his expeditions to Kilimanjaro and around the Great lakes, he learned to speak several native languages, and wrote the first {{dictionary}} of the (Chichewa) (Kiniassa) language, as well as completing a dictionary (started by his colleague Ludwig Krapf) of the Nika (Mijikenda) language, and a dictionary of Swahili (now lost, but of which some material may have been incorporated into Krapf's Dictionary of the Suaheli Language (1882)). He also translated the Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> into Swahili.|$|E

5|$|In the Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> {{the words}} of the Magnificat are spoken by Mary when she visits her cousin Elizabeth, both being pregnant, Mary with Jesus and Elisabeth with John the Baptist. In Christianity, the feast commemorating that visit is called Visitation. It is a chosen {{opportunity}} to give more than ordinary attention to the Magnificat canticle in liturgy, while the feast celebrates the event tied to its origin.|$|E
5|$|Jesus' {{childhood}} home is {{identified in the}} gospels <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> and Matthew as the town of Nazareth in Galilee, where {{he lived with his}} family. Although Joseph appears in descriptions of Jesus' childhood, no mention is made of him thereafter. His other family members—his mother, Mary, his brothers James, Joses (or Joseph), Judas and Simon and his unnamed sisters—are mentioned in the gospels and other sources.|$|E

Cancellara {{finished}} second, 25 seconds back, with Vanmarcke allowing him to take second place. Kristoff won the sprint for fourth place, ahead <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> Rowe (Sky), 49 seconds behind Sagan.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{text of the}} {{manuscript}} contains fragments of the chapters 1:1-11:33 of the Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Luke.</b> The codex comprises 86 thick, coarse parchment leaves and three partial leaves; it measures 36 x 29cm. The text was written in a single column with well-formed uncial script. The letters are large, round and narrow, without spiritus asper, spiritus lenis, or accents. The manuscript was written by two scribes.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} Meine Seel erhebt den Herren for the Feast of the Visitation (2July), which commemorates Mary's {{visit to}} Elizabeth as narrated in the Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Luke,</b> 1st chapter, verses 39 to 56. In that narrative {{the words of}} the Magnificat, , are spoken by Mary. Traditionally, Luther's translation of the biblical text is sung to a German variant of the tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone, concluding with a doxology, translated from the Gloria Patri, on the same tune. Bach based his BWV10 cantata on Luther's German Magnificat and its traditional setting, working text and melody into the composition as he had done with Lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas.|$|E

5|$|Bach had {{composed}} his Christmas Oratorio, {{based on}} the gospels <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> and Matthew, in 1734, a work in six parts to be performed on six occasions during Christmas tide. He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725. The Ascension Oratorio appeared thus in the same liturgical year as the Christmas Oratorio. The text for the Ascension Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who had written the libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, among others. It follows {{the story of the}} Ascension as told in Luke, Mark and the Acts of the Apostles.|$|E
5|$|Codex Zacynthius (designated by siglum Ξ or 040 in the Gregory-Aland numbering; A1 in von Soden) is a Greek New Testament codex, dated paleographically to the 6th century. First {{thought to}} have been written in the 8th century, it is a palimpsest—the {{original}} (lower) text was washed off its vellum pages and overwritten in the 12th or 13th century. The upper text of the palimpsest contains weekday Gospel lessons; the lower text contains portions of the Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Luke,</b> deciphered by biblical scholar and palaeographer Tregelles in 1861. The lower text is of most interest to scholars.|$|E
5|$|He {{is known}} to have absorbed the {{abilities}} <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E
50|$|<b>Luke</b> <b>of</b> Steiris, <b>Luke</b> Thaumaturgus, Luke the Younger, <b>Luke</b> <b>of</b> Hellas, or <b>Luke</b> the Wonder-worker (d. 946 AD) was a Byzantine {{saint of}} the tenth century AD {{who lived in}} the themes (provinces) of Hellas and Peloponnese in Greece. His relics are {{preserved}} in his monastery of Hosios Loukas. The principal source for Luke's life is an anonymous Life written by a monk of Hosios Loukas who had been one <b>of</b> <b>Luke's</b> followers. His feast day is commemorated on February 7, and the translation of his relics on May 3. He was one of the earliest saints to be seen levitating in prayer.|$|R

5|$|In 2002, new {{evidence}} concerning the murder <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> Doggett came to light. Doggett sought Follmer's assistance {{because he had}} worked against organized crime in New York City before coming to Washington. Reyes, however, recalled seeing Follmer accept a bribe from a mobster. Although he tried to play the event off as him paying an informant (at which he nearly succeeded), the truth was as Reyes suspected: Follmer was crooked. Once the truth of Luke's fate was revealed, Follmer killed the mobster who had nevertheless threatened blackmail concerning Follmer's bribe acceptance. Follmer's future at the FBI was left unresolved, although he most likely faced criminal charges for his actions.|$|E
5|$|The {{handwriting}} of {{the text}} from the beginning <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> to 1 Corinthians 10:8, {{differs from that of}} the rest parts of the manuscript. Some letters have Coptic shapes (f.e. Α, Μ, Δ, and Π). The letters are more widely spaced and are a little larger than elsewhere. Delta has extended base and Pi has extended cross-stroke. Numerals are not expressed by letters except in Apocalypse 7:4; 21:17. In the past the codex had been judged to be carelessly written, with many errors of transcription, but not so many as in the Codex Sinaiticus, nor more than in the Codex Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the badnjak is {{explained}} by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Luke</b> , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By Holy Tradition, the manger was located in a cave near that town. An angel of the Lord appeared {{to a group of}} shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region, and told them that the Savior was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.|$|E
