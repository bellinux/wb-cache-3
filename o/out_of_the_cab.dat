500|$|Due to misting and exhaust obstructing the driver's {{view through}} the window, the driver drove leaning <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> {{for much of}} the time. A side effect of this was that it made hearing the AWS sounder harder, as well as {{observation}} of a flashing light fitted in the cab to remind a driver of an AWS warning.

The train approached signal SN43 at [...] and passed over the temporary AWS magnet. The driver failed to react to the warning given within the time allowed and the brakes were applied.

2500|$|Until 1970, when a train {{paused at}} a red block signal, the train {{operator}} was allowed to pass the red signal using a procedure called [...] "keying by." [...] The train operator would pause at the red signal, and then the operator would get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab,</b> descend to the trackside, and crank down the track trip with a key-like device. After a series of accidents, in which train operators keyed by and crashed into trains in front, the procedure was made against the rules, unless permission was granted by the train dispatchers.|$|E

2500|$|Savoy Court is {{the only}} named street in the United Kingdom where {{vehicles}} are required to drive on the right. [...] This is said to date {{from the days of}} the hackney carriage when a cab driver would reach his arm out of the driver's door window to open the passenger's door (which opened backwards and had the handle at the front), without having to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> himself. Additionally, the hotel entrance's small roundabout meant that vehicles needed a turning circle of [...] to navigate it. This is still the legally required turning circle for all London cabs.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 February 2007 a Class 390 Pendolino [...] "City of Glasgow" [...] {{forming the}} 17:15 London Euston to Glasgow Central service derailed {{in the village}} of Grayrigg in Cumbria. The train was {{carrying}} 109 people. Several carriages were left lying on the railway embankments. An elderly woman was killed in the derailment. Five people were seriously injured. The accident was caused by a faulty set of points and Network Rail accepted full responsibility. The train itself however was widely praised for the way it retained its structural integrity. Richard Branson also praised the train driver because he attempted to stop the train and did not get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> before it derailed.|$|E

50|$|The {{system is}} {{failsafe}} in that <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> code would display a Restricting signal. The codes would be {{transmitted to the}} train from the block limit in front of it. This way if the rail was broken or another train entered the block, any codes would not reach the onrushing train and <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> signal would again display Restricting. Trains with an insufficient number of axles will not short <b>out</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> signal current so that following trains might receive an incorrect aspect.

2500|$|On January 3, 1958, at 6:15 pm, a {{few days}} before Frances was {{scheduled}} to lead a junket of editors to Brazil, the Rushmores met inside the lobby of their apartment building in a final attempt at reconciliation. Frances was due to have dinner at the Dobbins' at 8 pm. When an argument broke out between the couple, Frances left to hail a taxi. Taxi driver Edward Pearlman picked her up at Madison Avenue and 97th Street. Simultaneously, Howard entered the cab. As the two continued arguing, Pearlman ordered him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> to which he replied, “I’m her husband, don’t worry about it.” “Where do you want to go?” Pearlman asked. “Take me to a police station,” Frances said. As the cab raced to the 23rd Precinct at Third and 104th, they were only two blocks away when Frances screamed, “Oh my God!” Suddenly, three gunshots fired inside the cab. Rushmore had shot his wife in {{the right side of the}} head and neck then put the pistol to his temple and shot himself. At the police station, an unregistered [...]32 Colt revolver was found in Rushmore's hand and a seven-inch commando knife inside the waistband of his trousers. Jean Dobbins speculated that her mother's refusal to take Rushmore to Brazil might have started the argument that ended in the shooting. Contrary to general expectations, Dobbs said her parents quarreled [...] "over personal things, not Rushmore's controversial public life ... 'He was very possessive, very jealous, and wanted to go everywhere with her." [...] Frances Rushmore's father, Louis Everitt, the owner of a women's shoe store in Charlotte, brought his daughter's body back to North Carolina.|$|E

60|$|We {{decided not}} to lunch at that early hour, but we could not keep our eyes from feasting, even at eleven o'clock in the morning, on the {{wonderful}} prospect that tempted them, on every hand, away from the more immediate affair <b>of</b> choosing one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many <b>cabs</b> that thronged about our arriving train. <b>The</b> <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> Frascati are all finer than <b>the</b> <b>cabs</b> <b>of</b> Rome, and <b>the</b> horses are handsomer and younger and stronger; we could have taken <b>the</b> worst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipages that contested our favor and still fared well; but we chose the best--a glittering victoria and an animal of proud action, with a lustrous coat of bay. He wore a ring of joyous bells; he had, indeed, not a headstall of such gay colors as some others; but you cannot have everything, and his driver was of a mental vividness which compensated for all the color wanting in his horse's headstall, and of a personal attraction which made us ambitious for his company on any terms. He quickly reduced us from our vain supposition that carriages in a country-place should be cheaper than in a city; because, as he proved, there were fewer strangers to hire them and they ought logically to be dearer. So far from accepting our modest standards of time and money, he all but persuaded us to employ him for the whole day instead of a few hours at a price beyond our imagination; and he only consented to compromise on a half-day at an increased figure.|$|R

40|$|An {{immunoglobulin}} M kappa-chain murine {{monoclonal antibody}} (CAB) reacted in a Western blot (immunoblot) with approximately 30 polypeptides from a whole-cell lysate of several American and European Borrelia burgdorferi strains. The reactive antigen {{with the highest}} M(r) was measured at 93 kDa (p 93) and had an NH 2 -terminal sequence {{identical to the one}} previously reported for this antigen. The lowest reactive antigen had an M(r) of 16, 000. All antigens recognized by CAB had isoelectric points within a narrow acidic range, between 5. 4 and 6. 2. Thus, <b>the</b> objective <b>of</b> {{this study was to determine}} whether <b>the</b> broad reactivity <b>of</b> <b>CAB</b> could be due to degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antigen with the highest M(r), since such spontaneous degradation of p 93 has already been reported, and to determine whether CAB could recognize shared epitopes in different antigens. Treatment of B. burgdorferi with protease inhibitors did not result in changes in CAB reactivity, indicating that if such degradation existed, it was most likely not due to <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> endogenous proteases. Likewise, protease treatment of intact organisms and recovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antigens in <b>the</b> insoluble fraction <b>of</b> a Triton X- 114 partition indicated that they were internal and thus less likely to be degraded by experimental procedures. Amino-terminal sequences of other reactive polypeptides showed one approximately 72 -kDa polypeptide to be identical to <b>the</b> DnaK homolog <b>of</b> B. burgdorferi. Two other antigens at approximately 49 and 47 kDa were blocked to Edman degradation. Finally, one sequenced polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 38. 5 kDa had a strong identity with glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase of other bacteria and vertebrates. Thus, while it cannot be ruled <b>out</b> that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CAB</b> reactivity may be due to fragmentation of p 93, there is strong evidence to indicate <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a shared epitope in at least three, possibly five, unrelated antigens of B. burgdorferi. A linear epitope within amino acid residues 357 to 371 of p 93 was identified. Evidence is presented for a discontinuous epitope in <b>the</b> carboxy-terminal region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DnaK homolog, which bears strong amino acid identity with the p 93 epitope. The conserved amino acid sequences necessary for these shared epitopes indicate possible genetic and/or functional relatedness among these various antigens...|$|R
