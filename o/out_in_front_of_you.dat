500|$|Due to the {{time-frame}} of {{the original}} band's career, Van der Graaf Generator have been frequently {{referred to as a}} progressive rock band. Writing in Record Collector, Toby Manning said the music was [...] "philosophical, even intellectual, complex [...]. at times, terrifying". While the music on The Aerosol Grey Machine (September 1969) has a more pastoral, hippie feel, with prominent use of Hammill's acoustic guitar, later work featured more complex instrumentation and arrangements. Hammill thinks the style of the band evolved due to the culture of music in the late 1960s, stating [...] "the whole of music was laid <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you...</b> it was the blues in wonky time signatures." [...] Both Hammill and Banton have stated that Jimi Hendrix was an influence on the band's sound, with Hammill remarking that [...] "there'd been distortion before, but there hadn't been that real out-there attitude to sound in itself". The group's experimental style has also been compared to Krautrock bands such as Can. Because of their musical influences and line-up, the band tended to play darker musical themes than other progressive bands, {{with the possible exception of}} King Crimson. However, Hammill has stated that the group is still fun to work with, stating [...] "as far as we're concerned, it's serious fun, but fun nonetheless." ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{with the}} arts {{it is quite}} another matter. While you will search in vain, in his civilization, for {{explanations}} {{of even the most}} simple of nature's laws, you will meet at every turn with devices for the beautifying of life, which may stand not unworthily beside the products of nature's own skill. Whatever these people fashion, from the toy of an hour to the triumphs of all time, is touched by a taste unknown elsewhere. To stroll down the Broadway of Tokio of an evening is a liberal education in everyday art. As you enter it there opens <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> a fairy-like vista of illumination. Two long lines of gayly lighted shops, stretching off into the distance, look out across two equally endless rows of torch-lit booths, the decorous yellow gleam of the one contrasting strangely with the demoniacal red flare of the other. This perspective of pleasure fulfils its promise. As your feet follow your eyes you find yourself in a veritable shoppers' paradise, the galaxy of twinkle resolving into worlds of delight. Nor do you long remain a mere spectator; for the shops open their arms to you. No cold glass reveals their charms only to shut you off. Their wares lie invitingly exposed to the public, seeming to you already half your own. At the very first you come to you stop involuntarily, lost in admiration over what you take to be bric-a-brac. It is only afterwards you learn that the object of your ecstasy was the commonest of kitchen crockery. Next door you halt again, this time in front of some leathern pocket-books, stamped with designs in color to tempt you instantly to empty your wallet for more new ones than you will ever have the means to fill. If you do succeed in tearing yourself away purse-whole, it is only to fall a victim to some painted fans of so exquisite a make and decoration that escape short of possession is impossible. Opposed as stubbornly as you may be to idle purchase at home, here you will find yourself the prey of an acute case of shopping fever before you know it. Nor will it be much consolation subsequently to discover that you have squandered your patrimony upon the most ordinary articles of every-day use. If in despair you turn for refuge to the booths, you will but have delivered yourself into the embrace of still more irresistible fascinations. For the nocturnal squatters are there {{for the express purpose of}} catching the susceptible. The shops were modestly attractive from their nature, but the booths deliberately make eyes at you, and with telling effect. The very atmosphere is bewitching. The lurid smurkiness of the torches lends an appropriate weirdness to the figure of the uncouthly clad pedlar who, with the politeness of the arch-fiend himself, displays to an eager group the fatal fascinations of some new conceit. Here the latest thing in inventions, a gutta-percha rat, which, for reasons best known to the vender, scampers about squeaking with a mimicry to shame the original, holds an admiring crowd spellbound with mingled trepidation and delight. There a native zoetrope, indefatigable round of pleasure, whose top fashioned after the type of a turbine wheel enables a candle at the centre ingeniously to supply both illumination and motive power at the same time, affords to as many as can find room on its circumference a peep at the composite antics of a consecutively pictured monkey in the act of jumping a box. Beyond this [...] "wheel of life" [...] lies spread out on a mat a most happy family of curios, the whole of which you are quite prepared to purchase en bloc. While a little farther on stands a flower show which seems to be coyly beckoning to you as the blossoms nod their heads to an imperceptible breeze. So one attraction fairly jostles its neighbor for recognition from the gay thousands that like yourself stroll past in holiday delight. Chattering children in brilliant colors, voluble women and talkative men in quieter but no less picturesque costumes, stream on in kaleidoscopic continuity. And you, carried along by the current, wander thus for miles with the tide of pleasure-seekers, till, late at night, when at last you turn reluctantly homeward, you feel as one does when wakened from some too delightful dream.|$|E

Freed from the classification of form, Vaccha, the Tathagata is deep, boundless, hard to fathom, like the sea. 'Reappears' doesn't apply. 'Does not reappear' doesn't apply. 'Both does & does not reappear' doesn't apply. 'Neither reappears nor does not reappear' doesn't apply.|$|E
5000|$|No one {{is likely}} to confuse the savage energy of King Crimson and Van der Graaf Generator in their mid-1970s incarnations with the disinterested density of Gentle Giant or the more pastoral, at times delicate, stylizations of Genesis or Renaissance (or even Yesin their quieter moments) Edward Macan Due to the {{time-frame}} of the original band's career, Van der Graaf Generator have been frequently {{referred to as a}} progressive rock band.

Hold your thumb <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> at arm's length and view it first with your right eye (left eye closed). Note the background. Then with your left eye (right eye closed) repeat the experiment. Your thumb appears to jump! Actually it is the background that changes. This shift is called a parallactic shift. The distance from the bridge of your nose to the thumb in your extended hand can be calculated by combining this shift and the distance between your two eyes (called base line) with a little geometry. Notice that this shift is estimated by noting {{the change in the}} fixed background. It is this simple principle that will be used on the transit day. Let us start with some definitions. The parallax πs of the sun is defined as the subtended by the radius of the earth Re at the sun. πs = Re / ds In the figure below E, V and S are the Earth, Venus and the Sun.
