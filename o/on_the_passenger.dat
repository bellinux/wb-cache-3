5|$|In May 2011, all 24,091 C3 Picassos in the UK were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} modification, following complaints and {{an investigation by}} BBC consumer affairs programme Watchdog into brakes that could be activated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> side of the right-hand drive vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Cunard was in {{significant}} financial difficulties when Smallpeice joined, and posted {{a loss of}} $7.2 million in 1965, losing money <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> ships and making profits on their shipping line. Smallpeice initially attempted to resolve the financial position of the company by embarking on a merger with another shipping line. Ocean Steamship Company had previously asked that they have first refusal on a merger with Cunard. Ocean Steamship brought P into the discussions, and a three-way merger at one point looked feasible, but neither party could see any benefit in a deal involving Cunard, and backed out of proposed deal.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} {{processed}} in sequence to article Mechanics of car frontal crash from conference (Expert Forensic Science) 2010 and deals with <b>the</b> deceleration acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> in <b>the</b> frontal impact. There is explained principle of obtaining the maximal deceleration acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> in <b>the</b> vehicle during the frontal impact from damage of the vehicle. From {{the point of}} view size of deceleration during the impact is obtained difference between restrained and unrestrained passenger. For an example about it what size achieves values of deceleration acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> during <b>the</b> frontal impact are processed and evaluated data from the dummy from the real crash test of the vehicle...|$|R
5000|$|Options {{available}} at extra cost included velour carpeting, grab handles for <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> in <b>the</b> back, whitewall tires, a two tone paint finish {{and even a}} [...] "make-up mirror" [...] cleverly incorporated into <b>the</b> sun-visor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> side.|$|R
50|$|Increasingly strange {{incidents}} {{occur as}} {{the lights go out}} in some carriages and the carriages suddenly look old and in another, lights shatter and glass falls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>passengers</b> do not know where to go to escape the coming crash since the back of the train is no longer safe. Mi-Sun tries to stop them from crashing the train.|$|R
25|$|There were {{at least}} four US {{government}} officials <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> list with rumours, never confirmed, of a fifth on board. The presence of these men on the flight later gave rise to conspiracy theories, in which {{one or more of}} them were said to have been targeted.|$|E
25|$|The Amtrac on {{the right}} manoeuvred itself off the road into a little {{depression}} and as it did so, disembarked the Marines inside (including one wounded, Private Horacio Tello) out of view. This encouraged the Royal Marines to think that Marine Mark Gibbs had scored a direct hit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> compartment of the APC.|$|E
25|$|An air bag is {{a safety}} feature {{designed}} to protect automobile passengers in a head-on collision. Most cars today have driver's side airbags and many have one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> side as well. Located in the steering wheel assembly on the driver's side and in the dashboard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> side, the air bag device responds within milliseconds of a crash. The original safety cushion was first created by John W. Hetrick in 1952. After a car accident that his family was involved in, Hetrick drew sketches of compressed air stored in a container. When a spring-loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate, it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag. With this knowledge, he developed his design until {{he was able to}} obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952. Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S. Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967, the ball-in-tube inertial sensor for crash detection. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler.|$|E
50|$|Incidents {{involving}} hijacked {{aircraft and}} terrorists throughout Malaysia {{come under the}} remit of PASKAU. The unit is trained {{to solve the problem}} with <b>the</b> least effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> and aircraft.|$|R
50|$|As in {{previous}} years, the Top 40 Qualifying cars eligible to start, must have flashing lights installed (for better {{identification of the}} Top 40 competitors) behind <b>the</b> windscreen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger’s</b> side.|$|R
50|$|From now <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> in <b>the</b> {{rear seats}} can adjust <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> seat from <b>the</b> back. The {{electrical}} control is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> seat near <b>the</b> centre console {{and is thus}} easy to operate from <b>the</b> back. <b>Passengers</b> in <b>the</b> rear can move the front seat forward and back and adjust the seat height and angle.|$|R
25|$|Mounting base: Attaches the {{mounting}} {{system to the}} vehicle. This element is commonly composed of rugged materials such as steel. Tunnel Mounts attach to the raised floor area (drive shaft tunnel) between the driver and passenger. Passenger Side Mounts attach to floor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> side of the vehicle. Console mounting brackets attach to an existing vehicle center console. Trunk Mounts provide mounting options for use inside car trunks.|$|E
25|$|The ferries {{operate with}} four crew members on board (captain and first mate {{on the bridge}} and two attendants <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> level) and {{engineers}} who stay ashore most of the time, but do regular checks of the engines and are available to come aboard at any time. Seabus crew members are trained and certified to deal with marine emergencies, and will give directions to passengers {{in the unlikely event}} of an emergency.|$|E
25|$|Investigation {{after the}} {{accident}} revealed that one deadheading person who was not included <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> list was present on the plane. He was a former Aero O/Y pilot and WWII fighter ace who was allowed to travel in the cockpit by the pilots. Contrary to the speculation in the press following the incident, his presence likely {{did not have any}} connection to the occurrence of the accident, according to the investigation report.|$|E
50|$|Each car is {{numbered}} (1 to 100), with a 348 Serie Speciale plate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> side door-post.In 1994, {{a further}} 15 units were produced, {{bringing the total}} production of this limited edition to 115.|$|R
50|$|The Franklin Mint {{produced}} a die-cast toy {{model of a}} 1956 Metropolitan in a police car version. Among its features are a police hat and handcuffs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> seat, {{as well as a}} fire extinguisher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor.|$|R
50|$|This form of {{in-flight}} {{entertainment is}} experienced through headphones that are distributed to <b>the</b> <b>passengers.</b> <b>The</b> headphone plugs are usually only compatible with <b>the</b> audio socket <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> armrest (and vice versa), and some airlines may charge {{a small fee}} to obtain a pair. The headphones provided {{can also be used}} for the viewing of personal televisions.|$|R
25|$|From {{this time}} the GWR drafted in three new 45XX 2-6-2T locomotives, 4504 - 4506, for use <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> trains. The Taff Vale Railway did not {{consider}} the GWR a friendly company, and the TVR reminded the GWR that the agreement to use Treherbert TVR station was with the R, not the GWR: the latter had to rebrand the locomotives and renumber them in the R stock, as 31 - 33, to comply.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect that}} {{windshield}} wipers {{have on a}} vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace the windshield wipers with lower profile wipers, or to only remove the windshield wiper <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> side of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air up and over the wipers.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} Belfast City Airport at 07:15 {{after a short}} positioning flight from Belfast International Airport, and was refuelled for the planned route-trip to Cork and back. The flight specified Waterford Airport as the alternate airport for the sector to Cork. No second alternate was made. Boarding of the flight was delayed due to both crew members working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> seats in the cabin; boarding commenced once that task was completed. Passengers chose their seats at random and the safety demonstration {{was carried out by}} the co-pilot.|$|E
50|$|The interior, {{like the}} {{exterior}} and chassis, is made entirely of carbon fiber. There are four screens: one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver's side of <b>the</b> dashboard, one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> side of <b>the</b> dashboard, one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center console, and one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Ben-my-Chrees <b>passenger</b> {{facilities}} are centred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main <b>passenger</b> area <b>on</b> Deck 7.|$|R
50|$|The {{trainset}} has {{the ability}} to tilt by up to 8° when taking corners so as to reduce the effect of centrifugal force <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>passengers</b> remain comfortable even if the train fully takes advantage of the characteristics of the track thanks to the lightness of the construction (only 13.5 t / axle).Use of the train does not demand particular modifications to the railroad but it is expensive in terms of maintenance of the rolling stock due to the complexity of the tilting system.|$|R
25|$|Most jurisdictions permit rear {{fog lamps}} to be {{installed}} either singly or in pairs. If a single rear fog is fitted, most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver's side of the vehicle's centreline—whichever side is the prevailing driver's side {{in the country in}} which the vehicle is registered. This is to maximize the sight line of following drivers to the rear fog lamp. In many cases, a single reversing lamp is mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> side of the vehicle, positionally symmetrical with the rear fog. If two {{rear fog lamps}} are fitted, they must be symmetrical with respect to the vehicle's centreline.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation RX comes {{standard}} with a twin-chamber {{front passenger}} airbags, side torso airbags {{for the front}} row, side curtain airbags for front and rear rows, and knee airbags for the front row. Active headrests become standard to help reduce whiplash injuries. Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Hill Assist Control (HAC) which helps prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards on inclines are standard while a more advanced Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system is optional. VDIM {{is designed to be}} more subtle and less intrusive in performance than VSC alone, VDIM can also engage prior to an actual skid taking place acting as a preventative measure. The Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) remains optional, while a new bi-xenon optional Intelligent Highbeam feature is added, this system can dim the high-beams automatically whenever traffic is detected. Other optional safety features include a Pre-Collision System (PCS) and a Head-up Display (HUD) which helps the driver keep attention on the road ahead by displaying navigation, speed, and audio information on the windshield; the HUD uses high-intensity LEDs displaying high contrast white figures on the windshield allowing it to be read in direct sunlight. The optional navigation system offers a backup camera and a Wide-View Side Monitor utilizes a camera <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> side view mirror to help eliminate blind spots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> side at low speeds, this system does not include the 180° wide-angle front camera found in the LX 570. To further help improve visibility, water-repellent glass is used on the front doors.|$|E
25|$|The second {{aircraft}} entered {{service in}} November {{and the third}} in early 1947. FOF and DNL started an operations cooperation in early 1947, but this lasted for only a year, when FOF withdrew and DNL shifted to cooperate in the Scandinavian Airlines System. Since FOF focused exclusively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> and freight charter market. In April and May 1952 the airline experienced two write-off incidents, causing a shortage of aircraft and crew, resulting in the purchase of another DC-3 and a Douglas DC-4. The latter only remained in use for two years. The airline also bought a helicopter, a Hiller 360, bought in 1954 which crashed on its inaugural flight. It was registered as LN-FOG, and since all of the airline's registration codes started with FO.|$|E
50|$|Cars sold from 1952 also {{featured}} a fuel-based passenger cabin heater. In order to ignite the heater {{it was necessary}} first to open a small tap in the engine bay, after which the flow of hot air could be regulated using a control in <b>the</b> footwell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> side.|$|R
50|$|The {{series is}} focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> and flights {{originating}} out of Southwest Airlines focus cities at Baltimore-Washington International, Chicago Midway, Houston's Hobby Airport and Los Angeles International. The series also follows customers in {{all types of}} moods and situations, and also {{takes a look at}} employees both <b>on</b> and off <b>the</b> job.|$|R

25|$|Six {{and seven}} car trains were run, and {{as on the}} City and South London Railway, {{locomotives}} were stepped back at the termini. A seven-car train required a crew of eight. Two men rode in the locomotive, there was a front and rear guard, and four additional men operated the gates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> cars. 28 locomotives were built, although 32 were ordered, the remaining four intended for when the extension from Bank to Liverpool Street was opened. However, from 1901 trials were conducted with multiple units, with motor cars converted from trailer cars 54, 81, 84 and 88. These became the first operational multiple units in Europe, {{and the benefits of}} virtually eliminating vibration and the ease of reversing them at the termini resulted in an order for 64 motor cars being placed. They were delivered in mid-1903, and the locomotives became redundant after only three years.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, Labonte {{announced}} the GEICO 500 {{is to be}} his 890th and final start. To commemorate the occasion, Go Fas Racing designed a car split into three designs: the Kellogg's design from his 1996 title run on the driver side, the Piedmont Airlines design from his 1984 championship year <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> side, and the Duck Industries design from his early career in the center. However, NASCAR did not allow the scheme, due to a rule stating cars must have the same colors on both the driver side and passenger {{side of the car}} for safety reasons; the team would switch to the former design, while being allowed to retain the center. Labonte qualified ninth, but because of the unapproved paint scheme, was forced to start {{at the tail end of}} the field. He would finish in thirty-third place, one lap down in his final race.|$|E
25|$|Finally on 28 November 1944, {{an accord}} was signed between the US and Portuguese governments, that envisioned its {{use as a}} {{waypoint}} for planes travelling to the Pacific theatre of operations, or those {{that needed to be}} diverted due to weather conditions. This was followed on 14 December 1944 by a similar accord between Pan American Airways and the Portuguese government, resulting in the installation of new radio equipment. Work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> terminal and support buildings had already progressed, along with runways 2 and 3 and the parking area. At this time there were 3000 workers onsite: 2000 American, 600 Micaleanse and 400 Marienses, a number that continued to grow over time (eventually reaching 3000 Americans and 1000 Azoreans). Meanwhile, the port was expanded to receive battalions with the equipment necessary to improve the infrastructures and to construct a network to pipe aviation fuel to the plateau. These included: airport infrastructures; roadways; water supply and sewage; residences; and social spaces (such as hotel, gymnasium, church, a cinema/theatre to hold 1000 people, and a hospital in the area of Santana, to evacuate the injured in the European theatre).|$|E
