5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number <b>of</b> <b>logging</b> permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
5|$|The Anahim hotspot {{is set in}} {{a remote}} {{location}} accessed by a network <b>of</b> <b>logging</b> roads from Quesnel on Highway 97. Because of this, the most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only. Although not heavily populated, the area is home to forestry operations and the small community of Nazko. The presence of burned wood within Nazko tephra suggests that this area is prone to forest fires caused by volcanic eruptions. Also, if an eruption column were to be produced, it would disrupt local air traffic. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems. Renewed volcanism is likely to result in the creation of mafic cinder cones. The latest such event occurred with the eruption of Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. However, eruptions of less mafic magma, typical of earlier activity of the Anahim hotspot, cannot be ruled out.|$|E
30|$|Air-drying {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used operations to dehydrate logging residues for production of wood fuel chips. This study developed a drying curve model for the air-drying <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> in order to estimate drying time to reach a given moisture level, and to evaluate the influence <b>of</b> <b>log</b> properties on drying characteristics <b>of</b> <b>logs.</b> <b>Log</b> piles <b>of</b> sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) were air-dried in Tsukuba city, Japan, from November 2014 to August 2015. A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to estimate the moisture content <b>of</b> individual <b>logs</b> as a function of initial moisture content, diameter, length, heartwood ratio, and drying time. The measured mean moisture content fit well to the estimated drying curve, indicating that the developed model is a potentially useful method to estimate the drying time for any moisture content within the limited range of climate conditions studied here. A comprehensive evaluation <b>of</b> <b>log</b> properties affecting the drying characteristics <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> showed that initial moisture content, diameter, and length have an influence on the drying rate <b>of</b> <b>logs.</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{a method}} for estimating relationship between weight and volume <b>of</b> <b>log</b> <b>of</b> Acacia mangium. DBH of 50 trees (planted in 1991) in a sample plot in Subanjeriji had been measured, and the trees were then felled and bucked into 2. 50 m logs upto a limit diameter of 8 cm. Diameter <b>of</b> each <b>log</b> was measured al both ends, and diameter <b>of</b> <b>log</b> was the mean of both ends diameter. The volume <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> was calculated by using formula of V = π R 2 L. The mean <b>of</b> the <b>log</b> volume were 0. 0485 m 3 and 0. 039 m 3 for logs with bark and logs without bark respectively, and the mean <b>of</b> the <b>log</b> weight were 0. 02846 ton and 0. 025298 ton for logs with bark and logs without bark respectively. The relationship between the weight and volume <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> could be drawn by the formulas: B 1 = 0. 65 V, with t = 100. 89 and r = 0. 93 B 2 = 0. 59 V 1, with t = 94. 61 and r = 0. 92 B 3 = 0. 56 V, with t = 58. 18 and r = 0. 82 Since t 0, 01 is equal to 2. 338 on 386 degrees of freedom, the coefficient of the three regressions are highly significant. Where B 1 is the weight <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> with bark, and B 2, and B 3 are both the weight <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> without bark, and V and V 1 are the volume <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> with and without bark respectively. The smallest convertion from volume to weight (density) is 0, 56 ton/m 3 that is for weight <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> without bark to logs with bark. Since the raw materials for pulp industry are logs without bark, the convertion from volume <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> with bark lo weight <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> without bark should use density value of 0. 56 ton/m 3. The staplemeter unit (sm) used by PT Musi Hulan Persada (PT MHP) {{as a tool for}} measuring the logs volume is miss used for the mean of tonage of weigt which transported by truck was 43. 15 tonnes with the mean <b>of</b> estimated <b>log</b> volume was 77. 65 sm.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to define a {{reasonable}} moduli theory <b>of</b> <b>log</b> smooth curves which recovers the classical Deligne-Knudsen-Mumford moduli of pointed stable curves.

In this paper we will develop the theory <b>of</b> moduli <b>of</b> <b>log</b> smooth curves, which is expected to give a compactification of the classical moduli of algebraic curves.
