5|$|Bicycle and {{motorcycle}} dynamics is {{the science}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> of bicycles and motorcycles and their components, {{due to the}} forces acting on them. Dynamics falls under a branch of physics known as classical mechanics. Bike motions of interest include balancing, steering, braking, accelerating, suspension activation, and vibration.

5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that {{the speed of light}} in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.|$|E

5|$|Measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 {{suggest that these}} two galaxies are moving toward each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may have encountered M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 2011, Neptune {{completed}} its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in 1846, {{although it did}} not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a different location in its 365.26-day orbit. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> of the Sun {{in relation to the}} barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July 2011.|$|E

Results are obtained for a model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge without isolation pads and for various values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shear modulus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rubber. This allows comparing <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predominant frequencies and <b>the</b> dynamic amplification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> over an extended range <b>of</b> frequencies. <b>The</b> results are then compared to <b>the</b> power spectra <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> recorded at three points of an instrumented pier (the base, <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pier, and the same location on the deck) under an actual earthquake.
