25|$|More monumental {{than the}} three panels that preceded it, the two figures {{dominate}} the foreground of Eight Bells, {{and the details}} of the ship are minimally rendered. Homer has taken some artistic license, showing the figure at left using an <b>octant</b> to take a reading of the sun, the other apparently reading the altitude of a completed sight on his <b>octant.</b> In reality, both observers would have had their octants to their eyes, rocking them back and forth to determine the highest elevation reached by the sun, thereby establishing local apparent noon. The moment is prosaic, yet it is presented as a heroic image. In 1887 Homer produced an etching based on the painting, in which he further minimized the ship's rigging and diminished the area of sky, thereby focusing more on the figures.|$|E

25|$|Eight Bells was the {{outgrowth}} {{of a series}} of oil paintings that Homer made using three wooden panels he found in the cabin of his brother's sloop at Prouts Neck, Maine. On two of the panels Homer painted scenes of mackerel fleets at Prouts Neck, one at dawn and the other at sunset; on the third he painted a grisaille study of the work that inspired Eight Bells, which depicted a ship's officer standing alone, taking an observation with an <b>octant.</b> Several years earlier, Homer had painted a watercolor on his voyage to England that also showed a sailor performing this activity.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>octant,</b> {{also called}} [...] "reflecting quadrant", is a {{measuring}} instrument used primarily in navigation. It {{is a type}} of reflecting instrument that uses mirrors to reflect the path of light to the observer and, in doing so, doubles the angle measured. This allows the instrument to use a one-eighth circle arc to measure a quarter circle or quadrant. The <b>octant</b> was invented in 1730 by Thomas Godfrey, a glazier in Philadelphia, and independently {{at the same time in}} England by the mathematician John Hadley, who began work on a similar version of the <b>octant.</b> Both men have an equal and legitimate claim to the invention of the <b>octant.</b> Originally this instrument was referred to as [...] "Hadley's quadrant", after the English inventor. These days it is now known as an <b>octant,</b> the name given to it by its American inventor, Thomas Godfrey.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, a {{three-dimensional}} Cartesian system defines {{a division of}} space into eight regions or octants, according to {{the signs of the}} coordinates of the points.

2500|$|In 1757, John Bird {{invented the}} first sextant.This {{replaced}} the Davis quadrant and the <b>octant</b> {{as the main}} instrument for navigation. The sextant {{was derived from the}} <b>octant</b> in order to provide for the lunar distance method. [...] With the lunar distance method, mariners could determine their longitude accurately. [...] Once chronometer production was established in the late 18th century, the use of the chronometer for accurate determination of longitude was a viable alternative. Chronometers replaced lunars in wide usage by the late 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Octans [...] is a faint {{constellation}} {{located in}} the deep southern sky.

40|$|Key words: {{ray tracing}} optimization, {{non-uniform}} spatial subdivision, octree, octtree, octree subdivision methods. The non-uniform spatial subdivision technique refined by Andrew Glassner [Glassner 1984] minimizes facet intersection tests (i) by automatically generating a density dependent spatial hierarchy of facet regions (called an octree) and(ii) by only testing facets in regions {{along the path}} of the ray. Past research has addressed optimization of the octree ray tracing process by separately improving both the octree traversal method and facet intersection algorithms. This author attempted to further improve the overall approach by attempting to identify new octree construction methods that would decrease the number of traversals required to render the scene. This research focused on the subdivision technique used in constructing the octree. The conventional Glassner algorithm utilizes cubic <b>octants</b> that can result in a large population of empty <b>octants</b> when rendering scenes containing localized regions with high facet density. Sparse octrees (containing significant numbers of empty <b>octants)</b> were believed to hinder performance of the facet traversal algorithm.

2500|$|Octans {{was one of}} 14 constellations {{created by}} Nicolas Louis de Lacaille during his {{expedition}} to the Cape of Good Hope, and was originally named [...] "l’Octans de Reflexion", French for “the reflecting octant”. It {{was part of his}} catalogue of the southern sky, the Coelum Australe Stelliferum, which was published posthumously in 1763. In Europe, it became more widely known as Octans Hadleianus, in honor of English mathematician John Hadley, who invented the <b>octant</b> in 1730. There is no real mythology related to Octans, partially due to its faintness and relative recentness, but mostly because of its extreme southerly latitude.|$|E
2500|$|No further {{practical}} advance {{appears to}} {{have been made in the}} design or construction of the reflecting telescopes for another 50 years until John Hadley (best known as the inventor of the <b>octant)</b> developed ways to make precision aspheric and parabolic speculum metal mirrors. In 1721 he showed the first parabolic Newtonian reflector to the Royal Society. It had a [...] diameter, [...] focal length speculum metal objective mirror. The instrument was examined by James Pound and James Bradley. After remarking that Newton's telescope had lain neglected for fifty years, they stated that Hadley had sufficiently shown that the invention did not consist in bare theory. They compared its performance with that of a [...] diameter aerial telescope originally presented to the Royal Society by Constantijn Huygens, Jr. and found that Hadley's reflector, [...] "will bear such a charge as to make it magnify the object as many times as the latter with its due charge", and that it represents objects as distinct, though not altogether so clear and bright.|$|E
50|$|In a {{three-dimensional}} n-body simulation, the Barnes-Hut algorithm recursively divides the n bodies into groups by storing {{them in an}} octree (or a quad-tree in a 2D simulation). Each node in this tree represents a region of the three-dimensional space. The topmost node represents the whole space, and its eight children represent the eight <b>octants</b> of the space. The space is recursively subdivided into <b>octants</b> until each subdivision contains 0 or 1 bodies (some regions do not have bodies in all of their <b>octants).</b> There {{are two types of}} nodes in the octree: internal and external nodes. An external node has no children and is either empty or represents a single body. Each internal node represents the group of bodies beneath it, and stores the center of mass and the total mass of all its children bodies.|$|R
50|$|The Bris sextant {{is not a}} true sextant, {{but it is a}} true {{reflecting}} instrument {{based on}} the principle of double reflection and subject to the same rules and errors as common <b>octants</b> and sextants. Unlike common <b>octants</b> and sextants, the Bris sextant is a fixed angle instrument capable of accurately measuring a few specific angles unlike other reflecting instruments which can measure any angle within the range of the instrument. It is particularly suited to determining the altitude of the sun or moon.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>octants</b> {{retained}} some of {{the features}} common to backstaves, such as transversals on the scale. However, as engraved, they showed the instrument to have an apparent accuracy of only two minutes of arc while the backstaff appeared to be accurate to one minute. The use of the vernier scale allowed the scale to be read to one minute, so improved the marketability of the instrument. This and the ease in making verniers compared to transversals, lead to adoption of the vernier on <b>octants</b> produced later in the 18th century.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{structure}} unit of YB66, {{shown in}} figure 4b, is B80 cluster of 80 boron sites formed by the B10 to B13 sites. All those 80 sites are partially occupied and in total contain only about 42 boron atoms. The B80 cluster {{is located at the}} body center of the <b>octant</b> of the unit cell, i.e., at the 8a position (1/4, 1/4, 1/4); thus, there are eight such clusters (336 boron atoms) per unit cell. Two independent structure analyses [...] came to the same conclusion that the total number of boron atoms in the unit cell is 1584. The boron framework structure of YB66 is {{shown in figure}} 5a. To indicate relative orientations of the supericosahedra, a schematic drawing is shown in figure 5b, where the supericosahedra and the B80 clusters are depicted by light green and dark green spheres, respectively; at the top surface of the unit cell, the relative orientations of the supericosahedra are indicated by arrows. There are 48 yttrium sites ((0.0563, 1/4, 1/4) for YB62) in the unit cell. Richards and Kasper fixed the Y site occupancy to 0.5 that resulted in 24 Y atoms in the unit cell and the chemical composition of YB66. As shown in figure 6, Y sites form a pair separated by only 0.264nm in YB62. This pair is aligned normal to the plane formed by four supericosahedra. The Y site occupancy 0.5 implies that the pair has always one Y atom with one empty site.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, LAMP archaeologists {{discovered}} the second oldest shipwreck in northeast Florida waters, an unidentified colonial sailing vessel {{known as the}} [...] "Storm Wreck". The wreck site, completely buried when initially discovered, has been subject to excavations each summer from 2010 to 2012, and seems to consist of scattered remnants of cargo, ship's equipment and components, military hardware, and personal possessions. LAMP archaeologists, along with volunteer and student divers, have documented and recovered {{a wide range of}} well-preserved artifacts, including numerous iron and copper cauldrons, pewter spoons and plates, an iron tea kettle, ceramic and glass fragments, belt and shoe buckles, a brass candlestick, bricks, a flintlock Queen Anne pistol, three Brown Bess muskets (two of which were loaded, one with buck and ball), thousands of lead shot, military buttons (including one from a Royal Provincial unit and one from the 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders), a cask of nails, tools and navigational equipment (including a sight from an <b>octant),</b> ship's hardware and rigging elements, the ship's lead deck pump, a bronze ship's bell, a 4-pounder cannon, and a 9-pounder carronade, believed to be the second oldest in the world.

This was the final British fleet to leave Charleston, and when it arrived between December 24 and 31, 1782, as many as sixteen vessels were lost on the sandbar in front of the St. Augustine inlet.

50|$|Early <b>octants</b> were {{constructed}} primarily in wood, with later versions incorporating ivory and brass components. The earliest mirrors were polished metal, since {{the technology to}} produce silvered glass mirrors with flat, parallel surfaces was limited. As glass polishing techniques improved, glass mirrors began to be provided. These used coatings of mercury-containing tin amalgam; coatings of silver or aluminum were not available until the 19th century. The poor optical quality of the early polished speculum metal mirrors meant that telescopic sights were not practical. For that reason, most early <b>octants</b> employed a simple naked-eye sighting pinnula instead.|$|R
50|$|Given that Elton's {{quadrant}} {{was roughly}} {{as complex as}} an <b>octant</b> in construction, there would not likely be a significant advantage in price.

50|$|Spencer, Browning & Rust {{manufactured}} {{a variety}} of navigational instruments, including octants, sextants, telescopes, and compasses. One of the earliest instruments for nautical use was the quadrant; {{this was followed by}} the <b>octant.</b> Also referred to as a reflecting quadrant or Hadley quadrant, the <b>octant</b> had small mirror(s) that permitted alignment of the reflected image of the sun with the horizon. It was easier to use than the Davis quadrant and thus generally had fewer errors. While Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) invented the principle of the <b>octant,</b> it was two other men who developed the <b>octant</b> independently, one in England and the other in America. The <b>octant</b> was patented by English mathematician John Hadley (1682-1744) in 1734, and soon thereafter was utilized by most British navigators. American optician Thomas Godfrey (1704-1749) developed the <b>octant</b> about the same time in Pennsylvania. Also among the nautical instruments that the company of Spencer, Browning & Rust made were sextants. Developed later than the <b>octant,</b> in 1759, the sextant (pictured) was utilized to measure the altitude of a star or other object in the sky. The measurement then allowed the user to determine his geographical position.|$|E
5000|$|One common {{practice}} among navigators {{up to the}} late nineteenth century was to use both a sextant and an <b>octant.</b> The sextant was used with great care and only for lunars, while the <b>octant</b> was used for routine meridional altitude measurements of the sun every day. [...] This protected the very accurate and pricier sextant, while using the more affordable <b>octant</b> where it performs well.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We present {{scalable}} algorithms for parallel adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening (AMR), partitioning, and 2 : 1 {{balancing on}} computational domains composed of multiple connected 2 D quadtrees or 3 D octrees, {{referred to as}} a forest of octrees. By distributing the union of <b>octants</b> from all octrees in parallel, we combine the high scalability proven previously for adaptive single-octree algorithms with the geometric flexibility that can be achieved by arbitrarily connected hexahedral macro-meshes, in which each macro-element is the root of an adapted octree. A key concept of our approach is an encoding scheme of the inter-octree connectivity that permits arbitrary relative orientations between octrees. Based on this encoding we develop inter-octree transformations of <b>octants.</b> These form the basis for high-level parallel octree algorithms, which are designed to interact with an application code such as a numerical solver for partial differential equations. We have implemented and tested these algorithms in the p 4 est software library. We demonstrate the parallel scalability of p 4 est on its own and in combination with two geophysics codes. Using p 4 est we generate and adapt multi-octree meshes with up to 5. 13 × 1011 <b>octants</b> on as many as 220, 320 CPU cores and execute the 2 : 1 balance algorithm in less than 10 seconds per million <b>octants</b> per process.
