Using results on the convergence of the trimmed mean, we show that mutual information converges in distribution to the logarithm of a folded Gaussian distribution {{in the limit of}} a large number <b>of</b> <b>receive</b> antennas. The convergent distribution also shows there is channel hardening in this scenario like SIMO maximum ratio combining. For finite number <b>of</b> <b>receive</b> antennas...|$|R
30|$|Both {{progressive}} methods (methods 1 and 2) {{increase the}} shadow size after using multiple thresholds. Therefore, in our proposed method 3, {{we use a}} different technique to progressively share multiple secret images. In method 3, if the number <b>of</b> <b>received</b> guardian stegos corresponds to the lowest threshold, {{as long as the}} number <b>of</b> <b>received</b> stego images also corresponds to the threshold value of a secret image group, then the rough version of each secret image in that secret group can be revealed. The more guardian images received, the better the quality of the recovered secret images, as long as the number <b>of</b> <b>received</b> stego images also corresponds to certain threshold values. In particular, when the number <b>of</b> <b>received</b> guardian stegos corresponds to the highest threshold value, then all secret images can be recovered without errors, as long as the number <b>of</b> <b>received</b> stego images also corresponds to certain threshold values.|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{antibiotic prophylaxis}} in the rabbit model of experimental endocarditis with three strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis of differing susceptibility patterns. For the first strain, which was highly susceptible to methicillin and cephalosporins, vegetations grew S. epidermidis for all 15 untreated rabbits compared with 1 <b>of</b> 20 rabbits <b>receiving</b> cefazolin, 3 <b>of</b> 20 <b>receiving</b> cefamandole, none <b>of</b> 20 <b>receiving</b> vancomycin, and none <b>of</b> 20 <b>receiving</b> LY 146032. For the second strain, which was methicillin resistant but cephalosporin susceptible, vegetations were positive for 14 of 15 untreated controls, 4 <b>of</b> 20 <b>receiving</b> cefazolin, 5 <b>of</b> 22 <b>receiving</b> cefamandole, none <b>of</b> 20 <b>receiving</b> vancomycin, and none <b>of</b> 20 <b>receiving</b> LY 146032. For the third strain, which was methicillin resistant and only intermediately susceptible to cephalosporin antibiotics, vegetation cultures were positive for 15 of 17 untreated controls, 14 <b>of</b> 21 <b>receiving</b> cefazolin, 11 <b>of</b> 20 <b>receiving</b> cefamandole, 5 <b>of</b> 20 <b>receiving</b> vancomycin, and 0 <b>of</b> 22 <b>receiving</b> LY 146032. In conclusion, these {{studies in the}} endocarditis model indicate that cefazolin and cefamandole have some protective value against certain strains of S. epidermidis. Vancomycin and LY 146032, however, were more active than cephalosporins for all three strains included in this analysis. These findings support the need for trials of vancomycin and LY 146032 prophylaxis in patients undergoing placement of prosthetic heart valves...|$|R
5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months <b>of</b> <b>receiving</b> the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead <b>of</b> <b>receiving</b> the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned to labor in state-owned mines. Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry mines in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and sent them to the mines of Palestine. On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E

Wide receiver Kevin Challenger finished the game with 4catches for 45yards, while the Eagles' Rich Gunnell finished the game with 54yards. Surprisingly for the number <b>of</b> <b>receiving</b> yards recorded by the Eagles in the game, no Boston College receiver caught a touchdown.|$|E
