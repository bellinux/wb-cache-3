5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate.

The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope.

5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> The lower half of the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E

5|$|The head {{today is}} used {{for a variety of}} reasons. Firstly it is a tourist spot where country walks can be taken all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> due to the well defined gravel paths, some of which form part of the Bournemouth Coast Path.
