A complete matrix of reciprocal comparisons among seven parids and the Verdin (Auriparus flaviceps) indicated that the Blue Tit (P. caeruleus) and Great Tit (P. major) together form the sister group {{of the rest of}} the genus, and that the Bridled Titmouse (P. wollweberi) is more closely related to North American titmice than to the <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>crested</b> tits. The DNA-hybridization data complement information from allozyme and mtDNA studies of closely related parids and provide historical insight into patterns of tit behavior...|$|R

50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> (Hystrix cristata), {{a typical}} {{representative}} of the <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> porcupines, occurs throughout the south of Europe and North and West Africa. It is replaced in southern and central Africa by the Cape porcupine, H. africaeaustralis, and in India by the Malayan porcupine (H. brachyura) and Indian (<b>crested)</b> <b>porcupine</b> (H. indica).

Forty-two mounting episodes which occurred inside the artificial burrow were recorded by a videocamera and subsequently analysed to describe the sequence of the mounting and copulation behaviour.

50|$|The Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> {{is a large}} rodent, {{weighing}} 11-18 kg. Their body (from {{the nose}} {{to the base of}} the tail) measures between 70-90 cm, with the tail adding an additional 8-10 cm. The lifespan of wild Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> is unknown, but the oldest known captive individual was a female that lived to be 27.1 years old.|$|R

50|$|Most of what {{is known}} about {{reproduction}} in the <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> comes from individuals in captivity. Usually, female <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> have one litter every year. One or two very well developed young are born in a chamber within the burrow that is usually lined with grass, after a 66-day gestation period, on average. The young weigh about 1000 g at birth, which is about 5% of the mother's weight. They leave the den after one week. At this time, the spines begin to harden. <b>Crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> reach adult weight at one to two years and are often sexually mature just before then. Breeding occurs throughout the year.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is a {{terrestrial}} mammal; {{they very}} seldom climb trees, but can swim. They are nocturnal and monogamous. The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> {{takes care of}} the young {{for a long time and}} small family groups consist of the adult pair and young of various ages. In defense, when disturbed, they raise and fan their quills to make themselves look bigger. If continually bothered, the <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> will stamp its feet, whirr the quills, and charge the disturber back end first trying to stab the enemy with the thicker, shorter quills. These attacks are known to have killed lions, leopards, hyenas, and even humans.|$|R

50|$|The Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is {{protected}} under the India Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, amended up to 2002. Nonetheless, because they are destructive to gardens and agricultural crops, porcupines are widely hunted. A large trade of these porcupines exists for consumption and medicinal use. Despite being considered a pest, Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> {{play an important role}} in spreading seeds and pollen.|$|R

5000|$|The porcupine, called haozhu or [...] "pig {{with long}} thin hair" [...] in Chinese, {{should not be}} {{confused}} with hedgehog, ciwei or the [...] "thorned creature". Porcupines are rodents and hedgehogs belong to a separate order. Three species of <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> porcupine are found in China: the Asiatic brush-tailed <b>porcupine,</b> Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine,</b> and Malayan porcupine. Many parts of the porcupine including the brain, organs, fat, quills and even the feces can be used to make traditional Chinese medicine. Porcupines are raised on farms.|$|R

40|$|Amongst mammals, femalebiased sexual size {{dimorphism}} (SSD) is {{rare and}} it occurs mostly in species where reduced male intrasexual competition is present. Reverse SSD {{has been reported}} for <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> porcupines Hystrix spp. We compared weight and six metric body measurements of 40 male and 42 female <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> from Southern Tuscany, Italy. No significant difference was observed between sexes. The monogamous mating system of porcupines, sharing parental care, together with no evidence of territoriality, militate against previous claims of SSD presence, probably due to small sample size and inappropriate statistical analyses...|$|R
50|$|<b>Old</b> <b>World</b> porcupines are stout, heavily built animals, with blunt, rounded heads, fleshy, mobile snouts, {{and coats}} of thick {{cylindrical}} or flattened spines, which form the whole covering of their bodies, {{and are not}} intermingled with ordinary hairs. The habits of most species are strictly terrestrial. They vary in size from the relatively small long-tailed porcupine with body lengths of 27.9 to 48 cm, and a weight of 1.5 to 2.3 kg, to the much larger <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines,</b> which are 60 to 83 cm long, discounting the tail, and weigh from 13 to 27 kg.|$|R
50|$|Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} southwest and central Asia and {{in parts of}} the Middle East, including Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, China, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan,Lebanon, Nepal, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Yemen. Due to their flexible environmental tolerances, Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> occupy a broad range of habitats. They prefer rocky hillsides, but are also common in tropical and temperate shrublands, grasslands, forests, plantations, and gardens. Their range seems to be limited by seasonal densities of forage and the availability of suitable substrates for digging burrows. More specifically, the northern range of the Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is limited by minimum summer night duration: they do not occur above latitudes where minimum night duration is less than 7 hours, presumably because of the amount of foraging time required to meet their dietary needs.|$|R
50|$|Rodents noted are the Gambian sun {{squirrel}} (Heliosciurus gambianus), striped ground squirrels (Xerus erythropus)s, nocturnal <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> (Hystrix cristata), mongooses, brush-tailed porcupine, civets and genets.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines,</b> the Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is nocturnal. Both {{adults and}} weaned juveniles {{spend an average}} of 7 hours {{foraging}} every night. They tend to avoid moonlight in the winter months, which could be a strategy to evade predation. However, during summer months they do not avoid moonlight (likely because there are less dark hours during which to forage), but instead tend to stay closer to their dens. During the day, they remain in their dens, but throughout the winter, they occasionally emerge from their dens during daylight hours to bask in the sun.|$|R
50|$|Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> mate in February and March. Gestation lasts {{an average}} of 240 days. A female gives birth to one brood of two to four {{offspring}} per year. Young are born with open eyes and are covered in short, soft quills that harden {{within a few hours}} after birth. Young are fully weaned 13-19 weeks after birth, but remain in the den with parents and siblings until sexual maturity around 2 years of age. The Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is usually monogamous, and both parents live in the den with their offspring throughout the year.|$|R
