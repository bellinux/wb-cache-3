25|$|In the afternoon, Flintoff {{unexpectedly}} removed Justin Langer, who {{had looked}} {{set for a}} century but holed out to Kevin Pietersen at cover point. Ashley Giles, bowling in his first first-class match for twelve months, took the wicket of Damien Martyn but was innocuous, if inexpensive (unlike many of his colleagues), claiming no more wickets during the day. Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey survived the final session {{of the day to}} close at 3/346. During the session, Ponting passed 100 runs in a near-faultless display, <b>offering</b> <b>up</b> only one potential lbw shout (dismissed by umpire Billy Bowden) when he missed a sweep on a straight ball from Giles. The century took him level with Steve Waugh as Australia's leading century-maker, with 32 centuries each. England's bowling was generally criticised, most notably Harmison, who was given only 12 overs out of the 90 overs bowled during the day. Andrew Flintoff was the only bowler to finish the day with his reputation enhanced, having been England's cheapest and most effective bowler. The pitch, however, was flat and not conducive to either pace or spin bowling and as England failed to use the new ball well at both {{the beginning and end of}} the day, it proved to be one of the most frustrating days in the field English cricket had endured in modern Ashes series.|$|E
