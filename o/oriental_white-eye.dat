50|$|It {{can reach}} a length between nine and eleven {{centimetres}} and looks slightly {{similar to the}} <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eye.</b> The forehead and the crown are blackish and its upperparts and underparts are darker than at the <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eye.</b> The back is olive green and the iris is brown. The bill and the feet are coloured black. The voice is characterized by soft twitters.|$|E
50|$|This {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from the widespread <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eye,</b> Zosterops palpebrosus, by its larger size, duller green back and more extensive yellow on the breast. It has a darker patch between the eye and the bill.|$|E
50|$|With a {{powerful}} bill and rapid flight, these kingfishers have few predators when healthy and rare cases of predation {{by a black}} kite and a jungle crow may be of sick or injured birds. An individual found dead with its beak embedded into the wood of a tree has been suggested as an accident during rapid pursuit of prey, possibly an <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eye.</b> A few parasites have been noted.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} season lasts from May to July. Being socially monogamous {{both male and}} female take part in nest-building, incubation, brooding and feeding of the young. The incubation period lasts 14 to 16 days and the nestling period 9 to 12 days. Three or four eggs are laid in a neat cup nest made with twigs and spider webs {{on the end of a}} low branch. The nest is sometimes built in the vicinity of a breeding pair of drongos, which keep predators away. Chicks hatch in about 21 to 23 days. A case of interspecific feeding has been noted with paradise flycatcher chicks fed by <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eyes.</b>|$|R
50|$|It perches conspicuously on wires {{or other}} exposed perches within its territory, {{and is a}} {{frequent}} sight in south Asia. This species mainly hunts large crustaceans, insects, earthworms, rodents, snakes, fish and frogs. Predation of small birds such as the <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eye,</b> chick of a red-wattled lapwing, sparrows and munias have been reported. The young are fed mostly on invertebrates. In captivity, it has been noted that it rarely drinks water although bathing regularly.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eye</b> (Zosterops palpebrosus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the white-eye family. It is {{a resident}} breeder in open woodland in tropical Asia, east from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, extending to Indonesia and Malaysia. They forage in small groups, feeding on nectar and small insects. They are easily identified by the distinctive white eye-ring and overall yellowish upperparts. Several populations of this widespread species are named subspecies and some have distinctive variations in the extent and shades of yellows in their plumage.|$|E
50|$|Ornithologists of {{preceding}} times {{documented the}} number of bird species in Lahore. According to one study conducted in 1965 there were 240 bird species. In another study (1992) only 101 bird species from the parks of Lahore were recorded. However, {{with an increase in}} the rate of urbanisation, the ecology of Lahore has been considerably affected and bird population reduced to 85, including both residents and migrants. Resident species include Indian grey hornbill, yellow-footed green pigeon, parakeets, bulbuls, doves, spotted owlet, Old World babblers, Old World flycatchers, mynas, woodpeckers, crows, black kites, ashy prinia, redstarts, warblers, red-wattled lapwing, kingfishers, and the <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eye.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{hermaphroditic}} (or bisexual) {{flowers are}} mainly pollinated by bats (Cynopterus and Rousettus) and arboreal mammals (Lion-tailed Macaque, Brown Palm Civet, Indian Giant Squirrel, Nilgiri Langur, and Indian Giant Flying Squirrel). These mammals and other rodents that visit the flowers such as Dusky-striped Squirrel and Malabar Spiny Dormouse also act as flower predators as they consume {{a substantial number}} of flowers. The flowers are also visited by a number of bird species, including <b>Oriental</b> <b>White-Eye,</b> Square-tailed Bulbul, Yellow-browed Bulbul, Brown-cheeked Fulvetta, Common Rosefinch, Kerala Laughingthrush, and White-cheeked Barbet. However, flowers visited by birds tend to be aborted.|$|E
50|$|This bird is {{slightly}} larger than the <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eye</b> (about 11 cm long) which it replaces above 4000 ft. The upper {{parts of the body}} and sides of neck are dark olive green. The rump appears paler green while the crown and forehead appear darker. The wings and tail are brown edged with green on the back. The typical ring of tiny white feathers around the eye is present. The lores are dark and there is a dark streak below the eye. The chin, throat and upper breast are greenish-yellow as are the thighs and vent. The belly region is grayish white. The dark bill has a slaty base to the lower mandible. The legs are dark. The iris is yellow to reddish brown.|$|E
50|$|These {{white-eyes}} are sociable, forming flocks {{which only}} separate on {{the approach of}} the breeding season. They are highly arboreal and only rarely descend to the ground. The breeding season is February to September but April is the peak breeding season and the compact cup nest is a placed like a hammock on the fork of a branch. The nest is made of cobwebs, lichens and plant fibre. The nest is built in about 4 days and the two pale blue eggs are laid within a couple of days of each other. The eggs hatch in about 10 days. Both sexes take care of brooding the chicks which fledge in about 10 days. Though mainly insectivorous, the <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eye</b> will also eat nectar and fruits of various kinds.|$|E
50|$|Eaglenest is {{well known}} as a major birding area. It is home to at least 454 species of birds {{including}} 3 cormorants, 5 herons, black stork, Oriental white (black-headed) ibis, 4 ducks, 20 hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and vultures, 3 falcons, 10 pheasants, junglefowl, quail, and peafowl, black-necked crane, 3 rails, 6 plovers, dotterels, and lapwings, 7 waders, ibisbill, stone-curlew (Eurasian thick-knee), small pratincole, 2 gulls, 14 pigeons, 3 parrots, 15 cukoos, 10 owls, 2 nightjars, 4 swifts, 2 trogons, 7 kingfishers, 2 bee-eaters, 2 rollers, hoopoes, 4 hornbills, 6 barbets, 14 woodpeckers, 2 broadbills, 2 pittas, 2 larks, 6 martins, 7 wagtails, 9 shrikes, 9 bulbuls, 4 fairy-bluebirds, 3 shrike, brown dipper, 3 accentors, 46 thrushes, 65 Old World flycatchers, 6 parrotbills, 31 warblers, 25 flycatchers, 10 tits, 5 nuthatches, 3 treecreepers, 5 flowerpeckers, 8 sunbirds, <b>Oriental</b> <b>white-eye,</b> 3 bunting, 14 finches, 2 munia, 3 sparrows, 5 starlings, 2 orioles, 7 drongos, ashy woodswallow and 9 jays. The sanctuary has the distinction of having three tragopan species, perhaps unique in India.|$|E
