40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a two-hop relay {{model in which}} mul-tiple sources communicate with a single destination via multiple distributed relays. We propose an asymmetric Compute-and-Forward (CoF) scheme that allows lattice coding with different coarse and fine lattices at the sources. The proposed scheme is motivated by the observation that, in an asymmetric CoF system, a higher transmission power at a source does not nec-essarily translate to a higher achievable information rate. We show that significant performance enhancement {{can be achieved by}} optimizing the transmission powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>below</b> their respective budgets. Further, the asymmetric construction of lattice coding allows the relays to conduct different modulo operations to reduce their forwarding rates, thereby supporting higher rates at the sources. However, modulo operations in general incur information loss, and so need to be carefully designed to ensure that the destination can successfully recover the source messages. As such, we propose a novel successive recovering algorithm for decoding at the destination, and establish sufficient conditions to guarantee successful recovery. Numerical results are provided to verify the superiority of our proposed scheme over other schemes. I...|$|E
40|$|Motivating student {{employees}} through competitive training ORIGINS OF THE LIBRARY OLYMPICS Jim Smith’s article teaching LC call numbers was {{the inspiration}} for my game-oriented training program. In his article, Smith provided a set of 52 call numbers which, when sorted correctly, would be in numerical order within suits (for example, Hearts from deuce to ace). Following his example, I created two identical decks, modifying some of the cards to better reflect my library’s collection. I first used the card game when I had several new student employees start {{work in the same}} trimester. After working through the tutorial in LC Easy, a software program commonly used to teach the basics of LC call numbers, students played the game individually. They were encouraged to consult a cheat sheet I created based on two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>below.</b> The cards made it easy to see where they were having trouble and to focus on these problem areas. Students gained skill and confidence quickly. Once they demonstrated their competence, they had a chance to compete with each other in speed and accuracy using the dueling decks.

Moreover, we confirmed that an inflation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dike oriented in the NW–SE direction below the Pon-Machineshiri crater effectively explains the observed tilt vectors in this study. The {{fact that the}} tilt vectors at MEA in 2006 and 2008 showed almost the same direction suggests {{the possibility that the}} dike estimated from the 2008 activity can also explain the tilt vector observed in 2006. Unfortunately, however, we were unable to determine which source configuration, dike or sphere, is better for the 2006 data because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limited number <b>of</b> recorded data. It is expected that future activity at Meakan-dake volcano will provide an opportunity for obtaining a more concrete understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precursory deformation <b>source</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> Pon-Machineshiri crater.|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} XMM-Newton observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{high energy}} peaked blazar, PKS 2155 - 304, made on 24 May 2002 in the 0. 3 - 10 keV X-ray band. These observations display a mini-flare, a nearly constant flux period {{and a strong}} flux increase. We performed a time-resolved spectral study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data, by dividing the data into eight segments. We fitted the data with a power-law and a broken power-law model, and in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> segments we found a noticeable spectral flattening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source's</b> spectrum <b>below</b> 10 keV. We also performed time-resolved cross-correlation analyses and detected significant hard and soft lags (for {{the first time in}} a single observation <b>of</b> this <b>source)</b> during <b>the</b> first and last parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observation, respectively. Our analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectra, <b>the</b> variations <b>of</b> photon-index with flux as well as the correlation and lags between the harder and softer X-ray bands indicate that both the particle acceleration and synchrotron cooling processes make an important contribution to the emission from this blazar. The hard lags indicate a variable acceleration process. We also estimated the magnetic field value using the soft lags. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field is consistent with the values derived from the broad-band SED modeling of this source.

40|$|A {{database}} of wideband acoustic emission (AE) modeled signals {{was used in}} Part 1 to ex-amine <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> a wavelet transform (WT) to identify AE <b>sources.</b> <b>The</b> AE signals in the database were created by use of a validated three-dimensional finite element code. These signals represented the out-of-plane displacements from buried dipole sources in aluminum plates 4. 7 mm thick and of small and large lateral dimensions. The surface displacement signals at three far-field distances were filtered with a 40 kHz high-pass filter prior to applying the WT. The WTs were calculated with AGU-Vallen Wavelet, a freeware software program. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> propagation distance, AE <b>source</b> type, and <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AE <b>source</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> plate surface were examined. Specifically, a ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WT magnitude (WT coefficient) from the fundamen-tal anti-symmetric mode to that from the fundamental symmetric mode was studied for correla-tion with <b>the</b> AE <b>source</b> type. <b>The</b> WT magnitudes were those corresponding to a particular group velocity and signal frequency for each mode. For <b>sources</b> in <b>the</b> large plate located at the same depth, the ratios were able to distinguish different source types and exhibited only small changes with increasing propagation distance. But, when <b>the</b> variable <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> was introduced, <b>the</b> ratios did not uniquely classify <b>the</b> AE <b>source</b> type. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small cou-pon plate specimen, reflections from the specimen edges distorted and complicated the WTs.

40|$|We propose an {{explanation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Island and Banana {{states and the}} relation between Atoll and Z-track sources, constituting a unified model for Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB). We find a dramatic transition at a luminosity of 1 - 2. 10 ^{ 37 } erg/s above which the high energy cut-off E_CO <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Comptonized emission in all sources is low at a few keV. There is thermal equilibrium between the neutron star at ~ 2 keV and the Comptonizing accretion disk corona (ADC) causing the low E_CO in <b>the</b> Banana state <b>of</b> Atolls and all states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Z-track <b>sources.</b> <b>Below</b> this luminosity, E_CO increases towards 100 keV causing <b>the</b> hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island state. Thermal equilibrium is lost, the ADC becoming much hotter than the neutron star via an additional coronal heating mechanism. This suggests a unified model <b>of</b> LMXB: <b>the</b> Banana state is a basic state with the mass accretion rate Mdot increasing, corresponding to <b>the</b> Normal Branch <b>of</b> Z-track <b>sources.</b> <b>The</b> Island state has high ADC temperature, this state not existing in <b>the</b> Z-track <b>sources</b> with luminosities {{much greater than the}} critical value. <b>The</b> Z-track <b>sources</b> have an additional flaring branch consistent with unstable nuclear burning on the neutron star at high Mdot. This burning regime does not exist at low Mdot so this branch is not seen in Atolls (except GX Atolls). The Horizontal Branch in Z-track sources has a strong increase in radiation pressure disrupting the inner disk and launching relativistic jets. Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Lunar domes are {{structures}} of volcanic origin {{which are usually}} difficult to observe due to their low heights. The Lunar Domes Handbook is a reference work on these elusive features. It provides a collection of images for {{a large number of}} lunar domes, including telescopic images acquired with advanced but still moderately intricate amateur equipment as well as recent orbital spacecraft images. Different methods for determining <b>the</b> morphometric properties <b>of</b> lunar domes (diameter, height, flank slope, edifice volume) from image data or orbital topographic data are discussed. Additionally, multispectral and hyperspectral image data are examined, providing insights into <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dome material. Several classification schemes for lunar domes are described, including an approach based on the determined morphometric quantities and spectral analyses. Furthermore, the book provides a description of geophysical models of lunar domes, which yield information about <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lava from which they formed and <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magma <b>source</b> regions <b>below</b> <b>the</b> lunar surface...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work has}} been {{concerned}} with a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> AGW in <b>the</b> ionosphere connected with passages of weather fronts based on <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> ionospheric vertical sounding. Short-term changes of electron concentration in the ionospheric F region in the period range 15 - 120 minutes have been studied during campaigns of rapid sequence vertical ionospheric sounding in October 1996 and October-November 1997. The wave-like structures have been studied under low geomagnetic and solar activity conditions. Quasi-periodic oscillations in the electron concentration have been studied during low solar activity. Passages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weather fronts are observed {{to be associated with}} substantial intensification <b>of</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravity waves. <b>The</b> most probable <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed waves were found below the heights under study and very probably not in the auroral zone. The calculated vertical components of propagation characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed gravity waves correspond with <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> Acoustic Gravity Wave propagation in the ionosphere and confirm <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> being <b>below</b> <b>the</b> studied heights.

40|$|International audienceMid to far {{infrared}} {{is an important}} wavelength band for detection of substances. Incandescent sources are often used in infrared spectroscopy because they are simple and cost effective. They are however broadband and quasi isotropic. As a result, the total efficiency in a detection system is very poor. Yet {{it has been shown}} recently that thermal emission can be designed to be directional and/or monochromatic. To do so amounts to shape the emissivity. Any real thermal source is characterized by its emissivity, which gives <b>the</b> specific intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> compared to <b>the</b> blackbody at the same temperature. The emissivity depends on the wavelength and <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> emission and is related to <b>the</b> whole structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> (materials, geometry <b>below</b> <b>the</b> wavelength-scale [...] .). Emissivity appears as a directional and chromatic filter for the blackbody radiation. Playing with materials and structure resonances, the emissivity can be designed to optimize <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> an incandescent source. We will see how it is possible to optimize a plasmonic metasurface acting as an incandescent source, to make it directional and quasi monochromatic at a chosen wavelength. We will target a CO 2 detection application to illustrate this topic...|$|R
40|$|We {{revisit the}} flare on 1992 January 13, {{which is now}} universally termed the “Masuda flare”. Our work is {{motivated}} by <b>the</b> remarkable improvement <b>of</b> Yohkoh hard X-ray imaging, which was only achieved after the intensive investigations on this famous event. With the calibrated Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT) data, {{we find that the}} hard X-ray coronal source is indeed a loop-top source, located slightly above the soft X-ray loop but within the 10 % brightness contour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HXT L-band thermal loop, rather than distinctly above the loop top as in the original HXT images. This critical change relieves the three major difficulties <b>of</b> understanding <b>the</b> original Masuda flare, viz., (1) <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> L-band emission at <b>the</b> coronal <b>source</b> location and consequently the extremely flat spectrum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coronal <b>source</b> <b>below</b> ∼ 20 keV, (2) <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> soft X-ray signature of hydrodynamic response at the presumed field lines that connected the hard X-ray coronal <b>source</b> to <b>the</b> chromosphere, and (3) the apparently low density at <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coronal <b>source</b> due to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> soft X-ray emission. Despite the generally accepted belief that the coronal emission in the Masuda flare was nonthermal, we find its spectrum can be explained either by thermal bremsstrahlung of a superhot plasma (80 MK), or by nonthermal bremsstrahlung at a thick-thin target, with the injecting electron index derived from the coronal emission approximately equal to that from the footpoints. We propose a simplified picture, featuring the field line shrinkage effect and <b>the</b> resultant increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss-cone angle at the coronal trap, to qualitatively explain that as time progresses the hard X-ray coronal source diminishes in brightness relative to the footpoints, that its centroid position moves to higher altitudes, and that the footpoint spectrum is successively hardening, with the coronal spectrum softening simultaneously...|$|R
