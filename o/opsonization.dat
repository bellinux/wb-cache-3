5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (<b>opsonization</b> and phagocytosis).|$|E
25|$|About 60% of all ALF {{patients}} fulfil {{the criteria}} for systemic inflammatory syndrome irrespective of {{presence or absence of}} infection. This often contributes towards multi organ failure. Impaired host defence mechanism, due to impaired <b>opsonization,</b> chemotaxis and intracellular killing, substantially increases risk of sepsis. Bacterial sepsis mostly due to gram positive organisms and fungal sepsis are observed in up to 80% and 30% patients, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{coating of}} {{platelets}} with IgG renders them susceptible to <b>opsonization</b> and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages, as well by Kupffer {{cells in the}} liver.nbsp& The IgG autoantibodies are also thought to damage megakaryocytes, the precursor cells to platelets, although this is believed to contribute only slightly to the decrease in platelet numbers.nbsp& Recent research now indicates that impaired production of the glycoprotein hormone thrombopoietin, which is the stimulant for platelet production, may be a contributing factor to the reduction in circulating platelets.nbsp& This observation {{has led to the}} development of a class of ITP-targeted drugs referred to as thrombopoietin receptor agonists.|$|E
25|$|Once β-arrestin {{is bound}} to a GPCR, it {{undergoes}} a conformational change allowing it {{to serve as a}} scaffolding protein for an adaptor complex termed AP-2, which in turn recruits another protein called clathrin. If enough receptors in the local area recruit clathrin in this manner, they aggregate and the membrane buds inwardly as a result of interactions between the molecules of clathrin, in a process called <b>opsonization.</b> Once the pit has been pinched off the plasma membrane due to the actions of two other proteins called amphiphysin and dynamin, it is now an endocytic vesicle. At this point, the adapter molecules and clathrin have dissociated, and the receptor is either trafficked back to the plasma membrane or targeted to lysosomes for degradation.|$|E
25|$|Several of the {{proteins}} that anchor to GPI {{on the cell}} membrane are used to protect the cell from destruction by the complement system, and, without these anchors, the cells are more easily targeted by the complement proteins. Although red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are targeted by complement, red blood cells are particularly vulnerable to lysis. The complement system {{is part of the}} innate immune system and has a variety of functions, from destroying invading microorganisms by <b>opsonization</b> to direct destabilization by the membrane attack complex. The main proteins that protect blood cells from destruction are decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), which disrupts formation of C3-convertase, and protectin (CD59/MIRL/MAC-IP), which binds the membrane attack complex and prevents C9 from binding to the cell.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{proteins}} and glycoproteins {{that constitute the}} complement system are synthesized by hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinal tract and gastrointestinal tract. The three pathways of activation all generate homologous variants of the protease C3-convertase. The classical complement pathway typically requires antigen—antibody complexes (immune complexes) for activation (specific immune response), whereas the alternative pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis, foreign material, pathogens, or damaged cells. The mannose-binding lectin pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all three pathways, C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events. [...] C3b binds {{to the surface of}} pathogens, leading to greater internalization by phagocytic cells by <b>opsonization.</b>|$|E

50|$|Anwar’s {{research}} on N. meningitidis involved determining effects that modifying the organism’s outer components had on its susceptibility to {{attack by the}} host’s immune system. Specifically, the ability of mannose binding lectin, {{a component of the}} immune system involved in the lectin pathway of <b>opsonization,</b> to bind onto N. meningitidis when it’s LOS outer core and/or capsule had been removed was determined by utilizing flow cytometry and gel electrophoresis. It was found that when the outer core was removed, strong binding of MBL to N. meningitidis was detected, even when physiologically low levels of MBL had been used. In addition, activation of the lectin pathway of <b>opsonization</b> had also been detected by the presence of a cleaved product. Both results indicate that removal of the outer core increases the host’s immune response against the pathogen.|$|E

50|$|C3a {{formation}} occurs through activation and cleavage of complement component 3 in {{a reaction}} catalyzed by C3-convertase. There are three pathways of activation, {{each of which}} leads to the formation of C3a and C3b, which is involved in antigen <b>opsonization.</b> Other than the alternative pathway, which is constantly active, C3a formation is triggered by pathogenic infection.|$|E
50|$|Another {{group of}} {{virulence}} factors possessed by bacteria are immunoglobulin (Ig) proteases. Immunoglobulins are antibodies expressed and secreted by hosts {{in response to}} an infection.

50|$|Polyclonal {{antibodies}} inhibit T lymphocytes {{and cause}} their lysis, {{which is both}} complement-mediated cytolysis and cell-mediated <b>opsonization</b> followed by removal of reticuloendothelial cells from the circulation in the spleen and liver. In this way, polyclonal antibodies inhibit cell-mediated immune reactions, including graft rejection, delayed hypersensitivity (i.e., tuberculin skin reaction), and the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but influence thymus-dependent antibody production.|$|E
5000|$|S. pyogenes {{has several}} {{virulence}} factors that {{enable it to}} attach to host tissues, evade the immune response, and spread by penetrating host tissue layers. [...] A carbohydrate-based bacterial capsule composed of hyaluronic acid surrounds the bacterium, protecting it from phagocytosis by neutrophils. In addition, the capsule and several factors embedded in the cell wall, including M protein, lipoteichoic acid, and protein F (SfbI) facilitate attachment to various host cells. [...] M protein also inhibits <b>opsonization</b> by the alternative complement pathway by binding to host complement regulators. The M protein found on some serotypes is also able to prevent <b>opsonization</b> by binding to fibrinogen. [...] However, the M protein is also the weakest point in this pathogen's defense, as antibodies produced by the immune system against M protein target the bacteria for engulfment by phagocytes. M proteins are unique to each strain, and identification can be used clinically to confirm the strain causing an infection.|$|E
50|$|Collectins {{can act as}} opsonins. There is a {{specific}} interaction between collectins and receptors on phagocytic cells {{which can lead to}} increased clearance of microorganisms.
