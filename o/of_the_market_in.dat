5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants {{of the market}} size and puts primary focus on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance {{should be given to}} promoting exports.|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero and Rock Band (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii), music game franchises {{which used}} {{specially}} designed controllers that mimicked musical instruments and allowed uses {{to play a}} large selection of licensed music, were extremely popular during the seventh generation, with over twenty different title releases across various platforms. Activision's Guitar Hero series sold more than 25 million units with over $2 billion in retail revenue, while Harmonix's Rock Band series has sold over 13 million copies; both series were augmented with a large volume of downloadable content. However, due to saturation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> 2009 along with the economic recess, both series have since ceased publishing, though Harmonix has stated they will bring back Rock Band to the eighth-generation {{when the time is}} right.|$|E

5|$|Secular {{portraiture}} was {{a rarity}} in European art before 1430. The format did not exist as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> betrothal portraits or royal family commissions. While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art form {{and the majority of}} surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed. Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer; his seminal 1432 Léal Souvenir is one of the earliest surviving examples, emblematic of the new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance. His Arnolfini Portrait is filled with symbolism, as is the Madonna of Chancelor Rolin, commissioned as testament to Rolin's power, influence, and piety.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the deregulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> 1994, {{the lack of}} free slots at Fornebu {{made it impossible to}} have free competition, since no new airlines could establish themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to happen, and from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E

25|$|Around the 1970s {{the study}} of market {{failures}} came into focus with {{the study of}} information asymmetry.

Akerlof considered the problem of bad quality cars driving good quality cars out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> his classic “The Market for Lemons” (1970) {{because of the presence}} of asymmetrical information between buyers and sellers. Michael Spence explained that signaling was fundamental in the labour market, because since employers can't know beforehand which candidate is the most productive, a college degree becomes a signaling device that a firm uses to select new personnel.|$|E

A gild at Lideford is mentioned in 1180, and the pipe roll of 1195 records a grant for the reestablishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> <b>In</b> 1238 the borough, which had hitherto been crown demesne, was bestowed by Henry III on Richard, earl of Cornwall, who in 1268 obtained a grant of a Wednesday market and a three days fair at the feast of St Petrock. The borough had a separate coroner and bailiff in 1275, {{but it was never}} incorporated by charter, and only once, in 1300, returned members to parliament.|$|E
25|$|A morning {{market is}} {{held on the}} central square during weekends. These are the only days when the {{residents}} of Thimphu can buy fresh fruit and vegetables. The inhabitants rely on the supermarkets for other provisions throughout the week. The market also sells yak butter, cheese, wooden bowls and fabrics. A number of cheap souvenirs from Nepal are also sold at the market. Behind the open market, several shops sell Chinese and Bangladeshi crockery, appliances, shoes, silks and carpets. For many years merchants {{would come to the}} central square from all over Bhutan and market their goods and would sleep in the open air. However, in 1986, platforms were erected and in 1989 covered market halls were built over the platforms. A special building for meat products was constructed on the north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, the handicrafts section was moved to the new stalls {{on the other side of}} the new bridge, built in the traditional style in 2005.|$|E
500|$|The 1912 trip {{represented}} a landmark in her work, led to several exhibitions {{and her first}} significant international critical acclaim. The journeys are also the subject {{of one of the}} few books about the artist's work, Jeanette Hoorn's Hilda Rix Nicholas and Elsie Rix's Moroccan Idyll: Art and Orientalism. Exhibition of her first works produced immediate results: the French government purchased one of her pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> Tangiers, and in 1913 she again had paintings displayed at the Paris Salon. The purchase by the French government was of a pastel drawing, Grande marche, Tanger, which she would later copy in oils. The drawing was favourably discussed in the French edition of the New York Herald, but not by one The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer, who complained that [...] "the drawing and colour are eccentric, after the post-impressionist manner" [...] and described the central figure as [...] "grotesque in its want of finish".|$|E
