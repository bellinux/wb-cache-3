5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation.

In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
