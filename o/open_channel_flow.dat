40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{an outcome of}} {{physical}} and numerical research of secondary current effects in <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> <b>flows</b> with both smooth and rough configuration in prismatic cross-sections. Experiments have been conducted for <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> <b>flows</b> of rectangular and trapezoidal cross-section with four different roughnesses to develop models and also to find calibrating coefficients. Using micro-ADV we have been collected 3 -D data sets and evaluated Reynolds stress and calibrating coefficients (i. e. secondary flow parameter Γ, eddy viscosity coefficient, friction factors f). These coefficients {{play an important role}} in prediction of depth averaged velocity and boundary shear stress of an <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> <b>flows.</b> These are found to vary with flow depth, geometry, roughness and hydraulic conditions. A mathematical expressions have been formulated to predict these variables in terms of non-dimensional geometry and hydraulic parameters such as aspect ratio, lateral distances along width of the channel and vertical distances above bed are, and respectively. The new expressions are expected to improve the Shiono and Knight method (SKM) and accurately predict depth averaged velocity distribution in an <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> <b>flows</b> for different geometry, surface and flow conditions. The predictions of depth averaged velocity using new expressions obtained from multi-linear regression were found to provide better results as compared to SKM.

2500|$|Under {{steady state}} flow {{conditions}} (e.g. no flood wave), <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> <b>flow</b> can be subdivided into {{three types of}} flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. [...] Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. [...] This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or channel slope. [...] During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn). [...] This depth {{is analogous to the}} terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013). [...] Typically, this depth is calculated using the Manning formula. [...] Gradually varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small. [...] In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply. [...] Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope. [...] Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed. [...] Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the conditions for}} initiation and maintenance of secondary currents in <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> <b>flows.</b> By analyzing the Reynolds equation in the wall-normal and wall-tangent directions, this study reveals that, like other types of vortices, the secondary currents are originated in the near-boundary region, and the magnitude (or strength) of secondary flow {{is proportional to the}} lateral gradient of near-wall velocity. The near-wall secondary flow always moves from the region with lower velocity (or lower boundary shear stress) to the location with higher velocity (or higher boundary shear stress). Subsequently, the near-boundary secondary flow creeps into the main flow and drives circulation within a region enclosed by lines of zero total shear stress, leading to anisotropy of turbulence in the main flow region.
