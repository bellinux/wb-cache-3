25|$|During the Great Depression, Prestini was {{sometimes}} laid off by Washington Brick & Lime {{for several months}} at a time. For {{a couple of years}} he drifted and worked odd jobs in Chicago, San Francisco, Mexico, Hawaii, and various other places. Although he had long been sculpting original terra cotta art pieces, he didn't begin painting seriously until his return to Clayton in 1936. He was likely inspired in part by Charles Sater, a fellow terra cotta modeler who did religious-themed oil paintings. Prestini's early work was in the Regionalist style popular at the time, but had a strange, dark cast, reflecting his deep forebodings <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> mechanization and the rise of fascism in Europe. In 1940 a series of paintings he called the Pages of History was briefly displayed in the windows of a downtown Spokane stationery store before public complaints over their grim content led to their removal. These same works were better received when he took them to Los Angeles, earning a laudatory article in the Sunday Los Angeles Times.|$|E

6000|$|The Attic tragedy still {{keeps its}} hold upon {{the loyalty of}} {{scholars}} through their imagination, or their pedantry, or their feeling of an exclusive property, as may happen, and, however alloyed with baser matter, this loyalty is legitimate and well bestowed. But the dominion of the Shakespearian is even wider. It pushes forward its boundaries from year to year, and moves no landmark backward. Here Alfieri and Leasing own a common allegiance; and the loyalty to him is one not of guild or tradition, but of conviction and enthusiasm. Can this be said of any other modern? of robust Corneille? of tender Racine? of Calderon even, with his tropical warmth and vigor of production? The Greeks and he are alike and alone in this, and for the same reason, that both are unapproachably the highest in their kind. Call him Gothic, if you like, but the inspiring mind that presided <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> these clustered masses of arch and spire and pinnacle and buttress is neither Greek nor Gothic,--it is simply genius lending itself to embody the new desire of man's mind, as it had embodied the old. After all, to be delightful is to be classic, and the chaotic never pleases long. But manifoldness is not confusion, any more than formalism is simplicity. If Shakespeare rejected the unities, as I think he who complains of [...] "Art made tongue-tied by Authority" [...] might very well deliberately do, {{it was for the}} sake of an imaginative unity more intimate than any of time and place. The antique in itself is not the ideal, though its remoteness from the vulgarity of everyday associations helps to make it seem so. The true ideal is not opposed to the real, nor is it any artificial heightening thereof, but lies in it, and blessed are the eyes that find it! It is the mens divinior which hides within the actual, transfiguring matter-of-fact into matter-of-meaning for him who has the gift of second-sight. In this sense Hogarth is often more truly ideal than Raphael, Shakespeare often more truly so than the Greeks. I think it is a more or less conscious perception of this ideality, as it is a more or less well-grounded persuasion of it as respects the Greeks, that assures to him, as to them, and with equal justice, a permanent supremacy over the minds of men. This gives to his characters their universality, to his thought its irradiating property, while the artistic purpose running through and combining the endless variety of scene and character will alone account for his power of dramatic effect. Goethe affirmed, that, without Schröder's prunings and adaptations, Shakespeare was too undramatic for the German theatre,--that, if the theory that his plays should be represented textually should prevail, he would be driven from the boards. The theory has prevailed, and he not only holds his own, but is acted oftener than ever. It is not irregular genius that can do this, for surely Germany need not go abroad for what her own Werners could more than amply supply her with.|$|E
