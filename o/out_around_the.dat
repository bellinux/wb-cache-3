5|$|A {{landscaped}} {{park with}} lakes and statues was laid <b>out</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> house, and {{the drive to}} the house was along a semicircular avenue of trees. Sir Edward died in 1766. Sir Gregory Page-Turner, 3rd Baronet considered the house too large, so in 1767 he sought to demolish part of it to create a smaller house. This proved impossible so in 1768 he had the entire house demolished.|$|E
5|$|Little {{evidence}} exists of settlements within the Rhondda during the Norman period. Unlike the communal dwellings of the Iron Age {{the remains of}} the Medieval buildings discovered in the area follow the pattern similar to modern farmsteads; with separate holdings spaced <b>out</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> hillsides. The evidence of Medieval Welsh farmers comes from {{the remains of the}}ir buildings, with the foundations of platform houses having been discovered spaced out throughout both valleys. When the site of several platform houses at Gelligaer Common were excavated in the 1930s potsherds dating from the 13th-14th century were discovered.|$|E

5|$|Marasmius sasicola is {{a species}} of Marasmiaceae fungus known from Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. First {{collected}} in 2000, it was described in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi. The species produces small mushrooms with white caps and very short, very thin black stems. Unlike in other, similar species, the stems enter the plant matter on which the mushroom grows. The six to eight white gills are spread <b>out</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cap, {{and all of them}} reach the stem. The flesh has no taste or odour. Found in June, the species grows on dead Sasa leaves, from which it takes its specific epithet.|$|E
5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread <b>out</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{base of the}} plant for varying distances, close to the surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these {{come into contact with}} a rooting medium.|$|E
5|$|When in 1415 Sir Piers Legh II {{was wounded}} in the Battle of Agincourt, his mastiff stood over and {{protected}} him for many hours through the battle. The mastiff was later returned to Legh's home and was the foundation of the Lyme Hall Mastiffs. They were bred at the hall and kept separate from other strains, figuring prominently in founding the modern breed.

5|$|Although {{the current}} owner Charles Spencer professes to have never {{witnessed}} a ghost at Althorp or anywhere else, {{over the years}} numerous ghostly sightings {{have been reported in}} the mansion. In the mid 19th century the Dean of Lincoln was invited to stay at the property by Fredrick, 4th Earl Spencer. He complained the following morning that during the night a figure dressed as a groom (believed to be the ghost of the deceased servant of the 3rd Earl) had entered his room holding candles and checking that they were snuffed <b>out</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> bed. Margaret Douglas-Home professed to being aware of a ghost of a girl with grey slippers in the gallery.|$|E

5|$|Formal gardens {{were laid}} <b>out</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> house by W. A. Nesfield in around 1840–50 for Hungerford Crewe. Nesfield's design {{included}} statuary, gravelled walks and elaborate parterres realised using low box hedges and coloured minerals. Balustraded terraces were also constructed {{on the north}} and south sides of the hall, probably designed by E. M. Barry, and incorporating statues of lions, griffins and other heraldic beasts, echoing the interior staircase. Military usage during the Second World War, however, destroyed parts of the gardens; army buildings were erected near the house, and the area in front of the hall served as a parade ground and later was ploughed up to grow potatoes. The grounds were further neglected while the house was used as offices, and little has survived except the terraces, gates and statues. In 2009, English Heritage placed the hall on the Heritage at Risk Register as highly vulnerable, considering that the historic character of the gardens and park is compromised by recent developments to the hotel complex, in particular the conference centre, spa and associated parking area.|$|E
5|$|Paulo {{was written}} to be unlikable, {{with the hope}} he would redeem himself when his backstory was {{revealed}} in his final episode. Paulo either resents or is indifferent toward the often heroic actions {{of some of the}} survivors, spending much of his time golfing. He complains to Nikki about not being included; however, he does little to help <b>out</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> camp and does not try to improve his status in the survivors' hierarchy. When he does get chances to participate in treks, for example, when Hurley finds a car, Paulo is uninterested and discourages Nikki from joining Hurley on his adventure. Nikki tries to participate, tending to a wounded Mr. Eko and volunteering to go with Locke to the Pearl station, much to the surprise of Paulo. Paulo accompanies her, and he exhibits a constant sarcastic behavior in the Pearl.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} {{allegation}} against Pleydell in the Star Chamber concerned the forced expulsion of an occupant of the manor house at East Grafton, Somerset in late 1553. He {{was accused of}} assisting John Berwick in the original infringement and composing an amenable jury in Marlborough to avoid conviction. Both were found innocent of breaching the peace and claimed to have acted at the reasonable request of their employer, Anne Seymour; undue interference with judicial proceedings was ruled <b>out.</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> same time, Pleydell was sued for forcible entry and illegal seizure of property at Little Bedwyn (with similar offences at Collingbourne Ducis) but claimed to be acting on {{the failure of the}} plaintiff to punctually pay rent.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{they were}} ordered to Roslavl, {{south-east}} of Smolensk, but this was soon changed to Yelnya, east of Smolensk. When they reached Smolensk, they marched on through Yartsevo to Safonovo before being ordered to turn north towards Bely to help stop a Soviet breakthrough south of Rzhev. At {{the head of the}} division, the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment attacked off the route of march towards elements of the 1st Panzer Division holding <b>out</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> village of Komary. The fighting continued in snowstorms and extreme cold until 16 December, with Mickl forward directing the battle, which ended with the destruction of eight Soviet tank and rifle brigades in the Bely area. After a few days rest, on 23 December Mickl's regiment marched to the north-east of Bely to stop Soviet forces moving into the Luchesa river valley. In the difficult terrain and weather conditions, the regiment was exhausted from constant fighting over hamlets that often changed hands. On 30 December, the fighting escalated as the Red Army forces in the sector were reinforced, and Mickl's II Battalion was forced to temporarily withdraw into the surrounding forest. Fierce fighting continued until the 12th Panzer Division was detached at short notice on 14 January 1943, but not before the divisional staff had reported Mickl's brave leadership in the fighting to the Oberkommando des Heeres (German Army High Command). On 16 January 1943, the division was on the move, this time headed north-west to Velikiye Luki, but its move to the front was countermanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{reform plan}} adopted in 2005 envisaged the {{formation}} of eighteen integrated brigades through the brassage process as its first of three stages. The process consists firstly of regroupment, where fighters are disarmed. Then they are sent to orientation centres, run by CONADER, where fighters take the choice of either returning to civilian society or remaining in the armed forces. Combatants who choose demobilisation receive an initial cash payment of US $110. Those who choose {{to stay within the}} FARDC are then transferred to one of six integration centres for a 45-day training course, which aims to build integrated formations out of factional fighters previously heavily divided along ethnic, political and regional lines. The centres are spread <b>out</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> country at Kitona, Kamina, Kisangani, Rumangabo and Nyaleke (within the Virunga National Park) in Nord-Kivu, and Luberizi (on the border with Burundi) in South Kivu. The process has suffered severe difficulties due to construction delays, administration errors, and the amount of travel former combatants have to do, as the three stages' centres are widely separated. Following the first 18 integrated brigades, the second goal is {{the formation of}} a ready reaction force of two to three brigades, and finally, by 2010 when MONUC is anticipated to have withdrawn, the creation of a Main Defence Force of three divisions.|$|E
5|$|Before Burebista became king, the Dacians {{experienced}} {{a succession of}} kings through the period of 450 to 60 BC. The kings included Dromichaetes, Oroles and Rubobostes {{in the third and}} second centuries BC. From the 4th century BC to the 2nd century BC the La Tène Celts of the Danube, Alpines and Balkans influenced the Dacian culture. La Tène material culture was found in the central and north-west of Dacia. The development of a La Tène based economy in 3rd–2nd century BC allowed the consolidation of political power through tribal unions. Such regional unions were found both among the Transylvanian Dacians under the rule of Rubobostes, and the Moldavian and Wallachian Getae in Argedava. It is from the La Tène that the Dacians were introduced to the potter's wheel, superior metal-working techniques and probably a tradition of coinage. Homes were a combination of Celtic and Dacian pottery, and certain Celtic style graves contain Dacian style vessels. This suggests a sort of co-existence and fusion between the cultures. Sometime after around 150 BC, however, evidence of La Tène culture peters <b>out,</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> same time the Dacian culture began to mature as evidenced by population and economic growth. Under Rubobstes the authority of the Dacians appears to have increased, thus ending the dominance of the Celtic culture, and leading to the Celts being expelled from the area or merged into the culture, or both at once. There is archaeological evidence to suggest that relations between Dacians and Celts living in the areas north and west of Dacia continued. Painted ceramics of late La Tène-style have been found in Dacian sites in west and central Dacia. Some of these were imported while others were made by Dacian potters imitating Celtic style. A stable monarchy, however, only developed when Burebista became king. Burebista's accession came with the expulsion of Celts around 60 BC when his forces moved through to the middle Danube region, and {{with the support of the}} religious establishment and leaders in Dacia which brought around a stricter moral code in the Dacian kingdom. Around this time pottery of the Dacian style began appearing in Celtic settlements in Central Europe, including former Yugoslavia including in Gomolava, Yugoslavia and Budapest, Hungary.|$|E
