40|$|The {{findings}} of electrical short circuit and current overload tests performed on commercial aircraft wiring are presented. A series of bench-scale {{tests were conducted}} to evaluate circuit breaker response to overcurrent and {{to determine if the}} wire showed any visible signs of thermal degradation due to overcurrent. Three types of wire used in commercial aircraft were evaluated: MIL-W- 22759 / 34 (150 C rated), MIL-W- 81381 / 12 (200 C rated), and BMS 1360 (260 C rated). A second series of tests evaluated circuit breaker response to short circuits and ticking faults. These tests were also meant to determine if the three test wires behaved differently under these conditions and if a short circuit or ticking fault could start a fire. It is concluded that circuit breakers provided reliable <b>overcurrent</b> protection. <b>Circuit</b> breakers may not protect wire from ticking faults but can protect wire from direct shorts. These tests indicated that the appearance of a wire subjected to a current that totally degrades the insulation looks identical to a wire subjected to a fire; however the 'fire exposed' conductor was more brittle than the conductor degraded by overcurrent. Preliminary testing indicates that direct short circuits are not likely to start a fire. Preliminary testing indicated that direct short circuits do not erode insulation and conductor to the extent that ticking faults did.

5000|$|A {{system could}} be made entirely ungrounded. In this case a fault between one phase and ground would not cause any {{significant}} current. In fact, {{this is not a}} good scheme. Commonly the neutral is grounded (earthed) through a bond between the neutral bar and the earth bar. It is common on larger systems to monitor any current flowing through the neutral-to-earth link and use this as the basis for neutral fault protection. The connection between neutral and earth allows any phase-to-earth fault to develop enough current flow to [...] "trip" [...] the <b>circuit</b> <b>overcurrent</b> protection device. In some jurisdictions, calculations are required to ensure the fault loop impedance is low enough so that fault current will trip the protection (In Australia, this is referred to in AS3000:2007 Fault loop impedance calculation). This may limit the length of a branch circuit. In the case of two phases sharing one neutral, the worst-case current draw is one side has zero load and the other has full load, or when both sides have full load. The latter case results in 1 + 1@120deg = 1@60deg, i.e. the magnitude of the current in the neutral equals that of the other two wires.|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{application}} note describes designs using IC family UBA 2015, UBA 2015 A and UBA 2016 A for common ballast topologies. The IC is a controller used in electronic ballast for fluorescent lamps incorporating controllers and NMOST drivers for Power Factor Correction (PFC) and the half-bridge circuit. The high-voltage fluorescent lamp ballast controller drives a zero-voltage switching resonant topology. The lamp controller module includes a high-voltage level shift circuit and several protection features. The protection features include hard switching/capacitive mode protection, half-bridge overcurrent (coil saturation) protection, lamp overvoltage (lamp removal) protection and temperature protection. In {{addition to the}} lamp controller, the IC also contains a PFC controller. The quasi-resonant operation guarantees efficient operation of the PFC <b>circuit.</b> <b>Overcurrent</b> protection, overvoltage protection and demagnetization sensing ensure safe operation under all conditions. The brownout protection of the PFC controller reduces the half-bridge frequency to prevent excessive currents. The proprietary high-voltage BCD power logic process enables efficient, direct start-up from the rectified universal mains voltage. The IC can drive half-bridge circuits with a supply voltage up to 600 V (AC).

40|$|Switched-mode {{converters}} are DC/DC converters {{that supply}} DC loads with a regulated output voltage, and protection against <b>overcurrents</b> and short <b>circuits.</b> These converters are generally fed from an AC network via {{a transformer and}} a conventional diode rectifier. Switched-mode converters (one quadrant) are non-reversible converters that allow the feeding of a DC load with unipolar voltage and current. The switched-mode converters presented in this contribution are classified into two families. The first {{is dedicated to the}} basic topologies of DC/DC converters, generally used for low- to mid-power applications. As such structures enable only hard commutation processes, the main drawback of such topologies is high commutation losses. A typical multichannel evolution is presented that allows an interesting decrease in these losses. Deduced from this direct DC/DC converter, an evolution is also presented that allows the integration of a transformer into the buck and the buck–boost structure. This enables an interesting voltage adaptation, together with a galvanic isolation directly integrated into the converter. The second family is related to DC/DC converters with an intermediary AC stage. Such structures include middle-frequency transformers as described above, and offer reduced commutation losses thanks to natural soft commutation conditions, sometimes reinforced by the insertion of LC components or active devices. This allows high switching frequencies, and then a reduction of the size and weight of such applications...|$|R
40|$|In the {{controller}} of the dc-dc converter, the <b>overcurrent</b> limiting control <b>circuit</b> is often prepared {{to protect the}} power stage of the dc-dc converter and/or the load. In this case, {{the operation of the}} dc-dc converter is divided into to major modes, i. e., the constant voltage-regulated and overcurrent-limited modes. In the overcurrent-limited mode, {{the controller}} may be affected easily by the switching noise from the power stage because the gain of the overcurrent-limiting circuit is relatively high. The integral compensator is used usually to suppress the influence of this noise. However, when the gain is made larger, the converter in the overcurrent-limited mode easily becomes unstable. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the overcurrent-limiting control circuit composed of not only the integral compensator but also the derivative one to improve the dynamic characteristics in the overcurrent-limited mode. Also, the steady-state and dynamic characteristics in the overcurrentlimited mode of the converter are analyzed theoretically and experimentally. As a result, the circuit conditions in steady-state are defined for the foldback current-limiting, constant current, and voltage drooping characteristics. Moreover, it is revealed that the stability in the overcurrent-limited mode and the transient response with the step change of the load from the voltage-regulated mode to the current-limited one can be sufficiently improved by employing the relatively large overcurrent-limiting coefficient and the appropriate rate and reset time of the derivative and integral compensators...|$|R
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and <b>circuit</b> breakers are <b>overcurrent</b> or short <b>circuit</b> protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R
