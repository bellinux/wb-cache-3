30|$|The IB of the 20 -mm-control {{board was}} 0.29  MPa (pressing time: 10  min). On the other hand, the IB of the 20 -mm boards in 10  min was 0.62  MPa. The {{difference}} between the 20 -mm-control and 20 -mm boards was in the pressing method used. The former was manufactured using an <b>ordinary</b> <b>press,</b> while the latter was manufactured using the air-injection press (Table  1), hence the air injection increased the IB. In the previous study [6], the air injection increased the IB of 10 -mm-thick boards only slightly, but the IB of the 20 -mm boards {{in this study was}} increased conspicuously by air injection. This suggests that the effects of air injection are greater on boards that are 20  mm thick than 10  mm thick, but the causes are unknown and must be investigated.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{cultural}} and scientific discourses that informed journalistic commentary about a young child actor {{as a key to}} understanding conceptions of the human mind in the 1850 s. The publicity about Anna Maria Quinn (1848 – 1920), {{one of the most significant}} child players of Shakespeare ever to appear in colonial Australia, suggests a heightening awareness of childhood in mid-nineteenth-century Australia. It involved, to some degree, not only the recognition of the infant prodigy as a child, but also the construction of a loose consensus of what defined childhood. Reportage such as that about Anna Maria Quinn indicates that journalists defined infant prodigies primarily by what they were not: <b>ordinary.</b> <b>Press</b> accounts suggest that young individuals demonstrating exceptionality distinguished themselves by virtue of their uniqueness, implying the existence of a common understanding of the characteristics defining the “ordinary” child...|$|E

30|$|As heat {{does not}} {{transfer}} quickly {{from the upper}} and lower heating plates {{to the center of the}} board in an <b>ordinary</b> hot <b>press</b> (Fig.  1 a, hot press), an additional heating method is needed to reduce the pressing time. Moreover, for manufacturing a thick board, long pressing time is needed owing to low heat conduction at the center of the board. Thus, other heating methods are needed for manufacturing a thick board. A hot press with a radio-frequency heating device installed has been designed to reduce the pressing time and to manufacture thicker boards (Fig.  1 c, radio-frequency hot press) [7 – 10]. This radio-frequency hot press can not only heat board surfaces between {{the upper and lower}} heating plates, but can also heat the inside of a board by radio-frequency heating. This results in simultaneous and uniform heating of the entire board and a rapid rise in temperature at the center of the board [10]. Thus, a thick board can be manufactured with reduced pressing time [11]. However, the radio-frequency hot press significantly increases the water vapor pressure inside the board because of the rapid rise in temperature; therefore, this press is likely to be more prone to inadvertent blowout than an <b>ordinary</b> hot <b>press</b> [12].|$|R

I felt at the sides, and {{discovered}} that what had appeared to me from beneath to be the ordinary light canopy of a four-post bed was in reality a thick, broad mattress, the substance of which was concealed by the valance and its fringe. I looked up and saw the four posts rising hideously bare.

The frightful apparatus moved without making the faintest noise. There had been no creaking as it came down; there was now not the faintest sound from the room above. Amid a dead and awful silence I beheld before me--in the nineteenth century, and in the civilized capital of France--such a machine for secret murder by suffocation as might have existed in the worst days of the Inquisition, in the lonely inns among the Hartz Mountains, in the mysterious tribunals of Westphalia! Still, as I looked on it, I could not move, I could hardly breathe, but I began to recover the power of thinking, and in a moment I discovered the murderous conspiracy framed against me in all its horror.|$|R
30|$|In the {{previous}} study [6], the <b>ordinary</b> hot <b>press</b> could not manufacture 10 -mm-thick boards {{with a metal}} frame placed on particle mats because the boards blew out. Conversely, the air-injection press successfully manufactured 10 -mm-thick boards even when the metal frame was used. In this study, 20 -mm boards were manufactured by following the methods in {{the previous}} study [6]. The 20 -mm boards blew out when they were hot pressed using metal frames and no air was injected. In contrast, air injection facilitated the manufacture of 20 -mm boards, even when the metal frames were used, showing that air injection was also effective in preventing blowout of 20 -mm boards.|$|R

The objectives were to more or less automatically convert the intermediate tones of a photographic image into small lines or dots of stark black and white; to do this better, or at least more efficiently, than was possible with existing processes; and to create a printing block that could be combined with blocks of text in an <b>ordinary</b> printing <b>press.</b> The lines or dots, of varying widths or sizes respectively, had to be small enough to adequately blend together in the eye at a normal viewing distance, producing the illusion of various shades of gray, yet the printing plates had to be durable enough to last through a typical press run without excessive degradation. Above all, the process had to be economical enough to make its widespread commercial use practical.|$|R

The post of New South Wales Governor was the oldest in Australia and had long been considered the most powerful. But, by law, the royal appointment to Government House held sway. During the First World War, the strain began to show in the London Liberal government. Ferguson was desperate to keep secrecy, and maintain control over policy access to London. On 3 June 1916, the Colonial Secretary informed Ferguson that a coalition was pending. Strickland, having snubbed the Government in Melbourne, went over the Governor-General's head directly to London. Strickland worked up an ANZAC day annual memorial, which proved very popular - but which Strickland claimed was a national celebration. On 1 May 1917, Munro Ferguson confessed to Lord Stamfordham that he had under-estimated the deep emotional loyalty of <b>ordinary</b> Australians. <b>Press</b> belief that Anzacs were the spearhead elite and shocktroops among dominions gave a status in the British Empire's armies they sustained throughout the war.|$|R

30|$|Particleboards of {{different}} densities (0.6, 0.7 and 0.8  g/cm 3) and thicknesses (10 and 20  mm) were manufactured from low-moisture particles using an air-injection press. The {{effects of the}} air injection on preventing blowout of the boards {{of different}} densities and thicknesses were investigated by artificially creating blowout-prone conditions using metal frames. The effects of the air-injection pressure on the board performance were also investigated. 10 -mm-thick boards of 0.8  g/cm 3 pressed at 170  °C blew out when air was not injected, but were successfully manufactured by injecting air. 10 -mm-thick boards at 150  °C showed constant internal bond (IB), regardless of density, but at 170  °C, IB was higher in boards of higher densities. This was likely due to accelerated hardening of the urea–formaldehyde resin at 170 than 150  °C. At both pressing temperatures, low air-injection pressure did not cause blowout {{and a reduction in}} board performance. Air injection also prevented the blowout of thick boards of 20  mm and enabled successful manufacture, showing its effectiveness. The IB of the 20 -mm-thick board manufactured using the air-injection press exceeded that of 20 -mm-thick board manufactured using an <b>ordinary</b> hot <b>press.</b>|$|R

The only difference between board no. 6 and board no. 2 was the resin content of 2.5 and 5  %, respectively. All other conditions were the same. Board no. 6 had low resin content and thus had low bonding strength [13]; consequently, it could not resist the vapor pressure and blew out, irrespective of the pressing time. Conversely, board no. 2 had a high resin content and thus high bonding strength [13], resisted the vapor pressure, and did not blow out in 4 and 6  min.|$|R

30|$|The TS of the 20 -mm-control {{board was}} 16.9  % and {{was lower than}} the TS of the 20 -mm board. As shown in Fig.  9, the IB of the 20 -mm-control board was {{lower than that of}} the 20 -mm board; thus TS was {{predicted}} to be higher in the 20 -mm-control board than in the 20 -mm board, but actually was not. This was possibly due to the following reason. The 20 -mm board was manufactured using the air-injection press, and the 20 -mm-control board was manufactured using the <b>ordinary</b> hot <b>press.</b> Air injection lowers the temperature inside the boards [1]. For thick boards of 20  mm, considerable time would have been required for the heat to reach the core. The 20 -mm board is insufficiently heated with pressing time of this study [15] and hence the particles do not plasticize thoroughly, resulting in insufficient contact between particles [16] and increased compressive stress due to hot pressing. The insufficient contact means water is prone to penetrate the board, causing a large springback of particles. Therefore, the TS of 20 -mm board increased. On the other hand, the 20 -mm-control board, which was hot pressed for a long time without air injection, was sufficiently heated. The particles plasticized and contacted each other tightly, which blocked the entry of water. Plasticized particles reduced the springback and were therefore likely to result in low TS.|$|R
30|$|In {{previous}} studies [1 – 3], urea–formaldehyde resin was used, and the air-injection press reduced the pressing time. In this study, however, board no. 5 was successfully manufactured in 4  min, using an <b>ordinary</b> hot <b>press,</b> and board no. 8 required 8  min using an air-injection press. Isocyanate resin {{could be used}} to manufacture boards from high-moisture particles in a short time, even without using an air-injection press. As listed in Table  2, board no. 5 had better properties than board no. 8, suggesting that the air-injection press had adversely impaired the board properties. The frame prevented isocyanate resin from escaping from the edges of the board, but it escaped from the upper plate of the air-injection press, resulting in lowered bonding strength due to less isocyanate resin. The results show that isocyanate resin does not cause blowouts, requires a short pressing time, and can be used to manufacture high-property boards from high-moisture particles without using an air-injection press. However, the board size should be noted. In this study, small boards measuring 300  ×  300  mm were manufactured. Due to this small size, vapor easily escaped from the edges, allowing board no. 5 to be manufactured in 4  min without blowouts. The boards produced in mills are much larger, however, making it more difficult for vapor to escape from the edges. Boards manufactured in mills from high-moisture particles, such as board no. 6, may be vulnerable to blowouts. Therefore, board no. 6 was manufactured with a frame to inhibit the release of vapor from the edges and should be compared with board no. 8. Board no. 6 could not be manufactured with any pressing time, while board no. 8 was manufactured in 8  min, demonstrating the effectiveness of the air-injection press. The remaining issue is how to improve the properties of board no. 8.|$|R
