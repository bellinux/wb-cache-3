For The Missing Link, the team improved the lighting, gameplay mechanics, player freedom, and character animation. The DLC was developed entirely at Eidos Montréal, and this gave the team the <b>opportunity</b> <b>of</b> developing a boss fight with multiple solutions, something they regretted not being able to do with the main game.|$|E
