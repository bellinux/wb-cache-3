5|$|While {{mercury and}} zinc {{minerals}} {{are found in}} large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At {{the current rate of}} consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan.

5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have {{the highest levels of}} copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area with high levels <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> in southeastern Poland showed it to bioaccumulate much higher levels <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E

5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass <b>of</b> <b>mercury.</b> Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E

40|$|The uptake <b>of</b> {{metallic}} <b>mercury</b> was studied using erythrocytes {{with different}} catalase activities taken from various kind of animals.

It was concluded that erythrocyte catalase activity has {{an important role in the}} uptake <b>of</b> metallic <b>mercury...</b>|$|R
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound <b>of</b> <b>mercury.</b> Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens <b>of</b> <b>mercury</b> that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
5|$|Former {{mines in}} Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once {{produced}} {{a large proportion}} of the world supply, have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due to the fall of the price <b>of</b> <b>mercury.</b> Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992.

40|$|Lunar sample {{studies have}} shown that solar-wind {{irradiation}} of the lunar surface has produced a variety of low-molecular-weight compounds. Analysis of the lunar soils has revealed the presence of H 2, CH 4, H 2 O, N 2, CO, CO 2, He, Ne and other components which are extralunar. Irradiation experiments on lunar materials and analogs have shown that solar-wind and solar-flare irradiation of the lunar surface produces selected low-molecular-weight components. Solar-wind irradiation <b>of</b> <b>Mercury's</b> surface should also produce a wide variety of low-molecular-weight species because of the increased solar flux, which results from Mercury being nearer the sun than the moon. The thermal regime <b>of</b> <b>Mercury's</b> surface would result in thermal evaporation of low-temperature components followed by 'cold-trapping' on the night-time side of the planet.
