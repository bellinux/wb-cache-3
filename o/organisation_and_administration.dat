The early stages of the journey envisaged rather bold changes in response to the well identified failures of the CAP as pointed out by many stakeholders, analysts and think tanks. The distribution of direct payments and the impact of agriculture on the environment were prominent issues.

Accordingly, regulating and managing biological diversity presupposes standardisation and methods for managing uncertainty. To be acted on, the concept must be promoted, passing, in this process, through various institutions, such as intergovernmental <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> national <b>administrations.</b> This paper examines how {{the principle of}} biological diversity conservation is defined, focusing on the values of biological diversity and how this notion has 'travelled the world'.

5000|$|These raids caused immense loss of {{life and}} devastation in Berlin. The 22 November 1943 raid killed 2,000 Berliners and {{rendered}} 175,000 homeless. The following night 1,000 were killed and 100,000 bombed out. During December and January, regular raids killed hundreds of people each night and rendered between 20,000 and 80,000 homeless each time. German author Laurenz Demps collated the losses. He evaluated (1) the damage reports of the Berlin police commissioner (Polizeipräsident) issued after each air raid with the descriptions of losses and damage indicated by houses, and distributed to 100-150 <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> <b>administrations</b> busy with rescue, repair, planning and so on; (2) the reports of the main bureau for air raid protection (Hauptluftschutzstelle) {{of the city of}} Berlin, who issued more than 100 copies with variable frequency, each summarising losses and damage by the number of air raids; (3) the war diary of the air raid warning command (Luftwarnkommando, or 'Wako Berlin'), a branch of the German air force (Luftwaffe); and (4) various sources on specific damage. According to Demps, a total of 7,480 were killed (with an additional 2,194 missing), 17,092 injured and 817,730 made homeless. The effect of smoke and dust in the air from the bombing and long periods spent in shelters gave rise to symptoms that were called [...] "cellar influenza" [...] (or keller grippe). According to another author, Reinhard Rürup, nearly 4,000 were killed, 10,000 were injured and 450,000 were made homeless.|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} improvement {{of management and}} assessment processes for curricular external internships has led a group of university teachers specialised in this area to develop a mixed model of measurement that combines the verification of skill acquisition by those students choosing external internships with the satisfaction of the parties involved in that process. They included academics, educational tutors of companies <b>and</b> <b>organisations</b> <b>and</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> services personnel in the latter category. The experience, developed within University of Alicante, {{has been carried out}} in the degrees of Business <b>Administration</b> <b>and</b> Management, Business Studies, Economics, Advertising and Public Relations, Sociology and Social Work, all part of the Faculty of Economics and Business. By designing and managing closed standardised interviews and other research tools, validated outside the centre, a system of {{continuous improvement}} and quality assurance has been created, clearly contributing to the gradual {{increase in the number of}} students with internships in this Faculty, as well as to the improvement in satisfaction, efficiency and efficacy indicators at a global level. As this experience of educational innovation has shown, the acquisition of curricular knowledge, skills, abilities and competences by the students is directly correlated with the satisfaction of those parties involved in a process that takes the student beyond the physical borders of a university campus. Ensuring the latter is a task made easier by the implementation of a mixed assessment method, combining continuous and final assessment, and characterised by its rigorousness and simple management. This report presents that model, subject in turn to a persistent and continuous control, a model all parties involved in the external internships are taking part of. Its short-term results imply an increase, estimated at 15 % for the last course, in the number of students choosing curricular internships and, for the medium and long-term, a major interweaving between the academic world and its social and productive environment, both in the business and institutional areas. The potentiality of this assessment model does not lie only in the quality of its measurement tools, but also in the effects from its use in the various groups and in the actions that are carried out as a result of its implementation and which, without any doubt and as it is shown below, are the real guarantee of a continuous improvement...|$|R
