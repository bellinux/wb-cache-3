25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z {{would have}} the film – American Gangster – playing on the {{monitors}} above the recording booth {{as a source of}} motivation during the recording sessions. In an interview with MTV, producer LV from The Hitmen said [...] "Jay {{would have the}} beats...He'd do the record, and he'd send it back to us. We'd fill in the blanks as far as making them full records. From having live horns, live strings, live drummers. This percussion dude, he was coming in with bottles, banging on bottles, just sprinkles of shit. We went all out. We brought in musicians to bring it out. Jay probably just heard a sample and some drums. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the vocals back, we brought in all the extra candy".|$|E
500|$|On 6 December 2004 an {{expanded}} version of The Holy Bible was released, containing two CDs and a DVD. Disc one comprised a digitally re-mastered {{version of the}} original album plus four live tracks. The DVD features {{an interview with the}} band, footage of TV and festival appearances and promo videos. The second disc includes a remix of the album by Tom Lord-Alge. The remixed version had been intended for release in the US, but this never happened [...] "for well-documented reasons", according to James Dean Bradfield. The band felt the second mix was superior to the version originally released. As Bradfield puts it: [...] "For <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> something back from the American record company—who we despised—and it was brilliant".|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{we might}} as well start up a fire," [...] came from Darry, in {{something}} of a disappointed tone. [...] "I was hoping we'd be able to camp under the stars just <b>once</b> before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the fort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{whole story}} {{would have to}} come out," [...] said Tredgold, sharply. [...] "Verdict: served them right. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> the {{treasure}} <b>we</b> could have given Captain Bowers his share, or more than his share, {{and it would have been}} all right. As it is, nobody must know that we went for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right you are, lad, that is {{a capital}} plan. We will do it at <b>once.</b> <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> {{everything}} wrapped up ready. One of us will stay up there with Tom so as to guard {{the top of the}} path, in case any of the redskins should come down before we are ready to go forward. Three will be enough to hold the Canyon." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Sednaoui. Inspired by French and Japanese pop culture, Sednaoui took {{inspiration}} from Nobuyoshi Araki's work, {{and tried to}} convey a similar aesthetic to the photoshoot. The cover depicts Minogue sitting and surrounded by swirling multi-coloured lights, dressed in a blue Véronique Leroy mini dress. Because Deconstruction wanted to distribute a limited-edition version of the album, Sednaoui had to photograph a separate artwork and dedicate it to those editions. The lenticular sleeve required multiple static cameras to shoot Minogue in the dark. In order to create the long-exposure effect of the lights circulating around the singer, Sednaoui fully dressed himself in a black body suit so he couldn't {{be seen in the}} final shot. However, Minogue remarked that [...] "the shoot was so very difficult but we knew that <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it right it would be amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the decade}} later {{featured}} {{a decline in}} output by neo soul artists, with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow-up album. Badu's commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut Baduizm departed further from that album's music. Hill followed-up her 1998 debut, considered the best-selling neo soul album, with the 2002 live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, a combative, confessional work in which she expresses her misgivings about fame. Melena Ryzik of The New York Times wrote in a retrospect of that [...] "era of left-of-center black singer-songwriters", stating [...] "many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum, conflicted about their early mainstream success." [...] Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists' regression from the mainstream, saying [...] "I {{think most of us}} went through our psychosomatic, quasi-self-saboteur stage. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> that first taste of success, I think just the pressure of reacting got to all of us. Some of us released some of the craziest records of our career." [...] Other artists such as D'Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene. Tyler Lewis from PopMatters attributed the decline to [...] "the downside of [...] rejection of the term [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It {{was the first time}} we sort of jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks in a way we hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E
5000|$|On {{hearing the}} news of the bombing of Hiroshima: I agreed emphatically with Henry Stimson. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> {{ourselves}} into the business of bombing cities, we might as well do the job competently and get it over with. I felt better that morning than I had felt for years… Those fellows who had built the atomic bombs obviously knew their stuff… Later, much later, I would remember downside.|$|R
6000|$|... "And we couldn't {{turn back}} after <b>we</b> <b>once</b> <b>got</b> into Alaska. There {{is no such}} thing as {{travelling}} back and forth between the months of October and May. The rivers freeze up, and everything is snow and ice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If we are attacked," [...] Roger said, [...] "we {{must make}} {{straight}} up the mountains. Steep {{as they may}} be, there are few places where active men cannot climb, and numbers would avail nothing if <b>we</b> <b>once</b> <b>got</b> up among those heights." ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 1986, {{following}} his departure from rehab, Vaughan moved {{back into his}} mother's Glenfield Avenue house in Dallas, which is where he {{had spent much of}} his childhood. During this time, Double Trouble began rehearsals for the Live Alive tour. Although Vaughan was nervous about performing after achieving sobriety, he received positive reassurance. Wynans later recalled: [...] "Stevie was real worried about playing after he'd gotten sober...he didn't know if he had anything left to offer. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back out on the road, he was very inspired and motivated." [...] The tour began on November 23 at Towson State University, which was Vaughan's first performance with Double Trouble after rehab. On December 31, 1986, they played a concert at Atlanta's Fox Theatre, which featured encore performances with Lonnie Mack.|$|E
2500|$|Antwon Tanner portrays Antwon [...] "Skills" [...] Taylor, one of Lucas' oldest {{friends and}} another of those who played at the Rivercourt as children. Tanner said that at first he had thought Skills would become an {{important}} character, but later had come to doubt it. [...] "My character was originally on the thing as recurring, possible series regular, and I was told that <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> picked up my character would become a series regular", he said. [...] "Then when I didn't and the show went in a different direction, I was kind of like, 'Uh-oh.' I didn't think the fans took to him at first, so I thought maybe that's why the studio did it like that. But now he's doing his thing, so I ain't mad at it. They need to write me in more!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{interior}} and exterior locations used to suit {{the needs of the}} story, were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Within a 5-month shooting schedule, 3 weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis, explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film saying, [...] "The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part of Los Angeles, ... It would look almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs." [...] The film crew installed fictional alien language signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores {{on both sides of the}} street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew [...] "came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them, ..." [...] while also mentioning how they [...] "brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with." [...] The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties. Collis recalled how the alien language resembled [...] "a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph. Occasionally, we'd underline it as though it came from sort of electronic machine, like an IBM report. It turned out to be such a simple thing <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it going, but we had to go through a process of 'what is this going to look like?' before we got what we wanted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bradfield {{commented that}} Journal for Plague Lovers {{was an attempt}} to finally secure the legacy of their former member Richey Edwards and the result was that, during the {{recording}} process, it was as close to feeling his presence since his disappearance: [...] "There was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice. That was part of the whole thing of letting enough time lapse. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> actually <b>got</b> into the studio, it almost felt as if we were a full band; it [...] as close to him being in the room again as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] Godfrey shouted, [...] "she {{is as good}} as ever. Now, Luka, get {{everything}} out of her as soon as you can, then we can turn her over and empty her, put the things in again, and be off at <b>once.</b> <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> no time to lose, for you must remember there is {{not much more than a}} quart of cold tea left in the kettle. I am sure the Kara River can't be very far off, but I can't say whether it is three miles or thirty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bill {{here has}} brought news {{that there is}} a row among the natives. They are beating their drums and yelling like fiends, and we expect it means mischief. At any rate it comes to this: we are so {{convinced}} {{that there is going to}} be trouble that we mean to cut and run at <b>once.</b> <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> enough grub put on board our canoe to take us to the next island, but we did not want to leave you in the lurch, to be speared by the niggers, so we have called you to offer you a seat in the canoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, {{it would}} take us YEARS,' exclaimed another. 'Just look at all those tall green branches, {{spreading}} in every direction. If <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> entangled in THEM, we should never get out again!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{lies between}} us and the inlet, and it's quite clear that we can't stay where we are. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> nipped, there'd {{probably}} be an end of her. We must get into that inlet at once or make for the other further south." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} know Haskett. He's {{as close as}} he is brutal. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> up a list to give Captain Pepperill a {{birthday}} present, but Haskett, although he was first mate, only gave twenty-five cents,--no more than Cooley, the cook, chipped in. In his eyes a ten-dollar gold piece is a big lot of money." ...|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS. Exactly. That's {{what keeps}} it so select: nobody but people whose reputations are above {{suspicion}} dare belong to it. If <b>we</b> <b>once</b> <b>got</b> a good name, we {{should become a}} mere whitewashing shop for all the shady characters in London. Better join us, Craven. Let me put you up.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{the long}} night wore away. Our {{progress}} was very slow, but guided by occasional glimpses at the compass we never stopped but twice, <b>once</b> when <b>we</b> found ourselves apparently surrounded by tree boles and fallen boughs, and <b>once</b> when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into swampy ground. Then {{we took the}} risk of lighting the lantern, and by its aid picked our way through these difficult places. By degrees the trees grew fewer {{so that we could}} see the stars between their tops. This was a help to us as I knew that one of them, which I had carefully noted, shone at this season of the year directly over the cone of the mountain, and we were enabled to steer thereby.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{broke up}} a bit," [...] John Little said. [...] "It wasn't to be {{expected}} as we should hang together long after <b>we</b> <b>once</b> <b>got</b> out here; one thought one place best, and another another; but I and my two mates here, and long Simpson, and Alick, and Jones, we have stuck together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} heartily, Rajah, for having so {{promptly}} {{come to my}} aid; though assuredly you would have arrived {{too late to save}} us, had we not, as soon as the fighting began, set to work to prepare a means of escape. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> out, we were sure that you would protect us, and therefore rode here and awaited your return." ...|$|E
60|$|We went to Ogbury Barrows on an archæological expedition. And as {{the very}} name of archæology, owing to a serious {{misconception}} incidental to human nature, is enough to deter most people from taking any further interest in our proceedings when <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there, I may as well begin by explaining, {{for the benefit of}} those who have never been to one, the method and manner of an archæological outing.|$|E
6000|$|... "As for hostage," [...] he continued, [...] "that's {{his last}} talk, I guess, with them he loves so dear. I've got my piece o' news, and thanky {{to him for}} that; but it's over and done. I'll take him in a line when we go {{treasure}}-hunting, for we'll keep him like so much gold, in case of accidents, you mark, and in the meantime. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him his share, to be sure, for all his kindness." ...|$|E
5000|$|In retrospect, Morgan Rose has {{described}} Seasons as too commercial. This {{was due to}} Sevendust's loss of creative control with TVT Records thinking that Seasons should be suitable for radio airplay. He noted in an interview, [...] "When we finished our touring cycle for Seasons, and our number one priority was {{to figure out a}} way to get out of the record deal that we had been stuck in for quite a while. <b>Once</b> <b>we</b> finally <b>got</b> out, our next priority was not to be stuck in the same position as far as creative control and to be able to make a lot of the musical decisions on our own." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> {{were now}} <b>got</b> {{into a very}} hot climate, and, {{whatever}} was the cause, my men began to grow very sickly, and that {{to such a degree}} that I was <b>once</b> afraid <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> the plague among us; but our surgeons, who we all call doctors at sea, assured me there was nothing of that among them, and yet we buried seventeen men here, and had between twenty and thirty more sick, and, as I thought, dangerously too.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} CP/CMS was {{by a small}} and varied {{software}} research and development group for its own use and support… and for experimenting with time-sharing system design.... Schedules and budgets, plans and performance goals {{did not have to}} be met.… We also expected to redo the system at least <b>once</b> after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it going. For most of the group, it was meant to be a learning experience. Efficiency was specifically excluded as a software design goal, although it was always considered. We did not know if the system would be of practical use.... In January, 1965, after starting work on the system, it became apparent from presentations to outside groups that the system would be controversial.|$|R
6000|$|... "From kind-hearted Christians {{throughout}} the country, who send us gifts {{of old and}} new garments, boots and shoes, shawls and socks, etcetera, which we have always in readiness to meet sudden demands; and I may add that the demands are pretty constant. Brown told you just now that we have varied experience. I remember <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a message from the Assistant Quartermaster-General's office to ask how many women and children we could accommodate, as a shipful was expected. We replied that we could take 140, and set to work with preparations. After all, only one woman came! To-day we expected nobody, and--you see what we have got!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{so it was}} all settled easily enough," [...] Sheldon was saying. He was on the veranda, {{drinking}} coffee. The whale-boat {{was being}} carried into its shed. [...] "Boucher was a bit timid at first to carry off the situation with a strong hand, but he did very well <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> started. We made a play at holding a court, and Telepasse, the old scoundrel, accepted the findings. He's a Port Adams chief, a filthy beggar. We fined him ten times {{the value of the}} pigs, and made him move on with his mob. Oh, they're a sweet lot, I must say, at least sixty of them, in five big canoes, and out for trouble. They've got a dozen Sniders that ought to be confiscated." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{we never}} bothered with the commissary. Our hustlers drew better rations from the farmers. Our new captain, however, doubted us. He never knew when he'd see the ten of us again, <b>once</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{under way in}} the morning, so he called in a {{blacksmith}} to clinch his captaincy. In the stern of our boat, one on each side, were driven two heavy eye-bolts of iron. Correspondingly, on the bow of his boat, were fastened two huge iron hooks. The boats were brought together, end on, the hooks dropped into the eye-bolts, and there we were, hard and fast. We couldn't lose that captain. But we were irrepressible. Out of our very manacles we wrought an invincible device that enabled us to put it all over every other boat in the fleet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} not," [...] she said, getting {{up with a}} painful effort. [...] "I am awfully foolish, and I am so sorry that I broke down, but I felt so delighted that I could not help it.

6000|$|... "He had the {{strength}} to pick up one of the heavy posts of the porch. Holding it under his armpit like a lance, but with both hands, he charged madly the rocking house with the force of a battering-ram, bursting open the door and rushing in, headlong, over our prostrate bodies. I and the General picking ourselves up, bolted out together, without looking round <b>once</b> till <b>we</b> <b>got</b> across the road. Then, clinging to each other, we beheld the house change suddenly into a heap of formless rubbish behind the back of a man, who staggered towards us bearing the form of a woman clasped in his arms. Her long black hair hung nearly to his feet. He laid her down reverently on the heaving earth, and the moonlight shone on her closed eyes.|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} {{problems associated with}} current system which are solving the problem of automatic currency classification.
