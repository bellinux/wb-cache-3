5|$|The {{chemistry}} of uranium {{was the focus}} of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various uranium oxides and uranium hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery depleted uranium metal from the uranium tetrafluoride left <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride left <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{specialist}} units were also raised, including three Australian tunnelling companies. Arriving on the Western Front in May 1916 they undertook mining and counter-mining operations alongside British, Canadian and New Zealand companies, initially operating around Armentieres and at Fromelles. The following year they operated in the Ypres section. In November 1916, the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company took <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Canadians around Hill 60, subsequently playing {{a key role}} in the Battle of Messines in June 1917. During the German offensive in March 1918 the three companies served as infantry, and later supported the Allied advance being used to defuse booby traps and mines. The Australian Electrical Mining and Mechanical Boring Company supplied electric power to units in the British Second Army area.|$|E

5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed exclusively by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8—have been largely carried <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever, facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E

5|$|At 02:00 on 13 June the 13th/18th Royal Hussars {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} 'C' Company's {{position at the}} crossroads, later followed by fifty-one men from the 22nd Independent Parachute Company. Bréville was now in British control again {{for the third time}} since the landings on 6 June. But not in the numbers to defend against a German counter-attack, so the 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles, part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, was moved into the village to take <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> survivors of the attack.|$|E

The expanded edition was entitled Sauermugg Redux. Siamese has since been translated into Danish, Czech and English.|$|R

5|$|Boycott {{continued}} to commentate for the station, along with various satellite and Asian channels, until 2003, when {{his career was}} further threatened by throat cancer (see below). Having successfully undergone treatment, Boycott enjoyed a renaissance in his career as he returned to high-profile commentating with Channel 4, which had meanwhile taken <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> BBC in televising England's home Test games. In November 2005, Boycott rejoined the BBC's Test Match Special to provide commentary for England's 2005 tour of Pakistan. In January 2006, Boycott joined Asian channel Ten Sports. He delivered the Colin Cowdrey Lecture in 2005, speaking {{about the need for}} cricket to adapt to changing circumstances and embrace innovations like Twenty20.|$|E
5|$|Clark Gregg reprises {{his role}} as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. The episode is set in Peru, {{featuring}} guest star Leonor Varela {{as a member of}} the Peruvian military involved with the ongoing conflict between the Peruvian government and rebel forces. Ethnic instruments were used in the score to support this setting, while Tesseract technology is carried <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> films to tie-in with the conflict. Special guest star Samuel L. Jackson also reprises his role from the film series in a cameo appearance.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{including}} a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> convention, and Garfield traveled to New York {{to meet with}} party leaders there. After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time. Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a few close states, including New York and Indiana.|$|E

5|$|Due to the missed field goal, Air Force took <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{point at}} which the kick was missed, the 27-yard line. Despite gaining a bit of {{momentum}} when they kept Virginia Tech from scoring, the Falcons were unable to gain a first down and went three and out, punting the ball away. Tech declined to return the ball, which rolled to the Virginia Tech three-yard line, where the Hokies' offense took over. On the first play after the punt, Tech's Nigel Bowe fumbled the ball, which was leapt upon by several Air Force defenders, who recovered it. After the fumble recovery, it took the Falcons just one play to score a touchdown and gain a 107 lead.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the Allies {{landed at}} Arawe on New Britain on 15 December, while the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade, having {{commenced}} its advance {{up the coast}} from Gusika on 3 December, continued on passing through Bald Hill, Lakona and Kiligia {{on its way to}} Fortification Point as it led the opening phase of the Australian advance towards Sio. In late December, the 20th Infantry Brigade, which had largely been rested during the advance on Wareo, took <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 4th. After sweeping up the coast quickly against light Japanese resistance, they captured Sio in early January 1944, having suffered only very light casualties.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, left <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall {{was a result of}} unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{just two}} years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden {{unveiled}} the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and allowed Holden to gauge public reaction to its styling. Much of the Torana's styling drew on the essence of the VE's design. Some production-ready components even carried <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> TT36 including the steering wheel, the window and rear-view mirror switch cluster and the handbrake lever.|$|E
5|$|In June, the {{division}} was withdrawn into reserve to conduct training exercises for the Ypres offensive. Replicas of the German positions on Pilckem Ridge were built and attacks rehearsed. On 20 July, {{the division}} {{returned to the}} front taking <b>over</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 29th Division. Until {{the end of the}} month, the division was subjected to German artillery fire. These shells, a mixture of high explosive and mustard gas, inflicted serious losses. At the same time, aerial reconnaissance and infantry patrols by the division confirmed that the British preliminary barrage had forced the Germans back to their second line positions.|$|E
