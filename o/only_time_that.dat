5|$|The twenty days between Braden's {{perfect game}} and Halladay's was the {{shortest}} span between two perfect games since 1880 {{and there was}} a chance {{that for the first time}} in MLB history there would be three perfect games in such short succession. Had Galarraga's game been correctly called, the four-day span since Halladay's perfect game would have broken that 130-year-old record, and marked the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> three consecutive no-hitters had been perfect games, the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> three perfect games had occurred in one season (since done in 2012 by Philip Humber, Matt Cain and Félix Hernández), the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> three perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a month, the only time four perfect games had occurred in a span shorter than a year (as Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox threw a perfect game in July 2009), and the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> four perfect games had occurred within a stretch of five no-hitters.|$|E

5|$|He took match {{figures of}} 5/48 in the Second Test in a drawn match. He batted {{for the first}} time, and {{remained}} unbeaten without scoring as Australia collapsed to be all out for 107 on sticky wicket. It was the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> they conceded a first innings lead in the series, and persistent rain forced a draw.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} and so far <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the steeplechase was {{declared}} void, after 30 of the 39 runners began and carried on racing despite there having been a false start. Seven of the field even went on to complete the course, with Esha Ness crossing the finishing post first, in what would have been the second-fastest time ever.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of August 1915, Sing was hospitalised for four days with influenza. That same month, an enemy sniper's bullet struck Sheehan's spotting telescope, injuring his hands and face, and then hit Sing's shoulder, but the latter was back in action after a week's recuperation. Sheehan was more severely wounded, and was shipped back to Australia. This was reportedly the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Sing was injured at Gallipoli. He would not fare so well {{later on in the}} war.|$|E
50|$|Moth lived quite discreetly and did {{not have}} any {{political}} influence; the <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> she used her influence were when she secured a few favours from the monarch for some of her relatives. Her brother Matthias Moth, in particular, used the connection to his advantage. In 1682, she was granted estates in Gottorp.|$|R
5|$|Australia has competed once in ice hockey, in 1960. The {{team lost}} every game, placing last out of nine countries. Australia has not competed in curling as an {{official}} sport at the Olympics, but has competed in it as a demonstration sport, placing seventh in 1992. These are the <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> Australia has competed in team sports involving ball-like objects.|$|R
50|$|Hucklebuck {{made his}} debut at Gawler on 11 August 2013, winning by over 4 lengths. 4 weeks later, {{he won his}} next race at Morphetville. These two races, with Jackson Matthews aboard, were the <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> Dom Tourneur was not used as jockey. In the next two months, Hucklebuck had three races in Victoria, winning the listed Gothic Stakes.|$|R
5|$|On 31 May, Ajax, {{under the}} command of Captain George Baird, was the second ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. She fired one salvo of six common pointed, capped shells at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group shortly after 19:00, but had to cease fire {{immediately}} afterwards when her view was obstructed by the ships of the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron. That was the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the ship fired her weapons during the battle.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the second}} time an East Pacific storm was named Naomi and the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> a storm named Naomi in the basin reached {{hurricane}} strength. Because the effects from the hurricane were minor, the name was not retired after this hurricane and was re-used in the 1976 season. However, a name change in 1978 dropped the name Naomi, and the name has not been used since.|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{opened for}} the entire series, and {{returned}} his best ever series figures of 421 at 70.17, second only to Bradman.

50|$|Largely {{due to the}} Bucs’ wretched showing on the field, {{attendance}} was typically among {{the lowest in the}} league. Usually, the <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> games attracted crowds anywhere near capacity were when the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers came to town and brought thousands of their fans with them. As a result, most Bucs’ home games were blacked out locally.|$|R
5|$|A {{long-term}} {{goal of the}} IFAF is for American football {{to be accepted by}} the International Olympic Committee as an Olympic sport. The <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the sport was played was at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but as a demonstration sport. Among the various problems the IFAF has to solve in order to be accepted by the IOC are building a competitive women's division, expanding the sport into Africa, and overcoming the current worldwide competitive imbalance that is in favor of American teams.|$|E
5|$|Australia's strongest ever {{performance}} in swimming {{was at the}} 1956 Olympics on home soil in Melbourne. Australia claimed eight of the thirteen gold medals available, including both relays and a clean sweep of the medals in the 100m freestyle, considered the blue-riband event {{for both men and}} women. This is the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Australia has topped the medal tally in swimming, and the tally of gold medals has not been surpassed despite the expansion of the swimming program to its current 32 events.|$|E
5|$|By 1986 the Flames landed {{forwards}} Doug Risebrough, Lanny McDonald, and Dan Quinn, defenceman Al MacInnis, and goaltender Mike Vernon. Finishing {{second in}} the Smythe with a 40–31–9 record (the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points), the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, setting up a showdown with the Oilers. Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season, and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row. However, the Flames upset the Oilers in seven games—the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the Flames defeated the Oilers in a playoff series during the decade. The series-winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by Steve Smith ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr's leg and into his own net. The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history.|$|E

50|$|In 1902, the Aswan Low Dam was {{completed}} on the Nile River by the British. This threatened many ancient landmarks, including the temple complex of Philae, with being submerged. The {{height of the}} dam was raised twice, from 1907-1912 and from 1929-1934, and the island of Philae was nearly always flooded. In fact, the <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> the complex was not underwater was when the dam's sluices were open from July to October.|$|R
5|$|Cardiff City {{qualified}} for the 1927 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1926–27 FA Cup. They defeated Arsenal by one goal to nil, with the only goal of the game coming from Hughie Ferguson. It was the club's first FA Cup victory, and the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> the trophy had been won by a club outside of England. A few months after Cardiff's victory, the match between them and Corinthians for the FA Charity Shield was set to take place at Stamford Bridge on 12 October. Corinthian announced their team a few days prior to the game, though goalkeeper Benjamin Howard Baker was subsequently replaced by A.M. Russell, who normally played for Cambridge University A.F.C.. Due to an injury to Tom Watson, Billy Hardy was switched to the other wing in defence for Cardiff City.|$|E
5|$|Even before {{retiring}} from the Corps, Butler began developing his post-Corps career. In May 1931, he {{took part in a}} commission established by Oregon Governor Julius L. Meier. The commission laid the foundations for the Oregon State Police. He began lecturing at events and conferences and after his retirement from the Marines in 1931, he took this up full-time. He donated much of his earnings from his lucrative lecture circuits to the Philadelphia unemployment relief. He toured the western United States, making 60 speeches before returning for his daughter's marriage to Marine aviator Lieutenant John Wehle. Her wedding was the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> he wore his dress blue uniform after he left the Marines.|$|E
5|$|Hal Nerdal {{competed in}} Nordic combined, the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Australia {{has participated in}} the event at the Olympics, and {{finished}} last. Four years after injury prevented them from competing, Bower and Mason recorded Australia's best result, placing 12th in the pairs figure skating, although they were still second to last. Hickey and two male figure skaters—who were close to last—were the only Australians to place in the top 20, while Christine Davy became the first Australian {{to break into the}} top 30 in a skiing event, although she too was in the bottom 20% of the competition. The athletes were accompanied by seven staff members, the largest Australian support contingent until 1988. Chisholm mistakenly noted in his official report that it was Australia's second participation, forgetting the delegations sent in 1936, 1952 and 1956.|$|E

50|$|Belgium at the UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships is an {{overview}} of the Belgian results at the UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. The <b>only</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> cyclo-cross racers appear in proper national selections of one or multiple sportsmen are the yearly UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. Because of this, all Belgian national cyclo-cross teams (either elite or younger teams) only compete as such during one day per year. As of 2014, Belgium's national manager of the men's elite selection is Rudy De Bie.|$|R
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was then}} {{overhauled}} and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took {{her head out}} of the water, and seeing the American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics was the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{made his}} {{international}} debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. He {{took his first}} medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain the <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics. He {{went on to win}} gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute, the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku. Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.|$|E
