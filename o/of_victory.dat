5|$|Gibraltar was {{fortified}} for {{the first}} time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of Aragon and Castile. Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount <b>of</b> <b>Victory),</b> though this name did not persist, and a fortified town named Medinat al-Fath (the City <b>of</b> <b>Victory)</b> was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.|$|E
