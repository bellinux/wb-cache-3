5|$|In 1525 or 1526, Gérard {{withdrew his}} son from the Collège de Montaigu and {{enrolled}} {{him in the}} University of Orléans to study law. According to contemporary biographers Theodore Beza and Nicolas Colladon, Gérard believed that Calvin would earn more money as a lawyer than as a priest. After a few years <b>of</b> <b>quiet</b> study, Calvin entered the University of Bourges in 1529. He was intrigued by Andreas Alciati, a humanist lawyer. Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed classical studies. During his 18-month stay in Bourges, Calvin learned Koine Greek, a necessity for studying the New Testament.|$|E

5|$|The {{rippling}} preep and whistled sweeeooo {{calls of}} the Alpine chough {{are quite different}} from the more typically crow-like chee-ow vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red-billed chough. It also has a rolling churr alarm call, and a variety <b>of</b> <b>quiet</b> warbles and squeaks given by resting or feeding birds. In a study of chough calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in the Alpine chough showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.|$|E
5|$|After Marwan's 732 expedition, {{a period}} <b>of</b> <b>quiet</b> set in. Marwan was {{replaced}} {{as governor of}} Armenia and Adharbayjan in spring 733 by Sa'id al-Harashi, but he undertook no campaigns at all until 735, when he lost his sight and resigned. Marwan was then re-appointed to the post, but he too was unable to launch anything but local expeditions until 737: three fortresses near the Darial Pass and the ruler of a North Caucasian principality, Tuman Shah, were captured in 735, while another local prince, Wartanis, was defeated and killed in 736. Blankinship attributes this inactivity to the exhaustion of the Arab armies and draws a parallel with the contemporaneous quiet phase in Transoxiana in 732–734, where the Arabs had also suffered a series of costly defeats {{at the hands of}} Turkic nomads. In addition, Agapius and Michael the Syrian record that the Arabs and the Khazars concluded peace, information which Muslim sources ignore or downplay to a tactical ruse by Marwan designed to gain time for his preparations.|$|E
5|$|Cherry {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the series while watching coverage of the Andrea Yates murder trials, and was fascinated by how women lead lives <b>of</b> <b>quiet</b> desperation. He began writing the script in 2002 and pitched it to several networks throughout the following year. In October 2003, ABC announced that it had picked up the pilot. Casting began in February 2004 and filming took place the following month primarily on the Colonial Street backlot set at Universal Studios. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 21.6million viewers on its original American broadcast, becoming the most-watched program of the week. The pilot received extremely positive reviews, with critics complimenting the series' tonal diversity. The cast, particularly the four leads and Sheridan, also received praise. The episode won various awards, including three Emmys.|$|E
