25|$|High {{variable}} costs mean that Pandora {{does not have}} significant <b>operating</b> <b>leverage,</b> {{and in the next}} couple years might actually have negative <b>operating</b> <b>leverage</b> due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile. Pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly one-ninth the rate of desktop hours. Since Pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the user's platform, the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours. Mobile revenues will improve over time as Pandora shifts from relying on third-party ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates.|$|E

The Degree of <b>Operating</b> <b>Leverages</b> (DOL), Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL) & Degree of Combined Leverage (DCL) are the independent variables and Earning Per Share (EPS) and Share Price (SP) are the dependent variables for this study.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a framework for}} improving the availability of cluster based Internet services. Our approach models Internet services {{as a collection of}} interconnected components, each possessing well defined interfaces and failure semantics. Such a decomposition allows designers to engineer high availability based on an understanding of the interconnections and isolated fault behavior of each component, as opposed to ad-hoc methods. In this work, we focus on using the entire commodity workstation as a component because it possesses natural, fault-isolated interfaces. We define a failure event as a reboot because not only is a workstation unavailable during a reboot, but also because reboots are symptomatic of a larger class of failures, such as configuration and operator errors. Our observations of 3 distinct clusters show that the time between reboots is best modeled by a Weibull distribution with shape parameters of less than 1, implying that a workstation becomes more reliable the longer it has been <b>operating.</b> <b>Leveraging</b> this observed property, we design an allocation strategy which withholds recently rebooted workstations from active service, validating their stability before allowing them to return to service. We show via simulation that this policy leads to a 70 - 30 rule-of-thumb: For a constant utilization, approximately 70 % of the workstation failures can be masked from end clients with 30 % extra capacity added to the cluster, provided reboots are not strongly correlated. We also found our technique is most sensitive to the burstiness of reboots as opposed to absolute lengths of workstation uptimes. 1...|$|R
