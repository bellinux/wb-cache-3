It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, {{his father}} was {{appointed}} prebendary and rector of Tibohine, and {{the family moved to}} neighbouring Frenchpark, in County Roscommon. He was home schooled by his father and his aunt due to a childhood illness. While a young man, he became fascinated with hearing the old people in the locality speak the Irish language. He was influenced in particular by the gamekeeper Seamus Hart and the wife of his friend, Mrs. Connolly. He was crushed when Hart died (Douglas was 14) and his interest in the Irish language, which was the first language he began to study in any detail, as his own undertaking, flagged for a while. However, he visited Dublin a number of times and realised that there were groups <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> <b>just</b> like him, interested in Irish, a language looked down on at the time by many and seen as backward and old-fashioned.|$|E

Her career as an author began prior to her courtroom series. One of her more recent books, which hit shelves on April 25, 2013, was inspired by one of her advisory catch phrases encouraging romantic partners to be judicious with regards to domestic partnerships. This catch phrase is: “There is no Court <b>of</b> <b>People</b> <b>Just</b> Living Together.” In September 2014, Sheindlin celebrated the opening of her 19th season by giving out her latest book, [...] "What Would Judy Say: Be the Hero of Your Own Story," [...] for free.

I'm walking up to the Plaza , and when I was dressed as Mariah Carey, there were a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>just</b> standing there taking pictures, and the street was closed down, and it was a whole rigmarole. It is what it is. So, basically, I went into costume as the stalker, and I told my bodyguard, 'I don't want you to walk with me.' So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E
500|$|Band {{publicist}} Derek Taylor told NME: [...] "A {{key factor}} in the breakdown {{had to be the}} Beach Boys themselves, whose stubbornness by [...] had seemingly twisted itself into a grim determination ... {{to get back to the}} old accepted, dumb formulas." [...] An unnamed observer told Gaines: [...] "... knowing that everyone in that group was married, and had children and a house. I think he [...] felt like more of a benefactor than an artist." [...] Music writer Richard Goldstein relates his impression of Wilson based on a meeting in 1967: [...] "He came across as ... deeply insecure about his creative instincts, terrified that the songs he was working on were too arty to sell." [...] Ultimately, Wilson put an end to the Smile project once he felt he did not have a [...] "commercial feeling about some of these songs ... Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves. You know, what they've written is nice for them ... but a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>just</b> don't like it." [...] A replacement LP, Smiley Smile, [...] was released on September 18, 1967 to mixed reviews and the group's worst sales yet, becoming the first in a seven-year string of under-performing Beach Boys albums. According to writer Scott Schinder, the album was released to [...] "general incomprehension. While Smile may have divided the Beach Boys' fans had it been released, Smiley Smile merely baffled them." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public.... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." [...] Brian said that Smile leftovers like [...] "Surf's Up" [...] were left unreleased because he lacked a [...] "commercial feeling" [...] for those songs, surmising that [...] "Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves.

[...] Carl Wilson reflected on the period: [...] "To get that album [...] out, someone would have needed willingness and perseverance to corral all of us. Everybody was so loaded on pot and hash all of the time that it's no wonder the project didn't get done." ...|$|E
500|$|Kulwicki {{started his}} rookie season in 1986 with Terry. After Terry decided to end support for his racing team mid-season, Kulwicki fielded his own team. He started out as {{essentially}} a one-man team {{in a time when}} other teams had dozens of people in supporting roles. Initially the driver, owner, crew chief, and chief mechanic, Kulwicki had difficulty acquiring and keeping crew members because he found it difficult to trust them to do the job with the excellence that he demanded, and because he was hands on in the maintenance of racecars {{to the point of being}} a [...] "control freak". He sought out crew members who had owned their own racecars, believing they would understand what he was going through: working long hours and performing his own car maintenance with a very limited budget. Notable crew members include his crew chief, Paul Andrews, and future Cup crew chiefs, Tony Gibson and Brian Whitesell. Future crew chief and owner, Ray Evernham, lasted sixweeks with Kulwicki in 1992. Evernham later said, [...] "The man was a genius. There's no question. It's not a matter <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>just</b> feeling like he was a genius. That man was a genius. But his personality paid for that. He was very impatient, very straightforward, very cut-to-the-bone." [...] With onecar, twoengines, and twofull-time crew members, Kulwicki won the 1986 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award. He had competed in 23 of 29events, with fourtop10 finishes, three races not completed (DNF), an average finish of 15.4, and had only one result below 30th place. Kulwicki finished 21st in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.|$|E

[...] McCloud specified {{that he was still}} keeping an eye on things that needed to happen for the infinite canvas to take off, saying that [...] "the notion of Web applications being as robust as desktop applications has placed us closer to that hope that we may finally be able to create those spaces in a seamless way online. Right now, it's very difficult to do that."

5000|$|By 'peoples', Rawls means [...] "the {{actors in}} the Society <b>of</b> <b>Peoples,</b> <b>just</b> as {{citizens}} are the actors in domestic society" [...] (L.P. p. 23). Peoples share three features: a common system of government; what John Stuart Mill called 'common sympathies' (XVI of Mill's Considerations, 1862); and a moral nature. Although the Law <b>of</b> <b>Peoples</b> {{is supposed to be}} part of liberal foreign policy, the peoples Rawls talks about are not necessarily liberal. 'Decent hierarchical peoples' also feature as parties to the Law <b>of</b> <b>Peoples,</b> though burdened states, outlaw states and benevolent absolutisms do not. The inclusion of 'decent hierarchical peoples' is demanded by the notion of toleration: a notion Rawls sees as integral to liberalism. In part, the Law <b>of</b> <b>Peoples</b> is an attempt to show how far international toleration by liberal societies can reasonably be expected to extend.|$|R
