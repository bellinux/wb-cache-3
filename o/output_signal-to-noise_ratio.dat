40|$|A polarity-coincidence {{detector}} with biased polarity indicators (biased hard limiters) is {{studied to}} determine the effects of the bias on the detector output mean value, output variance, and <b>output</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> power <b>ratio.</b> The mean value of the detector output is derived for the case of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with arbitrary spectra for the signal and noise. The mean value is expressed as a function of the input <b>signal-to-noise</b> power <b>ratio,</b> and as a function of the biases in the input channel and the reference channel polarity indicators. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a spurious component in the output mean value. The variance of the defector output is derived for the cage of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with RC low-pass spectra for signal and noise, for small input <b>signal-to-noise</b> power <b>ratios</b> only. The variance is expressed as a function of the biases in the input channel and reference channel polarity indicators, and as a function of the input signal-to-noise band-width radio. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a spurious component in the output variance. The <b>output</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> power <b>ratio</b> (the square of the output mean divided by the output variance) is derived for both an ideal polarity-coincidence detector (no bias) and for a biased polarity-coincidence detector. The <b>output</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> power <b>ratio</b> is expressed as a function of the input <b>signal-to-noise</b> power <b>ratio,</b> the biases in the input channel and the reference channel polarity indicators, and input <b>signal-to-noise</b> band-width <b>ratio,</b> for small input <b>signal-to-noise</b> power <b>ratios</b> only. It is shown that the <b>output</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> power <b>ratio</b> of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of a correlation detector. When the input <b>signal-to-noise</b> band-width <b>ratio</b> is unity, the degradation is about 1. 4 db. The degradation increases to about 2. 2 db. when the input signal-to noise band-width ratio becomes either very small or very large. It is also shown that the <b>output</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> power <b>ratio</b> of a biased polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector. A simple expression for the degradation is presented.

40|$|A set {{of three}} {{dimensionless}} parameters is proposed to characterize lidar systems. Two of them are based on an asymptotic approximation of the <b>output</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> {{as a function of}} the input optical power reaching the photoreceiver when there is no background radiation. Of these, one is defined as the ratio between the input signal power level coming from a reference range in a reference atmosphere (reference power level) and the input power level that would produce a reference <b>output</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> if the photoreceiver operated always in signal-shot noise limited regime. The other is defined as the ratio between the reference power level and the input power level for which the signal-induced shot noise power equals the receiver noise power. A third parameter, defined as the ratio between the background optical power at the photoreceiver input and the reference power level, quantifies the effect of background radiation. With these three parameters a good approximation to the <b>output</b> <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> of the lidar can be calculated {{as a function of the}} power reduction with respect to the power reaching the photodetector in the reference situation.

We also examine via computer simulations the effect of path unbalance/correlation as well as outdated/imperfect channel estimations. We show through numerical exam ples that the proposed schemes which are designed for the minimum use of network resources can save a certain amount of complexity load and soft handover overhead with a very slight performance loss compared to the conventional generalized selection combining-based diversity systems.
