40|$|Purpose. We {{hypothesized}} that reaction times (RTs) for a switch release are faster for hand-controlled than for foot-controlled switches for physiological and anatomical reasons (e. g., nerve conduction speed). The risk of accidental trauma {{could be reduced}} if the surgeon reacted quicker and therefore improve the surgical outcome. Method. We included 47 medical professionals at USC. Demographics and handedness were recorded. Under a microscope, a simple reaction time test was performed, testing all extremities multiple times in a random order. Additionally, a subjective questionnaire was administered. Results. The mean RTs for hands are 318. 24 [*]ms ± 51. 13 and feet 328. 69 ± 48. 70. The comparison of hand versus foot showed significant shorter RTs for the hand (P= 0. 025). Partially significant differences between and within the experience level groups could be demonstrated by level of education (LE) and microscopic surgeries/week (MSW) (P= 0. 57 – 0. 02). In the subjective questionnaire, 91. 5 % (n= 43 / 47) of test subjects prefer to use hand controls. Conclusion. Our data show that the RT for hands is faster than feet. Similarly the subjective questionnaire showed a greater preference for hand actuation. This data suggest a hand-controlled <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>instrument</b> might have distinct advantages; however, clinical correlation is required...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of microorganisms in <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>instruments</b> and surfaces {{can lead to}} the exposure of patients to several infections. However, there is no information regarding fungal and bacteria contamination in optical shops. This study aims to characterize fungi and bacteria contamination in air and surfaces from 10 optical shops covering also <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>instruments.</b> Air samples were collected through an impaction method onto malt extract agar (MEA) supplemented with chloramphenicol (0. 05 %) used for fungi and Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) supplemented with nystatin (0. 2 %) used for bacteria. Outdoor samples were also performed to be used as reference. Surface and equipment’s swab samples were also collected side-by-side. All the collected samples were incubated at 27 ºC for 5 to 7 days (fungi) or at 30 º for 7 days (bacteria). Regarding fungal distribution, thirteen different species/genera were found in the air, being the most common Alternaria sp. (62. 0 %). Eight different species/genera were identified in the surfaces, ranging from 2 to 5 x 104 CFU/m 2, being the most common A. versicolor complex and Penicillium sp. (40. 0 %). The trial frames were the most contaminated equipment, since 50. 0 % of the collected samples were with countless colonies. The airborne bacterial population indicated higher concentrations in the contactology office (average: 133 CFU/m 3) than in the client’s waiting rooms (average: 126 CFU/m 3).

40|$|Determination of {{two-dimensional}} {{characteristics of}} the anterior surface of the eye is becoming increasingly important in modern optometry and ophthalmology practice. In particular, accurate estimation of the pupil size and centration is crucial in customized refractive surgery, corneal transplantation, and advanced contact lens fitting. The pupil parameters change under different lighting conditions so they often need {{to be related to}} some fixed reference such as the limbus outline. However, current commercial pupillometers do not estimate limbus position. We present a novel algorithm for automatic extraction of pupil parameters from digital images that takes the relative limbus information into account. The algorithm utilizes several customized image processing techniques that form a robust procedure which performs well {{for a wide range of}} clinical images. We apply the developed algorithm to images obtained by a standard digital camera, and specialized <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>instruments</b> such as a wavefront sensor and a high-speed imaging system...|$|E

40|$|The {{tracking}} scanning laser ophthalmoscope (TSLO) was designed, {{built and}} characterized for high-resolution eye-tracking, imaging, and targeted retinal stimulus delivery. Eye-tracking is done via an image-based software program that monitors {{the image of}} the retina over time while simultaneously logging the displacements of the eye. Currently, this system is the most accurate, fast and functional eye-tracking system used in a standard <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>instrument.</b> The TSLO has the ability to non-invasively track the eye at 960 Hz (with an accuracy of 0. 2 arcminutes or roughly 1 micron) and present stimuli to the retina at the resolution of single cone photoreceptors (0. 66 arcminutes, which is roughly 3 microns). The combination of structural imaging and functional testing allows one to begin to more thoroughly understand retinal disease progression, as well probe specific retinal locations in order to test new treatment efficacies. This level of accuracy is unprecedented in the clinic and is crucial when monitoring minute changes in eye motion, structure, and function. Additionally, the system is capable of providing external eye-tracking for other high-resolution imaging systems, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) systems through the active steering of an imaging beam. This feature allows the imaging raster or stimuli to stay on target during fixational eye motion. This dissertation steps through all of the above-mentioned uses of the TSLO and further elaborates on the optimal design and system test performance capabilities of the system...|$|R
40|$|Glaucoma is {{the second}} main cause of the {{blindness}} {{in the world and}} {{there is a tendency to}} increase this number due to the lifetime expectation raise of the population. Glaucoma is related to the eye conditions, which leads the damage to the optic nerve. This nerve carries visual information from eye to brain, then, if it has damage, it compromises the visual quality of the patient. In the majority cases the damage of the optic nerve is irreversible and it happens due to increase of intraocular pressure. One of main challenge for the diagnosis is to find out this disease, because any symptoms are not present in the initial stage. When is detected, it is already in the advanced stage. Currently the evaluation of the optic disc is made by sophisticated fundus camera, which is inaccessible for the majority of Brazilian population. The purpose of this project is to develop a specific fundus camera without fluorescein angiography and red-free system to accomplish 3 D image of optic disc region. The innovation is the new simplified design of a stereo-optical system, in order to make capable the 3 D image capture and in the same time quantitative measurements of excavation and topography of optic nerve; something the traditional fundus cameras do not do.
