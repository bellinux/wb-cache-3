50|$|For {{space and}} weight-distribution reasons, the {{outboard}} or wing engines were mounted with their output ends facing forward, with power transmitted through Vee-drive gearboxes to the propeller shafts. The center engine was mounted with the <b>output</b> <b>flange</b> facing aft, and power was transmitted {{directly to the}} propeller shaft.|$|E
40|$|Compact robotic {{wrist-joint}} assembly {{includes two}} motor subassemblies providing two concentric output rotations about axis of wrist: outer <b>output</b> <b>flange</b> on front face of assembly rotated to, and held at, any predetermined roll angle {{within range of}} plus or minus 180 degrees, and inner <b>output</b> <b>flange</b> concentric with outer <b>output</b> <b>flange</b> capable of unlimited rotation relative to outer flange. Each motor subassembly includes concentric rotor and stator and harmonic drive...|$|E
40|$|The modular {{drive system}} has an electromechanical/hydromechanical drive (5) for {{generating}} a rotary input motion, and a brake unit (6) for braking the generated rotary input motion. A gearbox is arranged in housing (1) for {{conversion of the}} rotary input motion into translational output movement. The housing is equipped with input flange surface (2 - 1) attached to electromechanical/hydromechanical drive, and <b>output</b> <b>flange</b> surface (3 - 1) attached to shaping machine. An independent claim is included for a shaping machine...|$|E
50|$|All E30 differentials, small case {{or medium}} case, are interchangeable. The E28 5-Series and E24 6-Series {{shared the same}} differential, {{and can be used}} in the E30 after {{swapping}} the rear cover and <b>output</b> <b>flanges.</b> This provides options for ratios such as 3.25 and 3.46 that wake up the 325e, or provide a proper final drive ratio for engine-swapped cars without overdrive.|$|R
50|$|Porsche {{revealed}} {{basic information}} on the 991 Carrera and Carrera S on 23 August 2011. The Carrera {{is powered by a}} 350 hp (257 kW) 3.4-litre engine. The Carrera S features a 3.8-litre engine producing 400 hp (294 kW). A Power Kit (option X51) is available for the Carrera S, increasing power to 430 hp. The new 991s overall length grows by 2.2 inches and wheelbase grows by 3.9 inches (now 96.5 in.) Overhangs are trimmed and the rear axle moves rearward roughly 3 in. toward the engine (made possible by new 3-shaft transmissions whose <b>output</b> <b>flanges</b> are moved closer to the engine). There is a wider front track (2.0 inches wider for the Carrera S). The design team was headed by Michael Mauer.|$|R
50|$|Input and <b>output</b> shaft <b>flanges</b> are {{bolted to}} the giubo on either side using {{alternating}} hole positions, so that the flanges are not connected directly to one another but instead only through the rubber material of the coupling. The elasticity of the rubber absorbs vibration and flexes for alignment. It follows that the rubber must withstand the application's full transmitted torque, for which reason the rubber is often reinforced internally using moulded-in fibre material.|$|R
40|$|There are {{presented}} basic results of experiments on the LIA- 10 M accelerator since its putting into operation (1994) till today. There were investigated various modes of accelerator operation and its output characteristics {{depending on the}} parameters of injected electron beam, number of connected accelerator modules, time program of inductors switch-in etc. There was obtained a large scope of experimental data that are of interest for LIA- 10 M accelerator practical use and {{for the development of}} new facilities of this type. The investigations that have been performed recently make it possible to considerably (half as much again) increase the output dose parameters of the accelerator as compared to the level achieved before: maximal dose (Si) and dose rate on the <b>output</b> <b>flange</b> constitute 400 Gy and 2. 5. 1010 Gy/s, while at a 1 meter distance from the target they are equal to 7. 5 Gy and 5. 108 Gy/s, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{precision}} actuators in robotic arm {{comes from the}} need to ensure the resulting accuracy of the robot at the maximum speed of movement. The replacement of actuators by means of electrical module allows the use of carrier body of the module for gripping flanges or other modules. Development of new modules {{is based on the}} requirement of providing a complete solution for the customerâ€™s needs. After the development of new modules, the producer checks the parameters, receives feedback, and uses the authentication options in the independent workplaces, which can provide impartial results. Based on this data, manufacturers can optimize their solutions and deliver the products to market, complying with not only their vision but mainly the needs of customers. This article describes how to verify the characteristics of the modules used in the construction of robotic wrist. It primarily focuses on verification of the accuracy of results and repeatability of position of the wrist on <b>output</b> <b>flange</b> end module. In addition, it presents the design of the testing stand and selection methodologies of measurement. The declared values are compared with the values measured during verification...|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{variations}} of the gearbox. There is a version for the cast-iron 4-cylinder engines of the 940 (redblock), the all aluminum 6-cylinder of the 960 (whiteblock), and the version for the Volkswagen 6-cylinder diesel engine D24TIC. The differences are the bell housing bolt pattern and the <b>output</b> shaft <b>flange</b> with a 3-bolt flange for the redblock/diesel engines and a 4 bolt flange for whiteblock engines.The variant for the 6-cylinder Volvo engine will fit on all 4/5/6 all-aluminum Volvo N/RN-series engines.|$|R
50|$|The MT75 {{has five}} speeds and reverse. This {{was the first}} Ford {{production}} gearbox to have a synchromesh on reverse (so reverse can be selected whilst in slight forward motion).The internal gear assembly in order {{from front to back}} as installed on the mainshaft is as follows: 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st, Reverse with 5th gear situated at the rear towards the <b>output</b> (propshaft <b>flange),</b> all gears are of a helical cut with the exception of reverse which is straight cut. Refined over time with slight improvement made to the synchro's phasing out single part synchromesh's on 1st & 2nd gear in favour of three part syncro's.|$|R
