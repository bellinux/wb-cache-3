40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{international}} evidence indicates that downsizing and related forms of organisational restructuring are having profound adverse effects on worker safety, health and wellbeing. In particular, evidence links downsizing to poorer mental health outcomes, including bullying {{and other forms of}} occupational violence.

This study shows that while Australian regulators are aware of the problems posed by downsizing they have made only modest efforts to pursue compliance with legislative duties, producing some guidance material that refers to restructuring and workloads and launching a small number of prosecutions. At the same time, there is an increased willingness to address staffing levels and other impacts of downsizing (like working in isolation). Employer and union responses were also examined. The article concludes by identifying a number of initiatives that would enable regulators, unions and employers to address the problems posed by downsizing more effectively...|$|E

In the thesis I deal with legal status of persons with disabilities and the instruments for protection and support {{in the area of}} employment. The thesis is divided into the introduction, nine chapters divided further into sub-chapters and sections, the conclusion and the annexes. The first chapter defines the term person with disability under international law, specifically in documents of International Labour Organisation, World Health Organisation, United Nations Organisation, Council of Europe, and under Czech legal system. In the second chapter I deal with the provisions of working conditions of persons with disabilities under the above international organisations.

In Europe, the European Union Directive 90 / 269 /EEC e Manual Handling of Loads sets out a hierarchy of measures aimed at reducing the risks of manual handling and training is one of the <b>obligations</b> <b>on</b> <b>employers.</b> This study involved a survey of current practices in relation to manual handling training and sought to identify components believed to be effective. One hundred and fifty telephone interviews were conducted with representatives from UK organisations and training consultancies across a wide range of industry sectors. The majority of participating employer organisations had undertaken some form of manual handling training in the previous 12 months. Responses indicated that induction of new staff and statutory requirements are the main drivers for manual handling training. The majority of organisations surveyed conduct in-house training rather than out sourcing training to consultants. Sickness absence is regarded as the main outcome measure of effectiveness. Survey respondents considered that manual handling training is more effective if it is tailored to specific industry and task demands. Practical elements in training were believed to reinforce learning, particularly if tailored to individual job demands. Understanding how training occurs at present and beliefs surrounding this are a valuable precursor to developing guiding principles for future manual handling training programmes. Relevance to industry: One ergonomic solution for safe manual handling is employee training. This study investigated current practice of manual handling training to reduce the risks of MSD...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The paper {{looks into}} the {{institutional}} factors that shape CSR adoption in the Russian energy industry. Underpinned by theoretical foundations, this paper helps to understand which of Scott’s (1995) three institutional pillars dominate the structuring of CSR in the Russian energy industry. CSR understanding depends heavily upon the institutional context of the countries (Kim et al. 2013). CSR is now employed internationally, facing various institutional contexts, with different cultures, regulations, norms and behaviours (Hira and Hira, 2000). Different motivational factors and value systems shape CSR internationally (Kim et al. 2013). Institutions are formal or informal rules, regulations, norms and understandings that constrain and enable behavior (North, 1990). This study employs neo-institutional theory to explore the specific factors that shape CSR {{in the context of}} the Russian energy industry. A neo-institutional framework provides an approach for the understanding different attitudes and practices in a specific social context (DiMaggio and Powell, 1991; Scott, 1995). The study is a detailed qualitative analysis of CSR in Russia, a country with different value and political systems from the U. S where CSR was initially developed (Campbell, 2007). This study employs the three ‘pillars of institutions’ regulative, normative and cognitive to identify pressures on CSR actions (Scott, 1995; Kostova and Roth, 2002). Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative research is appropriate for this study as it enables to develop a deep understanding of people’s hidden interpretation, motivations and understanding (Subhasis and Siva, 2014). Semi-structured interviews are conducted as it allows the employees to raise and discuss matters of importance to them (Denzin and Lincoln, 2005). Following Miles and Huberman (1994), qualitative content analysis technique is used to analyse the interviews to identify themes in the data. Preliminary Findings – The findings reveal so far that CSR practice in Russian is not related to any single institutional pressure. However, for a post-communist economy such as Russia, a regulation implementation might be weak and may not play an important role in forming CSR. In fact, the non-regulatory processes such as normative influence may have a greater impact instead. The companies have been under media pressure over the social and environmental consequences over the past several years. Companies need to meet expectations of internal stakeholders such as employees, and external such as community where the company wants to perform. Russia has a strong traditional ideology of collectivism, which places strong <b>obligations</b> <b>on</b> <b>employers</b> for their employees (Mamontov et al. 2014). Companies are expected to provide various social benefits to employees in terms of healthcare, education, housing. This is taken-for-granted common social belief, which is embedded in culture and specific for this particular context (Bashtovaya, 2014). This belief has been inherited from the communist era where companies were considered as ‘social caretakers’, constantly providing social benefits (Fifka and Pobizhan, 2014). This belief is culturally formed unlike the regulative and the normative pillars (Scott, 2008). Practical Implications – This paper offers an understanding on why Russian energy companies adopt CSR and what institutional factors shape their adoption. This sheds more light on institutional logics that underline CSR practices, and puts forward implications for managers and policy makers to construct more effective CSR strategies. In particular, this helps multinational companies to construct effective CSR strategies and not just adopt their CSR from home country. Value -This paper looks into institutional factors in particular, which of three institutional pillars seem more relevant in shaping CSR in the Russian energy industry. The theoretical contribution from this research is to neo-institutional theory and three pillars of institutions, and its application to understand CSR in the Russian context. Based on a wide range of literature review, I integrate literature on CSR, neo-institutional theory, and post-communist economy. Thus theoretically conceptualizing the effects of three institutional dimensions such as regulative, normative and cognitive on CSR at international level. Although prior literature suggests a connection between CSR and institutions, I attempt to extend the theoretical framework by looking at a new contextual environment. Crotty and Rodgers (2012) argue CSR research requires to be more contextualised by tacking into consideration characteristics of the country. I attempt to broaden the Western interpretation about CSR by considering the post-communist economy of the country. If contextualisation is not in place, than the type and nature of CSR undertaken in non-western contexts might be diminished and misinterpreted...|$|E

40|$|Local authorities, {{like most}} employers, are often {{asked to give}} {{references}} in respect of employees who are moving to new jobs. Whilst most still partake in this practice care needs to be taken. Bad references are becoming a growth area of litigation.

25|$|As {{with the}} right of freedom of assembly, there has not {{traditionally}} been positive protection {{of the right of}} freedom of association. The common law has recognised the autonomy of organisations in deciding their membership and legislation has not placed any general controls on the exercise of the right of association. The right is generally reflected in the principle of freedom of contract and the relative ease by which companies and trusts can be set up. The right is most regulated in the area of labour relations including the right to join a trade union which achieved statutory recognition in the Industrial Relations Act 1971, the right not to be dismissed or refused employment on the basis of non-membership under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 and the right to claim unfair dismissal on the basis of trade union activity. However, there is no <b>obligation</b> <b>on</b> <b>employers</b> to recognise collective bargaining agreements except in certain very limited circumstances and their role has declined significantly. The right to strike was acknowledged {{for the first time in}} March 2011 by the Court of Appeal. The right not to be unjustly excluded from the exercise of a trade or profession has been recognised by the courts, in a case brought by female horse trainer Florence Nagle against the Jockey Club's refusal to grant her a training licence on grounds of her sex.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 This {{dissertation}} scrutinises {{the impact}} of pregnancy challenges on the mining industry, taking the right of equality and unfair discrimination into consideration. Pre-employment pregnancy testing is an acceptable practice within the current legal framework whereby the MHSA and section 26 of the BCEA place an <b>obligation</b> <b>on</b> the <b>employer</b> to protect employees {{before and after the}} birth of a child. This section provides that no work may be performed by an employee that is hazardous to her health or the health of her unborn child. The dissertation synthesises and reviews the practical implications of pregnancy and related challenges of underground employees and all the problems surrounding this matter are dissected. The liability of the employer and the failure of the employee to report her pregnancy status to the employer as soon as she becomes aware of it, can be justifiably treated as misconduct. The justification of the dismissal of an underground employee based on pregnancy is confirmed in light of the legislative <b>obligations</b> placed <b>on</b> the <b>employer.</b> Current legislative measures, which justify an automatically unfair dismissal due to pregnancy, cannot be implemented without considering the Constitution and the employers’ right to economical sustainability. A literature study will be done using current and relevant sources such as books, legislation, court decisions, conference papers and journal articles. Methodological issues will also render it necessary to weigh up different rights through literature sources. Master...|$|R
40|$|The {{past two}} decades have {{witnessed}} a growing level of illegal immigration into Western Europe, North America, Australasia {{and parts of the}} Middle East and Asia. The employment of illegal immigrants (also known as 'undocumented workers'), or visitors working contrary to their visas, raises a series of policy issues – problems exacerbated by the fears and vulnerability of these workers. This paper examines {{the occupational safety and health}} and workers' compensation obligations of employers who engage illegal entrants, or persons working contrary to visa requirements, and the rights of those workers. While the primary focus of the paper is on the Australian experience, comparison is made to the situation in the USA and (to a lesser extent) Europe. Available evidence indicates that foreigners working illegally are more likely to be subjected to exploitative (in terms of wages and conditions) and unsafe employment practices. Although occupational safety and health statutes in Australia, and probably many other countries, impose an <b>obligation</b> <b>on</b> <b>employers</b> to safeguard all people on their premises, even if they are not employees (in the USA, the employer's duty is principally to protect employees), ensuring that illegal immigrants are protected effectively requires dedicated measures – something government agencies are only beginning to consider. Further, in Australia and the USA, employers may be liable to make workers' compensation payments to illegal workers (engaged contrary to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) or the Immigration Reform and Control Act 1986 respectively), although court decisions with regard to such claims are inconsistent and ambiguous. The paper concludes by identifying policy interventions that may remedy these problems...|$|R
40|$|The legal <b>obligation</b> <b>on</b> <b>employers</b> {{to provide}} {{information}} to employees has grown since the early 1970 s. At that time, the emphasis was on disclosure for collective bargaining. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, the emphasis shifted more to disclosure for joint consultation. In the context of new legislation, the possibility of further interventions from Europe, and a greater commitment to openness {{in other areas of}} company and public life, disclosure of information for collective bargaining and joint consultation at work is again on the agenda. This article focuses on disclosure for both of these processes. Disclosure for collective bargaining is the most developed and potentially significant area of the law from an industrial relations perspective. Disclosure for joint consultation, however, has been the most dynamic area in recent years. Voluntary information provision by firms has also been a significant part of developing human resource management practice. The paper therefore provides a broad examination of the law on disclosure. The UK provisions are conceptualised as constituting an agenda-driven disclosure model; i. e. the trigger for their use lies within the bargaining agenda. By contrast, the provisions stemming from European initiatives are event-driven; i. e. they are triggered by specific employer initiated events that affect employment contracts in other ways irrespective of the representative context. In the final sections, we attempt a broader evaluation of the intent and impact of the legislation and assess {{the pros and cons of}} the different approaches. Disclosure of information, collective bargaining, joint consultation...|$|R

50|$|In certain {{scheduled}} unhealthy industries, where {{certificates of}} authorization from local authorities must {{be obtained by}} intending occupiers, conditions of health and safety for workers can be laid down in the certificate. The Minister of the Interior is empowered to draw up regulations prohibiting or making conditions for the employment of young workers or women in dangerous or unhealthy industries. The provisions against truck cover not only all industrial workers engaged in manual labour under a contract with an employer, but also shopassistants; the special regulations against fines and deductions apply to factory workers and shops where at least 20 workers are employed. In mines under the law of 1884, which supplements the general mining law, employment of women and girls underground is prohibited; boys from 12 to 16 and girls from 12 to 18 may only be employed at light work above ground; 14 is the earliest age of admission for boys underground. The shifts from bank to bank must not exceed 12 hours, of which not more than to may be effective work. Sunday rest must begin not later than 6 A.M., and must be of 24 hours' duration. These last two provisions do not hold in case of pressing danger for safety, health or property. Sick and accident funds and mining associations are legislated for in minutest detail. The general law provides for safety in working, but special rules drawn up by the district authorities lay down in detail the conditions of health and safety. As regards manufacturing industry, the Industrial Code lays no <b>obligation</b> <b>on</b> <b>employers</b> to report accidents, and until the Accident Insurance Law of 1889 came into force no statistics were available. In Austria, unlike Germany, the factory inspectorate is organized throughout under a central chief inspector.|$|R
50|$|The Act {{replaced}} the previous legislation, largely removing voluntary adult (age 18 and over) prostitution from {{the criminal law}} {{and replacing it with}} civil law at both national and local level. A distinction was made between voluntary and involuntary prostitution. It remains a crime to coerce someone to provide sexual services. Sex work is also prohibited for those on temporary visas, and immigration for and investment in sex work is prohibited. Contracts between provider and client were recognised, and providers have the right to refuse services. Contested contracts can be referred to the Disputes Tribunal. Advertising is banned, with the exception of print media, which is restricted. The Summary Offences Act remains in force in relation to soliciting, which may be classed as offensive behaviour. The Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004 also allows sex workers to apply for previous convictions to be removed from the record. Sex work is recognised (but not promoted) as legitimate work by Work and Income New Zealand, who may not advertise vacancies in brothels or suggest people start sex work as a means of getting off a benefit. Now, workplace safety and health rules, developed in consultation with the prostitutes' collective, apply to sex work. Employment disputes can be referred to the Labour Inspectorate and Mediation Service. There is an <b>obligation</b> <b>on</b> <b>employers</b> and employees to practise and promote safe sexual practices. The Ministry of Health has the responsibility for enforcement. Registration of indoor sex workers with the police was replaced by certification at an administrative law level of brothel operators. Prior records have been destroyed. Refusal of a certificate is permitted for prior criminal offences (not necessarily related to prostitution). Police activities changed from the registration and prosecution of sex workers to protection. The Police Manual of Best Practice was amended to include prostitution.|$|R
