5|$|In 1970, Congress finally removed {{references}} to contraception from federal anti-obscenity laws; and in 1973, the Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion {{during the first}} trimester <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia {{has been}} linked to {{recurrent}} miscarriage, and possibly various complications <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> such as intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, severe pre-eclampsia and abruptio placentae.|$|E
5000|$|Worldwide, 38% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> were {{unintended}} in 1999 (some 80 million unintended pregnancies in 1999). [...] In {{developed world}} an estimated 49% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> were unintended, 36% {{in the developing}} world.|$|R
50|$|Under 49 days' gestational age, 60-80% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{will end}} with {{mifepristone}} alone; at any gestational age, 54-92% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> will end with mifepristone. There {{is no evidence}} that the effects of mifepristone can be reversed.|$|R
50|$|Note: Numbers {{and rates}} are for {{detected}} pregnancies. A large proportion <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> miscarry before {{the woman is}} aware <b>of</b> the <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|R
5|$|Toxemia <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{is common}} and kills many {{pregnant}} females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases. Pregnancy toxemia {{appears to be}} most common in hot climates. Other serious complications <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> can include a prolapsed uterus, hypocalcaemia, and mastitis.|$|E
5|$|While all {{methods of}} birth control have some {{potential}} adverse effects, the risk is less than that <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> After stopping or removing many methods {{of birth control}}, including oral contraceptives, IUDs, implants and injections, the rate <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> during the subsequent year {{is the same as}} for those who used no birth control.|$|E
5|$|Births occur year-round, with peaks between May and June in {{northern}} populations and between January and March in southern populations. Gestation appears to vary {{from four to}} twelve months, as the species is capable of delayed implantation followed by four months <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> In California, sea otters usually breed every year, about twice as often as those in Alaska.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} individual, household and community characteristics on two aspects of fertility among South African women [...] the age at first conception and the number <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> We find that education has a significant effect in pushing back the age at first conception and in reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> There is a thresh-hold level of education that must be attained before education starts delaying the age at first conception and the number <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> for each woman. Women who are currently enrolled in school have lower number <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Fertility cannot be examined in isolation of child mortality because child mortality can affect a woman's demand for birth by inducing her to replace her children who die. We therefore investigate the effect of child mortality on the number <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and find that {{while there is a}} replacement factor associated with fertility decisions the effect is not very strong when we make child mortality variables end [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In 2009, 23.2% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> in Serbia {{ended in}} abortion. The highest year on record was 1989, when 68% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> were terminated. As {{recently}} as 2006, Serbia {{continued to have}} {{the highest rate of}} abortions out of the former Yugoslav republics.|$|R
30|$|Expectant {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> <b>of</b> unknown {{location is}} safe when serum hCG and progesterone measurements are combined with serial TVS. This should {{not rule out}} performing a laparoscopy {{if there is a}} high index of suspicion <b>of</b> ectopic <b>pregnancy</b> based on clinical findings.|$|R
5|$|In addition, in at-risk pregnancies {{due to an}} {{affected}} male partner, non-invasive {{prenatal diagnosis}} can be performed by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA in a blood sample taken from the mother (via venipuncture) between six and twelve weeks <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> It has no procedure-related risk of miscarriage (excepting via needle contamination).|$|E
5|$|Non-reproductive health {{remains an}} {{important}} predictor of maternal health. In the United States, the {{leading causes of}} maternal death are cardiovascular disease (15% of deaths), endocrine, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, infection, hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> (Gronowski and Schindler, Table II).|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2017, Bevin signed two {{into law}} two bills restricting abortion, {{including}} one that banned abortions after the 20th week <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Prior to signing it, Bevin announced the 20-week ban {{would be the first}} of seven bills that day that he would sign.|$|E
50|$|Postterm {{pregnancy}} {{occurs in}} 3% to 12% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the United States and United Kingdom, 40% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> are {{unplanned}}, {{and between}} a quarter and half <b>of</b> those unplanned <b>pregnancies</b> were unwanted pregnancies.|$|R
50|$|Gestational {{diabetes}} affects 3-10% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> {{depending on}} the population studied.|$|R
5|$|The use of {{metformin}} {{during all}} parts <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> is controversial. One review {{found that when}} taken during pregnancy it reduces the number of complications during pregnancy and {{does not appear to}} cause developmental delays. Another review found good short term safety for both the mother and baby but unclear long term safety.|$|E
5|$|Anneli Sarah Alderton, aged 24, {{a mother}} of one who {{was also in the}} early stages <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> had been living in Colchester, Essex. Alderton {{disappeared}} on 3 December and was last seen on the 17.53 train from Harwich to Manningtree. Alderton got off the train at Manningtree at 18.15 before going on to Ipswich on another train, arriving at 18.43. Alderton's body was found on 10 December near Nacton, in woodland in front of Amberfield School.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include an upset stomach. More {{significant}} side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater {{among those who}} are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.|$|E
50|$|Parity is {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> carried to viable gestational age.|$|R
50|$|Postpartum {{depression}} is a {{moderate to severe}} depressive episode starting anytime during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. It occurs in 4-20% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> depending on its definition. In 38% of the cases of postpartum depression, women are still depressed 3 years postpartum. In 0.2% <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> postpartum depression leads to psychosis.|$|R

5|$|Congenital malformation, {{hereditary}} disorders, {{and acquired}} conditions can affect cerebellar structure and, consequently, cerebellar function. Unless the causative condition is reversible, {{the only possible}} treatment is to help people live with their problems. Visualization of the fetal cerebellum by ultrasound scan at 18 to 20 weeks <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{can be used to}} screen for fetal neural tube defects with a sensitivity rate of up to 99%.|$|E
5|$|During Maya's {{final year}} of high school, she worries {{that she might be}} a lesbian (which she equates with being a hermaphrodite), and initiates sexual {{intercourse}} with a teenage boy. She becomes pregnant, which on the advice of her brother, she hides from her family until her eighth month <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in order to graduate from high school. Maya gives birth {{at the end of the}} book.|$|E
5|$|Even mild or {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism {{leads to}} possible infertility and {{increased risk of}} miscarriage. Hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, even with limited or no symptoms, may {{increase the risk of}} pre-eclampsia, offspring with lower intelligence, and the risk of infant death around the time of birth. Women are affected by hypothyroidism in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies. Subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy has also been associated with gestational diabetes and birth of the baby before 37 weeks <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} number <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> on bone mineral density (BMD) in 320 post-menopausal women aged between 49 and 64 years. Cases were selected from people with similar lifestyles and stratified into five groups according to the number <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Each group was divided into two subgroups according to the duration of the menopause (3 – 5 years versus 6 – 10 years). Lumbar (L 2 – L 4) and femoral neck BMD were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and T-score values were used in the statistical evaluation. No significant difference was found between the number <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and BMD within each group based on the same menopause duration, but a significant correlation was found in most groups based on menopause duration: T-scores decreased as menopause duration increased. Changes in BMD are likely to be related to menopause duration, rather than the number <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{pregnancy}} {{the maternal}} immune {{system has to}} coordinate uterine spiral-artery remodelling, trophoblast invasion, and acceptance of the semi-allogenic fetus simultaneously. As dysregulation {{of the immune system}} is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, we analysed first-trimester deciduas <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> for immune parameters in later complicated pregnancies. Higher IL 6 and macrophage mRNA expression, and lower ratios of regulatory macrophages were found in first-trimester deciduas <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> later complicated with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Lower Gata 3 (Th 2) mRNA expression was found in deciduas <b>of</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with later foetal growth restriction. Our results suggest that adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with immunological disturbances in first-trimester deciduas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of bipolar disorder. Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression. The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li+. They may increase the risk of developing Ebstein's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take lithium during the first trimester <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
