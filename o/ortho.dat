5|$|The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and <b>ortho</b> H2 {{increases}} with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H2 contains {{large quantities of}} the high-energy <b>ortho</b> form that converts to the para form very slowly. The ortho/para ratio in condensed H2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from <b>ortho</b> to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.|$|E
5|$|When {{both the}} <b>ortho</b> {{positions}} on the benzene ring are blocked, a second ortho-Claisen rearrangement will occur. This para-Claisen rearrangement ends with the tautomerization to a tri-substituted phenol.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 {{publications}} Birch {{collaborated with}} Leo Radom {{in a study}} that concluded that electron densities at the <b>ortho</b> and meta positions to be close with a slight <b>ortho</b> preference, but with mixtures of <b>ortho</b> and meta protonation occurring. RHF/sto-3g and UHF/sto-3g computations were used to conclude that both <b>ortho</b> and meta substitutions would occur with a slight preference for <b>ortho.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ordinary electrophilic substitutions with an {{activating}} group show {{preference for}} both the <b>ortho</b> and para position, this reaction demonstrates increased regioselectivity because the <b>ortho</b> position alone is targeted.|$|E
25|$|Copper-promoted {{nucleophilic}} aromatic substitution. Electronegative {{groups in}} the <b>ortho</b> position of the aryl halogen are strongly activated toward these reactions. On the other hand, this reaction is inhibited by the steric hindrance provided by bulky groups on <b>ortho</b> positions of the aryl groups.|$|E
25|$|Nearly {{simultaneously}} with him, William Pollack, then of <b>Ortho</b> Pharmaceutical Corporation, and researchers John Gorman and Vincent Freda of New York City's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center,-Globulin Antibody Preparation: A Preliminary Report |journal=Transfusion |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.1964.tb02824.x }} having {{come to the}} same realization, set out to prove it by injecting a group of male prisoners at Sing Sing Correctional Facility with antibody provided by <b>Ortho,</b> obtained by a fractionation technique developed by Pollack (who also provided Finn with several vials of antibody during a visit by Finn to <b>Ortho).</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{both the}} Lewis acidity of the organolithium {{compound}} and the Lewis basicity of the substituent are high, as in lithiations of ortho-(dialkylamino)methyl toluenes with n-butyllithium in a non-coordinating solvent, coordination {{of the base}} to the heteroatom substituent takes place. Lithiation then occurs at the most kinetically accessible <b>ortho</b> benzylic position; <b>ortho</b> lithiation is slower in this case.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the same}} {{catalyst}} system directing groups {{can be employed}} to achieve regioselectivity without substituents as steric mediators. For example, Boebel and Hartwig reported a method to conduct ortho-borylation where a dimethyl-hydrosilyl directing group on the arene undergoes iridium catalyzed borylation at the C–H bond <b>ortho</b> to the silane directing group. Selectivity for the <b>ortho</b> position {{in the case of}} using hydrosilyl directing groups has been attributed to reversible addition of the Si-H bond to the metal center, leading to preferential cleavage of the C–H bond <b>ortho</b> to the hydrosilyl substituent. Several other strategies to achieve ortho-borylation of arenes have been developed using various directing groups.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been found that the <b>Ortho</b> Evra patch is less {{effective}} in women over 198 pounds (90kg).|$|E
25|$|The {{general rule}} for {{aromatic}} substitution is: <b>ortho</b> > meta > para. This gives non-selective β-blockers. Large para-substituents usually decrease activity but large ortho-groups retain some activity. Polysubstitution on carbon 2 and 6 makes the compound inactive {{but when the}} substitution is on carbon 3 and 5 there's some activity. For the highest cardioselectivity, the substituents should be as following: para > meta > <b>ortho.</b> All the β-blockade is in one isomer, (S)-aryloxypropylamine and (R)-ethanolamine.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{side effect}} {{information}} {{is provided in}} the <b>Ortho</b> Evra label information and the Evra Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and PIL.|$|E
25|$|However, textbooks, {{publishing}} on {{the mechanism}} of the Birch Reduction, have noted that <b>ortho</b> protonation of the initial radical anion is preferred.|$|E
25|$|If an {{aldehyde}} or {{carboxylic acid}} occupies the <b>ortho</b> or para positions, the allyl side-chain displaces the group, releasing it as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, respectively.|$|E
25|$|For example, in a {{multiple}} addition of ethyl bromide to benzene, <b>ortho</b> and para substitution is expected {{after the first}} monosubstitution step because an alkyl group is an activating group. However, the actual reaction product is 1,3,5-triethylbenzene with all alkyl groups as a meta substituent. Thermodynamic reaction control makes sure that thermodynamically favored meta substitution with steric hindrance minimized takes prevalence over less favorable <b>ortho</b> and para substitution by chemical equilibration. The ultimate reaction product is thus {{the result of a}} series of alkylations and dealkylations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ortho</b> Evra {{contraceptive}} {{patch and}} the Evra contraceptive patch are both intended to gradually release into the systemic circulation approximately 20µg/day of ethinylestradiol and 150µg/day of norelgestromin.|$|E
25|$|Detections of c-C3H2 in the ISM rely on {{observations}} of molecular transitions using rotational spectroscopy. Since c-C3H2 is an asymmetric top, the rotational energy levels are split and the spectrum becomes complicated. Also, {{it should be}} noticed that C3H2 has spin isomers much like the spin isomers of hydrogen. These <b>ortho</b> and para forms exist in a 3:1 ratio and should {{be thought of as}} distinct molecules. Although the <b>ortho</b> and para forms look identical chemically, the energy levels are different, meaning that the molecules have different spectroscopic transitions.|$|E
25|$|Janssen Biotech, Inc., {{formerly}} known as Centocor Biotech, Inc., is a biotechnology company that was founded in Philadelphia in 1979. In 1982, Centocor transitioned into a publicly traded company. In 1999, Centocor became a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Since the acquisition, Janssen Biotech increased its annual sales from $500 million to more than $2 billion. During the same period, research and development investment increased from $75 million to more than $300 million. In 2008, Centocor, Inc. and <b>Ortho</b> Biotech Inc. merged to form Centocor <b>Ortho</b> Biotech Inc. In June 2010, Centocor <b>Ortho</b> Biotech acquired RespiVert, a privately held drug discovery company focused on developing small-molecule, inhaled therapies {{for the treatment of}} pulmonary diseases. In June 2011, Centocor <b>Ortho</b> Biotech changed its name to Janssen Biotech, Inc. as part of a global effort to unite the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies around the world under a common identity. In December 2014, the company announced it would co-develop MacroGenics cancer drug candidate (MGD011) which targets both CD19 and CD3 proteins in treating B-cell malignant tumours. This could net MacroGenics up to $700 million. In January 2015, the company announced it will utilise Isis Pharmaceuticals' RNA-targeting technology to discover and develop antisense drugs targeting autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, with the partnership potentially generating up to $835 million for Isis.|$|E
25|$|Burnham in 1969 {{concluded}} that protonation {{is unlikely to}} occur predominantly at the <b>ortho</b> position and the reaction most probably occurs at the meta position but may occur at both sites at similar rates.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule the regioselectivity {{is in favor of}} the <b>ortho</b> adduct {{at the expense of the}} meta adduct when the amount of charge {{transfer}} taking place in the exciplex increases.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} source of phosphoric acid is an 85% aqueous solution; such {{solutions}} are colourless, odourless, and non-volatile. The 85% solution is a syrupy liquid, but still pourable. Although phosphoric acid {{does not meet}} the strict definition of a strong acid, the 85% solution is acidic enough to be corrosive. Because of the high percentage of phosphoric acid in this reagent, {{at least some of the}} orthophosphoric acid is condensed into polyphosphoric acids; for the sake of labeling and simplicity, the 85% represents H3PO4 as if it were all in the <b>ortho</b> form. Dilute aqueous solutions of phosphoric acid exist in the <b>ortho</b> form.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} adverse events reported while using the <b>Ortho</b> Evra / Evra patch were: breast discomfort, engorgement or pain (22%), headache (21%), application site reaction (17%), nausea (17%), {{upper respiratory tract}} infection (10%), menstrual cramps (10%), and abdominal pain (9%).|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in the chemical literature is now only of historical significance. Indeed, some further computational results have been reported, which vary from suggesting a preference for meta radical-anion protonation to suggesting a mixture of <b>ortho</b> and meta protonation.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 and 1993 an esoteric {{test was}} devised {{which showed that}} <b>ortho</b> {{protonation}} of the radical anion was preferred over meta (seven to one). This was accompanied by more modern computation which concurred. Both experiment and computations were {{in agreement with the}} early 1961 computations.|$|E
25|$|The only {{currently}} available contraceptive patches are Xulane in the United States (after <b>Ortho</b> Evra, marketed by Ortho-McNeil was discontinued), and Evra, marketed in Canada by Janssen-Ortho {{and in the}} United Kingdom and other countries by Janssen-Cilag. The patches are packaged in boxes of three and are only available by prescription.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 {{a simple}} {{computation}} {{of the electron}} densities of the radical anion revealed {{that it was the}} <b>ortho</b> site which was most negative and thus most likely to protonate. Additionally, the second protonation was determined computationally to occur {{in the center of the}} cyclohexadienyl anion to give an unconjugated product.|$|E
25|$|In another {{application}} DOM {{is applied}} in placing a bulky tert-butyl group in an <b>ortho</b> position (scheme 4). The lithiation is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution {{and the subsequent}} reaction to the sulfoxide an electrophilic aromatic substitution. In the final step tert-butyllithium acts as a nucleophile in another nucleophilic aromatic substitution through an anionic intermediate.|$|E
25|$|Directed <b>ortho</b> metalation (DoM) is an {{adaptation}} of electrophilic aromatic substitution in which electrophiles attach themselves exclusively to the ortho- position of a direct metalation group or DMG through the intermediary of an aryllithium compound. The DMG interacts with lithium through a hetero atom. Examples of DMG's are the methoxy group, a tertiary amine group and an amide group.|$|E
25|$|Then in 1990 and 1993 {{a method}} was finally devised to {{experimentally}} assess whether the anisole and toluene radical anion protonated <b>ortho</b> or meta. The esoteric method {{began with the}} premise that the isotope selectivity in protonation in a protium–deuterium medium would be greater for the radical anion, of the first protonation step, than for the carbanion of the penultimate step. The reasoning was that carbanions are much more basic than the corresponding radical anions and thus will react more exothermically and less selectively in protonation. Experimentally it was determined that less deuterium at the <b>ortho</b> site than meta resulted (1:7) for a variety of methoxylated aromatics. This is a consequence of the greater selectivity of the radical anion protonation. Computations (e.g. ROHF/6-31g) of the electron densities concurred with the experimental observations. Also, it was ascertained that frontier orbital densities did not, and these had been used in some previous reports.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{combined}} hormonal contraceptives, <b>Ortho</b> Evra / Evra works {{primarily by}} preventing ovulation. A secondary {{mechanism of action}} is inhibition of sperm penetration by changes in the cervical mucus. Hormonal contraceptives also have effects on the endometrium that theoretically could affect implantation; however, no scientific evidence indicates that prevention of implantation actually results from their use.|$|E
25|$|Breakthrough {{bleeding}} and/or spotting {{while using}} the <b>Ortho</b> Evra / Evra patch was reported by: 18% in cycle 1, 12% in cycle 3, 8% in cycle 6 and cycle 13. Breakthrough bleeding (requiring {{more than one}} pad or tampon per day) was reported by: 4% in cycle 1, 3% in cycle 3 and cycle 6, and 1% in cycle 13.|$|E
25|$|In {{three large}} {{clinical}} trials involving {{a total of}} 3,330 women using the <b>Ortho</b> Evra / Evra patch for up to one year, 12% of users discontinued the patch because of adverse events. The most frequent adverse events leading to patch discontinuation were: nausea and/or vomiting (2.4%), application site reaction (1.9%), breast discomfort, engorgement or pain (1.9%), headache (1.1%), and emotional lability (1.0%).|$|E
25|$|The {{systematic}} name of pyridine, within the Hantzsch–Widman nomenclature {{recommended by the}} IUPAC, is azine. However, {{systematic name}}s for simple compounds are used very rarely; instead, heterocyclic nomenclature follows historically established common names. IUPAC discourages the use of azine in favor of pyridine. The numbering of the ring atoms in pyridine starts at the nitrogen (see infobox). An allocation of positions by letter of the Greek alphabet (α-γ) and the substitution pattern nomenclature common for homoaromatic systems (<b>ortho,</b> meta, para) are used sometimes. Here α (<b>ortho),</b> β (meta), and γ (para) refer to the 2, 3, and 4 position, respectively. The systematic name for the pyridine derivatives is pyridinyl, wherein {{the position of the}} substituted atom is preceded by a number. However, here again the historical name pyridyl is encouraged by the IUPAC and used instead of the systematic name. The cationic derivative formed by the addition of an electrophile to the nitrogen atom is called pyridinium.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid has {{the formula}} C6H4(OH)COOH, where the OH group is <b>ortho</b> to the {{carboxyl}} group. It {{is also known}} as 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is poorly soluble in water (2 g/L at 20°C). Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) can be prepared by the esterification of the phenolic hydroxyl group of salicylic acid with the acetyl group from acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. Salicylic acid can also be prepared using the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction.|$|E
25|$|When observing c-C3H2 in the {{interstellar}} medium, {{there are only}} certain transitions that can be seen. In general, only a few lines are available for use in astronomical detection. Many lines are unobservable because they are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. The only lines that can be observed are those that fall in the radio window. The more commonly observed lines are the 110 to 101 transition at 18343MHz and the 212 to 101 transition at 85338MHz of <b>ortho</b> c-C3H2.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} the {{catalytic}} cycle is shown below for the <b>ortho</b> borylation of hydrosilane compounds. Kinetic data show that an observed trisboryl complex coordinated to cyclooctene rapidly and reversibly dissociates cyclooctene to form a 16 electron trisboryl complex. In the case of using benzyldimethylsilane as a directing group it is proposed that benzyldimethylsilane reacts with the trisboryl iridium catalyst through reversible addition of the Si-H bond to the metal center, followed by selective ortho-C–H bond activation via oxidative addition and reductive elimination.|$|E
25|$|One {{explanation}} for the increased acidity over alcohols is resonance stabilization of the phenoxide anion by the aromatic ring. In this way, the negative charge on oxygen is delocalized on to the <b>ortho</b> and para carbon atoms. In another explanation, increased acidity {{is the result of}} orbital overlap between the oxygen's lone pairs and the aromatic system. In a third, the dominant effect is the induction from the sp2 hybridised carbons; the comparatively more powerful inductive withdrawal of electron density that is provided by the sp2 system compared to an sp3 system allows for great stabilization of the oxyanion.|$|E
