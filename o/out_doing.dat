25|$|He {{is perhaps}} the most {{influential}} character in films that explore archaeology. Since the release of Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981, the very idea of archaeology and archaeologists has fundamentally shifted. Prior to the film's release, the stereotypical image of an archaeologist was that of an older, lacklustre professor type. In the early years of films involving archaeologists, they were portrayed as victims who would need to be rescued by a more masculine or heroic figure. Following 1981, the stereotypical archaeologist is thought of as a male bull whip wielding adventurer and Ivy League professor. The stereotypical image of an archaeologist is also portrayed as an individual usually <b>out</b> <b>doing</b> fieldwork, which is not always the case.|$|E

Following her 2001 appearance on Rikets tilstand, she was offered a job with TV 2, Norway's second largest broadcaster. She made a short appearance, as herself, in an episode of the comedy television series Uti vår hage, shown on Norwegian television in March 2008.

25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is <b>out</b> <b>doing</b> or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do or say will be good enough or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are feeling so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E

While talking to a police officer, Mars reportedly declared that {{what he did was}} [...] "foolish" [...] and that [...] "he has never used drugs before." [...] Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and in return was told that the charges would be erased from his criminal record as long as he stayed out of trouble for a year. He paid a $2,000 fine, did 200 hours of community service, and completed a drug counseling course. Nevertheless, in a cover story for GQ magazine in 2013, Mars said [...] "I was young, man! I was in f---ing Vegas...I wasn't thinking", he added: [...] "I was given a number one record and I'm <b>out</b> <b>doing</b> dumb sh--." [...] Mars confessed that he lied to the authorities about having done cocaine before, saying [...] "I don't know where that came from", adding: [...] "I was really intoxicated. I was really drunk.

[...] "It took quite a long time", Iommi said. [...] "We were getting really drugged <b>out,</b> <b>doing</b> a lot of dope. We'd {{go down to the}} sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day." [...] The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's [...] "unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse." [...] The album featured the singles [...] "Never Say Die" [...] and [...] "Hard Road", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK. The band also made their second appearance on Top of the Pops, performing [...] "Never Say Die". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US.|$|E
500|$|According to Joseph, [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is thematically {{similar to}} [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] (1999) and [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), from the Destiny's Child era. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] celebrates showing off. Jon Pareles of The New York Times viewed {{the concept of}} the song as not merely having a nice {{wardrobe}} to entice men, but it also serves as [...] "a means of self-assertion." [...] In the song, the female protagonist pulls out her best dress to remind her potentially wandering mate of what he is leaving at home. Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly added that Beyoncé also seemingly gives professional advice to women on how to hold a man's attention in a long-term relationship. She sings: [...] "I think I'm ready/ Been locked up in the house way too long / It's time to get it, cause once again he's <b>out</b> <b>doing</b> wrong [...] Wear very skimpy clothes...". Joseph commented that in the song, Beyoncé is capable of wearing anything to keep her man by her side rather than dumping him. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that after having skirted her best dress, Beyoncé eyes other guys in dance clubs to make her own man jealous, in the hope of regaining his attention but she also makes sure that he really pays when he does her wrong. Beyoncé later refers to her [...] "freakum dress" [...] in [...] "Jealous", a track from her fifth studio album Beyoncé (2013).|$|E
500|$|Despite this, member Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes was the opposite. She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going <b>out</b> <b>doing</b> the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I say just leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess we told you how to [...] We were really happy and we still are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E
