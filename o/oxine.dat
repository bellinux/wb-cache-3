J NucÃ-Med 20 : 1181 - 1188, 1979 The in vivo localization of Tc- 99 m-labeled radio-pharmaceuticals is based on the ability of specific organs to remove foreign substances from the blood. It could be anticipated that Tc- 99 m, {{for which there is no}} known metabolic requirement, would be most readily handled by one of the body's detoxification mechanisms. It is perhaps for this reason that Tc- 99 m radiopharmaceu-ticals have been most successful in the examination of the various elimination mechanisms of the liver, lungs, and kidneys. Attempts to design Tc- 99 m-labeled ra-diopharmaceuticals for imaging the nonexcretory organs have been less successful.

Because of the physical char-acteristics of In- 111, in vivo studies of temporal and spatial distribution and deposition can be performed using In- 11 l-labeled platelets (2 - 7). The determi-nation o platelet survival with ln- 111 -labeled pla-telets has been reported (3. 8, 9). Several investigators have suggested that the la-beling of platelets with ln- 111 <b>oxine</b> must be per-formed in a plasma-free medium (1, 10) because of possible interference by plasma transferrin. Trans-ferrin is known to have a high affinity for indium cations (//) and indium <b>oxine</b> is a rather weak com-plex compared with indium transferrin (12,J 3). On the other hand, it is well established that autologous plasma is the best medium for suspension of pla...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} based on {{catalytic}} current in differential pulse polarogrms {{in a medium}} containing chlorate and -hydroxyquinoline (<b>oxine)</b> is described for the determination of tungsten. Experimental conditions such as pH and the composition of supporting electrolyte are optimized to get a linear calibration graph and also to lower the detection limit. The influence of possible interferences on the catalytic current has been investigated. The mechanism of the electrode process Is studied using DPP diagnostic criteria...|$|E
