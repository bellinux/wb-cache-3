40|$|The {{number and}} costs {{associated}} with reported sharps injuries in Swedish hospitals and the potential cost offset by introducing safety devices with needle and syringe was estimated from a health care perspective. Data about reported sharps injuries were collected from infection control nurses at 18 Swedish hospitals and information about the procedures following such injuries from doctors at Swedish hospitals and published articles. Unit costs were derived from the Southern Regional Health Care Board, SEK 2007. On average, 3. 14 injuries per 100 full-time equivalent positions are reported annually in Swedish health care. Approximately 60 % involves hollow-bore needles. The cost of occupational sharps injuries in Sweden was estimated at euro 1. 8 million (SEK 16. 3 million) or euro 272 (SEK 2513) per reported injury, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>euro</b> 1 million was for hollow-bore sharps injuries. The expected number of injuries that could be avoided by introducing safety devices was estimated at 3125 injuries and the corresponding expected cost offset at euro 850, 000. Most costs are associated with investigation as opposed to treatment. The cost per reported injury in Sweden seems to be lower than in other EU countries and the US, due to more thorough investigation and treatment procedures in countries with confirmed transmission of pathogens to healthcare workers...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the social/economic costs and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in eight EU member states. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with EB from Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Data on demographic characteristics, health resource utilisation, informal care, labour productivity losses, and HRQOL were collected from the questionnaires completed by patients or their caregivers. HRQOL was measured with the EuroQol 5 -domain (EQ- 5 D) questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 204 patients completed the questionnaire. Average annual costs varied from country to country, and ranged from euro 9509 to euro 49, 233 (reference year 2012). Estimated direct healthcare costs ranged from euro 419 to euro 10, 688; direct non-healthcare costs ranged from euro 7449 to euro 37, 451 and labour productivity losses ranged from euro 0 to euro 7259. The average annual cost per patient across all countries was estimated at euro 31, 390, out <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>euro</b> 5646 accounted for direct health costs (18. 0 %), euro 23, 483 accounted for direct non-healthcare costs (74. 8 %), and euro 2261 accounted for indirect costs (7. 2 %). Costs were shown to vary across patients with different disability but also between children and adults. The mean EQ- 5 D score for adult EB patients was estimated at between 0. 49 and 0. 71 and the mean EQ- 5 D visual analogue scale score was estimated at between 62 and 77. CONCLUSION: In addition to its negative impact on patient HRQOL, our study indicates the substantial social/economic burden of EB in Europe, attributable mostly to high direct non-healthcare costs.
