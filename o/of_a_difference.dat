Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may have felt that if he did not attend he could appear to be hiding.

25|$|There is much {{documentation}} of the history and necessity of the Declaration of Helsinki. The first code of conduct for research including medical ethics was the Nuremberg Code.

25|$|Controversy erupted at the Women's Gymnastics All-Around final, when gymnast after gymnast {{fell on the}} vault. Some gymnasts were {{physically}} injured, and all were shaken, but nothing was done to try to discover the reason most gymnasts were having severe problems. Finally, {{in the middle of}} the third round (out of four), it was determined that the vault horse had been set 5cm too low– enough <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> to throw off the impeccable timing of many of these world-class athletes. While athletes were allowed to vault again, the remedy did not fully repair injuries and shaken confidence. This situation led directly to the elimination of Svetlana Khorkina from consideration as the top all-around gymnast. The medals were eventually all won by Romanian gymnasts, with Andreea Raducan becoming the first athlete from her country to win the title since Nadia Comaneci in 1976. Teammates Simona Amanar and Maria Olaru took silver and bronze, respectively. This result also marked the first sweep of the event since the Soviet Union's in 1960.|$|E

25|$|In general, sexual {{dimorphism}} can {{be attributed}} to greater intraspecific competition in one sex, either between rivals for access to mates and/or to be chosen by mates. This may stem from the other gender being constrained by providing greater parental investment, in terms of factors such as gamete production, gestation, lactation, or upbringing of young. Although there is much variation in species, generally the more physically aggressive sex is the male, particularly in mammals. In species where parental care by both sexes is required, there tends to be less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference.</b> When the female can leave the male to care for the offspring, then females may be the larger and more physically aggressive. Competitiveness despite parental investment has also been observed in some species. A related factor is the rate at which males and females are able to mate again after producing offspring, and the basic principles of sexual selection are also influenced by ecological factors affecting the ways or extent to which one sex can compete for the other. The role of such factors in human evolution is controversial.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Justice Ajit Nath Ray dissented and gave reasons for rejecting the basic {{features}} doctrine. He stated {{that since the}} Constitution {{is the source of}} all legal validity and is itself always valid, a constitutional amendment, being part of the Constitution itself, will also always be valid. The power to amend the Constitution is wide and unlimited, and there is neither a distinction nor any possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between essential and non-essential features of the Constitution that may impede amendment. In fact, if Parliament's power to amend is extinguished because of essential features that are not expressly defined in the Constitution, the courts would be creating a new constitution. Justice Ray presented other problems of the basic features doctrine, criticizing it as being uncertain in scope. Without an evident definition of what the basic features are, the task of trying to amend the Constitution becomes unpredictable. In his view, all the provisions of the Constitution are essential but this does not prohibit them from being amendable.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{three years}} after his {{departure}} and one hour after he left, the Doctor returned to the Greenpeace rally. With Sam collected, the pair spent a great period wandering together, facing dozens of adventures. During their travels, Sam and the Doctor became aware of a great War, looming {{in the future of}} Gallifrey – a war between the Time Lords and an as-yet-unidentified Enemy, with dramatic and disturbing consequences. While exploring the subject, the Doctor discovered that his Sam was not the original Samantha Jones; rather, her biodata had been manipulated by an outside agency with the intent to mould her into a prosaic distraction for him (Alien Bodies). Ultimately this plan proved a failure, as Sam developed into a much more strongly-willed companion than intended; at one point she spent three years avoiding the Doctor, so as to cope with a crush she had developed on him, but managed to survive and make a good life for herself in the future until she rejoined the Doctor as she could make more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> with him.|$|E

500|$|Highlighting Ion Creangă's {{recourse}} to the particularities of Moldavian regionalisms and archaisms, their accumulation making Creangă's work {{very difficult to}} translate, George Călinescu reacted against claims that the narratives reflected antiquating patterns. He concluded that, in effect, Creangă's written language {{was the equivalent of}} a [...] "glossological museum", and even contrasted by the writer's more modern everyday parlance. Also discussing the impression that Creangă's work should be read with a Moldavian accent, noted for its [...] "softness of sound" [...] in relation to standard Romanian phonology, Călinescu cautioned against interpretative exaggerations, maintaining that the actual texts only offer faint suggestions of regional pronunciation. Contrasting Creangă with the traditions of literature produced by Wallachians in what became the standard literary language, Călinescu also argued in favor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in mentality: the [...] "balance" [...] evidenced by Moldavian speech and illustrated in Ion Creangă's writings is contrasted by the [...] "discoloration and roughness" [...] of [...] "Wallachianism". He also criticized those views according to which Creangă's variant of the literary language was [...] "beautiful", since it failed to [...] "please everyone on account of some acoustical beauty", and since readers from outside the writer's native area could confront it [...] "with some irritation." [...] For Călinescu, the result nevertheless displays [...] "an enormous capacity of authentic speech", also found in the works of Caragiale and, in the 20th century, Mihail Sadoveanu. According to the same commentator, the dialectical interventions formed a background to a lively vocabulary, a [...] "hermetic" [...] type of [...] "argot", which contained [...] "hilarious double entendres and indecent onomatopoeia", passing from [...] "erudite beauty" [...] to [...] "obscene laughter". Some of the expressions characteristic of Creangă's style are obscure in meaning, and some other, such as [...] "drought made the snake scream inside the frog's mouth", appear to be spontaneous and nonsensical. Another specific trait of this language, commented upon by Vianu's and compared by him to the aesthetics of Classicism, sees much of Creangă's prose being set to a discreet poetic meter.|$|E
