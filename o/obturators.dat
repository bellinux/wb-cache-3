30|$|There is a terminological {{diversity}} {{in defining the}} atypical vessels in the <b>obturator</b> area. Some authors define as <b>obturator</b> any vessel entering the <b>obturator</b> canal, regardless of its origin, irrespective of its drainage [2 – 4]. Von Lanz and Wachsmuth term the veins passing through the <b>obturator</b> canal and draining into the external iliac system, “vv. comitantes” [5]. Berberoğlu et al. term accessory <b>obturator</b> artery/vein any anatomical variant of an <b>obturator</b> vessel, arising from the external iliac system [6]. Other authors prefer the term aberrant <b>obturator</b> vessel, used to denote any abnormal deviation [7 – 9]. Rusu et al. perceive the accessory as additional to another existing <b>obturator</b> vein, respectively artery [1]. According to them, {{in the absence of}} another <b>obturator</b> vessel, the only one available is the <b>obturator</b> artery, respectively vein, regardless of its origin and drainage. The term “aberrant <b>obturator</b> artery, respectively vein”, describes the atypical course of the blood vessel and in this sense, an <b>obturator</b> vessel can be aberrant, whether arising either from the external iliac circulatory system, or entering atypically the <b>obturator</b> canal.|$|R

5000|$|A sabot (UK and Int.: , [...] ), (US: [...] ) is a {{structural}} device used in firearm or cannon ammunition {{to keep a}} sub-caliber flight projectile, such as a relatively small bullet or arrow-type projectile, {{in the center of}} the barrel when fired, if the bullet has a significantly smaller diameter than the bore diameter of the weapon used. The sabot component in projectile design is more than simply the relatively thin, tough and deformable seal known as a driving band or obturation ring needed to trap propellant gases behind a projectile, and also keep the projectile centered in the barrel, when the outer shell of the projectile is only slightly smaller in diameter than the caliber of the barrel. Driving bands and <b>obturators</b> are used to seal these full-bore projectiles in the barrel because of manufacturing tolerances; there always exists some gap between the projectile outer diameter and the barrel inner diameter, usually a few thousandths of an inch; enough of a gap for high pressure gasses to slip by during firing. Driving bands and obturator rings are made from material that will deform and seal the barrel as the projectile is forced from the chamber into the barrel. Small caliber jacketed bullets do not normally employ driving bands or <b>obturators</b> because the jacket material, for example copper or gilding metal, is deformable enough to serve that function, and the bullet is made slightly larger than the barrel for that purpose, (see Full metal jacket bullet and driving band). Sabots certainly use driving bands and <b>obturators,</b> because the same manufacturing tolerance issues exist when sealing the saboted projectile in the barrel, but the sabot itself is a more substantial structural component of the in-bore projectile configuration (Drysdale 1978). [...] Refer to the two APFSDS (Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot) pictures on the right to see the substantial material nature of a sabot to fill the bore diameter around the sub-caliber arrow-type flight projectile, compared to the very small gap sealed by a driving band or obturator to mitigate what is known classically as windage. More detailed cutaways of the internal structural complexity of advanced APFSDS saboted long rod penetrator projectiles can be found at reference 2.|$|E

30|$|Due to {{conceptual}} {{differences in}} terminology, “aberrant <b>obturator</b> artery/vein” was used.

The <b>obturator</b> vessels below the <b>obturator</b> nerve were not always completely dissected, and {{it was impossible to}} determine whether the vessel was accessory in relation to another <b>obturator</b> vessel.

50|$|Palatal <b>obturators</b> {{are not to}} be {{confused}} with palatal lifts or other prosthetic devices. A palatal obturator may be used in cases of a deficiency in tissue, when a remaining opening in the palate occurs. In some cases it may be downsized gradually so that tissue can strengthen over time and compensate for the decreasing size of the obturator. The palatal lift however, is used when there is not enough palatal movement. It raises the palate and reduces the range of movement necessary to provide adequate closure to separate the nasal cavity from the oral cavity. Speech bulbs and palatal lifts aid in velopharyngeal closure and do not obturate a fistula. A speech bulb, yet another type of prosthetic device often confused with a palatal obturator, contains a pharyngeal section, which goes behind the soft palate.|$|E
5000|$|A palatal {{obturator}} is a prosthesis that totally occludes {{an opening}} {{such as an}} oronasal fistula (in {{the roof of the}} mouth). They are similar to dental retainers, but without the front wire. Palatal <b>obturators</b> are typically short-term prosthetics used to close defects of the hard/soft palate that may affect speech production or cause nasal regurgitation during feeding. Following surgery, there may remain a residual orinasal opening on the palate, alveolar ridge, or vestibule of the larynx. A palatal obturator may be used to compensate for hypernasality and to aid in speech therapy targeting correction of compensatory articulation caused by the cleft palate. In simpler terms, a palatal obturator covers any fistulas (or [...] "holes") in the roof of the mouth that lead to the nasal cavity, providing the wearer with a plastic/acrylic, removable roof of the mouth, which aids in speech, eating, and proper air flow.|$|E

50|$|Like all {{standing}} balance asanas, ardha chandrasana {{offers many}} benefits related to focus and proprioception, and strengthening of hip and knee muscles. This asana is particularly {{beneficial to the}} external rotators and stabilizers of the hip including gluteus medius and minimus, <b>obturators</b> (external and internal) and gemelli (inferior and superior). Abduction of the hip is achieved through concentric contraction of tensor fascia latae, gluteus medius and minimus on both legs (lifting one and stabilizing the other). Both legs engage articularis genu, hip flexors and quadriceps to maintain leg extension,to relax,help in improvement in sports, while the supporting leg stretches the gastrocnemius, hamstrings and gluteus maximus. Upper body stability is achieved {{by a number of}} paraspinal and core muscles like the abdominals and obliques (external and internal), while the chest is opened by the rhomboids, and trapezius and the arms are abducted by the deltoids, externally rotated by the infraspinatus and stabilized by the latissimus dorsi.|$|E
50|$|A palatal {{plate is}} a {{prosthetic}} device, generally consisting of an acrylic plate and retention clasps of orthodontic wire, which covers a fistula of the palate. It {{may be used}} to aid in improving articulation and feeding. The blockage of the opening helps improve hypernasality and suckling ability for babies. In the case of a labial-oral-nasal fistula, the plate may include an anterior upward extension to fully occlude the passageway running between the labial surface of the alveolus, alveolus, and nasal cavity. The plate may be constructed to include any congenitally missing teeth to improve articulation and appearance. Individuals who use palatal plates must be monitored periodically by their dental professionals due to possible tissue irritation by the plate. Materials such as food particles, oral mucosa and secretions may cause buildup on the upper surface of the plate; therefore, it is essential to clean a palatal obturator at least twice a day to avoid tissue irritation.

40|$|SUMMARY: Palatal {{tumors are}} often treated with palatectomy or maxillectomy. The {{resulting}} surgical defect produces an oroantral communication. An obturator is a removable prosthesis used {{to close the}} palatal or maxillectomy defect. Fifteen patients who had undergone palatectomy or maxillectomy for carcinoma and subsequent obturator prosthesis placement were retrospectively studied. <b>Obturators</b> were characterized by Hounsfield units and were subdivided into 3 CT imaging groups: either hyperattenuated, hollow (air-containing), or heterogeneous (isoattenuated to hyperattenuated with internal foci of air). Eight patients had hyperattenuated <b>obturators</b> either representing acrylic resin or Trusoft. Four patients had hollow <b>obturators</b> also composed of acrylic resin or Trusoft. Three patients had heterogeneous <b>obturators,</b> which were composed of only Trusoft. The postoperative imaging of patients treated for palatal or maxillary tumors can be complicated {{by the presence of}} obturator prostheses. The intent of this article was to familiarize the reader with the CT imaging features of obturator prostheses.
