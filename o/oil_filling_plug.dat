30|$|The Markit Slope is an {{important}} area for the petroleum exploration in the Tarim Basin. Elucidation of the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> history of discovered oilfields has great significance for recognizing the accumulation processes of the whole region. Using molecular geochemistry, fluid inclusion techniques and basin modeling, we studied the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> process of the Bashituo Oilfield that {{is located in the}} west of the Markit Slope. The molecular migration indexes, such as the methyldibenzothiophene ratio (4 -/ 1 -MDBT), trimethylnaphthalene ratio (TMNr) and pyrrolic nitrogen compounds content, decrease from west to east, indicating that the charging direction and migration pathways are from west to east. Lithological analysis and homogenization temperatures of saline fluid inclusions accompanied with oil fluid inclusions suggest that two charging periods occurred in the Devonian oil reservoir. Combining the burial history and heating history of well BT 4, Basinmod ID software modeling shows the two <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> periods are from 290 Ma to 285 Ma and from 10 Ma to 4 Ma, respectively, and later <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> dominates. This study may be helpful to understand the accumulation process and provide useful references for oil and gas exploration in the Markit Slope.|$|R

A silicone sponge sutured {{directly across the}} macular region {{was performed on the}} silicone <b>oil</b> <b>filled</b> eyes. Silicone <b>oil</b> was removed no sooner than 1 month post-EMB.

The experiments were realized on request of the manufacturer of the cycloid gearbox.

These analytical methods provide the identification and quantification of emerging Fe abrasion particles occurring in the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> of the redactor. The results of the experiment pointed to the unsuitability of the application of the induction magnetic method for the assessment of an actual technical state of the cycloid gearbox. The reason for this lies in specific construction of the cycloid gearbox, with characteristic high operation temperatures of the <b>oil</b> <b>filling,</b> small dimensions, high transferred power, and gear ratio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} road vehicle with hydrodynamic brakes on road slopes, containing disturbances such as the variable load and {{the angle of the}} slope, is presented. The input is the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> and the output is the vehicle velocity. A {{mathematical model}} of the filling sump controlled by the proportional spool valve is developed. Using different geometry of the valve output port, the optional geometry is defined so that the pressure response in the chamber are sufficiently linear and quick. The effects of the nonlinear flow through the valve and the air compressibility in the chamber were carefully considered. Finally, a model connecting the control signal in the control unit of the hydrodynamic brake with the pressure in the sump, i. e. with the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> in the working space of the brake, is developed, thus completing the modelling and simulation process. The braking torque depends on the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> and the number of revolution of the brake rotor. The mathematical models of both the vehicle and the brake are nonlinear, but the analysis is carried out using linear equations valid in corresponding areas limited with nominal values of the model parameters...|$|R
