5|$|Dominic Fontana, a {{geographer}} at the University of Portsmouth, has voiced {{support for}} du Bellay's {{version of the}} sinking based on the battle as it is depicted in the Cowdray Engraving, and modern GIS analysis of the modern scene of the battle. By plotting the fleets and calculating the conjectured final manoeuvres of the Mary Rose, Fontana reached {{the conclusion that the}} ship had been hit low in the hull by the galleys and was destabilised after taking in water. He has interpreted the final heading of the ship straight due north as a failed attempt to reach the shallows at Spitbank only a few hundred metres away. This theory has been given partial support by Alexzandra Hildred, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> who has worked with the Mary Rose, though she has suggested that the close proximity to Spitbank could also indicate that the sinking occurred while trying to make a hard turn to avoid running aground.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko {{wrote to}} the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev {{to submit to the}} State Duma a draft law {{prepared}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped {{to such an extent that}} it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experts</b> arise. According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} whether a career-minded expert would make better decisions if the principal could observe <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action. <b>The</b> previous literature {{has found that}} this “transparency of consequence ” can only improve <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> decision making. We show, however, that this conclusion is very sensitive to the specified cost structure. While learning <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action makes <b>the</b> <b>expert</b> more likely to choose the action most likely to correspond to <b>the</b> true state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, when costs are asymmetric, this {{may be associated with}} a decrease in the principal’s expected welfare. In addition, for a range <b>of</b> parameters, if <b>the</b> principal benefits from learning <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action, her utility is higher if she observes only the consequences and not the action taken. As such, the optimal transparency regime will involve either the principal observing only <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action or only <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expert’s</b> action; it will but never be optimal to observe both.

He then scored 41 not out from 24 balls to win the Man of the Match award as his side won by 17 runs (by the Duckworth-Lewis method). Against India, he was used as second change bowler and took 3–34. It was he who had changed the game by taking the wickets of Yuvraj Singh and opener Irfan Pathan in the 11th over. He also dismissed Suresh Raina in the last over.

Although Disney's films have been highly praised, very popular and commercially successful over time, there were criticisms by reviewers. Caroline Lejeune comments in The Observer that Snow White (1937) [...] "has more faults than any earlier Disney cartoon. It is vulnerable again and again to the barbed criticisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experts.</b> Sometimes it is, frankly, badly drawn." [...] Robin Allen, writing for The Times, notes that Fantasia (1940) was [...] "condemned for its vulgarity and lurches into bathos", while Lejeune, reviewing Alice in Wonderland (1951), feels the film [...] "may drive lovers of Lewis Carroll to frenzy". Peter Pan (1953) was criticized in The Times as [...] "a children's classic vulgarized" [...] with [...] "Tinker Bell... a peroxided American cutie".
