A projected cost of £ 30 /MWh of clean electricity could be achieved by using a Hydro-Osmotic Power (HOP) plant if a suitable membrane is used and the osmotic potential difference between the two solutions is greater than 25 bar; a condition that can be readily found in many sites around the world. Results have shown that the membrane system accounts for 50 %– 80 % of the HOP plant cost depending on the salinity difference level.

As the membrane permeability determines the HOP process feasibility, this paper also describes the effect of the interaction between the fluid and the membrane on the system permeability.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{highlights}} the advancement in Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO) process and covers most recent {{development in the}} process applications. The first application of PRO process goes back to 1973 by Sidney Loeb who suggested using the concept of <b>osmotic</b> energy for <b>power</b> generation. In principle, two solutions of different concentrations are separated by semipermeable membrane of, relatively, high water permeability and solute rejection rate. The high-concentration solution is usually known as the draw solution while the low-concentration solution is called the feed solution. The draw solution is pressurized before entering the membrane. Due to the osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane, fresh water transports {{in the direction of}} the osmotic pressure gradients resulting in the dilution of the high-concentration solution. After leaving the membrane, the diluted draw solution is depressurized in a turbine system for power generation. Different types of membrane materials and solute gradient resources were proposed and their impact on the performance of PRO process was investigated. In addition to power generation, the hybridization of PRO process with membrane and thermal processes for power generation and seawater desalination is not unusual nowadays. The current study provides a critical review about the recent advancements in the PRO process and research outcomes...|$|R
40|$|McMillan and Mayer (MM) proved two {{remarkable}} theorems {{in their}} {{paper on the}} equilibrium statistical mechanics of liquid solutions. They first showed that the grand canonical partition function for a solution {{can be reduced to}} a one with an effectively solute-only form, by integrating out the solvent degrees of freedom. The total effective solute potential in the effective solute grand partition function can be decomposed into components which are potentials of mean force for isolated groups of one, two, three, etc, solute molecules. Secondly, from the first result, now assuming low solute concentration, MM derived an expansion for the <b>osmotic</b> pressure in <b>powers</b> of the solute concentration, in complete analogy with the virial expansion of gas pressure in powers of the density at low density. The molecular expressions found for the osmotic virial coefficients have exactly the same form as the corresponding gas virial coefficients, with potentials of mean force replacing vacuum potentials. In this paper we restrict ourselves to binary liquid solutions with solute species $A$ and solvent species $B$ and do three things: (a) By working with a semi-grand canonical ensemble (grand with respect to solvent only) instead of the grand canonical ensemble used by MM, and avoiding graphical methods, we have greatly simplified the derivation of the first MM result,(b) by using a simple nongraphical method developed by van Kampen for gases, we have greatly simplified the derivation of the second MM result,i. e.,the osmotic pressure virial expansion; as a by-product, we show the precise relation between MM theory and Widom potential distribution theory, and (c) we have extended MM theory by deriving virial expansions for other solution properties such as the enthalpy of mixing. The latter expansion, with changed independent variables corresponding to current experiments, is proving useful. Comment: pdftex, 32 pages, 2 figures. Thermodynamic errata in Section IV.

40|$|<b>Osmotic</b> <b>power</b> {{is a form}} of {{renewable}} energy which is currently not used at a commercial scale, but it might have the potential to be exploited in a sustainable manner in the near future. It uses the principle of osmosis, which is known for over a century and is used since recent years for several membrane applications. The salinity gradient between fresh river water and salt sea water, separated by a membrane, causes an osmotic flow which can be converted into electricity by using one of the two types of <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> generation, PRO or RED. Interested parties have already concluded, by conducting laboratory studies and operating pilot plants, that <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> is a promising source {{of renewable}} energy in the future. An energy unit rate of 8 cents/kWh should be possible for a commercial-scaled power plant. However, what is lacking in these studies is the actual design of the <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> plant. Scaling up of an <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> plant to a commercial scale will {{have a major impact on}} the design of the main infrastructure. The question is whether a commercial <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> plant is feasible if the capital costs of the main infrastructure are included. Answering this question is the objective of this thesis. The research question is answered by conducting multiple case studies with a varying capacity. By considering the revenues and investments over the lifespan of the power plant, the energy unit rate of each power plant is obtained. The general conclusion is that, with the present technology and knowledge, the energy unit rate deviates too much from a marketable energy unit rate. The high capital costs of the intake and outfall system and pre-treatment facility, and the low power plant efficiency ensure that a commercial <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> plant is not economically justified. The commercial exploitation of an <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> plant is therefore far from being feasible.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} process of {{pressure}} retarded osmosis (PRO) for salinity gradient energy conversion in power production applications. A mathematical model of the PRO process is developed with consideration for non-ideal effects including internal concentration polarization, external concentration polarization, and spatial variations that are caused by mass transfer and by pressure drop {{along the length of}} the membrane. A mathematical model of the <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> plant is also developed with consideration for pre-filtration and pick-up head, and for mechanical and electrical equipment efficiencies. A distinction is made between the gross power developed by the PRO process, and the net power available to the grid after parasitic loads are accounted for. This distinction leads to observation of a trade-off that exists between the different non-ideal effects. A method is developed for adjusting operating conditions in order to minimize the overall impact of non-ideal effects and to achieve maximum net power. Important improvements in net power densities are realized as compared to results obtained when general rules of thumb are used for operating conditions. The mathematical model is validated by experimental investigation of PRO at the bench-scale. It is found that test conditions generally used in the literature may not be appropriate for power production applications. Test conditions which strike a balance between pressure drop and other non-ideal effects may provide more realistic results. An analog electric circuit is developed for a simplified PRO process and <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> plant. The analog circuit is used to develop strategies for controlling operating conditions of the system, including by control of the load and by control of a flush valve. Both of these provide satisfactory tracking of the desired operating conditions and can also be used for tracking the maximum power point.

Recent membrane development for pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) {{is making the}} <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> generation more and more realistic. However, severe performance declines have been observed because the porous layer of PRO membranes is fouled by the feed stream. To overcome it, a negatively charged antifouling PRO hollow fiber membrane has been designed and studied in this work. An antifouling polymer, derived from hyperbranched polyglycerol and functionalized by α-lipoic acid and succinic anhydride, was synthesized and grafted onto the polydopamine (PDA) modified poly(ether sulfone) (PES) hollow fiber membranes. In comparison to unmodified membranes, the charged hyperbranched polyglycerol (CHPG) grafted membrane is much less affected by organic deposition, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption, and highly resistant to microbial growths, demonstrated by E. coli adhesion and S. aureus attachment. CHPG-g-TFC was also examined in PRO tests using a concentrated wastewater as the feed. Comparing to the plain PES-TFC and non-charged HPG-g-TFC, the newly developed membrane exhibits not only the smallest decline in water flux but also the highest recovery rate. When using 0. 81 M NaCl and wastewater as the feed pair in PRO tests at 15 bar, the average power density remains at 5. 6 W/m 2 in comparison to an average value of 3. 6 W/m 2 for unmodified membranes after four PRO runs.

40|$|As the {{population}} increases, {{the demand for}} electricity has also increased. Most of the required electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels at power stations {{all over the world}} which has dangerous influences on climate. Therefore, it is important to produce new renewable and maintainable energy sources to decrease the use of fossil fuels. <b>Osmotic</b> <b>power</b> is a renewable source of energy that is generated by using salt and fresh waters. Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) is a membrane based technology that can produce <b>osmotic</b> <b>power.</b> One of the main challenges for generating <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> by using PRO technology is the membrane fouling which reduces the permeate flux and consequently increases the cost and decreases the <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> generation. In this research, various pretreatment methods such as different types of ultrafiltration systems and a sand filter were used for removing total organic carbon (TOC), turbidity, and hardness from raw water. Moreover, different feed waters with various qualities were used to investigate the effect of fouling on a commercial membrane in PRO mode in continuous conditions. In addition, two physical and chemical cleaning methods were used to investigate and determine the desirable cleaning methods in PRO processes in order to control and reduce the membrane fouling. Most of the tests were performed at LTE Hydro Québec located at Shawinigan and the rest were performed at Concordia University. Based on the results, highest removal efficiency of turbidity occurred at 3. 72 NTU and was 100 % and 68. 6 % for ultrafiltration and the multimedia sand filter, respectively. Maximum TOC removal in ultrafiltration multimedia sand filter was 41 % and 1. 5 % at 6. 62 mg/L TOC initial concentration respectively. According to the results, the fouling rate when the draw solution was synthetic salt water followed the order of: untreated river water > multimedia sand filter > microfiltration > ultrafiltration effluents. It was observed that complete blocking, cake filtration and cake enhanced osmotic pressure were the main fouling mechanisms that governed the membrane fouling. The main inorganic foulants using synthetic salt water were iron, aluminum, calcium, sodium, and silica and when sea water was used as the draw solution, iron, aluminum, silica, magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium were detected as inorganic foulants. The organic foulants were humic substances, polysaccharides and proteins from use of both synthetic salt water and sea water as draw solutions. The successful cleaning method was chemical cleaning using a combination of acidic and basic cleaners. This research indicates that using appropriate pretreatment and membrane cleaning methods can decrease the membrane fouling in PRO processes and consequently can improve the <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> generation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Osmotic</b> <b>power</b> is an unexploited {{source of}} {{renewable}} energy {{that is based on}} mixing two types of water with a different salinity gradient. <b>Osmotic</b> <b>power</b> production (if life-cycle analysis of all necessary components is ignored) does not emit greenhouse gases to the atmosphere as opposed to fossil fuels employed in electricity production today, thus <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> does not systemically contribute to global warming and climate change. This thesis investigates the annual electricity production potential in the Nordic countries using pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) as a method of producing electricity. PRO is a controlled process of mixing two types of water – the feed and the draw – in a water tank equipped with a semi-permeable membrane that separates the solutions and allows for transfer of water in one direction only – feed to draw. Due to osmosis, the draw solution (seawater) draws the feed (river water) through the membrane. This overpressures the draw which is used as the force to propel a turbine. The greater the difference in salinity of the two waters, the greater the power output per volume of mixed waters. The magnitude of <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> production is limited by the river discharge. This thesis focuses on a scenario where fresh water discharged by a river is mixed as the feed with seawater available at a given estuary as the draw. In the Nordic countries, PRO power generation opportunities were analysed using a geographic information system (GIS) with parameters like seawater salinity, annual average water discharge as the feed, regional impact of climate change on precipitation, and contemporary hydropower and river basin management. With respect to thermo-dynamics, power generation using PRO proves most sensible in Norway and on the west coast of Jutland (Danish mainland) where the sites for hypothetical osmotic power-plants were suggested as estuaries. Estuaries were categorized by the level of nature protection, hydropower management and river basin management in the area (if any). For each estuary where seawater has salinity 30 psu or greater, the annual power production potential was quantified at the applied pressure of 9 bars. As a technological point of reference, I assume an ideal osmosis process (which presumes no salt accumulation inside of the membrane) in a system with 81 % efficiency. The membrane technology applied in all cases is a thin-film hollow composite membrane with a water permeability of A = 9. 22. 10 - 12. m 3. m- 2. s- 1. Pa- 1. The annual work potential in Norway and on the west coast of Jutland outside of environmentally protected areas is 88. 87 TWh and 0. 13 TWh, respectively. There are another 12. 94 TWh and 0. 82 TWh within nature protected zones of Norway and Jutland, respectively, which gives around 102. 76 TWh altogether. The total membrane area necessary to utilize the annual average water discharge of all investigated rivers is 1190 km 2. Due to climate change between 2021 and 2050, there will be relatively more precipitation in the region, therefore the potential for <b>osmotic</b> <b>power</b> production in the region is going to grow as more feed will be available.
