5|$|As {{leaders in}} the punk rock scene, the Ramones' music has usually been {{identified}} with that label, while some have defined their characteristic style more specifically as pop punk and others as power pop. In the 1980s, the band sometimes veered into hardcore punk territory, as can be heard <b>on</b> <b>Too</b> Tough to Die.|$|E
5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on {{for as long}} as they wanted to so that he could get a grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going <b>on</b> <b>too</b> long he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|E
5|$|The Goth. sibja, OHG. sippia, sippa, AS. sib gen. sibbe, denote peace, friendship, kindred; {{from these}} I infer a divinity Sibja, Sippia, Sib, {{corresponding}} to ON. Sif gen.

By this sense of the word, Sif would appear to be, like Frigg and Freyja, a goddess of loveliness and love; as attributes of Oðinn and Thôrr agree, their wives Frigg and Sif have also a common signification.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to tour {{in support of}} the album was made before it was even complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were completely out of practice, and realising he had taken <b>on</b> <b>too</b> much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters, and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral). Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, selling out within hours.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott's (Steve Carell) replacement appears in the office, to start receiving training from Michael. The new manager, Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell), has everyone hoping to make good first impressions: Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) finds himself awkwardly typecast while Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) worry that they've come <b>on</b> <b>too</b> strong. Only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is apathetic about the new leader.|$|E

5|$|The {{skeletal}} reconstruction {{accompanying the}} 1908 description restored the missing parts {{in a fashion}} similar to Stegosaurus, and Brown likened the result to the extinct armored mammal Glyptodon. Contrary to modern depictions, Brown's stegosaur-like reconstruction showed robust forelimbs, a strongly arched back, a pelvis with prongs projecting forwards from the ilium and pubis, {{as well as a}} short, drooping tail without a tail club, which was unknown at the time. Brown also reconstructed the armor plates in parallel rows running down the back; this arrangement was purely hypothetical. Brown's reconstruction became highly influential, and restorations of the animal based on his diagram were published as late as the 1980s. In a 1908 review of Brown's Ankylosaurus description, American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston criticised the skeletal reconstruction as being based <b>on</b> <b>too</b> scanty remains, and claimed that Ankylosaurus was merely a synonym of the genus Stegopelta, which Williston had named in 1905. Williston also stated that a skeletal reconstruction of the related Polacanthus by Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa was a better example of how ankylosaurs would have appeared in life. The claim of synonymy was not accepted by other researchers, and the two genera are now considered distinct.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{achieved}} {{his sixth}} pole {{position of the}} season, and his first at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 13.014 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Alonso, with teammate Massa in third, giving Ferrari their best qualifying performance of the season. Webber {{had not been able to}} use his car's KERS and qualified fourth, four-tenths of a second behind Vettel. Hamilton and Button qualified in fifth and seventh respectively and McLaren blamed the slow pace <b>on</b> <b>too</b> high levels of downforce on the high-speed circuit. The Mercedes drivers qualified in sixth and eighth, and Heidfeld and Vitaly Petrov completed the top ten. Paul di Resta was in 11th position, ahead of fellow rookies Pastor Maldonado and Kobayashi. Adrian Sutil struggled with grip throughout the session and was 14th; following him were Sébastien Buemi, Barrichello and de la Rosa. Jaime Alguersuari qualifying in 18th complained of insufficient grip and brake balance, and at the back of the grid were the Lotus, HRT and Virgin drivers. D'Ambrosio did not qualify after failing to set a time within 107% in the first qualifying session. However the stewards allowed him to race, having considered he was using a new chassis after an accident in Friday practice, where he had set faster lap times.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{attempted}} {{to subvert the}} Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken <b>on</b> <b>too</b> much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained {{the right to use}} the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.|$|E

25|$|Performance {{evaluations}} {{have been}} based on various operational or financial measures of performance, but no one factor provides a clear indication of productive or ineffective performance.
