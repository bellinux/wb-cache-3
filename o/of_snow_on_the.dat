25|$|In winter, Daytona Beach has weather {{conditions}} typical of cities on the Florida peninsula. The coolest months are from December through February; average daytime highs range from 65 to 70°F (18 to 21°C) and nighttime lows are near 50 F (10°C). Occasional cold fronts often drop the daytime temperatures into the 50s F with {{nights in the}} 30s F a few times each month. Like much of Florida, Daytona Beach often can be very dry in late winter and early spring, and brush fires and water restrictions can be an issue. Daytona Beach averages only 6 frosts per year according to the National Weather Service office in Melbourne. There is no record <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground in Daytona Beach in the last 109 years; however, snow flurries have been observed twice since 1880 – on January 1, 1977 and in January 2010.|$|E

500|$|Krusty has his {{own show}} on Channel 6 in Springfield: The Krusty the Clown Show, which is aimed towards a children's {{audience}} and has many followers, including Bart Simpson. Krusty has licensed the show to dozens of countries, including Ireland, China, Jamaica, and Romania, that produce localized versions. [...] Krusty's show has gone through various phases: a clip from 1961 presents the show as a serious talk show featuring Krusty interviewing AFL-CIO chairman George Meany {{on the topic of}} collective bargaining agreements, while a clip from 1963 shows Krusty interviewing Robert Frost, then dumping a load <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poet. The show later took a different turn, featuring Ravi Shankar as a guest and having Krusty howl a drugged-out version of The Doors' [...] "Break on Through (To the Other Side)" [...] in 1973. By the 1980s, the show had devolved into a children's entertainment show. During the series, the Krusty the Clown Show is shown to be aimed almost entirely at children and features many characters, including Sideshow Mel, Mr. Teeny, Tina Ballerina, and Corporal Punishment. Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty's main sidekick, but years of constant abuse led to Bob framing Krusty for armed robbery, although Bob was eventually foiled by Bart. Bob has since been replaced by Sideshow Mel, who has remained loyal to Krusty. He seems to retire from and then get back into show business repeatedly throughout his career. His most recent retirement was almost permanent because of recently paroled Sideshow Bob's latest scheme– wiring plastic explosives to a hypnotized Bart and sending him up on stage. When Krusty makes a tribute to Bob at the last minute, however, Bob has a change of heart and stops Bart from fulfilling his mission. Bob and Krusty were later reconciled, with Krusty exclaiming that Bob's attempts at Krusty's life make his ratings shoot through the roof. This reconciliation remains {{for the rest of the}} series, as Bob abandons his attempts for revenge on Krusty in favor of targeting Bart exclusively.|$|E
