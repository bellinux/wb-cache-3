50|$|Connell {{holds that}} Dorman and Sitting Bull most likely knew each other, but doubts the {{veracity}} of the Sioux chief's drink <b>offer,</b> <b>noting</b> that similar stories of European style chivalry were common at the time. Some writers on Sutting Bull repeat the account as credible however, suggesting that it {{had little to do}} with sentimental notions of grand chivalry, but rather a practical gesture by the Sioux leader towards a doomed man. The water given and the 'stop order' was therefore a temporary reprieve, one last acknowledgement of the interpreter the medicine man had once personally known.|$|R

5000|$|Rob Allsetter of Sega Saturn Magazine {{praised the}} {{impressive}} {{attention to detail}} in the graphics and the multiple routes.

[...] He pointed out that the much-maligned on-rails format is necessary to create the experience the game <b>offers,</b> <b>noting</b> as an example that it allowed the developers to synchronize the soundtrack with what is going on. He also praised the animation, 3D graphics, high frame rate, absence of pixelation even on the heavily detailed bosses, precise controls, lock-on attacks, and the ability to adjust the games difficulty by choosing different routes.|$|R

40|$|Review {{of current}} {{practices}} and {{recent developments in}} impact evaluation of nutrition programmes for preschool children in developing countries. A survey of the major types of nutrition programmes for young children - nutrition education, food supplementation, and nutrition rehabilitation - {{is followed by a}} discussion of the problems confronting impact evaluation. Firstly, methodological difficulties often weaken the power of the evaluation or restrict its scope. Secondly, the effects of most nutrition interventions are at best modest. Finally, nutrition programmes in tropical countries usually operate in a great variety of cultural settings, which not only raises practical implementation problems, but also have a strong bearing on the interpretation of evaluation findings. It is argued that impact evaluation cannot be a final arbiter, but it may contribute to a definition of the optimal combination of local conditions and type of assistance <b>offered.</b> <b>Notes,</b> ref., su...|$|R
