This may be due to the fact he is ambidextrous, playing tennis with his left hand, and writing with his right.|$|E

Her first try at the game was in 1910, when she played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> at the family property in Marest-sur-Matz.

50|$|Quattro Pro {{shipped in}} the final quarter of 1989.

The building was closed for months. All the computers were removed, placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>courts,</b> washed down (acoustic ceilings rained gray mush onto everything when the sprinklers ran) and dried with hair dryers.

After an extensive series of discretionary arrangements were made, Taylor joined Minh in a game of doubles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> of the Saigon Officers Club. McNamara watched on as Taylor played with Minh, waiting anxiously for any signals from Minh to [...] "broad hints of our interest in other subjects which we gave him during breaks in the game". Minh revealed nothing of his thoughts about a possible coup, leaving his guest bewildered to his intentions in inviting them. McNamara later grumbled to Kennedy that [...] "I sat on a sideline two feet from Big Minh for over an hour and I couldn't get a damn thing out of him." [...] Taylor got one of the tennis players, Colonel Raymond Jones, to contact Minh about the situation, to which Minh replied with a complaint about a perceived lack of support from Washington for a coup. Minh claimed that he thought McNamara and Taylor were seeking nothing but a match of tennis and offered to discuss military affairs at any time.|$|E
2500|$|In April the Spanish ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza, {{wrote to}} King Philip II of Spain {{that it had}} been {{proposed}} that if Anjou were to travel to England to negotiate his marriage to the Queen, De Vere, Surrey and Windsor should be hostages for his safe return. Anjou himself did not arrive in England until the end of August, but his ambassadors were already in England. De Vere was sympathetic to the proposed marriage, Leicester and his nephew Philip Sidney were adamantly opposed to it. This antagonism may have triggered the famous quarrel between De Vere and Sidney <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> at Whitehall. It is not entirely clear who was playing on the court when the fight erupted; what is undisputed is that De Vere called Sidney a 'puppy', while Sidney responded that [...] "all the world knows puppies are gotten by dogs, and children by men". The French ambassadors, whose private galleries overlooked the tennis court, were witness to the display. Whether it was Sidney who next challenged De Vere to a duel or the other way around, De Vere did not take it further, and the Queen personally took Sidney to task for not recognizing the difference between his status and De Vere's. Christopher Hatton and Sidney's friend Hubert Languet also tried to dissuade Sidney from pursuing the matter, and it was eventually dropped. The specific cause is not known, but in January 1580 De Vere wrote and challenged Sidney; {{by the end of the}} month De Vere was confined to his chambers, and was not released until early February.|$|E
