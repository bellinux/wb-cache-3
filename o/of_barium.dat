5|$|Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with {{a slight}} golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} in air yielding a dark gray oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium {{is very difficult to}} prepare, and therefore many properties <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> have not been accurately measured yet.|$|E

40|$|High-concentration {{barium sulfate}} has been {{reported}} to be useful for gastric cancer screening and used in many medical institutions. However, fundamental studies on highconcentration barium sulfate are still required to make sure its efficacy for gastric cancer screening. Previously, the authors reported viscosity changes <b>of</b> high-concentration <b>barium</b> sulfate with pH, volume and temperature changes of artificial gastric juice. In this study, acid resistance, fluidity and ease of consumption were compared among two types <b>of</b> high-concentration <b>barium</b> sulfate and one type <b>of</b> moderate-concentration <b>barium</b> sulfate. The results indicate that acid resistance and fluidity <b>of</b> high-concentration <b>barium</b> sulfate are better than those of moderate-concentration one. On the ease <b>of</b> consumption, high-concentration <b>barium</b> sulfate is also better than moderate-concentration one. 高濃度硫酸バリウムは胃がん検診における有効性が示され，多くの医療機関で用いられている。しかし，この高濃度硫酸バリウムを用いた検診をより適切に評価するためには，基礎的研究がさらに必要であると考えられる。著者らは，以前，人工胃液のpHや量の変化，さらには，温度変化に対する高濃度硫酸バリウムの粘度変化を報告した。本研究では，耐酸性，流動性および服用性について高濃度硫酸バリウムと中濃度硫酸バリウムを比較し，いずれにおいても高濃度硫酸バリウムが良いことを確認した...|$|R

5|$|The {{abundance}} <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> is 0.0425% in the Earth's {{crust and}} 13µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> is barite (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral. with deposits {{in many parts}} of the world. Another commercial source, far less important than barite, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.|$|E

25|$|The {{interpretation}} <b>of</b> standard <b>barium</b> swallow examinations {{for assessing}} dysphagia is operator and interpreter dependent. It has poor sensitivity for subtle abnormalities but is more sensitive in detecting esophageal webs and rings than gastroscopy. The best initial evaluation of suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia is a barium study.

5|$|The mean {{strontium}} {{content of}} ocean water is 8mg/l.

5|$|Enrico Fermi {{and a team}} of {{scientists}} at the University of Rome reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934. Fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned it in his Nobel Lecture in 1938. The sample was actually a mixture <b>of</b> <b>barium,</b> krypton, and other elements, but this was not known at the time. Nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. The mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.|$|E
5|$|Rocks from Incapillo {{are rich}} in sodium and have high ratios of {{lanthanum}} and samarium to ytterbium and high ratios <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> to lanthanum, as well as high lead-206 to lead-204 and strontium-87/strontium-86 ratios. These rare-earth element patterns {{are similar to the}} Late Miocene Maricunga Belt rocks and contrast to early Miocene rocks. The changes occurred {{at the same time as}} the arc migrated eastward, terminating activity in the Maricunga Belt. The element ratios are pronouncedly arc-like with some adakitic signatures. The rocks contain considerably more sodium and alumina than almost all Central Andes siliceous volcanic rocks.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} {{electrode potential}} for the Sr2+/Sr couple is −2.89V, approximately midway between those of the Ca2+/Ca (−2.84V) and Ba2+/Ba (−2.92V) couples, and close {{to those of the}} neighboring alkali metals. Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Strontium metal burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380°C, at room temperature, it forms only the oxide spontaneously. Besides the simple oxide SrO, the peroxide SrO2 can be made by direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Sr(O2)2. Strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of strontium are known.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} mineral resources, the Goat Rocks area {{can be divided}} into three segments, each rich with certain minerals. The first two are named Packwood Glacier–McCall Basin and Glacier Basin, and are located near past {{volcanic}} vents. These areas exhibit anomalous levels of cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc, well-dispersed levels of pyrite, and sporadic concentrations of silver. Area C corresponds to the Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and lies along the area of contact between Goat Rocks volcano and older volcanoes to the east. It is distinct from the other two study areas, featuring anomalous amounts <b>of</b> <b>barium,</b> cobalt, copper, and manganese, as well as smaller quantities of lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc. Other minerals found in Area C include barite, boron, cinnabar, mercury, pyrite, and tin in concentrates taken from stream-sediment. The water has high concentrations of chlorine, copper, fluorine, and molybdenum, and altered rocks contain arsenic, lead, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc at especially high levels. The Goat Rocks vicinity seems to offer large base metal deposits. Outside the area studied, coal has been identified at the Packwood and Cowlitz fields, and building stones and gravel are being quarried to the north and west of the volcano. The Goat Rocks area's potential resources for oil and gas remain unidentified. Because no volcanic activity has occurred during the Holocene (within the past 11,700 years), Goat Rocks has very little potential for geothermal resources.|$|E

25|$|Radiographic {{examinations}} involve {{radiation exposure}} {{in the form}} of X-rays. Although barium ions are toxic, their use is generally regarded as safe because the small amounts <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> ions available in solution and absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract are deemed to be negligible; however, isolated cases <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> encephalopathy have been described following absorption <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> from the intestinal tract. Constipation and abdominal pain may occur after barium meals. The formation of baroliths, which may need to be removed surgically, is a complication of the use <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> sulfate. Barium sulfate may cause serious peritoneal irritation. Leakage <b>of</b> <b>Barium</b> sulfate into the abdominal cavity may occur in people with duodenal ulcers or other perforations and may lead to peritonitis, adhesion, and granulomas; it is associated with a high mortality rate. Leakage <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> into the mediastinum or peritoneal cavity may lead to endotoxic shock, which is often fatal; as a result, the use <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> as a contrast agent is contraindicated when there is a suspicion or possibility of compromise of bowel wall integrity. Aspiration or inhalation <b>of</b> <b>barium</b> sulfate into the lungs during oral application can lead to serious respiratory complications leading to fatal aspiration pneumonia or asphyxiation. Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions are rare but some additives contained in barium preparations may induce immune reactions. Complete gastrointestinal obstruction is also a contraindication for barium studies.|$|E
