40|$|The {{subject of}} the present thesis is the {{phenomenon}} of simultaneous colour contrast: As is well known, the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> of a given light stimulus depends almost as strongly on the stimulation of neighbouring regions of the visual field as on the local stimulus itself. Thus, the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> of a target stimulus can be manipulated either by changing the colour co-ordinates of the target itself, or, alternatively, by changing the colour co-ordinates of the surround. Classical models of simultaneous contrast {{are based on the}} implicit assumption that the changes in <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> brought about by these two kinds of manipulation are basically of the same kind, and thus may compensate each other. This ‘compensation assumption’ is equivalent to the widespread assumption that the space of <b>perceived</b> <b>colours</b> is three-dimensional. In principle, though, the well-established facts of trichromatic theory are compatible with a dimensionality of the space of <b>perceived</b> <b>colours</b> higher than three (namely three times the number of differently coloured regions in the visual field). One of the central results of the present investigations is that the compensation assumption seems to be unwarranted in the case of simple centre-surround stimuli. This instilled the expectation that classical methods for measuring simultaneous contrast effects, such as grey settings and asymmetric colour matching, may sometimes be inappropriate, and thus yield misleading results. In further experiments it is shown that this is indeed the case when uniformly coloured surrounds are used. In the case of variegated surrounds, however, matters appear to be much less complicated. This difference seems to be due to impressions of perceptual transparency being evoked by uniform surrounds, but not by variegated ones...|$|R

This work aims to aid suchcolour design by exploring three main questions: 1. Is itpossible to survey and map out what <b>colours</b> people <b>perceive</b> onfacades observed under different conditions? If so, whatmethods {{can be used}} {{and it is possible}} to obtain results ofwider application? 2. How does the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> of a facadevary with changing observation conditions? What is the impactof factors such as light conditions, viewing distance andsurrounding colours? 3. How does the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> of thehouse, in different situations, differ from the colourcorresponding to the specification of the sample used forselection? Are there any recurring tendencies that can bepresented in a practically useful way? The work was based onabout 3600 observations of painted timber and rendered facades,made by both experienced colour researchers and "naïve"school students, with various daylighting conditions, viewingdistances and seasons. Colour specifications and discussions oncolour attributes were made within the conceptual framework ofthe Natural Colour System (NCS). Inherent colour was measuredby comparison with colour samples placed directly on the facadesurface. Six methods for determination of <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> weredeveloped and evaluated, along with a method for comparison ofperceived and inherent colour. A combination of all gave themost reliable results. Results showed some recurring tendenciesfor <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> to vary with viewing conditions, but thevariations were always smaller than the difference betweenperceived and inherent colour. Consistent variation patternsfor the difference between inherent and <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> werefound for both hue and nuance. Most obvious was that perceivedcolour always had less blackness than inherent colour. Possibleexplanations included differences between the outdoor viewingsituation and the standard situation where inherent colour isdefined, and the observer 9 ̆ 2 s acquired sense of what colours"belong" outdoors. A fuller explanation would require furtherstudies such as of colour perception in different lightsituations, and of three dimensional context effects. Resultshave immediate applicability however; suitably illustrated andpublished, the variation patterns found could be of directpractical use in exterior colour design. NR 2014080...|$|R

However, these methods are not assumed to be applicable for predicting the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> {{difference in}} complex colour patches such as digital images of complex scene. In this work existing metrics that predict the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> difference in digital images of complex scene are studied and compared. Performance evaluation was based on the correlations between values of the metrics and results of subjective tests that were done as a pair comparison, in which fifteen test participants evaluated the subjective colour differences in digital images. The test image set consisted of eight images each having four versions of distortion generated by applying different ICC profiles. According to results, none of the metrics were able to predict the <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> difference in every test image. The results of iCAM metric had the highest average correlation for all images. However, the scatter of the judgements was very high for two of the images, and if these were excluded from the comparison the Hue-angle was the best performing metric. It was also noteworthy that the performance of the CIELAB colour difference metric was relatively high...|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of the long-term memory colours of objects {{has been the subject}} of investigation for many years. Colour acceptance boundaries have been determined from the visual assessments of objects under variable illumination or by presenting manipulated images of objects on a calibrated computer display. However, a systematic and quantitative rating of the colour of real objects with respect to memory colour is not available at this moment. In this paper, nine familiar real objects with colours distributed around the hue circle, were positioned in a specially designed LED illumination box. For each object, approximately hundred real illumination spectra were synthesised in a random order keeping the luminance of the object approximately constant. Observers were asked to rate, on a five-point scale, the similarity of the <b>perceived</b> <b>object</b> <b>colour</b> to their idea of what the object looked like in reality. By avoiding specular reflections the observer was unable to identify any clues as to the colour of the illumination. For each object, similarity ratings showed a good intra- and inter-observer agreement. The ratings of all the observers were pooled and successfully modelled in IPT colour space by a bivariate Gaussian distribution. It was found that the chromaticity corresponding to the highest rating tended to be shifted towards higher chroma in comparison with the chromaticity calculated under D 65 illumination. The bivariate distributions could be very useful in applications where the quantitative evaluation of the colour appearance of an object stimulus is required, such as in the evaluation of the colour rendering capabilities of a light source. status: publishe...|$|R

In a first application of the assessment method, we used a colour contrast test chart printed on paper and studied it under the illumination of three LED light sources, halogen light and daylight.

The first chapter of this thesis introduces {{the possibility of using}} a digital computer in conjunction with a colour television monitor to calculate and display the luminance distribution in a lighted room; a system which may offer advantages both for the experienced designer and the student of lighting design. The display system is described briefly, along with some possible shortcomings. An account is given of the methods used for inter-reflection calculation. These inter-reflection calculations are then developed to include colour and techniques of photometric and colorimetric measurement with reference to the television display. A complete description of the display system hardware is also given. This display system as initially designed uses chromaticity as the criterion for colour reproduction. The shortcomings of this approach are discussed. Techniques for <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> measurement are described and the results presented for the <b>colour</b> <b>perceived</b> from some simple display images. The possibility of <b>perceived</b> <b>colour</b> prediction is examined and measured colours are compared with those predicted by a non-linear model.
