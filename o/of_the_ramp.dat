A small brick building – originally used as a laboratory or shell-filling facility – stands to the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp.</b> The fort is entered through a single gateway on its west side, protected against landward attackers by a caponier. The front of the fort was surrounded by a dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days, every man of the 700 or so who had {{made it to the}} bridge and whether a combat trooper or not, was engaged in the defence of the British perimeter. A Company was sited in the {{buildings}} on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> nearest the river, and on Monday 18 2 Platoon occupied a house on the east side. This sector came under increasing attack from tanks and infantry of the 10th SS Panzer Division, and the building was later burnt down.|$|E

5|$|An {{inclined}} tramway, the ramp, {{was built}} {{from the front}} of the terrace, on the axis of the gatehouse, down towards the port area of Fremantle. The ramp, constructed between 1852 and 1853, is of limestone rubble from the cut and fill activities required to create the prison site and the terrace. The ramp is an integral part of the original design of the prison complex and is of exceptional heritage significance. It is now cut at its western end by a modern road which severs the historic visual link with Fremantle. On each side of the alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> where it intersects with Henderson Street, are three terrace houses for the accommodation of prison warders. These were erected between 1851 and 1858 and mark the boundary of the Convict Establishment at this point. The limestone used for the early prison and its associated housing was quarried on the site.|$|E

40|$|In Port Aransas, TX, movable bridges, ferry ramps, {{are used}} to dock ferry boats and load {{vehicles}} on and off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boats to cross the Corpus Christie, TX ship channel as part of State Highway 361. Fatigue cracks are present in several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bearing assemblies that attach <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> to <b>the</b> headwall at the ferry landing. The cracks were caused by axial forces in the main supporting beams <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramps.</b> Using strain gage instrumentation applied to <b>the</b> beams, estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axial forces were obtained.

25|$|In late 2005, the {{intersection}} with Mannheim Road was reconstructed to remove unsafe conditions {{and bring the}} route closer to Interstate standards. In the late 1990s, the Illinois Department of Transportation restriped I-190 at Interstate 294. This action {{increased the number of}} lanes west of I-294 from two to three. In the process, the speed limit was reduced from 45 to 35, and yield signs were erected at the ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> from northbound Mannheim Road to westbound I-190, the busiest ramp at that intersection. This created a hazardous condition, often leading to high-speed crashes should drivers waiting on the ramp become impatient or underestimate the speed of westbound traffic. Often, an IDOT Minuteman (rapid response vehicle) would be stationed on the ramp waiting to tow away vehicles that would be involved in a crash during rush hour.|$|E

Its scope was not to cause a collapse of the wall — the buttress had been successful — but to pass under it and penetrate the city. This tunnel was built to allow the Persians four abreast to move through it. It eventually entered the city and pierced the inner embankment and, when the ramp was completed, Dura's end had come. As Persian troops charged up the ramp, {{their counterparts in the}} tunnel would have invaded the city with little opposition, as nearly all the defenders would have been on the wall attempting to repel the attack from the ramp.

Ben-Gal refused at first, but relented when he was told there was only one shell per tank. Ben-Gal consulted Eitan and decided to counterattack. The 7th Battalion began to move up the hill and saw the Syrian tanks. Kahalani called the other Israeli tanks behind the ramp and got little response, since they were from different units and were operating on different frequencies. The brigade communications officer cut into every company's net, but they still did not respond to Kahalani.

40|$|Ramping events, or {{rapid changes}} of wind speed and wind {{direction}} over {{a short period}} of time, present challenges to power grid operators in regions with significant penetrations of wind energy in the power grid portfolio. Improved predictions of wind power availability require adequate predictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>ramping</b> events. For <b>the</b> <b>ramping</b> event investigated here, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was run at three horizontal resolutions in 'mesoscale' mode: 8100 m, 2700 m, and 900 m. Two Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) schemes, the Yonsei University (YSU) and Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) schemes, were run at each resolution as well. Simulations were not 'tuned' with nuanced choices of vertical resolution or tuning parameters so that these simulations may be considered 'out-of-the-box' tests of a numerical weather prediction code. Simulations are compared with sodar observations during a wind ramping event at a 'West Coast North America' wind farm. Despite differences in the boundary-layer schemes, no significant differences were observed in <b>the</b> abilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> schemes to capture <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramping</b> event. As collaborators have identified, <b>the</b> boundary conditions <b>of</b> these simulations probably dominate <b>the</b> physics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simulations. They suggest that future investigations into characterization of ramping events employ ensembles of simulations, and that the ensembles include variations of boundary conditions. Furthermore, <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> these simulations to capture not only <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ramping</b> event but <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind profile during <b>the</b> <b>ramping</b> event (regardless <b>of</b> its timing) indicates that the set-up and execution of such simulations for wind power forecasting requires skill and tuning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simulations for a specific site...|$|R

25|$|Cibernético was {{scheduled}} to team up Heavy Metal, La Parka and Octagón at Héroes Inmortales IV against La Sociedad, a superstable consisting of the invading Los Perros del Mal stable, La Legión Extranjera, La Milicia and Los Maniacos, but prior to the match La Sociedads leader Konnan announced that Cibernético had decided to turn his back on AAA and join his team instead. AAA bought Konnan's claim and replaced Cibernético and Octagón, who was injured in a backstage assault by someone resembling Cibernético (later revealed as Super Fly), in the match with Dark Ozz and Dark Cuervo. However, in the end Cibernético interfered in the match and helped AAA pick up the win. Afterwards, Cibernético, upset with AAA and in particular his friend La Parka for believing he had turned on the company, decided to re–form Los Bizarros with Amadeus, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo. On November 22 Los Bizarros solidified their statuses as tweeners by attacking not only La Sociedad, but also La Parka. On December 5, 2010, at Guerra de Titanes Charly Manson was revealed as {{the newest member of}} Los Bizarros, as he made a surprise jump from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) back to AAA. During Cibernético's and La Parka's heated rivalry it was implied that Cibernético had assaulted and hospitalized Parka's three-year-old son, his own godson. On March 13, 2011, La Milicia and La Sociedad member Billy el Malo, who had been secretly working for Cibernético since at least October 2010, made a jump to Los Bizarros. In May, La Parka formed his own group El Inframundo ("The Underworld") to counteract Los Bizarros.

On October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, both Cibernético and La Parka took part in the Copa Antonio Peña gauntlet match and ended up causing each other's eliminations from the match. Later in the event, the rivalry took a surprise twist, when Parka turned rudo and joined La Sociedad. Cibernético finalized his technico turn on December 1 by feigning joining La Sociedad, before turning on them and being beaten down and bloodied by Los Perros del Mal. On March 18, 2012, at Rey de Reyes, Cibernético, Billy el Malo and Escoria defeated La Parka, Dark Dragon and Tito Santana in what was billed as the final chapter in the rivalry between Cibernético and Parka.
