5|$|The Daleks in London, {{commissioned}} on 25 May 1971, {{was to be}} {{the final}} story of Season 9 in 1972, re-introducing the Daleks after a five-year absence. Little is known about the exact storyline of the six-part Robert Sloman serial, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it would have had some similarities to The Dalek Invasion of Earth, except set in contemporary London. This similarity caused the production team some concern, and producer Barry Letts eventually decided that he would rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead of ending it with one. An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale.|$|E
25|$|The {{two plays}} are {{unrelated}} <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that they are}} both based on another play which is now lost. This is the Ur-Shrew theory (in reference to Ur-Hamlet).|$|E
25|$|O. Hashnu Hara. Although {{is hard to}} find {{concrete}} evidence, {{the first}} clue is always the impossibility to find information about the writer, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he wrote books published by Atkinson. Books under this name include: Practical Yoga; Concentration; and Mental Alchemy, all books with titles similar to other Atkinson's books.|$|E

25|$|February: Unidentified. Murdered {{sometime}} in February 1981. Nilsen recalled little about this victim, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> he was originally from Belfast, was slim, approximately 5ft.9in. tall, and was aged {{in his early}} 20s. He had encountered this victim somewhere in the West End after the pubs had closed. He was strangled with a tie and his body subsequently placed beneath the floorboards.|$|E
25|$|Little is {{documented}} on the specifics {{and the basic}} model of the D.33, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that it had a}} fixed undercarriage, and was a low-wing cantilever monoplane. There were three documented variations to the model, each of which was designed as a separate aircraft. This line of aircraft were regarded highly commercially before World War II, and they were influential in the establishment of the Dewoitine Company.|$|E
25|$|He is {{separated}} from his mother, who lives in Ohio, but they {{talk on the phone}} frequently and have a close relationship. (At the time the Achewood cookbook came out, she was in Iowa.) <b>Other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he is deceased, nothing is known about Philippe's father, although he appeared in one strip thus far in a dream. He is implied to be of French descent, and to have fought in a war as a youth. From time to time, Philippe's mother sends him unusual presents.|$|E

Little is said of {{his reign}} in <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> bare <b>facts</b> that he became king, and was then deposed and exiled in 774. Symeon of Durham's Historia Regum Anglorum reports that he fled to {{the kingdom of the}} Picts, where he was {{received}} by King Ciniod.|$|R
50|$|Reno Rumble was {{a reality}} program which began airing on the Nine Network on 5 May 2015, that pit teams from House Rules against teams from Nine's TV series The Block.

25|$|The {{practice}} of baking Easter breads, {{also known as}} hot cross buns, have been documented to exist {{at least since the}} 1500s. Two cross-marked buns have also been found in the Roman city of Herculaneum in modern-day Italy dating back as early as 79 CE. The Irish in particular have been known to bake a key {{in the shape of a}} cross inside the bread during the Easter period. It is uncertain, however, how cross buns are similar to shlissel challah, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that people have always made signs or symbols on their bread.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{military}} Smith was elected treasurer in DeKalb County, {{little is known}} about him <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he designed his home in the 200 block of Sycamore's Somonauk Street. F.W. Partridge was an attorney who began his legal career in the DeKalb County city of Sandwich, Illinois. Later, when he moved to Sycamore, he achieved some notoriety in that profession. During the Civil War Partridge was a breveted Brigadier General. Toward {{the end of the war}} he served as DeKalb County Clerk and Recorder; from 1864-1867. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him as ambassador to Siam.|$|E
25|$|In 1888 Roberts {{moved to}} Chicago {{where he worked}} as a site {{superintendent}} for S.S. Beman at Pullman, {{on the south side of}} the city. Roberts remained at that job until 1893. Roberts moved to the Chicago suburb of Oak Park in 1893 and established his own practice which eventually grew to become the largest architecture firm in the village of Oak Park, rivaling even architecture giant Frank Lloyd Wright's practice. In Oak Park he designed over 200 homes which span a multitude of architectural styles. Wright and Roberts were not, themselves, professionally associated, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they were competing architects.|$|E

5000|$|The core of Radbruch's legal {{philosophy}} consists of his tenets {{the concept of}} law {{and the idea of}} law. The idea of law is defined through a triad of justice, utility and certainty. Radbruch thereby had the idea of utility or usefuleness spring forth from an analysis of the idea of justice. Upon this notion was based the Radbruch formula, which is still vigorously debated today. The concept of law, for Radbruch, is [...] "nothing <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> given <b>fact,</b> which has <b>the</b> sense to serve the idea of law." ...|$|R
25|$|On December 21, Vivendi {{announced}} a Game Boy Advance version of The Fellowship {{would also be}} released. Developed by Pocket Studios, the game was to be called Lord of the Rings, Part I, and was to feature the full plot of The Fellowship and roughly half of The Two Towers. This would be followed soon after by Lord of the Rings, Part II, featuring {{the second half of}} Two Towers and all of Return of the King. Vivendi revealed little about the games <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they were to be more RPG based than the Xbox Fellowship game, and would be played from an isometric three-quarter top-down view.|$|E
25|$|Ties That Bind {{was first}} {{referred}} to in late 2004, when Midway Games released an earnings statement in which it spoke of the financial success of the first game. No other information was revealed at the time, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that a sequel was in development. On January 19, 2005, Midway revealed the game would be released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and was being developed by Surreal Software, the same team who had worked on the first game. They also announced the title, and revealed the game would begin moments {{after the end of}} the first game, but the intro sequence would depend on which ending the player received in the first game, assuming they still had a saved game file.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{among the}} Ghilji reveal strong links between tribal affiliation and {{membership in the}} larger ummah (Islamic community). Afghan historians believe that most Pashtuns are descendants of Qais Abdur Rashid, who is purported {{to have been an}} early convert to Islam and thus bequeathed the faith to the early Pashtun population. The legend says that after Qais heard of the new religion of Islam, he travelled to meet Muhammad in Medina and returned to Afghanistan as a Muslim. He purportedly had four children: Sarban, Batan, Ghourghusht and Karlan. Before the Islamization of their territory, the Pashtuns likely followed various religions. Some may have been Buddhists while others Zoroastians, worshippers of the sun, or worshippers of Nana, with some probably being animists, shamanists and Jews. However, there is no conclusive evidence to these theories <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that these were the religions practiced by the people in this region before the arrival of Islam in the 7th century.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{give an account}} of two {{seemingly}} equivalent verbs: Swedish 'gå' and Dutch 'gaan' and will focus principally on the way these verbs can be used in constructions with ingressive and future-directed meaning. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that the two verbs are used similarly in a surprisingly small part of the studied material. It was also shown that this was often caused by <b>other</b> reasons <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> Swedish verb has a more specific meaning than Dutch gaan that can function as a auxiliary to express future...|$|R
5000|$|Document 2RAD-2004-601189-ELC, {{is given}} the synopsis: [...] "Abu-Zubaydah Statement on the Capability of al-Qaidah to Manufacture and Deliver Nuclear Weapons to the U.S." [...] Abu Zubaydah was {{captured}} in Pakistan in March 2002 and {{is believed to be}} the highest-ranking member of al-Qaeda to be held. There is no indication that this document links Abu Zubaydah to Iraq in any way. Professor Fritz Umbach notes, [...] "the 'statement' itself is nothing more than an Arabic summary of a 2002 CBS News story on Zubaydah's claims. It has no identifiable link to Iraq, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> odd <b>fact</b> that it appears on a U.S. government site billed as Operation Iraqi Freedom Documents." ...|$|R
50|$|Matthew {{had been}} the Chancellor of Scotland in the late reign of king Alexander II of Scotland. He was {{appointed}} in 1227 {{after the death of}} Thomas, Archdeacon of Lothian. His name indicates that he was a Gael or had some personal connection with Gaeldom, but we do not know anything else about his background, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> perhaps <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he supposedly had some kind of defect of birth. Matthew was postulated to the see of Aberdeen, before in turn being postulated to the higher-ranking See of Dunkeld. He was not consecrated as bishop of Aberdeen, and probably died before being consecrated for Dunkeld. He died in 1229.|$|R
500|$|Declan {{was raised}} by single mother, Rebecca. They moved around a lot as Rebecca was running away from her abusive partner, and Declan's father, Richard (Blair Venn). Declan knew nothing about Richard, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Rebecca {{referred}} {{to him as a}} [...] "monster". Rebecca often struggles to pay the bills and Declan turned to crime to raise money.|$|E
500|$|However, not all reviews were positive. The same review from The Plain Dealer [...] {{expressed}} displeasure at how, [...] "after 150 {{pages of}} romantic dithering, I was tapping my foot to move on."

Except— why? There's little distinction between the two thinly imagined guys, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Peeta has a dopier name. Collins conjures none of the erotic energy that makes Twilight, for instance, so creepily alluring." ...|$|E
500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> they were all inside a Number Nine, I just {{thought it would be}} nice to have an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown at the end of the episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E
25|$|Doom’s honor code {{led him to}} save Captain America from {{drowning}} because Captain America {{had earlier}} saved his life, and on another occasion he thanked Spider-Man for saving him from terrorists attacking him in an airport by allowing him to leave alive despite Spider-Man subsequently insulting him. His code of honor also means {{that he will not}} attack a respected opponent who is weakened or at a severe disadvantage, as he regards any victory resulting from such circumstances as hollow and meaningless. He has even on several occasions battled opponents who were intent on killing the Fantastic Four, for no <b>other</b> reason <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he does not want the ultimate defeat of the Fantastic Four to come from anyone’s hands but his own.|$|R

In this issue, Lyall et al.

In {{much the same way}} as music produced by a quartet differs from that produced by each instrument, compared with the sensations produced by individual tastants, in mixtures they can produce an entirely different taste sensation, increase the intensity of one of the tastants, or, as shown in the work of Lyall et al.

40|$|Governing fast-growing {{metropolitan}} areas is always difficult, {{and the history}} of Auckland governance is no exception. This is so for no <b>other</b> reason <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they keep growing: as population increases the alignment of urban and jurisdictional boundaries breaks down, creating problems of coordination and fragmenting decision making. In addition, the increasingly complex pattern of councils results in tax exporting and what economists describe as spillovers, where peri-urban councils benefit from the expenditure of their larger neighbours while areas further out question the local benefits of centrally-based facilities. Consider, for example, the debate over the Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Act 2008. Past reform to increase coordination of regional activities while retaining representation of the interests of local ratepayers has often had the appearance of closing the barn door after the horse has bolted. 1 Will it be any different this time...|$|R

[...] "I don't have any really good reason why it took so long <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that I was waiting for Michael Jackson's new album to come out," [...] Yankovic explained. Unfortunately for Yankovic, the new album hit several snags. On November 26, 1991, Michael Jackson's new album, Dangerous was released. After hearing the hit single [...] "Black or White," [...] Yankovic {{approached}} Jackson about a potential parody entitled [...] "Snack All Night." [...] Although Jackson was a big supporter of Yankovic's work, he felt that a parody might damage the song's message. Jackson told Yankovic that he could, if he wanted to, parody another song off his album, but just not [...] "Black or White".|$|E
