40|$|The {{cholinergic}} {{nervous system}} has been demonstrated to attenuate the inflammatory response during sepsis via the inhibitory action of acetylcholine (ACh) on macrophages. These findings were largely based on experimental sepsis models using endotoxin as the inducing agent. Herein, however, we report that the specific inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) renders animals more resistant to infection by a virulent strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a Gram-negative enteric pathogen. Inhibition of AChE was induced by a subchronic exposure to paraoxon, a potent anti-cholinesterase metabolite of the <b>organophosphorous</b> <b>compound</b> parathion. Our findings indicate that inhibition of AChE enhanced survival of infected mice in a dose-dependent fashion and this correlated with efficient control of bacterial proliferation in target organs. Immunologically, inhibition of AChE enabled the animals to mount a more effective inflammatory anti-microbial response, and to secrete higher levels of interleukin- 12, a key T helper type 1 -promoting cytokine. The ACh-induced enhancement in resistance to infection was abrogated by co-administration of an oxime which can reactivate AChE.

Results: The most commonly ingested poisons were odollam (26 %) and organophosphorous compounds (22 %). The overall mortality was 22 %.

40|$|O-isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate, {{also known}} as sarin or GB, is a highly toxic <b>organophosphorous</b> <b>compound</b> that exerts its effect by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.

Previous studies in the rat and guinea pig have demonstrated that multiple exposures result in tolerance to themiotic effect of nerve agents.

Multiple whole-body inhalationexposures toGBvaporwereconducted inadynamic airflow chamber. Exposures lasted 60 min and each of the three exposures occurred at 24 -h intervals. The results of the present study demonstrate that the a-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine and theb-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol did not affect the development of tolerance to the miotic effect of GB vapor, suggesting that enhanced sympathetic tone to the eye is not responsible for the observed tolerance. Administration of atropine before the first exposure prevented the tolerance to the miotic effect ofGBvapor after the third exposure, suggesting that the tolerance is the result of muscarinic receptor desensitization secondary to receptor stimulation.

Materials and methods. The study was conducted on male rats weighing 160 — 230 g. Models of intoxications with ethanol, dichloroethane, carbofos, armine, or sodium nitrite in the doses causing 30 — 50 % death were employed. LPO products were studied in the lipid extracts of the brain, myocardium, and liver by various methods. The activity {{of a number of}} enzymes (catalase, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, Na+, K+-ATPase) was evaluated in the rats.

Quantitative histochemistry was used to determine the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, NAD-diaphorase, and Na+, K+-ATPase. The number of chemical reactions was measured and estimated on a MT- 9 TV analyzer microscope. Experimental findings were analyzed by different variation statistical methods using Student’s test.

The paper reports the results of comprehensive experimental studies of the efficiency of correction of prooxidative-antioxidative imbalance after severe acute intoxication with chemical prooxidants and some lipophilic xenobiotics.

Organophosphorous pesticide poisonings are common in developing worlds including Iran and Sri Lanka. Nerve agents were used during the Iraq-Iran war in 1983 - 1988 and in a terrorist attack in Japan in 1994 - 1995. Following decontamination, depending on the severity of intoxication the administration of atropine to counteract muscarinic over-stimulation, and an oxime to reactivate acetyl cholinesterase are indicated. Supportive and intensive care therapy including diazepam to control convulsions and mechanical respiration may be required. Recent investigations have revealed that intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate to produce mild to moderate alkalinization is effective. Gacyclidine; an antiglutamatergic compound, was also proved to be beneficial in conjunction with atropine, pralidoxime, and diazepam in nerve agent poisoning.
