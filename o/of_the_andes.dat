40|$|Abstract. Averaged n-Dependence Estimators (AnDE) is {{a family}} of {{learning}} algorithms that range from low variance coupled with high bias through to high variance coupled with low bias. <b>The</b> asymptotic error <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lowest bias variant is the Bayes optimal. <b>The</b> <b>AnDE</b> family <b>of</b> algorithms have a training time that is linear {{with respect to the}} training examples, learn in a single pass through the data, support incremental learning, handle missing values directly and are robust in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> noise. These characteristics make the algorithms particularly well suited to learning from large data. However, for higher orders of n they are very computationally demanding. This paper presents data structures and algorithms developed to reduce both memory and time for training and classification. These enhancements have enabled the evaluation and comparison of A 3 DE’s effectiveness.

5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Andes,</b> it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on the eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Andes.</b> This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Andes)</b> that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E
5|$|Although Artigas was {{defeated}} by the Luso-Brazilian armies, his allies Estanislao López and Francisco Ramírez continued hostilities against Buenos Aires for its inactivity against the invasion. Pueyrredón called the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> and the Army of the North (led by Belgrano) to aid Buenos Aires in the conflict. Guido noted to San Martín that if both armies did that, the north of Argentina and Chile would be easily reconquered by the royalists. San Martín also knew {{that most of the}} soldiers of the Army <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Andes</b> would not be willing to aid Buenos Aires in the civil war, as most were from other provinces or from Chile.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{quantify}} the relationship between <b>the</b> kinematics <b>of</b> subduction, deformation in the overriding plate and <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> slab geometry. A 2 -D finite element numerical code is used, and a first objective consists in benchmarking previously published analogue models. Far-field plate velocities are applied, and once the subducting plate reaches the 660 km discontinuity, modelled as a rigid base, we obtain two different forms or styles of subduction that depend on the overriding plate velocity vop: if vop > 0, the slab lies forwards on the 660 km discontinuity (style 1), and if vop≤ 0, the slab lies backwards on the discontinuity (style 2). We also obtain a cyclic pattern with the slab folding on itself repeatedly when vsp > 0 and 2 vop+vsp > 0 (where vsp is the subducting plate velocity). These conditions result from <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> several simulations in which the subduction velocities and plate viscosities are varied. When the slab periodically folds on the 660 km discontinuity, periods of shallow slab dip and compression in the overriding plate are followed by periods of slab steepening and relative extension in the overriding plate. Folding periodicity is controlled by the slab viscosity and subduction velocity. When a low-viscosity zone is included in the overriding plate, the trench motion is effectively decoupled from the overriding plate velocity, therefore allowing it to be directly controlled by <b>the</b> deep dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slab. For the cyclic style 2 corresponding to forward folding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slab, the low-viscosity region in the overriding plate increases the stress amplitudes oscillations, the trench motion and the folding periodicity with time. Therefore <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire overriding plate is shown to directly control <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> subduction. Using <b>the</b> Nazca and South American plate velocities we produce models of cyclic folding with a period of ca. 22 Ma and a minimal dip angle of ca. 10 °.
