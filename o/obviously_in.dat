5|$|Stephen invaded Székely Land {{multiple}} times in 1461. Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, decided to support Peter Aaron, giving him shelter in his capital at Buda. In 1462, Stephen underscored his wish for {{good relations with}} the Ottoman Empire, expelling from Moldavia the Franciscans, who were agitating for a united church and a crusade. Stephen continued to pay the yearly tribute to the Ottoman Empire initiated by his predecessor. He also made a new agreement with Poland in Suceava on 2 March 1462, promising to personally swear fealty to Casimir IV if the king required it. This treaty declared that Casimir was the sole suzerain of Moldavia, prohibiting Stephen from alienating Moldavian territories without his authorization. It also obliged Stephen to recapture the Moldavian territories that had been lost, <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> reference to Chilia.|$|E
5|$|Kingship was {{the major}} form of {{political}} organisation in the early Middle Ages, with competing minor kingdoms and fluid relationships of over- and under-kingdoms. The primary function of these kings was as war leaders, {{but there were also}} ritual elements to kingship, evident in ceremonies of coronation. The Kingdom of Alba, which emerged from the unification of the Scots and Picts in the tenth century, retained some of these ritual aspects, most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> the coronation ceremony at Scone. While the Scottish monarchy remained a largely itinerant institution, Scone remained one of its most important locations, with royal castles at Stirling and Perth becoming significant in the later Middle Ages before Edinburgh developed as a capital {{in the second half of}} the fifteenth century. The Scottish crown grew in prestige throughout the era and adopted the conventional offices of western European courts and later elements of their ritual and grandeur.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins are {{of nearly}} equal size and placed far {{back on the}} body, with the first {{originating}} over the latter third of the pelvic fin bases and the second over {{the latter half of}} the anal fin base. The pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded; the males have stout claspers. The pelvic and anal fins are about as large as the dorsal fins. The broad caudal fin comprises about a fifth of the total body length and has a strong notch near the tip of the upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-calcified arrowhead-shaped dermal denticles. The coloration of the dark shyshark is highly variable, and particular individuals can resemble any of the other shyshark species. The background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above, transitioning abruptly to white or cream below, sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins. There may be 68 orange, brown, or blackish variably shaped saddles along the back and tail, edged more or less <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> black. There may also be white spots within or within and between the saddles.|$|E

Although, overall, it is less {{geographically}} accurate than its Chinese cousin, most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> the depiction of rivers and small islands, it does feature some improvements (particularly the depictions of Korea and Japan, and a less cramped version of Africa).|$|E
25|$|The frescoes' {{effect on}} Renaissance artists was instant and {{profound}} (it {{can be seen}} most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> Raphael's decoration for the loggias in the Vatican), and the white walls, delicate swags, and bands of friezeframed reserves containing figures or landscapeshave returned at intervals ever since, notably in late 18th century Neoclassicism, making Famulus {{one of the most}} influential painters in the history of art.|$|E

25|$|For Andrew Schapper, Wild Seed is {{an entry}} {{point to the}} “ethics of {{controlled}} evolution” that permeate Butler’s novels, most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> the Xenogenesis trilogy. As an early novel on the subject, Wild Seed betrays Butler’s anxiety that eugenic manipulation and selective breeding could lead to an unethical abuse of power and thus she counters it with a “Judeo-Christian ethical approach to the sanctity of human life” represented by the character of Anyanwu.|$|E
25|$|The Metro has a {{distinctive}} design and corporate identity, to distinguish {{itself from the}} decrepit rail system it replaced and to match the livery of the buses then in use. The Calvert typeface, used for signage and in printed materials, was designed specifically for the Metro by Margaret Calvert. The corporate identity was revised in 1998, de-emphasising the Calvert font, and adding the word Metro to its M logo. A further revision made in 2008, and subsequently rolled out, re-emphasises the Calvert font, most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> posters and in signage at the refurbished Haymarket station in the centre of Newcastle.|$|E
25|$|The Type F was {{a single}} seat biplane with the same layout as all other Caudron landbased biplanes before it, apart from the Type B Multiplace. They were all twin boom tractor {{configuration}} aircraft with a short central nacelle and twin fins. Compared to the Type B to Type E range, the Type F differed most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> the nacelle design and the vertical tail shape. By 1913, when the Type F appeared, {{at least one of}} each of the earlier types had been modified from an equal span biplane to a sesquiplane; like the Type E, the Type F was a sesquiplane from the start.|$|E

25|$|César de Hauke’s {{catalogue}} raisonné of {{the works}} of Seurat lists fourteen works as oil studies for the Bathers, most if not all of which were almost certainly painted outdoors, and in which the composition of the final piece may be seen gradually taking shape. The last of these studies—presently housed at the Art Institute of Chicago—was painted in 1883 and is very close to the final work, except most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> respect of its size; it is just 25cm long and 16cm high. Seurat was fond of these small studies, calling them his croquetons (a nonce word best translated as ‘sketchettes’), and hanging them on the walls of his studio.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{recurrent}} {{themes of}} these painstakingly detailed new theories {{was the idea}} that humans may not perceive colours in isolation but rather, that one colour may be seen to interfere with another colour neighbouring it. In this way, colour perception was explained as a complex, interpretive process, rather than a static and simple record of visual data. Seurat’s response to the theories in these writings is widely evident in the Bathers, most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> such areas as those of the torso and legs of the man seated centre-left on the persimmon-orange cushion, and of the central figure as his back contrasts with light blue water and his arm contrasts with water of a darker hue.|$|E
25|$|High Tech {{architecture}} also owes {{a debt to}} Constructivism, most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> Richard Rogers' Lloyd's building. Zaha Hadid's early {{projects were}} adaptations of Malevich's Architektons, {{and the influence of}} Chernikhov is clear on her drawings. Deconstructivism evokes the dynamism of Constructivism, though without the social aspect, as in the work of Coop Himmelb(l)au. In the late 1970s Rem Koolhaas wrote a parable on the political trajectory of Constructivism called The Story of the Pool, in which Constructivists escape from the USSR in a self-powering Modernist swimming pool, only to die, after being criticised for much the same reasons as they were under Stalinism, soon after their arrival in the USA. Meanwhile, many of the original Constructivist buildings are poorly preserved or in danger of imminent demolition.|$|E

25|$|Oceaan 7 {{was very}} small for the purpose to which it was being put. The cramped living {{accommodation}} and lack of privacy on board soon caused tensions among the personnel. It proved difficult to maintain the vessel in position off Scarborough as the winter storms came. In November 1966 one storm was so severe that waves were breaking over the vessel's deck and water entered the living quarters and studio. The station carried on broadcasting through {{the early part of}} the storm although the presenters were <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> fear for their lives. Listeners on-shore (including 270 staff member Paul Burnett) were horrified by what was happening. In the aftermath of the storm, the station went off the air for 8 days while repairs were carried out.|$|E

500|$|The debt to Nietzsche is clear, most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> the {{adoption}} of a genealogical method as a tool of explanation and critique. Although part of Williams's intention was to attack those he felt denied the value of truth, the book cautions that, to understand it simply in that sense, would be to miss part of its purpose; rather, as Kenneth Baker wrote, it is [...] "Williams' reflection on the moral cost of the intellectual vogue for dispensing with the concept of truth." ...|$|E

[...] And you realize that the answer lies somewhere in a complex web of all kinds of stuff, like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [...] lucky breaks." [...] She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, <b>obviously,</b> <b>in</b> creating new ones." ...|$|E
500|$|Sherwood's {{vigorous}} anti-Catholicism appears most <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> {{her works}} from the 1820s and 1830s. During the 1820s in Britain, Catholics were agitating for greater civil rights {{and it was at}} this time that Sherwood wrote her most sustained attacks against them. When the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 was passed, Sherwood and many like her were frightened of the influence that Catholics might gain in the government. Therefore, she wrote Victoria (1833), The Nun (1833) and The Monk of Cimies (1834) in order to illustrate some of the dangers of Catholicism. The Monk narrates, in the first person, Edmund Etherington's decision to renounce the Church of England and join the Catholic church. While a monk, he ridicules his fellow brothers, plans a murder and debauches a young woman. But evangelicals were not all in agreement on the issue of Catholic Emancipation and some were uncomfortable with these books; one evangelical reviewer called The Monk of Cimies [...] "unfair and unconvincing." ...|$|E
500|$|In pre-Code Hollywood, the sex film became {{synonymous with}} women's {{pictures}} — Darryl F. Zanuck once told Wingate {{that he was}} ordered by Warner Brothers' New York corporate office to reserve 20% of the studio's output for [...] "women's pictures, which inevitably means sex pictures." [...] Vice films typically tacked on endings where the most sin-filled characters were either punished or redeemed. Films explored Code-defying subjects in an unapologetic manner with the premise that an end-reel moment could redeem all that had gone before. The concept of marriage was often tested in films such as The Prodigal (1931), {{in which a woman}} is {{having an affair with a}} seedy character, and later falls in love with her brother-in-law. When her mother-in-law steps in at the end of the film, it is to encourage one son to grant his wife a divorce so she can marry his brother, with whom she is <b>obviously</b> <b>in</b> love. The older woman proclaims the message of the film in a line near the end: [...] "This the twentieth century. Go out into the world and get what happiness you can." ...|$|E
