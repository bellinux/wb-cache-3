In the colonial period, the Spanish introduced new raw materials, new techniques and products but the rise of industrially produced products lowered the demand for most handcrafts by the early 20th century. The introduction of highways in the middle part of the century brought tourism to the region and with it a new market for traditional handcrafts.

500|$|The third {{reason the}} product was brought back was because of a new {{approach}} the company was taking regarding LTO products; instead of putting out large numbers <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>that</b> may only appeal to a small audience, it instead would only add a smaller amount <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>that</b> have broader market appeal.

The idea of reintroducing older products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product by allowing a company to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain already which is already established to deliver the product ingredients.

500|$|A {{primary reason}} {{the product was}} brought back was because of a new {{approach}} the company was taking regarding new and limited time offering (LTO) products. [...] Instead of putting out large numbers <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>that</b> may only appeal to a small audience, it would only add a smaller amount <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>that</b> have broader market appeal. Along with its BK Chicken Fries product, the Big King {{was part of that}} goal, with the reintroduction utilizing a three prong approach: its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact, a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns, and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company probably should have thought about before discontinuing. The idea of reintroducing older, possibly discontinued products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product. In many cases the reintroduction allows these companies to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain which is already established to deliver the product ingredients while catering to the public's feelings of nostalgia for these products. The limited-time offers allow chains to bring [...] "new" [...] products to the menu without adding permanent complexity to their kitchen operations.

500|$|In {{addition}} to natural insemination by rams, artificial insemination and embryo transfers {{have been used}} in sheep breeding programs for many years in Australia and New Zealand. These programs have become more commonplace in the United States during the 2000s as the number of veterinarians qualified to perform these types of procedures with proficiency have grown. However, ovine AI is a relatively complicated procedure compared to other livestock. Unlike cattle or goats, which have straight cervices that can be vaginally inseminated, ewes have a curved cervix which is more difficult to access. Additionally, breeders were until recently unable to control their ewe's estrus cycles. The ability to control the estrus cycle is much easier today because <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>that</b> safely assist in aligning heat cycles. [...] Some examples of products are PG600, CIDRs, Estrumate and Folltropin V. [...] These products contain progesterone which will bring on the induction of estrus in ewes (sheep) during seasonal anestrus. Seasonal anestrus is when ewes do not have regular estrous cycles outside the natural breeding season.|$|E
