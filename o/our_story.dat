25|$|In early 1995, Rob Riley, {{an activist}} with the Aboriginal Legal Service, {{published}} Telling <b>Our</b> <b>Story.</b> It described the large-scale {{negative effects of}} past government policies {{that resulted in the}} removal of thousands of mixed-race Aboriginal children from their families and their being reared in a variety of conditions in missions, orphanages, reserves, and white foster homes.|$|E

25|$|The new group, {{formed on}} 3 July 1998, was renamed Westside but that name {{was already in}} use by another band, so it was changed to Westlife. In Westlife – <b>Our</b> <b>Story,</b> Byrne {{revealed}} that, unlike {{the others in the}} group, he was keen to change the name to West High. McFadden also changed the spelling of his name to Bryan {{to make it easier to}} sign autographs. Boyzone singer Ronan Keating was brought in to co-manage the group with Walsh. The band then released an EP titled Swear It Again.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, Oz sent imprisoned former Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti {{a copy of}} {{his book}} A Tale of Love and Darkness in Arabic {{translation}} with his personal dedication in Hebrew: “This story is <b>our</b> <b>story,</b> I hope you read it and understand us as we understand you, hoping to see you outside and in peace, yours, Amos Oz”. The gesture was criticized by members of rightist political parties, among them Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely. Assaf Harofeh Hospital canceled Oz's invitation to give the keynote speech at an awards ceremony for outstanding physicians in the wake of this incident.|$|E
25|$|Daniels began {{painting}} in the 1980s with the anthropologist Francoise Dussart. She began by painting ancestral designs on acrylic canvas in a style that {{has become known as}} Aboriginal ‘dot’ painting. Her paintings adhere very strongly to traditional templates for painting, but creativity {{can be seen in the}} handling of the painting, arrangement of the motifs and size and placement of the dots. Her work is made most distinguishable due to their bright colours and intricate patterns. Her works celebrate Australian Aboriginal Dreaming and culture and thoroughly invoked the Warlipiri concepts of ‘country’, ‘home’ and ‘camp’ in her work. She painted both her own and her father’s dreamings and states “it is <b>our</b> <b>story</b> - Aboriginal people’s story”.|$|E

25|$|In 1987, for Proteus Theatre Company, Constable devised Forgotten But Not Gone for actors with {{learning}} difficulties. He was {{artistic director of}} the company during 1989. In the 1990s, he wrote many children's plays for Proteus, including adaptations of Maeterlinck's The Bluebird, Thackeray's The Rose and The Ring, Dickens' A Christmas Carol, Rumpelstiltskin and The Emperor's New Clothes. As {{artistic director of the}} community arts group, Southwark Mysteries, he conducted children's workshops in schools and community centres. His popular workshops included the Our Place and <b>Our</b> <b>Story</b> programmes, which used local history and cultural identity as springboards for the participants' own devised work. His George And The Dragon workshops, first performed in schools in south London, were taken to Cumbria as part of an anti-racist programme. In 2014, he was the dramaturg for Half Moon Young People's Theatre's #LimehouseLandmark programme, featuring devised performances inspired by the history of their building in Limehouse.|$|E
500|$|The film began {{shooting}} in Manhattan, New York in 2006. [...] "I don't {{have much to}} compare it to, but the challenges were daunting," [...] said Schaefer, who directed several sequences outside The Dakota, the site of Lennon's assassination.

At all <b>our</b> <b>story</b> meetings he would say, 'Hey, Steven, you always said you wanted to shoot musicals.' I thought, 'Yeah, that could be fun.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Kreacher the house-elf, who {{was included in}} the script only at Rowling's request, has a larger part in the book than the film. In the novel, he is seen saving some of the Black family's artefacts which the Order of the Phoenix throw away, one of which is a locket which becomes extremely important in the seventh book. [...] "It was kind of tricky to raise that in <b>our</b> <b>story,</b> because it's for so much later", Yates said. [...] "We figured we can probably introduce it later, and that's the approach we took". Whilst Kreacher remained, all scenes involving Dobby were cut, and his important actions given to other characters.|$|E
500|$|The {{execution}} of Saddam Hussein, which Anwar had filmed {{from the internet}} from start to finish, was excluded from the documentary. [...] "We had a big debate {{about whether or not}} that should go into the film", O'Connor explained. Water continued, [...] "it {{was one of those things}} where to see it, it just gets you. But we had to ask ourselves, does it help <b>our</b> <b>story?</b> No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} renewed {{for a fourth}} season on March 3, 2016, earlier than usual for the series. Executive {{producer}} Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "We're thrilled to know going into the end of [...] with certainty {{that we will be}} returning, because we can build <b>our</b> <b>story</b> accordingly." [...] Executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen also noted that logistics for hiring directors for the season in advance would be easier, [...] "which is a very nice privilege to have...that's a luxury." [...] The end of the episode [...] "What If..." [...] features an onscreen tribute to Bill Paxton, who died in February 2017 and had portrayed John Garrett in the series' first season. The series paid additional tribute to Paxton in [...] "All the Madame's Men" [...] with promos during The Bakshi Report news segment showcasing John Garrett as a fallen American hero. The end of [...] "World's End" [...] features a similar onscreen tribute to Powers Boothe, who died in May 2017 and had portrayed Gideon Malick in the series' third season.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Lisa Cowling, Jon Shave, and Tim Powell. Contrary to the verse-chorus form that is {{typically}} used in modern pop music, [...] "The Show" [...] opts for a less conventional song structure. It was noted for its intricacy. The song's lyrics, which contain an anti-promiscuity message, [...] "set in motion a writing style that would come to epitomise Girls Aloud's music." [...] In the group's 2008 autobiography Dreams That Glitter - <b>Our</b> <b>Story,</b> Cheryl Cole described Girls Aloud's cover of the Pointer Sisters' [...] "Jump" [...] as [...] "the point when we realized everything we'd been doing was quite down and moody [...] and that's not what people wanted." [...] As their first single following the cover, [...] "The Show" [...] served as an introduction to Girls Aloud's new sound, being [...] "their most risqué cut at the time." [...] Rather than the guitar that dominated the band's first three singles, [...] "The Show" [...] mostly utilises synthesisers. The synth rhythm was composed by a Xenomania musician named Jon Shave. MusicOMH contributor John Murphy deemed the track's composition similar to [...] "Love Machine", which he considered inspired by [...] "'80s synth pop." ...|$|E
500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. <b>Our</b> <b>story</b> takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will {{find a lot of}} what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E
500|$|... "Call the Shots" [...] is a dance-pop and pop rock track {{written in}} the key of D major and with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. Unlike previous singles released by the band, the song follows the verse–chorus form. The lyrics {{are concerned with the}} ending of a relationship, and opens with a repetitive melody followed by Coyle singing, [...] "Static tone on the phone, I'll be breaking again / Must be something better babe". As the chorus begins, the five members of the group trade lines and sing, [...] "Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me / It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time", with Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stating that [...] "only anterograde amnesia could wipe [...] from your brain". During the middle-eight, Roberts sings lyrics that were the inspiration for Girls Aloud's autobiography Dreams that Glitter – <b>Our</b> <b>Story,</b> released in 2008: [...] "I've seen life burn bright, seen it shimmer / Then fade like starlight to a glimmer, oh no / I've seen life flow by like a river / So full of twilight, dreams that glitter". Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that the instrumentation of [...] "Call the Shots" [...] was based on 1990s dance productions, and added that it incorporated [...] "oohs" [...] and [...] "ah ah ahs" [...] that [...] "reverberate around an infectious chorus," ...|$|E
