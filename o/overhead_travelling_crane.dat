50|$|Andrew Betts Brown MICE MINA (1841-1906) was a Scottish {{engineer}} and inventor. He invented the hydraulic crane and <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane.</b> He founded several companies including the Vauxhall Iron Works, which later evolved into Vauxhall Motors, {{and the huge}} British engineering firm Brown Brothers.|$|E
50|$|He {{is first}} listed as an “engineer” living {{back with his}} parents in Edinburgh in 1861. In 1862, living in Stockport, {{he took out a}} patent for the {{improvement}} of steam engines and boilers. In 1863 he purchased a former brewery in Vauxhall in London and created the Vauxhall Iron Works. In 1863 he invented an <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane,</b> which was successfully used to construct Blackfriars Bridge over the River Thames in central London.|$|E

50|$|Rather than {{transport}} girders {{from their}} base in Lyttelton, on 25 June 1906, Andersons opened a large foundry, (285 ft x 30 ft) to fabricate the steel on site. It was {{powered by a}} wood-burning boiler and steam engine, with electric lights and machines. Electric <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> and a cableway (or Blondin) eased on-site transport. A water turbine drove the stone crusher and concrete mixer (adverts from the period said they used 9,000 bags of Portland Cement).|$|R
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{external}} change was the two-story glass extension on {{one half of}} the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane.</b> An electrical substation, taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company EDF Energy while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern's main exhibition spaces.|$|E
5000|$|The Berrima {{line was}} the home of two [...] "Tin Hares". The first entered service in the late 1920s, having been {{converted}} from a 1926-7 Chevrolet truck. It was used to convey the Medway Colliery Mine Manager and his deputy between the Cement Works and the mine. At weekends, the railcar was used by maintenance staff. The car could operate in the forward direction only. To enable the vehicle to be turned, a vertical steel bar, with an eye-bolt on the top, ran up through the cab. A gantry crane located at the colliery was used to lift and turn it at that end of the line, whilst an <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> at the works performed the same job there.|$|E
50|$|When {{the work}} on bridges began beyond Knights Key, Coe {{outsourced}} {{the setting of the}} steel to various contractors. As this method proved unsuccessful, the operations were put exclusively in the hands of Coes own men. The deck girder spans were brought to the piers on barges, and were then lifted and set in place by floating derricks. The railway gangers completed their tasks in less than half the time taken by the contractors. On one occasion, six spans were placed in position within four hours, while on another the laborers erected a span in twenty minutes. The Bahia Honda bridge was built by means of temporary timber framework and an <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane.</b> The precautions taken to ensure the workers safety were such that not a life was lost during the erection of the 32,900 ft. of steel that went to the building of Knights Key and Bahia Honda bridges.|$|E

The verification of a static relief of the main truss by the auxiliary one as a function of rigidity of transverse and skew space trusses was performed. The A. Blum method was used in analytical calculations. The obtained results were verified by means of the ANSYS 12. 1 program utilising the finite element method (FEM) ...|$|R
50|$|Between mid-1883 {{and late}} 1884, planing and {{dressing}} machinery to work soft timbers such as pine, cedar and beech were acquired; the Eucalypta, an 85 ft long steamer, {{was built for}} Burnett to transport cypress pine from the Moreton Bay islands (Amity Point on Stradbroke Island, Coochiemudlo Island and Macleay Island) and hardwood from the Tweed Heads, Nerang, Coomera and Logan River districts to his mill, the timber being unloaded at Hilliards Creek; a wharf with a large <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> was erected on the creek about 300 yards below the mill buildings; a tramway was laid to transport logs from the wharf to the mill (in 1885 the tramway was extended about three-quarters of a mile to give {{direct access to the}} bay); and an 8-ton boiler was installed to generate the steam to drive the horizontal saw, circular saws, planning machines and lathes, which could produce 40,000 feet of dressed timber a week. The South Pacific Islanders had gone. In November 1884, Trafalgar Vale sawmill employed about 40 non-indentured workers, most of whom lived in cottages near the mill. By 1889 the number of employees had risen to 50. Several of Burnett's sons also worked in the family business.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a practical}} investigation into {{the magnitude of the}} vertical and lateral forces exerted, by electric <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes,</b> on their supporting structures during operation. The method of measuring the forces and the equipment used for the actual measurements are discussed, as well as the equipment used for the processing of the recoided date. The forces measured during the experiments, executed in two stages namely controlled conditions and normal operation, are discussed under the headings of vertical forces due to the weight of the crane and lead handled, and the lateral forces due to cross travel movement, skewing of the crane and acceleration/deceleration of the crane. It is shown that the vertical misalignment of the rails, together with the stiffness of the crane structure, has a large influence on the magnitude of the vertical forces. Drive wheel slip, tested under controlled conditions on two E-type cranes, proved to cause high lateral forces. Comparisons are made with the existing Codes of Practice {{as well as with the}} theoretical models of crane behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{failure rate}} of {{electric}} <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> supporting structures {{across the world}} is unacceptably high. Failures occur even when the supporting structures are designed within the relevant design codes. This demonstrates {{a lack of understanding}} of the dynamic behaviour of cranes in many design codes. The current South African loading code is simplistic with respect to crane supporting structure design, relying on empirical factors to determine the correct loads. While these factors lead to predicted forces in the correct range of values, the Eurocode’s methods are more scientifically based. In recognition of this the draft South African code predominantly incorporates the methods used by the Eurocode to calculate design forces for crane supporting structures. The purpose of this thesis was to use an existing numerical model to determine the wheel loads induced by a crane into the crane supporting structure through hoisting, normal longitudinal travel, skewing and rail misalignment. The numerically obtained forces were then compared with the design forces estimated in the current South African code and the Eurocode, in order to determine whether the factors and methods used in the codes are accurate. The current empirically based South African code was found to be highly conservative. In contrast the scientifically based design forces from the Eurocode were close to the numerically calculated forces, only failing to predict the behaviour of the crane in the case of skewing. Further work needs to be completed in the estimation of forces induced during this load case. Once this is achieved it is hoped that the better understanding of the crane forces adapted from the Eurocode into the draft South African code will lead to a reduction in failures of electric <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> supporting structures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear model predictive control scheme {{for the two}} main axes of an <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane,</b> which guarantees both tracking of desired trajectories for the crane load and an active damping of crane load oscillations. The main idea of the used NMPC algorithm consists in a minimization of the tracking error {{at the end of}} the prediction horizon. That way the computation load can be kept relatively small. The varying length of the rope is considered by gain-scheduling techniques. The position of the crane load is measured by a CMOS camera using the spatial filtering principle. Desired trajectories for the crane load position in the three-dimensional workspace can be tracked independently with high accuracy. Experimental results from an implementation on a test rig show a high control performance...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. In {{structural}} engineering practice the actions imposed by {{overhead travelling cranes}} onto the supporting structure are defined as static forces amplified by dynamic coefficients and applied as pseudo-static forces without taking the interaction between crane and supporting structure into account. To investigate the validity of this approach, the forces generated at the wheels of an experimental crane are measured, as the crane traverses on the supporting structure. The interaction at {{the wheels of the}} crane is also visually recorded. These wheel load results will also be used by other researchers, to calibrate a numerical model of the experimental system. A full-scale 5 ton electric <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> (EOTC) running on top of rails and a supporting structure, was designed and erected for research purposes. The crane has a span of 8. 3 m and wheel spacing of 4 m, which can be modified. The supporting structure consists of three simply supported mono-symmetric plate girders on each side, with a total length of 13. 8 m. This is supported by columns with a height of about 3. 5 m. This paper describes the calibration of this system for measurement purposes. A data acquisition system was implemented to capture forces, strains, deflections and accelerations at various points on the crane and the supporting structure as well as to measure the velocity of the crane. The forces at the crane wheels are measured through strain gauges on the end carriage load measuring system. The calibrated facility is used to investigate the behaviour of the crane and the supporting structure under regular and exceptional wheel loads, which are classified as follows: - Regular wheel loads occur during normal payload hoisting and lowering, longitudinal crane travel with payload and lateral crab travel with payload. - Exceptional wheel loads occur during eccentric payload hoisting (payload outside normal operational area), impact forces on end-stops, maximum hoisting of the payload, failure of a longitudinal drive mechanism of the crane, misalignment of the supporting structure and skewing of the crane. The maximum values of these experimentally determined wheel loads and the dynamic response of the system is used to help describe the behaviour of the electric <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> and its supporting structure...|$|E
40|$|Intermediate {{diaphragms}} are invariably {{included in}} the design of <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> box-girders. This study concerns the influence of these diaphragms and their spacing on the global characteristic behaviour of the girder. In particular the action of internal diaphragms in the control of stresses associated with distortional deformation is investigated. The details and results of experimental tests on scale models of two crane geometries are presented. A method of analysis is developed to describe the distortional deformation of crane box-girder geometries using discrete box section elements. This method is assessed by comparison with both the experimental results and finite element analysis conducted for a range of configurations. It is shown to produce adequate predictions for use in further investigations. The theory is applied (by means of computer analysis of different crane box arrangements) to perform a study of the influence of intermediate diaphragms on both transverse distortional bending and longitudinal distortional warping. The results of this study are then incorperated into a series of design recommendations for the selection of cross section geometry and the positioning of diaphragms with particular reference to the control of these distortional effects...|$|E
40|$|An {{overarching}} {{investigation was}} conducted to provide engineers with guidelines for designing crane supporting structures. The focus {{of this study was}} to determine whether the identified parameters had an effect on the end buffer impact force history when the electric <b>overhead</b> <b>travelling</b> <b>crane</b> collides with the end stops of the supporting structure. Seven design codes which were reviewed do not consider the crane and its supporting structure as a coupled system. This simplification ignores some of the parameters which have a significant influence on the impact force, which could lead to the codified estimates being sometimes unconservative. During the experimental tests it was discovered that some of the parameters could not be accurately controlled and/or monitored. This led to the development of a finite element (FE) model of the full-scale experimental configuration which was used to conduct advanced simulations. The FE model considered the crane and the supporting structure as a coupled system, in which the parameters were individually varied to obtain its effect on the impact force history. The results showed that some of the individual parameters do have a significant effect on the impact force history...|$|E

40|$|Research objective: {{assessment}} {{of the impact of}} crane loading on safe operation of building by using probabilistic methods; taking into account accumulation of damage in building’s structural elements occurring during operation period. Materials and methods: current computational schemes exploit procedures that do not take into consideration all external effects and changes in structures occurring during operation period of an industrial building. They do not provide algorithms for {{assessment of}} spatial response of building’s structures if probabilistic methods are used. Results: the experimental and theoretical research carried out by the author resulted in more precise definitions for computational models and for computational methods of analysis of industrial buildings under the action of various crane loads, including those that are not considered by regulatory documents. The suggested models and methods will enable us to design bearing structures of frameworks in accordance with their real operating conditions.
