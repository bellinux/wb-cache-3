5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate {{was significantly lower}} than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. In the 1980s, gang activity was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise,</b> associated with crack cocaine. A task force was formed and was partially successful at reducing gang activity {{by a combination of}} removing gang-related graffiti and educating news sources to not name gangs in news reporting.|$|E
5|$|A. b. caama (Saint-Hilaire, 1803) : Known {{as the red}} {{hartebeest}} or Cape hartebeest. Formerly {{occurred in}} southern Angola; northern and eastern savannahs of Namibia; central, southern and southwestern Botswana; Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Free State, Northwest and Gauteng provinces and western KwaZulu-Natal of South Africa. Presently has been eliminated from all these areas except Northern Cape, central and southwestern Botswana and Namibia. Major re-introductions {{have taken place in}} these countries. The population of this hartebeest is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E

5|$|Corrective rape is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It {{is estimated that}} at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted, {{as reported by the}} Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Dozens of {{communities}} across America have suffered thefts of Baby Jesus figurines, and, in some instances, entire nativity scenes, Washington, D.C. journalist Daniel Nasaw reports for the British newspaper The Guardian.

5|$|On July 1, 2007, Kariya {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} worth $18 million with the St. Louis Blues. In similar fashion to his signing with Nashville, his arrival in St. Louis marked one of the team's first notable free agent acquisitions in a while (arguably since the team signed Brendan Shanahan in 1991). While the Predators were a team <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> when he joined them, the Blues had contrastingly missed the playoffs in the previous two seasons.|$|E

50|$|Another {{difference}} is that under most practical circumstances, dissolved gases, vapor pressure, and (sometimes) lack of adhesion with tube walls, conspire to render the tensile strength within the liquid ineffective for siphoning. Thus, unlike a chain which has significant tensile strength, liquids usually have little tensile strength under typical siphon conditions, and therefore <b>the</b> liquid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> side cannot be pulled up, {{in the way the}} chain is pulled up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> side.|$|R

5|$|The Blue-Green rivalry often {{erupted into}} gang warfare, and street {{violence}} had been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> in {{the reign of}} Justin I (r. 518–527), who took measures to restore order, when the gangs murdered a citizen in the Hagia Sophia.

5|$|The {{story of}} Carnivàle {{takes place in}} the mid-1930s during the worst of the Great Depression, a time of massive social and {{political}} upheaval. Unemployment rates were high, and European fascism was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise,</b> in the years leading up to the Second World War. People in the Great Plains suffered from the effects of the Dust Bowl. Farmers often not only ran into debt and lost their properties but also risked their health; dust pneumonia was a common cause of death.|$|E
5|$|According to {{statistics}} released by The Kennel Club, Cavaliers were the sixth most popular {{dog in the}} United Kingdom in 2007 with 11,422 registrations in a single year. Labrador Retrievers were the most popular with 45,079 registrations in that year. Their popularity is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> in America; in 1998 they were the 56th most popular breed but in both 2007 and 2008 they were the 25th most popular. They ranked higher in some individual US cities in the 2008 statistics, being eighth in both Nashville and Minneapolis-St.Paul, seventh in Boston, Atlanta and Washington D.C., and sixth in both New York City and San Francisco. The breed's popularity has continued to grow, ranking in 18th place in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Although his {{prestige}} was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise,</b> Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to}} their homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E
5|$|Around 1912, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's {{political}} influence was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise.</b> He had begun associating with an inner {{faction of the}} Conservative Party, which had as its leader Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, the Mayor of Bucharest. Afterward, Bogdan-Pitești became the publisher of Seara, but was reportedly a front for Cantacuzino, who used him to test the impact of his agenda on the Romanian public. Searas main negative campaign at the time focused on Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democrats, who, to Cantacuzino's displeasure, had been co-opted in government by the other mainstream Conservatives. The paper published gossip columns and lampoons having Ionescu, Alexandru Bădărău and Nicolae Titulescu for their main targets.|$|E
5|$|Ben Ammi Ben-Israel {{established}} the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966, {{at a time}} when black nationalism was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> {{as a response to the}} Civil Rights Movement. In 1969, after a sojourn in Liberia, Ben Ammi and about 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel. Over the next 20 years, nearly 600 more members left the United States for Israel. As of 2006, about 2,500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in the Negev region of Israel, where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews. In addition, there are Hebrew Israelite communities in several major American cities, including Chicago, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the monarchy in 1660, and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688, the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants, although the clergy were still important. Competition from Leeds and Hull, together with silting of the River Ouse, resulted in York losing its pre-eminent position as a trading centre but the city's role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise.</b> York's many elegant townhouses, such as the Lord Mayor's Mansion House and Fairfax House date from this period, as do the Assembly Rooms, the Theatre Royal, and the racecourse.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are valued}} as food by humans and also have many {{cultural}} roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than {{one third of}} species {{are considered to be}} threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific Northwest {{there is}} a stark {{contrast}} in Riesling production. The grape is currently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> in Washington State but on the decline in neighboring Oregon. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has a crisp lightness that bodes well for easy drinking. Often {{there will be an}} easily detectable peach and mineral complex. Some Washington State winemakers, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, are adapting German-style Riesling production methods, and even partnering with well-known German vintners like Dr. Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica Riesling. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 Pacific Rim Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production.|$|E
