500|$|The {{first years}} of Marie and Ferdinand's {{marriage}} were not particularly easy, and Marie would later tell her husband that [...] "it is such a shame {{that we had to}} waste so many years <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>youth</b> just to learn how to live together!" [...] Gradually, the couple's relationship became based on a cordial friendship: Marie accorded Ferdinand respect she believed he was due as a man and, later, as king, and he respected her because he realised that she had {{a better understanding of the}} world than he did. Eventually, Marie came to believe that she and Ferdinand were [...] "the best associates, the most loyal companions, but our lives intertwine only in certain matters". Ferdinand enjoyed Marie's presence during military marches and consequently, she was frequently invited to this sort of event.|$|E
500|$|This was {{followed}} by an October 1801 anonymous review in the Monthly Mirror that argued, [...] "It is a matter to be lamented, that, in times like the present, a work of letters can rarely be reviewed upon the ground of its own proper merits... In the consideration of this romance, the judicious critic cannot but feel that one rule of good writing has been studiously observed. His work will not incur the censure passed by the late Mr. Collins upon his Persian Eclogues, namely, that, from erroneous manners, they were 'Irish.'" [...] The review continued, [...] "He tells us it is metrical... He will excuse our ears, but we cannot agree with him. Among the sins <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>youth,</b> we, like him, have traded in desultory versification, but have long been brought back to lyrical rhyme, and heroic blank verse. The reasons are obvious... We recommend his beauties to the esteem, and his faults to the forgetfulness, of every reader. Upon the whole, he has our thanks for much amusement, and some information." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many in America {{were not}} happy with the draft-card burners, or with the {{frequent}} depiction of them in the media. Joseph Scerra, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spoke against what he saw as too much news coverage: [...] "All of our young people are not burning up their draft cards. All of our young people are not tearing up the flag. All <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>youth</b> are not supporting North Vietnam and carrying Viet Cong flags." [...] In October 1967 at a rally in support of the government a news photograph was snapped of a man kissing his draft card, his girlfriend smiling at his side. In Playboys November 1967 issue, Playboy Playmate Kaya Christian wrote that her [...] "turn-offs" [...] were [...] "hypocrites" [...] and [...] "draft card burners".|$|E
2500|$|Blizzard {{felt they}} had {{strength}} in developing a narrative for a large universe of characters as they had done for Warcraft. Chu expressed {{that they wanted to}} diverge from the fantasy and science fiction elements that were prominent in their main three franchises (Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo), stating [...] "we wanted to try something different with Overwatch, so what we decided to go for was the future of Earth. We always wanted the game to be about heroes, so we took a lot of inspiration from comics and superhero stories <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>youth</b> and today." [...] Once it was determined Overwatch would be played on a near-futuristic version of Earth, the writers recognized the possibility of having a global-spanning set of characters and locations set in an [...] "inspirational future". Metzen sees the Overwatch universe as having potential dynamics over time, but Blizzard does not yet have plans for how to implement this within the game.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly Clarkson {{was born}} in Fort Worth, Texas, to Jeanne Ann (née Rose), a first grade English teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson, a former engineer.

Her parents divorced when she was six years old, wherein her brother went to go live with their father, her sister {{went to live with}} an aunt and she stayed with her mother. Clarkson's mother later remarried, to Jimmy Taylor. Her ancestry is Greek (from a maternal great-grandfather), Welsh, English, Irish, German, and Scottish. Her mother is a descendant of Republican state senator Isaiah Rose, whose life story was discussed on Clarkson's episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, in 2013. Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist. She has said: [...] "I always grew up in church. I was the leader <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>youth</b> group. I’ve always grown up pretty close to church and with God.

2500|$|All of {{the songs}} that would feature on Wishful Thinking were written during the summer with {{almost all of them}} {{credited}} to Neck Deep. [...] "Crushing Grief (No Remedy)" [...] was credited to the band and Seb Barlow. Ben Barlow considered [...] "inspiration" [...] the hardest part of making the album due to him being [...] "super happy". Whereas for the band's EP releases Barlow [...] "had some shit going on that I needed to get off my chest". The band [...] "worked incredibly hard" [...] to make an album that reaches high standards set by other artists' albums that Hopeless have released. Rock Sound contributor Rob Sayce noted that the album was influenced by All Time Low's Nothing Personal (2009). Sayce wrote that the band [...] "gave British pop-punk a shot in the arm, drawing on the production sheen of 'Nothing Personal.'" [...] "Losing Teeth" [...] is about how Barlow and his friends were pursuing careers that would take them away from their hometown. Barlow said it wasn't [...] "about the end <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>youth,</b> as such, but definitely the end of us being kids, and reflecting on that." [...] "Growing Pains" [...] was the band's first attempt at [...] "diversity we have tried to implement", according to Thorpe-Evans. Thorpe-Evans mentioned that the group felt the song [...] "has a flair of originality and uniqueness" [...] when compared to the previous output. [...] "Candour" [...] was inspired by Barlow's dad, who was [...] "ill for a while." ...|$|E
2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? My {{answer is}} that a homosexual is somebody who is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt. Rev. Muhanguzi ... asked the following question: ... How can God contradict himself by saying in the Book of Genesis that Adam {{should be given a}} wife, Eve, and then also create homosexuals? ... However, now that I have been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon. Kadaga, I can see the fallacy of Bishop Muhanguzi's position. ... Do Albinos create themselves? No. Simply, nature goes wrong in a minority of cases. ... The question at the core of the debate of the homosexuals is: [...] "What do we do with an abnormal person? Do we kill him/her? Do we imprison him/her? Or do we contain him/her?" ... Apart from the people who are born abnormal, it seems there is a larger group of those that become homosexual for mercenary reasons - they get recruited on account of financial inducements. ... How about the women lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that go into that practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>youth</b> to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one I would agree with the Bill passed by Parliament. The unanswered question, however, is: What do you do with the really abnormal people? ... Only the other day, I saw on television that Dr. Allan Turing, the genius mathematician that cracked the German Enigma code for the anti-Hitler alliance ... was a homosexual. This man ... enabled them to win the war. Yet, the British chemically castrated him in 1952, where-upon he committed suicide, apparently. Were the British correct in handling that issue like that? The British no longer think so. Only the other day, the Queen had to apologize to this ... person ... much more useful to society than the millions of sexually normal people. ... he challenge is how to correctly handle the sexually abnormal on the one hand and those who use money or any other influence to recruit sexually normal people into this abnormal and disgusting behaviour. When we meet in the NRM caucus, we shall, I am sure, find a scientifically correct position.|$|E
