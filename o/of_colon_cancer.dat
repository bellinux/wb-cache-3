5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development <b>of</b> <b>colon</b> <b>cancer.</b> Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought {{to play a role in}} this progression.|$|E
5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk <b>of</b> <b>colon</b> <b>cancer.</b> Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Approximately 145, 000 Americans were {{diagnosed}} with colorectal cancer and 56, 000 died from colorectal cancer in 2006. Although colorectal screening can reduce mortality and incidence, U. S. screening rates are particularly low for racial/ethnic minorities. Racial differences in the subsite location <b>of</b> <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> could have implications for colorectal screening. This study examines the anatomic subsite distribution of tumors among African-American, Hispanic, Asian-American/Pacific-Islander and non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients with <b>colon</b> <b>cancer.</b> METHODS: Surveillance and End Results program data for 254, 469 primary in situ and invasive <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> for patients from 1973 - 2002 are included in this analysis. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression are used to describe and examine variations in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> diagnosed at sites proximal to the sigmoid colon or proximal to the splenic flexure over three successive time periods. RESULTS: The proportion <b>of</b> <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> diagnosed at the sigmoid colon was 15. 6 - 21. 3 % lower, while diagnoses at the descending colon were 40. 5. 0 - 45. 3. 0 % higher for African Americans than NHWs over the three time periods. In logistic regression analyses adjusted for gender, age group and year of diagnosis, {{the odds of a}} diagnosis of cancer proximal to the sigmoid colon or proximal to the splenic flexure was significantly higher for African Americans but lower for Hispanics and Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders compared to NHWs. DISCUSSION: The higher proportion of cancers among African Americans diagnosed at sites that are generally attempted but not always reached with a sigmoidscope suggest that African Americans may benefit from screening colonoscopy. They also highlight the need for systems that collect data that would allow a direct examination of the role that the differential use <b>of</b> specific <b>colon</b> screening tests and polypectomy play in racial/ethnic variation in <b>colon</b> <b>cancer</b> incidence and in the anatomic subsite distribution <b>of</b> <b>colon</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

40|$|SummaryColon cancers {{frequently}} harbor KRAS mutations, {{yet only}} a subset <b>of</b> KRAS mutant <b>colon</b> <b>cancer</b> cell lines are dependent upon KRAS signaling for survival. In a screen for kinases that promote survival <b>of</b> KRAS-dependent <b>colon</b> <b>cancer</b> cells, {{we found that}} the TAK 1 kinase (MAP 3 K 7) is required for tumor cell viability. The induction of apoptosis by RNAi-mediated depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of TAK 1 is linked to its suppression of hyperactivated Wnt signaling, evident in both endogenous and genetically reconstituted cells. In APC mutant/KRAS-dependent cells, KRAS stimulates BMP- 7 secretion and BMP signaling, leading to TAK 1 activation and enhancement of Wnt-dependent transcription. An in vitro-derived “TAK 1 dependency signature” is enriched in primary human <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> with mutations in both APC and KRAS, suggesting potential clinical utility in stratifying patient populations. Together, these findings identify TAK 1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for a treatment-refractory subset <b>of</b> <b>colon</b> <b>cancers</b> exhibiting aberrant KRAS and Wnt pathway activation...|$|R
