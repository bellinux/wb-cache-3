Upon reaching {{the spot where}} the submarine had been, the warship located an oil slick and began dropping depth charges which failed to achieve positive results. Approaching darkness and the necessity of escorting an Admiralty <b>oiler</b> forced Wainwright to break off her attack. After she shepherded the <b>oiler</b> to safety, she returned to the area of her attack and patrolled throughout the night, but the submarine had apparently retired from the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|At the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, the Islanders traded Brewer, Josh Green {{and their}} second round {{selection}} (Brad Winchester) {{in the same}} draft to the Edmonton Oilers for Roman Hamrlík. Although surprised to be traded, Brewer was excited {{at the prospect of}} playing for the Oilers, who saw Brewer as a top-four defenceman. However, Brewer's <b>Oiler</b> career began on a sour note as he suffered a bruised left hip and tailbone in his first game with the team. Brewer missed the next four games before returning to the lineup. Brewer scored his first goal as an <b>Oiler</b> on November 7, 2000, against the New York Rangers. Brewer finished his first <b>Oiler</b> season with career highs in goals, assists and points, as well as the best plus/minus rating on the Oilers team, a plus-15. Further, Brewer gained his first NHL playoff experience, a quarterfinal series versus the Dallas Stars. Brewer had six points, but the Oilers were eliminated four games to two by the Stars.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} the pennant number L134 during 1973. At {{the start of}} the year, Sydney was marked for a potential deployment to Mururoa in support of a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate sent to protest French nuclear testing at the atoll. The former carrier was chosen as she was capable of replenishing smaller vessels, and the RAN's dedicated replenishment <b>oiler,</b> , was undergoing refits. The Australian government did not want to send a warship until all other avenues of protest had been exhausted; the length of this delay meant Supplys refit was finished before Sydney was deployed, and the <b>oiler</b> was sent instead. Sydney visited Singapore in March, returned to Australia, and sailed to New Zealand in April: she participated in training exercises during both visits. The troopship was then involved in a joint warfare exercise in Jervis Bay during May.|$|E

Oil tankers have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result, they are subject to stringent design and operational regulations.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} support ship Takasaki {{was laid}} down on 20 June 1935 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal and {{was designed to}} be converted to either a fleet <b>oiler</b> or a light aircraft carrier as needed.

5|$|SAS President Kruger was {{the first}} of three President-class Type 12 frigates built in the UK for the South African Navy (SAN) during the 1960s. The ship spent most of her career {{training}} and made visits to foreign ports in Africa, Western Europe and the United States. In the late 1960s, she was modernized and equipped to operate a helicopter. In the mid-1970s, President Kruger played a minor role in the Angolan Civil War as a part of South African operations against the communists. The ship was placed in reserve in 1977, but was recommissioned in 1980. She sank in 1982 with the loss of 16 lives after colliding with her replenishment <b>oiler,</b> , in the South Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two <b>Oiler</b> fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} <b>Oiler</b> 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I thought you said you were going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers getting lost in the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{final chapter}} {{begins with the}} men's {{resolution}} to abandon the floundering dinghy they have occupied for thirty hours and to swim ashore. As they begin the long swim to the beach, Billie the <b>oiler,</b> the strongest of the four, swims ahead of the others; the captain advances towards the shore while still holding onto the boat, and the cook uses a surviving oar.

5|$|As {{a result}} of its target value and vulnerability, {{aircraft}} carriers are always escorted by at least one submarine for protection. The other vessels in the Strike Group provide additional capabilities, such as long range Tomahawk missiles or the Aegis Combat System, and also protect the carrier from attack. A typical Strike Group may include, in addition to an aircraft carrier: up to six surface combatants, including frigates (since retired from USN service), guided missile cruisers and guided missile destroyers (used primarily for anti-aircraft warfare and anti-submarine warfare); one or two attack submarines (for seeking out and destroying hostile surface ships and submarines); and an ammunition, <b>oiler,</b> and supply ship of Military Sealift Command to provide logistical support. The precise structure and numbers of each type of ship can vary between groups depending on the objectives of the deployment.|$|E
5|$|Lexington was at sea {{when the}} Pacific War began on 7 December 1941, {{ferrying}} fighter aircraft to Midway Island. Her mission was cancelled and {{she returned to}} Pearl Harbor a week later. After a few days, she was sent to create a diversion from the force en route to relieve the besieged Wake Island garrison by attacking Japanese installations in the Marshall Islands. The island was forced to surrender before the relief force got close enough, and the mission was cancelled. A planned attack on Wake Island in January 1942 had to be cancelled when a submarine sank the <b>oiler</b> required to supply the fuel for the return trip. Lexington {{was sent to the}} Coral Sea the following month to block any Japanese advances into the area. The ship was spotted by Japanese search aircraft while approaching Rabaul, New Britain, and her aircraft shot down most of the Japanese bombers that attacked her. Together with the carrier , she successfully attacked Japanese shipping off the east coast of New Guinea in early March.|$|E

5|$|Realizing Calgary's {{path to the}} Stanley Cup {{would go}} through Edmonton, coach Bob Johnson devised a seven-point plan for beating the Oilers that focused on {{limiting}} Wayne Gretzky, Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri's creativity, limiting access {{to the left side}} of the ice where the Oilers' top stars liked to skate, leaving their physical players on the ice by not engaging them and utilizing Neil Sheehy and Colin Patterson in roles designed to frustrate the <b>Oiler</b> players. Johnson first utilized the strategy in a late season game that ended in a 4–4 tie. The Flames then defeated the Oilers 9–3 in their final regular season meeting, a game that ended with another brawl and accusations by both teams that the other was sending their goons out after talented players.|$|E
5|$|Shōhō {{was quickly}} located again {{that morning and}} sunk. In turn, the Japanese spotted the <b>oiler,</b> , and her escorting destroyer, which were misidentified as a carrier and a light cruiser. A single dive bomber was lost during the {{consequent}} airstrike that sank the destroyer and damaged Neosho badly enough {{that she had to}} be scuttled a few days later. Late in the afternoon, the Japanese launched a small airstrike, without any escorting fighters, based on an erroneous spot report. The American carriers were far closer to the Japanese than they realized and roughly in line with their intended target. Alerted by radar, some of the American Combat Air Patrol (CAP) was vectored to intercept the Japanese aircraft, the rest being retained near the carriers because of bad weather and fading daylight. The American fighters mauled the Japanese attackers who were forced to call off the attack, but some of the surviving Japanese pilots became confused in the darkness and attempted to verify if the American carriers were their own before being driven off.|$|E
