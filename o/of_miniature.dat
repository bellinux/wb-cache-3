During {{a supply}} run to an outpost {{owned by the}} Ararat Corporation, she discovers that all the scientists except one have been killed. The Ararat Corporation is run by an alien colony <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> spider robots (led by an entity named Bob) that have infiltrated the U.S. government. The Ararat Corporation has cloned Venom to facilitate the extermination of humanity; however, the clone ravages its hosts and kills the outpost crew.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{appear in}} popular culture in {{concepts}} such as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and television production. The metaphoric name suggests that events are seen candidly, as a fly might see them. Flies have inspired the design <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> flying robots. Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park relied {{on the idea that}} DNA could be preserved in the stomach contents of a blood-sucking fly fossilised in amber, though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists.|$|E

Following the tale's publication, a child fan wrote Potter {{suggesting}} Jeremy find a wife. Potter responded with a series <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> letters on the theme as if from Jeremy and his pals. After Potter's death in 1943, licences were issued to various firms to produce the Potter characters.

5|$|The film's visual style {{includes}} abrupt cuts, rapid camera movement, extensive superimposition, dim lighting, {{and shapes}} and forms in twisted and disoriented angles. Filmed {{with a budget}} of only $97 ($ in today's dollars), it includes a combination of close-ups of live actors and long shots <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> sets, which were made from such items as cardboard, paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, and toy trains. With no access to Hollywood studios or equipment, most of the filming {{took place in the}} filmmakers' residences, with walls painted black for use as a background.|$|E
5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with black hair held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist. Her usual fighting outfit, in which she has appeared {{in most of the}} games, is a type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless upper garment, baggy pants (slit at the sides), arm guards, and a mask that conceals the lower half of her face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages wrapped around her shins, ankles and instep. Ibuki's alternative, everyday costume is a blue-and-white Japanese schoolgirl uniform, or casual clothes—in the same color scheme—with a chain <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> kunai knives and a fake tanuki tail, introduced in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords on her back.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} by Watanabe {{as an extension}} of his work on the television series, which he treated as a series <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> films. So as not to alienate fans of the series, a large amount of aesthetic material was incorporated, while also adjusting it to make it accessible to newcomers. Increased budget and production facilities enabled the use of filming styles associated with live action films and a higher animation quality than the series. Arabic thematic elements were incorporated to contrast against the series, which entailed Watanabe traveling to Morocco for research. The Arabic atmosphere was also used in Kanno's music.|$|E

5|$|The lavish {{illumination}} programme is {{far greater}} than any other surviving Insular Gospel book. There are ten surviving full-page illuminations including two evangelist portraits, three pages with the four evangelist symbols, a carpet page, a miniature of the Virgin and Child, a miniature of Christ enthroned, and miniatures of the Arrest of Jesus and the Temptation of Christ. There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages {{for the first few}} words of each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable that there were other pages <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages, there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text; in fact only two pages have no decoration.|$|E
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} <b>of</b> <b>Miniature</b> Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century, 12th century {{characteristics}} remained prominent; however, many parts that were formerly plain became decorated. This change is {{observed in the}} Muktesvara Temple at Chaudayyadanapura (Chavudayyadanapura) and the Santesvara Temple at Tilavalli, both in the Haveri district. The Muktesvara Temple with its elegant vimana was renovated {{in the middle of}} the 13th century. In the Tilavalli Temple, all the architectural components are elongated, giving it an intended crowded look. Both temples are built with a dravida articulation. Apart from exotic dravida articulations, some temples of this period have nagara articulation, built in the stepped-diamond and the square plan natural to a nagara superstructure. Notable among temples with a stepped-diamond style are the Ganesha Temple at Hangal, the Banashankari temple at Amargol (which has one dravida shrine and one nagara shrine), and a small shrine that is a part of the ensemble at the Mahadeva Temple. At Hangal, the architects were able to provide a sekhari superstructure to the shrine, while the lower half received a nagara articulation and depictions <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> sekhari towers. The style of workmanship with a square plan is found at Muttagi and the Kamala Narayana Temple at Degoan.|$|E

5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{started on}} 16 January 1995 and continued until 6 June. The producers {{were unable to}} use Pinewood Studios, the usual location for Bond films, {{because it had been}} reserved for First Knight, so an old Rolls-Royce factory at the Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire was converted into a new studio. In February the crew moved to Monaco and Monte Carlo for scenes in a casino and a demonstration of a Tiger helicopter. The pre-credits sequence involved a bungee jump, which was filmed at the Contra Dam near Locarno, Switzerland. Reference footage for a scene consisting of a tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to sets built at the Leavesden studio by production designer Peter Lamont. Scenes on a satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, while in the UK, Epsom Downs Racecourse and the Nene Valley Railway were both used. For the scenes of the fictional Russian location of Severnaya, and other effects, Derek Meddings built a number <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> sets at Leavesden. Meddings had worked on the Bond films since Live and Let Die and died before the film's release; GoldenEye was dedicated to his memory.|$|E
5|$|The planet Vulcan {{setting was}} created using {{a mixture of}} on-location {{photography}} at Minerva Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park and set recreation. Yellowstone was selected after filming in Turkish ruins proved to be too expensive. Securing permission for filming the scenes was difficult {{in the middle of}} the summer tourist season, but the Parks Department acquiesced so long as the crew remained on the boardwalks to prevent damage to geological formations. Zuberano, who had helped select the site for the shoot, traveled to Yellowstone and returned with a number of photos. Minor also made a trip and returned to create a large painting depicting how the scene might look. In consultations with Michelson, the crew decided to use miniatures in the foreground to create the Vulcan temples, combined with the real hot springs in the background. In the film, the bottom third of the frames were composed <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> stairs, rocks, bits of red glass and a Vulcan statue. The center of the frame contained Nimoy's shots and the park setting, while the final third of the frame was filled with a matte painting. On August 8, the day after production began at Paramount, an eleven-person second unit left for Yellowstone. The sequence took three days to shoot.|$|E

5|$|The room to {{the east}} of the Oak Bedroom is known as The Great Room. The room was {{established}} in the mid 17th century as part of a reception suite, and was used by George John, the Second Earl for important political conferences during his period as First Lord of the Admiralty and Home Secretary. The Great Room, predominantly red and gold in design like many of the first floor rooms, contains a table and chairs with a large gilded mirror with three urns in front of it. The long mirror, designed by James Stuart, who was noted for his Athenian designs, features a tableaux at the top with the Spencer coat of arms and the pulling of chariots by cherubs, representing the love between John and Georgiana. The Great Room contains an extensive collection <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> portraits, including a very rare Lucas de Heere portrait of Lady Jane Grey as a teenage girl at her family residence in Bradgate, Leicestershire. The Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa is mentioned in the 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana as hanging in one of the bedrooms at Althorp. It was sold in 1924 to art merchant Joseph Duveen, who sold it the following year to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{miniature}} {{is an art}} form, {{which can}} be linked to the Persian miniature tradition, as well as strong Chinese artistic influences. The words taswir or nakish were used to define the art <b>of</b> <b>miniature</b> painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes. The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called tahrir) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was {{different from that of the}} nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.|$|E
