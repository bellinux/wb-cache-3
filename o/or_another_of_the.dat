The 1936 version of Show Boat, faithfully adapted from the original stage production, {{is believed to be the}} definitive film version of the musical by many critics. but became unavailable following the 1951 remake. Warner's has remastered the 1936 version and is presently offering stamped DVDs for a limited time; thereafter, this version will be available on a DVD-on-demand basis using DVD-Rs.|$|E
5|$|In May 1992, {{intensive}} shelling and infantry {{attacks on}} Bosniak {{areas in the}} municipality caused the Bosniak survivors to flee their homes. The majority of them surrendered or were captured by Serb forces. As the Serb forces rounded up the Bosniak and Croat residents, they forced them to march in columns bound for one <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison camps that the Serb authorities had established in the municipality. On about 25 May 1992, about {{three weeks after the}} Serbs took control of the municipal government, and two days after the start of large scale military attacks on Bosniak population centers, Serb forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp. During the next several weeks, the Serbs continued to round up Bosniaks and Croats from Kozarac near Prijedor, and other places in the municipality and send them to the camps. Many Bosniak and Croat intellectuals and politicians were sent to Omarska. While virtually all of the prisoners were male, there were also 37 women detained in the camp, who served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, and were repeatedly raped in the canteen; bodies of five of them have been exhumed.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese {{had many}} involvements in South India, {{including}} {{their support of}} the Paravars in a trade battle {{over control of the}} pearl fisheries of Malabar, but in the Nair kingdoms their principal interest was to obtain control of the trade in pepper. In this they followed the Muslim Arabs, whom they eventually marginalised; and they were in turn followed by the Dutch in 1683. The British and French were also active in the region now known as Kerala, the former from 1615 and the latter from 1725. These various European powers combined with one <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nair rulers, fighting for control. One notable alliance was that of the Portuguese with the Kingdom of Cochin, with whom they sided in order to work against the power of the Zamorins of Calicut. Although Calicut remained the most significant of the kingdoms until the 1730s, its power was eroded and the rulers of Cochin were freed from being vassals of the Zamorins.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there is}} no extant music that can be {{positively}} identified with Nero, {{there is a possibility}} that some of it may have been used in later works. John E. Sawyer, in his analysis of Agrippina, reveals that this work, composed five years after Nero with similar characters, [...] "contains the highest proportion of borrowed material of any of the composer's major dramatic works", and Dean and Knapp speculate as to whether it also incorporates borrowings from Nero. According to the Handel scholar Charles Cudworth, the suite of dances that follows the overture to Handel's 1707 opera Rodrigo (his first after leaving Hamburg), could very well have begun as ballet music in Nero <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lost Hamburg operas. The musicologist Bernd Baselt has raised the possibility that Handel's Harpsichord Suite in G Minor, HWV 453, is an arrangement of the overture to Nero. A version of this suite, reconstructed for orchestra by Peter Holman, is included in a selection of Handel's Hamburg music, issued by Hyperion Records in January 2012.|$|E
500|$|The play {{had a good}} initial run, {{although}} Horner's trick and {{the notorious}} china scene immediately raised offence. Wycherley laughed off such criticisms in his next play, The Plain Dealer (1676), where he has the hypocritical Olivia exclaim that the china scene in The Country Wife [...] "has quite taken away the reputation of poor china itself, and sullied the most innocent and pretty furniture of a lady's chamber". Olivia's sensible cousin Eliza insists that she'll go see The Country Wife anyway: [...] "All this will not put me out of conceit with china, nor the play, which is acted today, <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same beastly author's, as you call him, which I'll go see." [...] Writing himself into The Plain Dealer as the [...] "beastly author" [...] of the china scene, Wycherley seems more amused than repentant. The Country Wife did in fact survive the complaints to become a dependable repertory play from 1675 till the mid-1740s, but by then public taste had changed too much {{to put up with}} the sex jokes any longer. Its last eighteenth century performance in 1753 was followed by a hiatus of 171 years, until the successful Phoenix Society production in 1924 at the Regent Theatre in London. The first-ever American performance of Wycherley's original Country Wife took place in 1931.|$|E

2500|$|The district's {{transformation}} from a New South Wales rural area to a built-up national capital began during political debates over Federation {{in the late}} 19th century.

However Sydney was Australia's oldest city, and so also had a justifiable claim to host the new nation's Federal polity.

In our hospital we have frequently recorded ichorous sores on the feet of delivering patients without having noticed any subsequent infections, either of those patients themselves or of other patients. Dr. Semmelweis places great emphasis on the better health of institutions exclusively for the education of midwives; he should consider that ichorous secretions occur equally in both institutions. Moreover, in an institution as large as the midwife clinic in Vienna, one <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients must always be ill and so provide a source of infection. If the infection occurs as easily as he believes, this would reduce the inequality in mortality rates between the clinics.|$|E
2500|$|Van Vliet {{wanted the}} whole band to [...] "live" [...] the Trout Mask Replica album.

With only two bedrooms the band members would find sleep in various corners of one, while Vliet occupied the other and rehearsals were accomplished in the main living area. Van Vliet implemented his vision by completely dominating his musicians, artistically and emotionally. At various times one <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group members was [...] "put in the barrel", with Van Vliet berating him continually, sometimes for days, until the musician collapsed in tears or in total submission.

French has recalled living on no more than a small cup of beans a day for a month.

Band members were restricted from leaving the house and practiced for 14 or more hours a day.|$|E
2500|$|To make a text {{available}} {{representative of}} the earliest copies of the Vulgate and summarize the most common variants between the various manuscripts, Anglican scholars at the University of Oxford began to edit the New Testament in 1878 (completed in 1954), while the Benedictines of Rome began an edition of the Old Testament in 1907 (completed in 1995). Their findings were condensed into an edition of both the Old and New Testaments first published at Stuttgart in 1969, created with the participation of members from both projects. These books are the standard editions of the Vulgate used by scholars. [...] From the original Oxford Vulgate, the editors of these critical editions adopted two major critical principles; firstly to present the text in sense lines [...] per cola et commata, with no other indications of punctuation; and secondly, to reconstruct the earliest text solely on the authority of primary manuscript witnesses dating from before the 11th century (a few later Bibles are selectively cited in the apparatus, but not used for the texts). Consequently, for the most part, the later medieval development of the Vulgate text is apparent in these critical editions only in citations of variants printed from the Sistine and Sixto-Clementine editions; albeit that these can only provide two snap-shots of {{the wide range of}} variant readings found in medieval texts. Neither in the Old or New Testaments, do the critical editions print conjectural readings (even in instances of manifest error or contamination, such as pietatis for [...] timoris Domini at Isaiah 11:2);" [...] every reading is taken from one <b>or</b> <b>another</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary witnesses for that book.|$|E
