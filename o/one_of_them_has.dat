5|$|As for tournaments {{where only}} one of the Big Four has competed, this is the only {{category}} where {{the rest of the field}} has a positive ratio, winning 186 of the 262 tournaments (71%) played overall. However, it must be noted that this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008, the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where just <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> competed.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{calls in}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and informs her that four African American {{men have been}} kidnapped in Philadelphia. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> been found dead exhibiting depigmentation. A {{specialist}} from the CDC believes that the men have died from a disease, and has requested Scully to investigate the case. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) joins Scully and {{has some of the}} evidence samples from Sanders' autopsy analyzed by Agent Pendrell, who finds a seed from a rare West African passionflower. Mulder takes the seed to his UN informant Marita Covarrubias and asks for her help; she provides him with information on the incident on the plane.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} {{highways}} along the US131 corridor were designated {{as early as}} 1919. When the US Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, US131 was created along the route of M-13 in Michigan. Originally ending at Fife Lake on the north end, the highway was extended to Petoskey in the late 1930s. Further changes were made, starting in the 1950s, to convert segments {{of the road to}} a full freeway. The state started this conversion simultaneously at two locations: heading north from Three Rivers, and heading both north and south from a point in southern Kent County. A third segment was built south of Cadillac and over subsequent years Michigan filled the gaps in the freeway. Cadillac and Manton were bypassed {{in the early part of}} the 21st century, resulting in the current freeway configuration. Another large-scale construction project in 2000 rebuilt an unusual section of the freeway through Grand Rapids known as the S-Curve. Two bridges formerly used by US131 have been labeled by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as historic structures; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> been listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).|$|E

25|$|Cox and Box; or, The Long-Lost Brothers, is a one-act {{comic opera}} with a {{libretto}} by F. C. Burnand and music by Arthur Sullivan, {{based on the}} 1847 farce Box and Cox by John Maddison Morton. It was Sullivan's first successful comic opera. The story concerns a landlord who lets a room to two lodgers, one who works at night and one who works during the day. When <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> the day off, they {{meet each other in}} the room and tempers flare. Sullivan wrote this piece five years before his first opera with W. S.

25|$|In 1998, CNN, in {{partnership}} with corporate sister Time magazine, ran a report that Operation Tailwind in 1970 in Vietnam included use of Sarin gas to kill a group of defectors from the United States military. The Pentagon denied the story. Skeptics deemed it improbable that such an extraordinary and risky atrocity could have gone unnoticed {{at the height of}} the Vietnam War's unpopularity. CNN, after a two-week inquiry, issued a retraction. The story's producers were summarily fired, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> been highly critical of CNN's handling of the story, saying that the network bowed to pressure from high-ranking officials to kill the story.|$|E
25|$|In a state torn {{by civil}} war, the contesting powers {{often do not}} have the ability to commit or the trust to believe in the other side’s {{commitment}} {{to put an end to}} war. When considering a peace agreement, the involved parties are aware of the high incentives to withdraw once <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> taken an action that weakens their military, political or economical power. Commitment problems may deter a lasting peace agreement as the powers in question are aware that neither of them is able to commit to their end of the bargain in the future. States are often unable to escape conflict traps (recurring civil war conflicts) due to the lack of strong political and legal institutions that motivate bargaining, settle disputes, and enforce peace settlements.|$|E

25|$|In some competitions, {{the game}} cannot {{end in a}} draw, so away goals, extra time and kicks from the penalty mark are the three methods for {{determining}} the winner after a match has been drawn. Away goals mean that if the team's score is level after playing one home and one away game, the goals scored in the away match count as double. Extra time consists of two periods of five minutes. If no winner is produced after these methods, 3 kicks from the penalty mark are taken, and the team that has scored the most wins. If it is not decided after 3 kicks from the penalty mark, it continues {{to go on with}} one extra kick from the penalty mark to each team at a time until <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> scored more goals than the other. Unlike extra time, the goals scored in a shoot-out do not count towards the goals scored throughout the match.|$|E
25|$|Among Rabbinitic authors Jacob quotes Abu al-Walid ibn Janah; but his {{quotations}} {{have apparently}} been intentionally suppressed by Firkovich in his edition (see Abraham Harkavy, Altjüdische Denkmäler aus der Krim, p.211, note 1), {{though they are}} found in the manuscripts, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> been given in the edition (on Jer. iv. 37; fol. 2b, line 1). If Jacob read Abu al-Walid not in the Arabic original but in the Hebrew translation, he must have compiled his book {{in the second half of}} the twelfth century. Abraham Firkovich believes Jacob to have lived at Kerch, in southern Russia, said to have been called in Hebrew; and he asserts that the quoted several times in the commentary to the Pentateuch is identical with Abraham ben Simhah of Kerch (c. 986), a personage invented by him. Both of these assumptions are tenuous at best, and most scholars reject them. Jacob was probably a native of Constantinople, as his commentary contains Greek language glosses; and he appears to have been influenced by Byzantine authors.|$|E
25|$|Escrivá's {{successful}} petition of a {{title of}} nobility has aroused controversy {{not only because}} it might seem at odds with the humility befitting a Catholic priest, but also because the same title of Marquess of Peralta had been rehabilitated during 1883 by Pope Leo XIII and King Alfonso XII in favor of a man to whom Escrivá had no male-line family association: the Costa Rican diplomat Manuel María de Peralta y Alfaro (1847–1930). On that occasion, the documents ordering the rehabilitation claimed that the original title had been granted during 1738 (not 1718) to Juan Tomás de Peralta y Franco de Medina, by Charles of Austria in his capacity as Holy Roman Emperor, not as pretender to the Spanish throne. Ambassador Peralta, who during 1884 had married a Belgian countess, Jehanne de Clérembault, died without children during 1930. None of his kinsmen in Costa Rica requested the transmission of the marquessate, but <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> published an extensive genealogical study that would seem to contradict any claim by Escrivá to the title.|$|E

500|$|In its {{review of}} the book's fourth edition, {{published}} in 1919, The Bookman observed that the book was now a firm favourite with the public. [...] "It has had many imitators... but not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> rivalled the original, and they have all faded away". The reviewer recommended the book's [...] "quaint drollery, its whimsical satire and delightfully quiet irony". In Canada, Queen's Quarterly magazine's sympathetic reception of the book contrasted {{with that of the}} New York Times nearly 30 years previously. It praises the understated but lovable self-portrait of Pooter, and adds that [...] "It is not till the second or third reading—and you are bound to reread it—that the really consummate art of this artless book becomes apparent". [...] The literary critic D. B. Wyndham Lewis summarised the Pooters as [...] "warm, living, breathing, futile, half-baked, incredibly alive and endearing boneheads".|$|E

500|$|In later times, {{a number}} of legends emerged about Tamar's place of burial. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>has</b> it that Tamar was buried in a secret niche at the Gelati monastery so as to prevent the grave from being profaned by her enemies. Another version {{suggests}} that Tamar's remains were reburied in a remote location, possibly in the Holy Land. The French knight Guillaume de Bois, in a letter dated from the early 13th century, written in Palestine and addressed to the bishop of Besançon, claimed {{that he had heard}} that the king of the Georgians was heading towards Jerusalem with a huge army and had already conquered many cities of the Saracens. He was carrying, the report said, the remains of his mother, the [...] "powerful queen Tamar" [...] (regina potentissima Thamar), who had been unable to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in her lifetime and had bequeathed her body to be buried near the Holy Sepulchre.|$|E
