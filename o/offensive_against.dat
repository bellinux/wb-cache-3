5|$|The Polish and Ukrainian armies, under Piłsudski's command, {{launched}} a successful <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> the Russian forces in Ukraine. On 7 May 1920, with remarkably little fighting, they captured Kiev.|$|E
5|$|The Great Naktong Offensive was a North Korean {{military}} <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> United Nations and Republic of Korea forces {{early in}} the Korean War, taking place from September 1–15, 1950. It was the North Korean People's Army's unsuccessful final bid to break the Pusan Perimeter established by the United Nations Command.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, which {{resulted}} in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary, Ferdinand I was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia. This was followed by a series of conflicts with the Habsburgs and their allies, fighting against the Ottoman Empire. In the Little War in Hungary both sides exhausted themselves after sustaining heavy casualties. The Ottoman campaign in Hungary ceased until the <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Szigetvár.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Battle of France and the {{evacuation}} of British troops from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo, much of Britain's war production and effort was channeled into RAF Bomber Command and the strategic bombing <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Germany. However, bomber losses on each raid began to increase during 1941, which British intelligence concluded was due to German use of advanced radar equipment.|$|E
5|$|Although the Japanese Army's {{attack on}} the Allied Lunga {{perimeter}} was decisively defeated in this battle, the Japanese were {{not yet ready to}} give up the struggle for Guadalcanal. The Japanese Army and navy made immediate plans to move the rest of the 38th Division to the island, along with the 51st Infantry Division, to try a further <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Henderson Field in November 1942.|$|E
5|$|By 1279 however, Charles had {{established}} his control not only over the Latin states of Greece (after 1278 {{he was the}} Prince of Achaea), but also received the submission and vassalage of Nikephoros I, Despot of Epirus. In August 1279, in preparation for resuming his <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Michael along the Via Egnatia, Charles appointed as his vicar-general in Albania the Burgundian Hugo de Sully. Over the next year, Sully received {{a steady flow of}} supplies, siege equipment and reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, the Byzantine {{position}} in Southern Italy was gradually consolidated {{so that by}} 873 Bari was once again under Byzantine rule, and most of Southern Italy would remain in the Empire for the next 200 years. On the more important eastern front, the Empire rebuilt its defences and went on the offensive. The Paulicians were defeated and their capital of Tephrike (Divrigi) taken, while the <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> the Abbasid Caliphate began with the recapture of Samosata.|$|E
5|$|In 610, {{during the}} Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, Heraclius became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire after overthrowing Phocas. While Heraclius focused his {{attention}} on {{the internal affairs of}} his empire, the Sassanid Persians conquered Mesopotamia, overran Syria in 611, and entered Anatolia to occupy Caesarea Mazaca. In 612, Heraclius expelled the Persians from Anatolia. In 613, he launched a counter <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Syria, but was decisively defeated.|$|E
5|$|In January 1863, Burnside {{launched}} a second <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Lee, but it {{bogged down in}} winter rains before it accomplished anything and has been derisively called the Mud March. In its wake, he asked that several openly insubordinate officers be relieved of duty and court-martialed; he also offered to resign. Lincoln chose the latter option on January 26 and replaced him with Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, {{one of the officers}} who had conspired against Burnside.|$|E

5|$|In late 1941, Luftflotte 2 {{supported}} the final German <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Moscow, codenamed Operation Typhoon. Raids on Moscow proved hazardous, as Moscow had good all-weather airfields and opposition from both fighters and anti-aircraft guns {{was similar to}} that encountered over Britain. The bad weather that hampered ground operations from October on impeded air operations even more. Nonetheless, Luftflotte 2 continued to fly critical reconnaissance, interdiction, close air support and air supply missions.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to suggestions that the U.S. launch a military <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> the alleged terrorists' sanctuary in Yemen, The Washington Post noted that Yemeni forces equipped with U.S. weapons and intelligence had carried out two major raids against AQAP {{shortly before the}} bombing attempt, and that the terror group may have lost top leaders in a December 24, 2009 airstrike.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the ARBiH and the HVO coordinated before their advance to Kupres. Most probably, the two forces' {{commands}} agreed on a simultaneous <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Kupres, without revealing actual battle plans to their counterparts. The HVO's contribution in the offensive, codenamed Operation Cincar, was planned jointly by the HVO and the HV.|$|E

5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Japan was {{to destroy}} the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale. Civilians {{who took part in the}} war effort through such activities as building fortifications and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered combatants in a legal sense and therefore liable to be attacked.|$|E
5|$|Mycale was, in many ways, the {{beginning}} of a new phase in the conflict, in which the Greeks would go on the <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> the Persians. The immediate result of the victory at Mycale was a second revolt amongst the Greek cities of Asia Minor. The Samians and Milesians had actively fought against the Persians at Mycale, thus openly declaring their rebellion, and the other cities followed in their example.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their final <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the agony of the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow the Khmer Rouge advance. By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen and the nation slid into darkness. In the new Year Zero, the Khmer Rouge, {{under the leadership of}} Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E
50|$|The United Irishmen now {{had control}} {{of almost all}} County Wexford, and were in a {{powerful}} position to launch <b>offensives</b> <b>against</b> the few remaining foreign garrisons in the county at Bunclody, Gorey, and New Ross.|$|R
50|$|After the NRA {{captured}} {{state power}} in 1986, Rwigema became the deputy Minister of Defence. He was regularly {{at the front}} line in northern Uganda during the new government's <b>offensives</b> <b>against</b> remnants of the ousted regime.|$|R
50|$|Ban Borić {{appears as}} a {{prominent}} figure in 1154, as an ally of the King of Hungary. He was involved in <b>offensives</b> <b>against</b> the Byzantines, in alliance with Hungary and Serbia, reaching {{as far south as}} Braničevo.|$|R
5|$|Saladin {{launched}} his last <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Mosul in late 1185, hoping {{for an easy}} victory over a presumably demoralized Mas'ud, but failed due to the city's unexpectedly stiff resistance and a serious illness which caused Saladin to withdraw to Harran. Upon Abbasid encouragement, Saladin and Mas'ud negotiated a treaty in March 1186 that left the Zengids in control of Mosul, but under the obligation to supply the Ayyubids with military support when requested.|$|E
5|$|The senate heaped {{many more}} rewards on Decimus Brutus than on Octavian for {{defeating}} Antony, then attempted to give {{command of the}} consular legions to Decimus Brutus—yet Octavian decided not to cooperate. Instead, Octavian stayed in the Po Valley and refused to aid any further <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Antony. In July, an embassy of centurions sent by Octavian entered Rome and demanded that he receive the consulship left vacant by Hirtius and Pansa.|$|E
5|$|To {{increase}} the toll on Allied bombers further, intruder operations restarted briefly in August 1943 and took place intermittently {{or on the}} initiative of single crews, since no organised Fernnachtjagd existed after October 1941. Success was still possible. On 22 April 1944 the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) 1st Bombardment Division and 3rd Bombardment Division were returning to England in darkening skies after a daylight raid over Germany. They were attacked by an element of Messerschmitt Me 410 bomber destroyers of Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51—Bomber Wing 51) over their bases. Over the next twenty minutes, 10 aircraft, nine of them B-24 Liberators, were shot down and 61 men killed {{for the loss of}} only two Me 410s and four airmen. The attack coincided with Operation Steinbock, a bombing and intruder <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> Greater London and in response to the British <b>offensive</b> <b>against</b> German industrial cities, but the operation was aimed at the British capital rather than British bomber bases.|$|E
50|$|Naga insurgents {{fighting}} against the Indian government have bases in the area over the Burmese side of the border. The Burmese army have launched <b>offensives</b> <b>against</b> these camps in recent years following top level meetings between the two governments.|$|R
50|$|Capitalizing {{on their}} victory, the communists {{launched}} {{a series of}} <b>offensives</b> <b>against</b> the nationalists, taking several counties in eastern Jiangxi and western Fujian, including Lichuan (黎川), Nanfeng, (南丰), Jianning, (建宁), Taining, (泰宁), Ninghua, (宁化) and Changding (长汀), further expanding the Jiangxi Soviet.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, the ADF has {{operated}} in the DRC's North Kivu province {{near the border}} with Uganda.
