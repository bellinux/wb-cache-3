50|$|The MOD-5B wind turbine, {{built in}} 1987, {{was the largest}} {{operating}} wind turbine {{in the world in}} the 1990s. The contract to build the Mod-5B was awarded to Boeing in 1980 and it was installed on Oahu in 1987. With a rated capacity of 3.2 megawatts, it weighed 426000 kg and had a 100 m diameter two-blade rotor on a 60 m steel tower. Early operation of the Mod-5B demonstrated a good availability of 95 percent for the new first-unit wind turbine. Early in 1988, <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> was transferred to Hawaiian Electric Industries, then to the Makani Uwila Power Corporations (MUPC), and kept in service intermittently until late in 1996. Because of financial difficulties, the wind turbine was shut down, {{along with the rest of}} MUPC, and passed to the property owner, Campbell Estates. Campbell Estates decided to disassemble the unit and sell it for scrap. The DOE salvaged the drive train gearbox and generator in July 1998.|$|E
5000|$|In larger steam {{turbines}} an oil operated servo mechanism {{is used in}} order to enhance the lever sensitivity. The use of a relay system magnifies the small deflections of the lever connected to the governor sleeve. The differential lever is connected at both the ends to the governor sleeve and the throttle valve spindle respectively. The pilot valves spindle is also connected to the same lever at some intermediate position. Both the pilot valves cover one port each in the oil chamber. The outlets of the oil chamber are connected to an oil drain tank through pipes.The decrease in load during <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turbine</b> will bring about increase in the shaft speed thereby lifting the governor sleeve. Deflection occurs in the lever and due to this the pilot valve spindle raises up opening the upper port for oil entry and lower port for oil exit. Pressurized oil from the oil tank enters the cylinder and pushes the relay piston downwards. As the relay piston moves the throttle valve spindle attached to it also descends and partially closes the valve. Thus the steam flow rates can be controlled. When the load on the turbine increases the deflections in the lever are such that the lower port is opened for oil entry and upper port for oil exit. The relay piston moves upwards and the throttle valve spindle ascend upwards opening the valve.The variation of the steam consumption rate ṁ (kg/h) with the turbine load during throttle governing is linear and is given by the “willan’s line”. The equation for the willan’s line is given by: ...|$|E

A new non-baseline {{damage detection}} method based on the Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) in a wind turbine blade is developed in this paper. Firstly, the Chi-square distribution is proven to be an effective damage-sensitive feature which is adopted as the individual information source for the local decision. In order to obtain the global and optimal decision for the damage detection, the feature information fusion (FIF) method is proposed to fuse and optimize information in above individual information sources, and the damage is detected accurately through <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global decision.

40|$|Condition Monitoring (CM) {{has been}} {{considered}} as an effective method to enhance <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> wind <b>turbines</b> and implement cost-effective maintenance. Thus, adopting an efficient approach for condition monitoring of wind turbines is desirable. This paper presents a data-driven model-based CM approach for wind <b>turbines</b> based on <b>the</b> online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) algorithm. A physical kinetic energy correction model is employed to normalize the temperature change to the value at the rated power output to eliminate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> variable speed <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>turbines.</b> <b>The</b> residual signal, obtained by comparing the predicted values and practical measurements, is processed by the physical correction model and then assessed with a Bonferroni interval method for fault diagnosis.

Meanwhile, the design covers the demands of an offshore turbine foundation to sufficient extent, the fabrication was even challenging regarding size and shape of the structure.

Alpha Ventus was planned as a first test field for the exploration of offshore wind energy in German waters. The project organisation has been Deutsche Offshore-Testfeld und Infrastruktur GmbH & Co. KG, DOTI. It was founded in 2006 by EWE AG (47,5%), E.ON Climate & Renewables Central Europe GmbH and Vattenfall Europe Windkraft GmbH (each 26,25%) assisted by Stiftung Offshore Windenergie. The German Federal Ministry of Environment BMU supported a number of research projects, which were summarized in the RAVE initiative (Research at Alpha Ventus). A broad basis of experience and knowledge was gained for the construction, commissioning and operation for future offshore wind farms. The Tripods were fabricated by Aker Kvaerner in Verdal, Norway. A horizontal assembly of the Tripods was realized in accordance to the local fabrication experience of the yard, coming from large oil and gas jacket fabrication, with subsequent upending and of course upright sailing from Norway to the offshore terminal in Eemshaven. The transportation of the Tripods to the location was done by Taklift 4 from Boskalis one by one.|$|E
