40|$|International audienceLake {{water levels}} change under the {{influences}} of natural and/or anthropogenic environmental conditions. Among these influences are the climate change, greenhouse effects and <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> <b>depletions</b> which {{are reflected in the}} hydrological cycle features over the lake drainage basins. Lake levels are among the most significant hydrological variables that are influenced by different atmospheric and environmental conditions. Consequently, lake level time series {{in many parts of the}} world include nonstationarity components such as shifts in the mean value, apparent or hidden periodicities. On the other hand, many lake level modeling techniques have a stationarity assumption. The main purpose of this work is to develop a cluster regression model for dealing with nonstationarity especially in the form of shifting means. The basis of this model is the combination of transition probability and classical regression technique. Both parts of the model are applied to monthly level fluctuations of Lake Van in eastern Turkey. It is observed that the cluster regression procedure does preserve the statistical properties and the transitional probabilities that are indistinguishable from the original data...|$|R

Key concepts of this new way of understanding complex systems –are theories of chaos, attractors, fractals, dissipative structures, self-organization, and autopoietic networks. The intellectual tradition of systems thinking, and the models of living systems developed during {{the early decades of the}} century, forms the conceptual and historical roots of the new scientific framework, current models and theories may be seen as an outline of an emerging theory of living systems. What is now emerging at the forefront of science is a coherent scientific theory that offers, for the first time, a unified view of mind, matter, and life. In the following we give a general theory for three pairs: (a) Terrestrial Organism (b) Oxygen Consumption (c) Dead Organic Matter (d) Decomposer Organisms (e) Green Plants (f) Nutrients.

40|$|A set of 10 {{environmental}} impact indicators is {{proposed for the}} evaluation the {{environmental impact}} of industrial installations and processes or industrial companies and sites: global warming, destruction of the <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> (<b>ozone</b> <b>depletion),</b> acidification, photochemical ozone creation, human toxicity, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, resource consumption (abiotic depletion), water consumption and waste production. These are "weighed" indicators: the individual emissions or discharges of components contributing to a certain theme are multiplied with a weighing factor and aggregated. Eco-efficiency indicators are calculated by dividing the "weighed", indicators by a value related to production. These relative indicators make it possible to quantify the evolution of the environmental performance for a process, company or industrial site and to evaluate which component(s) contribute(s) most to a given theme, thus allowing to set priorities for lowering the environmental impact. Examples illustrate the proposed method. Attention is also given to the emission of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) during the incineration of waste, trying to answer the question: are waste incinerators sinks or sources of POPs? It is shown that for non-carcongenic effects according to the incineration scenario, the weighed input/output ranges from 0. 3 to 20, 500 when considering the POPs in flue gases and solid residues. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{source of}} bromine that drives polar {{boundary}} <b>layer</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> events (ODEs) {{is still open}} to some debate. While ODEs are generally noted to form under conditions of a shallow stable boundary layer, observations of depleted air under high wind conditions are taken as being transport-related. Here we report observations from Antarctica in which an unusually large cloud of BrO formed over the Weddell Sea. The enhanced BrO was observed over Halley station in coastal Antarctica, providing an opportunity to probe the conditions within an active "bromine explosion" event. On this occasion, enhanced BrO and depleted boundary <b>layer</b> <b>ozone</b> coincided with high wind speeds and saline blowing snow. We derive a simple model to consider the environmental conditions that favour ODEs and find two maxima, one at low wind/stable boundary layer and one at high wind speeds with blowing snow.

The potential of global warming (GWP 100) improved by 71 % using the biotechnological route for the production of graphene.

40|$|Bromine {{monoxide}} is a reactive halogen species {{which has}} crucial {{impact on the}} chemistry of the tropospheric polar boundary layer. During polar spring, BrO enhancement can be detected in both northern and southern Polar Regions, while the boundary <b>layer</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> events occur. A considerable challenge for understanding enhanced BrO and the associated ODEs is the difficulty of real-time observations. In this study, a typical process of enhanced bromine and depleted ozone in late April, 2015 at Ny-Ålesund boundary layer was observed using ground-based Multi Axis-Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) technique. The results showed that there were as high as 8  ×  10 14  molecular cm − 2 BrO slant columns above the Kings Bay area in 26 April.
