5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E

[...] There were no objections, and the tale was finished in July.|$|E
500|$|Hill and Beatty {{left the}} film, which Paramount began {{developing}} as a lower-budget project with Richard Benjamin directing. Cash and Epps continued {{to rewrite the}} script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the Dick Tracy rights himself, along with the Cash/Epps script. When Jeffrey Katzenberg moved from Paramount to the Walt Disney Studios, Dick Tracy resurfaced with Beatty as director, producer and leading man. He considered hiring Martin Scorsese to direct the film, but changed his mind. [...] "It never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> direct the movie," [...] Beatty admitted, [...] "but finally, {{like most of the}} movies that I direct, when the time comes to do it, I just do it because it's easier than going through what I'd have to go through to get somebody else to do it." ...|$|E

500|$|After the {{publication}} of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Chabon was mistakenly featured in a Newsweek article on up-and-coming gay writers (Pittsburghs protagonist has liaisons with people of both sexes). The New York Times later reported that [...] "in some ways, [...] was happy" [...] for the magazine's error, and quoted him as saying, [...] "I feel very lucky about all of that. It really opened up a new readership to me, and a very loyal one." [...] In a 2002 interview, Chabon added, [...] "If Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about anything {{in terms of human}} sexuality and identity, it's that people can't be put into categories all that easily." [...] In [...] "On The Mysteries of Pittsburgh," [...] an essay he wrote for the New York Review of Books in 2005, Chabon remarked on the autobiographical events that helped inspire his first novel: [...] "I had slept with one man whom I loved, and learned to love another man so much that it would never have <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> want to sleep with him." ...|$|E

In a BBC Four interview with Mark Lawson, he was asked if he at any time had any religious faith. He replied simply, [...] "No." [...] He has also said [...] "It never really <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> believe in God".|$|E
2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and in all {{the time}} I have been here, it has never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were {{discussing}} Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E

60|$|Doubtless {{the child}} would have disregarded my wisdom, for wilful, rapturous youth is slow to accept {{experience}} secondhand.

My Cloak.--An {{exception}} <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the frugality {{described a}} letter (or may be two) ago; my cloak: {{it would certainly}} have been possible to have got something less expensive; still it is a fine thought for absent parents that their son possesses simply THE GREATEST vestment in Mentone.

60|$|There did {{not seem}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be the {{slightest}} objection to this arrangement, except that my boots were muddy, and my coat of the morning sort.

60|$|Cross-examined: It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> interfere. I thought {{very little}} of the affair at the time.
