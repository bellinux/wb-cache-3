40|$|Background: With {{the growing}} amount of {{biomedical}} data available in public databases {{it has become}} increasingly important to annotate data in a consistent way in order to allow easy access to this rich source of information. Annotating the data using <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> terms and ontologies makes it much easier to compare and analyze data from different sources. However, finding the correct <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> terms can sometimes be a difficult task for the end user annotating these data. Results: In order to facilitate the location of the correct term in the correct <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> or ontology, the Ontology Lookup Service was created. However, using the Ontology Lookup Service as a web service is not always feasible, especially for researchers without bioinformatics support. We have therefore created a Java front end to the Ontology Lookup Service, called the OLS Dialog, which can be plugged into any application requiring the annotation of data using <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> terms, making it possible to find and use <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> terms without requiring any additional knowledge about web services or ontology formats.

40|$|Semantic {{interoperability}} {{of mineral}} exploration geodata {{is a long-term}} concern in mining projects. Inconsistent conceptual schemas and heterogeneous professional terms among various geodata sources in a mining project often hinder their efficient use and/or reuse. Our study of a <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> focuses on interoperability of mineral exploration geodata of different mining projects of a mining group in China. In order to achieve this purpose, a proper representation of concepts and their inter-relationships in the knowledge domain of mineral exploration for mining projects is proposed. In addition, we propose that for wider interoperability of mining project geodata the <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> underpinning them should be interoperable with concepts in related applications in the mineral exploration domain. In developing our <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary,</b> we adopted/adapted national standards of geosciences taxonomies and terminologies. The organization structure of terms, coding method, metadata schema for database applications and an extensible structure of our <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> are discussed. The <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> we developed was then used to reconcile heterogeneous geodata and to set up integrated databases for various mining projects of the mining group. Our study shows that a properly organized <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> not only allows for efficient reconciliation of heterogeneous geodata sources in similar or related projects, but also makes related geodata to be interoperable with extramural applications in the same knowledge domain...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: <b>Controlled</b> <b>vocabularies</b> play an {{important}} role in information retrieval. Numerous studies have shown that conceptual searches based on vocabularies are more effective than keyword searches, at least in certain contexts. Consequently, new ways must be found to improve <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabularies.</b> The purpose of this paper is to present a semi-automatic model for updating <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabularies</b> through the use of a text corpus and the analysis of query logs. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental development is presented in which, first, the suitability of a <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> to a text corpus is examined. The keywords entered by users to access the text corpus are then compared with the descriptors used to index it. Finally, both the query logs and text corpus are processed to obtain a set of candidate terms to update the <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary.</b> Findings: This paper describes a model applicable both in the context of the text corpus of an online academic journal and to repositories and intranets. The model is able to: first, identify the queries that led users from a search engine to a relevant document; and second, process these queries to identify candidate terms for inclusion in a <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary.</b> Research limitations/implications: Ideally, the model should be used in controlled web environments, such as repositories, intranets or academic journals. Social implications: The proposed model directly improves the indexing process by facilitating the maintenance and updating of <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabularies.</b> It so doing, it helps to optimise access to information. Originality/value: The proposed model takes into account the perspective of users by mining queries in order to propose candidate terms for inclusion in a <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary.</b> This article is part of the projects ‘Audiencias activas y periodismo’ (Active audiences and journalism; CSO 2012 - 39518 -C 04 - 02) and ‘El turista en la Web: hábitos informacionales y selección de destino turístico’ (Tourists online: information habits and choice of tourism destination; CSO 2014 - 59896 -P) funded through grants under the Spanish National Research, Development and Innovation Plan of the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|SusCity is a MIT Portugal {{project that}} {{falls within the}} scope of smart cities.

In this article, we report the process and results associated with the development of the following metadata artefacts: an application profile, a metadata schema and four <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabularies.</b> The application field is the energy certification of buildings. For the development of the application profile, we inspired ourselves in the Me 4 MAP method although we did not use it thoroughly. The creation of the metadata schema and <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabularies</b> involved the use of Wikidata, so all new terms (RDFS classes and properties and SKOS concepts) are related to Wikidata terms. The results include the application profile, the metadata schema and the <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabularies.</b> The application profile has 13 properties, four of which are new. The <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabulary</b> on measures for energy performance has 22 new terms spread over four levels. The remaining <b>controlled</b> <b>vocabularies</b> just hold a few terms each.
