500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that you always have to work <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{with some}} very unique Aikido {{experience}} and an interpretation of Aikido that is both individual and profound. Morihei Ueshiba gave to anyone who was open {{but he was also}} a man apart- even from the Japanese. You 'got it' by being there and doing the business – not by special treatment. In fact working it <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> was par for the course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, I had {{him once}} more. 'You have found my address <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> sir,' I said. 'The {{directory}} {{will tell you}} my name, {{if you wish to}} find that <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> also; otherwise, you are welcome to my card.' ...|$|E
60|$|FANNY. He {{never told}} you ANYTHING--for the matter of that. I {{understood}} you had found <b>out</b> everything <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b>|$|R
60|$|ACIS. Listen here, young one. You {{must find}} <b>out</b> things <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> and not ask questions. For {{the first day}} or two you must keep your eyes and ears open and your mouth shut. Children should be seen and not heard.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} pick <b>out</b> one <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> Mr. Hilliard. Strength and {{willingness}} to work are the points I keep my eye upon; and, except for the foremen of the gangs, their intelligence does not interest me. You had better take a turn among the parties at work, and pick <b>out</b> a man <b>for</b> yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|MURRAY (haltingly). Yes, I'll {{admit that}} was my opinion--only I {{wanted to be sure}} you'd found <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah {{you must}} do as I do--you must find <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> Your {{resemblance}} to your grandmother is quite prodigious," [...] he immediately added.|$|E
60|$|Also {{you will}} do well to write <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> two other tables--one for the LOWER half of the cupboard, {{and the other for}} its RIGHT-HAND half.|$|E
50|$|You can try <b>out</b> {{the above}} <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> on a TI-990 simulator. Dave Pitts's sim990 simulates the TI-990 and {{includes}} software kits for native operating systems (including DX10).|$|R
60|$|I did not enter, in detail, on {{the spirit}} of the {{alteration}} I propose in your story; because I thought it right that you should think <b>out</b> that <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> if you applied yourself to the change. I can now assure you that you describe it exactly as I had conceived it; and if I had wanted anything to confirm me in my conviction of its being right, our both seeing it so precisely from the same point of view, would be ample assurance to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you don't}} {{want to be}} a parson," [...] said the General, [...] "and with your father's example before your eyes, I am sure I don't wonder. However, you are {{independent}} of him more or less, and had better cut <b>out</b> a line <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> We will back you. What {{do you say to the}} army?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Upon my word,' {{returned}} Bella, 'I {{forget what}} it says, {{but you can}} find <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> if you like, Mr Rokesmith. I don't want it any more.' ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. BRADMERE. I wouldn't {{trust you}} a yard. Once more, Godleigh! This is a Christian village, and we mean it to remain so. You look <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I guess you'll have {{to figure}} it <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> Dorothy," [...] said the little dog. [...] "To MY notion you're more {{particular}} than Ozma will be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye mustn't mind Jacksey," [...] said Rice, sycophantically edging to her side, [...] "he's so cut up with losin' {{your father}} {{that he loved}} like a son, he isn't himself, and don't seem to know whether to ante up or pass <b>out.</b> And as <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> Miss--why--What was it he was sayin' only just as the young lady came?" [...] he added, turning {{abruptly}} to Wyngate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Comrade Windsor, {{you have}} touched the spot. You are wasting the golden hours of your youth. You must move. You must hustle. You must make Windsor of Cosy Moments {{a name to}} conjure with. You must boost this sheet up till New York rings with your exploits. On the present lines that is impossible. You must strike <b>out</b> a line <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> You must {{show the world that}} even Cosy Moments cannot keep a good man down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, my dear, we won't {{argue over}} it. I {{think you are}} {{altogether}} wrong, but I {{have no objection to}} your going your own way and finding it <b>out</b> at last <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> but that does not alter my opinion that on an occasion of a set dinner-party in the county where everybody will be in their fullest fig, that dress, which is pretty and becoming enough in its way, I admit, can hardly be considered as appropriate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Cuthcott, and {{his eyes}} twinkled, [...] "what's your botheration? I suppose you want to strike <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> MY daughters did that without {{consulting}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> Get away, if you can, with a gun. Take {{the creek}} below, follow the current {{down to the}} Ohio, and then make east for Fort Henry.|$|E
6000|$|... "You wronged Steele. I {{happen to}} know. I know his record along the Rio Grande. It's {{scarcely}} my place, Miss Sampson, {{to tell you}} what you'll find <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> sooner or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was on his}} way to his tutor's to read {{an essay}} on Oliver Cromwell; and under the old wall, which had once hedged in the town, he took out of his pocket a beast. It was a small tortoise, and, with an extreme absorption, he watched it move its little inquiring head, feeling it all the time with his short, broad fingers, as though to {{discover}} exactly how it was made. It was mighty hard in the back! No wonder poor old Aeschylus felt a bit sick when it fell on his head! The ancients used it to stand the world on--a pagoda world, perhaps, of men and beasts and trees, like that carving on his guardian's Chinese cabinet. The Chinese made jolly beasts and trees, as if they believed in everything having a soul, and not only being just fit for people to eat or drive or make houses of. If only the Art School would let him model things 'on his own,' instead of copying and copying--it was just as if they imagined it would be dangerous to let you think <b>out</b> anything <b>for</b> <b>yourself!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would you rather, <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> know or not know, {{that the}} little red flowers are there, putting <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the pollen?' he asked harshly. His voice was brutal, scornful, cruel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Meet us to-morrow," [...] says Jack, [...] "and judge <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> Be in the Regent's Park {{at eleven}} in the morning, and look <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{us at the}} turning {{that leads to the}} Avenue Road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will know}} before tomorrow. In the {{meantime}} try {{and think it}} <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> A successful and prosperous detective agency like yours, Mr. Snyder, ought {{to do something in}} return for a fee." ...|$|E
6000|$|Do {{not take}} the word of others [...] That things are or are not so [...] When {{there is a chance}} that you may [...] Find <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> and know. [...] --Blacky the Crow.|$|E
6000|$|She nodded. [...] "You {{know now}} what I {{have to put}} up with," [...] she said. [...] "He is a dull, ignorant, pompous little bore. You have {{probably}} found that <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> by now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 10. Cut {{out another}} piece of paper like a in Fig. 21, but now, instead of merely giving it nicks at a, b, cut it into the shape A, Fig. 23. Roll the lower part up as before, but instead of pulling the upper part down, pinch its back at the dotted line, and bring the two points, a and b, forward, {{so that they may}} touch each other. B shows the look of the thing half-done, before the points a and b have quite met. Pinch them close, and stitch the two edges neatly together, all the way from a to the point c; then roll and tie up the lower part as before. You will find then that the back or spinal line of the whole leaf is bent forward, as at B. Now go out to the garden and gather the green leaf of a fleur-de-lys, and look at it and your piece of disciplined paper together; and I fancy you will {{probably}} find <b>out</b> several things <b>for</b> <b>yourself</b> that I want you to know.|$|R
6000|$|... 187. Here, then, for I cannot without colored {{illustrations}} {{tell you}} more, I must leave you to follow <b>out</b> the subject <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> with such help {{as you may}} receive from the water-color drawings accessible to you; or {{from any of the}} little treatises on their art which have been published lately by our water-color painters.[52] But do not trust much to works of this kind. You may get valuable hints from them as to mixture of colors; and here and there you will find a useful artifice or process explained; but nearly all such books are written only to help idle amateurs to a meretricious skill, and they are full of precepts and principles which may, for the most part, be interpreted by their precise negatives, and then acted upon with advantage. Most of them praise boldness, when the only safe attendant spirit of a beginner is caution;--advise velocity, when the first condition of success is deliberation;--and plead for generalization, when all the foundations of power must be laid in knowledge of speciality.|$|R
6000|$|... 'J-j-judge <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> Sir,' said Mellish. 'Y' Excellency shall judge <b>for</b> <b>yourself!</b> Absolutely infallible, on my honour.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have two}} strong hands, and health," [...] replied Fletcher. [...] "I {{will give you}} the two hundred pounds I mentioned, and after that you must look <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> You can take it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't {{cost you}} {{much time to}} find <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> lad. Take a couple of turns around, an' I'll {{guarantee}} you'll agree that Peter Sitz an' I are not tryin' to make mountains out of mole-hills." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think there}} are many to beat her, as far as malice goes. But you'll find <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> I shouldn't be {{surprised}} if she were to tell you before long that you were to marry the niece." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "J-j-judge <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> Sir," [...] said Mellish. [...] "Y' Excellency shall judge <b>for</b> <b>yourself!</b> Absolutely infallible, on my honor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And as <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> Nathaniel," [...] Hurry enquired {{with more}} {{interest}} {{than he was}} accustomed to betray in the welfare of others--"And, as <b>for</b> <b>yourself,</b> {{what do you think}} is likely to turn up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{go and get}} an 'it' <b>for</b> <b>yourself.</b> Why don't {{you have}} an 'it' <b>for</b> <b>yourself?</b> You can have an 'it' to-morrow, if you like,--or two or three, if all that I hear is true." ...|$|R
