25|$|However, {{with the}} {{evolving}} {{shift in the}} economy towards an informational materiality, in which value {{is based upon the}} informational significance, or the narratives surrounding the products, the clear-cut subjective separation is no longer obvious. Hardt and Negri see the open source approaches as examples of new ways of co-operation that illustrate how economic value is not founded upon exclusive possession, but rather upon collective potentialities. Informational materiality is characterized by gaining value only through being shared. Hardt and Negri thus suggest that the commons become the focal point <b>of</b> <b>analyses</b> of public relations. The point being that with this shift it becomes possible to analyse how the very distinctions between the private and public are evolving.|$|E
25|$|It was {{previously}} classified as an African {{variant of the}} Eurasian golden jackal, {{with at least one}} subspecies (Canis anthus lupaster) having been classified as a grey wolf. In 2015, a series <b>of</b> <b>analyses</b> on the species' mitochondrial DNA and nuclear genome demonstrated that it was in fact distinct from both the golden jackal and the grey wolf, and more closely related to grey wolves and coyotes. It is nonetheless still close enough to the golden jackal to produce hybrid offspring, as indicated through genetic tests on jackals in Israel and a 19th-century captive crossbreeding experiment. As the IUCN's golden jackal page has not been updated since 2008, it has yet to recognise the distinctiveness of the African wolf; thus its conservation status has not been evaluated, and no reliable population estimates are available.|$|E
500|$|Bannon's books, {{like most}} pulp fiction novels, were not {{reviewed}} by newspapers or magazines {{when they were}} originally published between 1957 and 1962. However, since their release they {{have been the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>analyses</b> that offer differing opinions of Bannon's books as a reflection of the moral standards of the decade, a subtle defiance of those morals, or a combination of both. Andrea Loewenstein notes Bannon's use of cliché, suggesting that it reflected Bannon's own belief in the culturally repressive ideas of the 1950s. Conversely, writer Jeff Weinstein remarks that Bannon's [...] "potboilers" [...] are an expression of freedom because they address issues mainstream fiction did not in the 1950s. Instead of cliché, Weinstein writes that her characters become more realistic as she exploits the dramatic plots, because they [...] "are influenced by the melodramatic conventions of the culture that excludes them".|$|E

Each dimension is organised according to several hierarchies (views <b>of</b> <b>analyse)</b> integrating several levels of data granularity. In order to insure data consistency, we introduce 5 semantic constraints (exclusion, inclusion, partition, simultaneity, totality) which can be intra-dimension or inter-dimensions; the intra-dimension constraints allow the expression of constraints between hierarchies within a same dimension whereas the inter-dimensions constraints focus on hierarchies of distinct dimensions. We also study repercussions of these constraints on multidimensional manipulations and we provide extensions of the multidimensional operators...|$|R

2500|$|This {{primordial}} openness is at {{the heart}} of his thesis of the primacy of perception. The slogan of Husserl's phenomenology is [...] "all consciousness is consciousness of something", which implies a distinction between [...] "acts of thought" [...] (the noesis) and [...] "intentional objects of thought" [...] (the noema). Thus, the correlation between noesis and noema becomes the first step in the constitution <b>of</b> <b>analyses</b> of consciousness. However, in studying the posthumous manuscripts of Husserl, who remained one of his major influences, Merleau-Ponty remarked that, in their evolution, Husserl's work brings to light phenomena which are not assimilable to noesis–noema correlation. This is particularly the case when one attends to the phenomena of the body (which is at once body-subject and body-object), subjective time (the consciousness of time is neither an act of consciousness nor an object of thought) and the other (the first considerations of the other in Husserl led to solipsism).|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of these software packages are designed for analyzing genetic sequence data. [...] For example, PAML {{is a collection of}} programs for the phylogenetic analysis of DNA and protein sequence alignments by maximum likelihood. Ancestral reconstruction can be performed using the codeml program. [...] In addition, [...] is a collection of Python scripts that wrap the ancestral reconstruction functions of PAML for batch processing and greater ease-of-use. , , and [...] are also software packages for the phylogenetic analysis of sequence data, but are designed to be more modular and customizable. [...] HyPhy implements a joint maximum likelihood method of ancestral sequence reconstruction that can be readily adapted to reconstructing a more generalized range of discrete ancestral character states such as geographic locations by specifying a customized model in its batch language. [...] Mesquite provides ancestral state reconstruction methods for both discrete and continuous characters using both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. [...] It also provides several visualization tools for interpreting the results of ancestral reconstruction. [...] MEGA is a modular system, too, but places greater emphasis on ease-of-use than customization <b>of</b> <b>analyses.</b> [...] As of version 5, MEGA allows the user to reconstruct ancestral states using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and empirical Bayes methods.|$|E
