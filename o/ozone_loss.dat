[...] The study analyzed data from the Aura and CALIPSO satellites, and determined that the larger-than-normal <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> was due to an unusually long period of cold weather in the Arctic, some 30 days more than typical, which allowed for more ozone-destroying chlorine compounds to be created. According to Lamont Poole, a co-author of the study, cloud and aerosol particles on which the chlorine compounds are found [...] "were abundant in the Arctic until mid March 2011—much later than usual—with average amounts at some altitudes similar to those observed in the Antarctic, and dramatically larger than the near-zero values seen in March in most Arctic winters".|$|E

2500|$|The Rowland–Molina {{hypothesis}} was strongly disputed {{by representatives of}} the aerosol and halocarbon industries. The Chair of the Board of DuPont {{was quoted as saying}} that ozone depletion theory is [...] "a science fiction tale … a load of rubbish … utter nonsense". Robert Abplanalp, the President of Precision Valve Corporation (and inventor of the first practical aerosol spray can valve), wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland's public statements. Nevertheless, within three years most of the basic assumptions made by Rowland and Molina were confirmed by laboratory measurements and by direct observation in the stratosphere. The concentrations of the source gases (CFCs and related compounds) and the chlorine reservoir species (HCl and [...] ) were measured throughout the stratosphere, and demonstrated that CFCs were indeed the major source of stratospheric chlorine, and that nearly all of the CFCs emitted would eventually reach the stratosphere. Even more convincing was the measurement, by James G. Anderson and collaborators, of chlorine monoxide (ClO) in the stratosphere. ClO is produced by the reaction of Cl with ozone—its observation thus demonstrated that Cl radicals not only were present in the stratosphere but also were actually involved in destroying ozone. McElroy and Wofsy extended the work of Rowland and Molina by showing that bromine atoms were even more effective catalysts for <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> than chlorine atoms and argued that the brominated organic compounds known as halons, widely used in fire extinguishers, were a potentially large source of stratospheric bromine. In 1976 the United States National Academy of Sciences released a report concluding that the ozone depletion {{hypothesis was}} strongly supported by the scientific evidence. [...] In response the United States, Canada and Norway banned the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in 1978. Early estimates were that, if CFC production continued at 1977 levels, the total atmospheric ozone would after a century or so reach a steady state, 15 to 18 percent below normal levels. By 1984, when better evidence on the speed of critical reactions was available, this estimate was changed to 5 to 9 percent steady-state depletion.|$|E

Most of the available chlorine (CHl and ClONO 2) was converted by reactions on polar stratospheric clouds to reactive ClO and Cl 2 O 2 thoroughout the Arctic polar vortex before midwinter. Reactive nitrogen was converted to HNO 3, and some, with spatial inhomogeneity, fell out of the stratosphere. These chemical changes ensured characteristic <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of 10 to 15 percent at altitudes inside the polar vortex where polar stratospheric clouds had occurred.

The model seeks insight into the phenomenon as a paradigm of unanticipated amplification of human activity, strives for clarity and relevance and complies with fundamental principles and with global constraints such as ozone levels and decay rates, chlorine monoxide and nitrogen dioxide concentrations and cloud sightings. Two main conclusions emerge: 1) the local regeneration of active chlorine mediated by nitrogen dioxide on ice clouds after sunrise is a key factor, and 2) local <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> become highly sensitive to initial conditions, and to slight perturbations of the catalytic activity of clouds, above critical levels of active chlorine...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the stratospheric sulfate aerosol layer {{associated}} with the Mt.

The time varying chlorine loading and the stratospheric cooling due to increasing carbon dioxide have been taken into account. The computed ozone and temperature changes associated with the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991 agree well with observations. Long model runs out to the year 2050 have been carried out, in which volcanoes having the characteristics of the Mount Pinatubo volcano were erupted in the model at 10 -year intervals starting in the year 2010. Compared to a non-volcanic run using background aerosol loading, transient reductions of globally averaged column ozone of 2 - 3 percent were computed as a result of each of these eruptions, with the ozone recovering to that computed for the non-volcanic case in about 5 years after the eruption. Computed springtime Arctic column <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of from 10 to 18 percent also recovered to the non-volcanic case within 5 years. These results suggest that the long-term recovery of ozone would not be strongly affected by infrequent volcanic eruptions with a sulfur loading approximating Mt. Pinatubo.
