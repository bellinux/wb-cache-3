50|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> is a {{radiological}} procedure used {{to visualize}} the gallbladder and biliary channels, developed in 1924 by American surgeons Evarts Ambrose Graham and Warren Henry Cole. It is usually indicated in cases of suspected gallbladder disease, and {{can also be used}} to determine or rule out the presence of intermittent obstruction of the bile ducts or recurrent biliary disease after biliary surgery.|$|E
40|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> {{repeated}} at six-months intervals is {{the standard}} method for determining reduction in size of gall stones (partial success) and complete dissolution of stones (complete success). In a comparative study of <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> and cholecystosonography six out of 14 patients with gall stones achieving complete success by oral cholecystographic criteria had stones still detectable by ultrasonography. Repeat <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> in a further 11 patients receiving post-dissolution maintenance treatment detected stones in two, whereas ultrasonography detected stones in seven. In future complete dissolution of gall stones should be reported only if both <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> and ultrasonographic studies give negative results and the progress of patients receiving post-dissolution maintenance treatment is monitored by ultrasonography rather than serial <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography...</b>|$|E
40|$|Twenty-six {{patients}} who had typical symptoms of biliary tract disease, e. g. postprandial right upper quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting, fatty food intolerance and flatulence and who had had two or more normal oral cholecystograms were subjected to cholecytokinin cholescystography. Ten patients showed a normal response to the intravenous administration of cholecystokinin, namely prompt and complete emptying of the gallbladder without producing any adverse reaction or symptoms. Sixteen patients demonstrated either no contraction or incomplete contraction of the gallbladder in response to cholecystokinin; several patients had moderate contraction of the gallbladder accompanied by symptoms of biliary colic. This latter group underwent cholecystectomy and operative cholangiography. Fifteen of the 16 patients are asymptomatic or improved, and only one patient continues to have symptoms. All removed gallbladders had histologic evidence of chronic cholecystitis. It is concluded that in some individuals with continuing symptoms suggesting gallbladder disease but normal <b>oral</b> cholecystograms, cholecystokinin <b>cholecystography</b> may {{be helpful in identifying}} physiologic dysfunction of the gallbladder...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{important}} advances in medical imaging, the oral cholecystogram {{is no longer the}} primary test of gall-bladder function and anatomy. Real-time ultrasonography and cholescintigraphy, both highly sensitive and specific tests, are the two major methods for assessing gallbladder pathology. <b>Oral</b> <b>cholecystography,</b> endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, and percutaneous gallbladder puncture serve as supplementary tests. Decisions about which test to use depend on the kind of gallbladder disease that is suspect-ed as well as the estimated likelihood of the disease before the information is obtained from the procedure. Thus, ultra-sonography is the test of choice for chronic cholecystitis, with <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> reserved for situations in which the diagnosis is uncertain after ultrasonography. When acute cholecystitis is suspected, ultrasonography is also the test of choice in most patients, and cholescintigraphy is used to resolve uncertainty...|$|E
30|$|US {{represents}} the imaging modality {{of choice for}} diagnosing GA, whereas CEUS should be considered the second-line imaging modality. MRI is the problem-solving technique for unclear cases at US and CEUS. PET may be considered for excluding malignancy in cases undiagnosed at US, CEUS and MRI. CT, endoscopic ultrasound and <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> are not routinely considered for diagnosing GA.|$|E
40|$|THERE is a {{widespread}} reluctance amongst surgeons to undertake cholecystectomy {{on the basis of}} symptoms alone. These views derive from early studies suggesting an unacceptable incidence of the post-cholecystectomy syndrome in such cases. ' There is however, a well recognised group of patients with typical biliary tract symptoms and normal <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> ('stoneless symptoms') who pose considerable management problems. It has been suggested that the persistence of contrast medium in the gall bladder on a straight x-ray taken 24 hours after an otherwise normal cholecystogram is a reliable index of gall bladder dysfunction. 2 Whilst more sophisticated techniques of demonstrating gall bladder function exist these are not universally available, outside specialist centres. The concept, that the simple, inexpensive, addition of one further x-ray, 24 hours after normal <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> might help to select out those with genuine gall bladder pathology, has considerable clinical appeal. The reliability of persistant opacification of the gall bladder in discriminating gall bladder pathology in the absence of calculi, has been assessed in a small series of patients...|$|E
40|$|In {{comparing}} the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> {{with that of}} sonography in 479 patients in a community hospital, the oral cholecystogram, when used with a double dose of contrast agent, showed greater specificity (1. 00) and sensitivity (0. 99) than the sonogram (0. 54 and 0. 94, respectively). Because of lower cost, the oral cholecystogram should {{be used as the}} initial diagnostic study when cholelithiasis is suspected, unless specific contraindications exist...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> {{is a well}} {{established}} method for studying the human gallbladder and radiological non-visualization of the gallbladder {{has been shown to}} correlate highly with the presence of disease. The exact mechanism by which diseased gallbladders fail to visualize is unclear, but may be due to a failure of the gallbladder to concentrate the luminal contents. Concentration of gallbladder contents is achieved by the reabsorption of water, the driving force for which is active sodium (Na+) absorption. Therefore Na+ transport was studied by measuring the flux of Na 22 across isolated human gallbladder mucosa (obtained at cholecystectomy) and compared with the results of <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> and histological grading. In 27 gallbladders studied, 59 % absorbed Na+, whilst the remainder secreted Na+. Comparison with histological grading showed that as gallbladders became more diseased they absorbed less Na+ and were more likely to secrete Na+. In addition, gallbladders that absorbed Na+ {{were significantly more likely to}} visualize on cholecystography than those that secreted Na+. These results indicate that some diseased human gallbladders secrete, rather than absorb, Na+ and suggest that the mechanism for radiological non-visualization is failure of fluid absorption and the development of active fluid secretion...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{advances}} in hepatobiliary imaging, the diagnosis of chronic acalculous gallbladder disease remains difficult. A retrospective study was undertaken to assess {{the value of a}} multiimaging approach in detecting chronic acalculous gallbladder disease and in predicting which patients would obtain symptomatic relief after cholecystectomy. Of 199 patients with chronic cholecystitis, 26 (13 %) had no gallstones. Of these 26, only 17 (65 %) had symptoms related to chronic cholecystitis; in the remainder, the histologic diagnosis was made incidentally. After cholecystectomy, 13 (76 %) of the 17 symptomatic patients obtained long-term symptomatic relief, while in four, the symptoms recurred. Among patients with histologic changes of chronic cholecystitis, biliary scintigraphy was the most sensitive technique (sensitivity, 89 %). The sensitivity of sonography and <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> was 61. 5 % and 66 %, respectively. However, for identifying symptomatic patients who may obtain long-term symptomatic relief after cholecystectomy, the accuracy of sonography, <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography,</b> and biliary scintigraphy was 82 %, 86 %, and 38 %, respectively. When two tests were in agreement the accuracy was 88 %. For chronic acalculous cholecystitis, more than one study must be performed {{in order to make the}} correct diagnosis and to predict good results from cholecystectomy...|$|E
40|$|In 100 {{subjects}} the cholecystokinin {{test has}} been used in conjunction with the secretin test of gall bladder function. The response of the normal gall bladder to a standard dose of pancreozymin has been studied and the results in patients following cholecystectomy and in the presence of biliary tract disease have been recorded and contrasted with the results obtained by the secretin test and <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography.</b> These are sufficiently characteristic to warrant the conclusion that used in this way the cholecystokinin test provides a new and valuable semi-quantitative estimate of gall bladder function...|$|E
40|$|Gall-bladder {{emptying}} {{in response}} to a standard meal was assessed in 34 patients with radiolucent gall stones and 34 matched controls. Percentage gall-bladder emptying, derived from volume measurements made on standardised <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography,</b> was significantly higher at 15 minutes in the patients than the controls (mean +/- SE of mean 38. 0 +/- 3. 7 % v 28. 0 +/- 3. 8 %). This difference was maintained at 30 and 60 minutes. It is concluded that postprandial gall-bladder emptying is increased in patients with cholesterol gall stones, and that this may be the cause of the small bile-acid pool found in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gallbladder {{duplication}} {{is a rare}} congenital condition, {{which can}} now be detected preoperatively by imaging studies. Methods: We report a case of duplicated gallbladder with symptomatic unilobar gallstones. Appropriate biliary workup (ultrasound, <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography,</b> and intravenous cholangiography) allowed a correct preoperative diagnosis. Results: Laparoscopic treatment included selective removal of the diseased accessory gallbladder. However, postoperative acute cholecystitis and symptomatic gallstone occurred in the remaining main gallbladder, and laparoscopic reintervention was required 27 months later. Conclusions: This case illustrates the need for complete removal of both gallbladders during initial surgery. Precise intraoperative recognition of vascular and biliary anatomy-including abnormalities-is highlighted to avoid mistakes during surgery...|$|E
40|$|Imaging of the {{gallbladder}} {{demonstrates a}} wide range of anatomical variants, including anomalies in location, number and shape. Duplication anomalies are quite rare and are characterized by a large variety of configurations depending on the size and degree of fusion of the two lobes, and on the number and disposition of the cystic ducts. We present a case of a deeply cleft, bilobed gallbladder imaged by computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) and <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> (OCG). The anomaly consisted of complete duplication of the body and fundus into two distinct and separated lobes both of which entered a single infundibulum. Awareness of congenital gallbladder variants may help in recognizing and correctly classifying gallbladder abnormalities, thus preventing misdiagnoses...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-seven {{symptomatic}} cholelithiasis {{patients who}} had cholecystectomy were studied to determine the relationships between clinical manifestations, histologic findings and gallbladder absorptive capability. A clinical score was calculated from clinical data which we thought might be predictive of abnormal gallbladder histology. Histologic parameters indicative of gallbladder disease were used to calculate a histologic score. Shortcircuit current measurements, which reflect gallbladder sodium absorption,were used to assess absorptive function. Patients with very high clinical scores, indicative of pronounced clinical score was not predictive of histologic findings or absorptive function of the gallbladder {{is directly related to}} the degree of histologic abnormality, and that absorptive capability is not an all-or-none phenomenon. The data also show that visualization on <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> is an unreliable measure of gallbladder absorptive capability...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonography is the {{technique}} of choice in diagnosing gallbladder calculi. In the mid- 1970 s ultrasound was only accurate enough to use {{as an adjunct to}} <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> but refinements such as gray scale and real-time imaging mean that in experienced hands it has a sensitivity of 96 % and a specificity of 93 %. Sonography is also the test of choice in the initial evaluation of jaundiced patients. It is an excellent technique for distinguishing between obstructive and nonobstructive jaundice, although it is less accurate in demonstrating the cause of the obstruction. Ultrasound is painless and relatively inexpensive, and has several advantages over oral cholecystography; it doesn't depend on contrast material, causes no adverse reactions or side-effects, is safe during pregnancy, does not expose the patient to radiation, and is less time-consuming...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of biliary tract disease was investigated by <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> and/or intravenous cholangiography in 77 unselected Nigerians with homozygous sickle-cell disease (SCD). They included 32 males and 45 females with ages ranging from 8 to 31 years. The prevalence of cholelithiasis was 9 % with equal sex incidence. The stones were always multiple and 71. 4 % {{of them were}} radio opaque. Visualization and contractility of all gall bladders examined were normal. The only patient with symptoms and signs which suggested biliary tract disease had no radiographic evidence of cholelithiasis and {{it was impossible to}} predict the presence of cholelithiasis from the {{incidence of}} abdominal crises in the patients. The prevalence of cholelithiasis is significantly less than that reported in American patients with SCD (35 %) and different dietary habits are probably responsible for this...|$|E
40|$|Imaging {{is central}} to the {{investigation}} and diagnoses of biliary tract disease. Upper abdominal pain, jaundice and abnormal liver function test are common symptoms and signs and imaging of the biliary tract should be performed to make an exact diagnosis of the disease. There are many options in the field of imaging from simple to more sophisticated examinations. Several imaging techniques are obsolete namely <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography,</b> Intravenous cholangiography and biliary scintigraphy, and should therefore be omitted. These imaging techniques are expensive and we should choose one or two options. Abdominal ultrasound is less expensive and can be performed rapidly without special preparation or contrast agent. It is the imaging of choice in the initial evaluation to evaluate patients with hepatopacreaticobiliary diseases. From the Result of abdominal ultrasound examination we can choose further the right imaging technique that can disclose the diagnoses of the disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{records of}} 242 patients, {{operated}} consecutively for biliary lithiasis, were analyzed {{to determine the}} reliability of <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> (OCG), ultrasonography (US), and HIDA in detecting biliary calculi. Preoperative interpretations were correlated to operative findings. OCG obtained in 138 patients was accurate in 92 %. US obtained in 150 was correct in 89 %. The accuracy of HIDA was 92 % in acute and 78 % in chronic cholecystitis. Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) done in 173 patients indicated the need for exploratory choledochotomy in 24; 21 had choledocholithiasis. These observations suggest that OCG and US are very accurate, but not infallible, in detecting cholelithiasis. US should be done first; when doubt persists, the addition of OCG allows the preoperative diagnosis of gallstones in 97 % of the cases. HIDA is highly accurate but not infallible in detecting acute calculous cholecystitis. IOC is very reliable in detecting choledocholithiasis; thus, its routine is justifiable...|$|E
40|$|The {{finding of}} adenomatous polyps of the {{gallbladder}} {{is a rare}} occurrence and an unusual clinical problem. Among 2, 145 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease only 9 (0. 4 per cent) presented with adenomatous polyps. There were 6 women and 3 men, aged 17 to 70 years. Preoperative ultrasonographic diagnosis was made in only 1 of 7 patients with gallstones, in contrast polypoid lesions within a gallbladder without stones were easily confirmed by both ultrasonography and <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> in the remaining 2 patients. All polyps were 1. 0 cm or less in size and without histologic evidence of malignant change. The clinical significance of this rare condition is discussed, with particular reference to a possible role in development of gallbladder carcinoma. Surgical treatment should be advocated regardless of clinical manifestation when the polyp exceeds 1. 0 cm in diameter or rapid growth of the lesion is seen on ultrasonographic follow-up examinations.

40|$|Currently, most {{protocols}} {{evaluating the}} efficacy of gallstone lithotripsy require a visualized gallbladder on <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> (OCG). The {{primary purpose of the}} OCG is to establish that the cystic duct is patent. When the gallbladder is visualized on OCG, it {{can also be used to}} number and size gallstones accurately. Patients with non-visualization of the gallbladder on OCG are excluded from consideration for lithotripsy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the ultrasonographic findings (i. e., number and sizes of stones in 32 patients with nonvisualization on the OCG). In 11 patients (34 %) ultrasound (US) did not detect any stone, and it is presumed that the gallbladder failed to visualize for other reasons. Six patients (19 %) had one or two stones and 15 (47 %) patients had more than three stones. This suggests that 20 % of patients with nonvisualization of the gallbladder on OCG would otherwise be eligible for lithotripsy provided that patency of the cystic duct can be demonstrated by other means, such as computed tomographic (CT) examination with oral biliary contrast or cholescintigraphy...|$|E
40|$|Thirty {{patients}} with radiolucent stones in a radiologically functioning gall bladder were treated {{for up to}} two years with a combination of Rowachol (one capsule twice daily), a mixture of cyclic monoterpenes, and chenodeoxycholic acid (7. 0 - 10. 5 mg/kg/day). The patients were not selected for body weight or size of stones. All complete dissolutions diagnosed by <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> were confirmed or refuted by ultrasound examination. Control of symptoms was excellent, only one patient withdrawing from the study because of persistent biliary pain. No evidence of hepatotoxicity was detected biochemically, and diarrhoea due to chenodeoxycholic acid was minimal at this dose. Stones disappeared completely in 11 patients (37 %) within one year and in 15 (50 %) within two years. These results compared favourably with those obtained with similar doses of chenodeoxycholic acid alone, in particular those of the National Co-operative Gallstone Study (complete dissolution in 13. 5 % of patients at two years). Treatment with a combination of medium dose chenodeoxycholic acid with Rowachol for radiolucent gall stones is economical, effective, and likely to minimise persistent symptoms and adverse effects of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{doses of}} either iopronic acid (4. 5 g Oravue, Squibb) or iopanoic acid (3 gTelepaque, Winthrop) {{were given to}} 98 {{patients}} requiring cholecystography. Radiographs were taken 13 to 16 hours after treatment showed good to excellent gallbladder opacification in 44 percent of patients after the first dose of iopronic acid and in an additional 29 percent after a second dose. Similar opacification occurred in 42 percent of patients after the first dose of iopanoic acid and in 34 percent after a second dose. Drug-related abnormalities in blood and urine tests occurred about equally in both groups and one patient in each group exhibited a clinically adverse reaction (diarrhea). Thus, the performance (radiographic efficacy and drug safety) of the new contrast agent, iopronic acid, was similar to a widely used drug, iopanoic acid. An important problem {{associated with the use}} of iopanoic acid for <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> is the frequent failure to produce diagnostically suitable gallbladder opacification with the initial dose [1]. This failure necessitates repeating the examination to avoid false-positive diagnoses since many of these patients subsequently are shown not to have cholecystopathology or hepatic disorders [2]. lopanoic acid also suffers from the disadvantage of producing an appreciable incidence of side-effects such as diarrhea, nausea, and transitory impairment of hepatic and renal functio...|$|E
40|$|Since {{radiographic}} {{findings on}} <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> (OCG) {{have implications for}} the eligibility for nonsurgical therapy of elderly patients, we investigated the OCGs of 448 symptomatic gallstone patients (109 male, 339 female; mean age, 49. 8 ± 14 (range, 21 – 88)). Opacification of the gallbladder was found in 323 cases (72. 1 %). Calcifications of gallstones were found in 85 opacified gallbladders (26. 3 %). Solitary and multiple stones were calcified in 35. 3 % and 18. 2 %, respectively (P 40 years), {{there was a significant}} increase in calcifications (P < 0. 02) and a non-significant increase in opacification with increasing age. It is concluded that age is a determinant for calcification of gallstones and not opacification of the gallbladder. Since multiple stones are proportionately observed more in clinical studies than in epidemiologic studies, it is suggested that multiplicity of stones predisposes to biliary complaints. That solitary stones {{are more likely to be}} calcified than multiple stones, adds to the hypothesis that solitary and multiple stones have a different pathogenesis. Elderly patients, in whom nonsurgical therapy is most likely to be indicated and cost-effective, are less likely to be suitable for this form of treatment, since age is a determinant for stone calcification...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the optimum bile acid regimen for rapid gall stone dissolution, 48 gall stone patients {{were divided into}} four groups of 12 according to stone diameter and were randomly allocated to receive one of four treatment regimens: bedtime or mealtime chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 12 mg/kg/day) and bedtime or mealtime ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, 12 mg/kg/day). An additional 10 patients treated {{with a combination of}} CDCA plus UDCA (each 6 mg/kg/day) at bedtime were matched with the 10 patients on bedtime CDCA and the 10 on bedtime UDCA. The gall stone dissolution rates at six and 12 months were determined by standardised <b>oral</b> <b>cholecystography</b> and expressed as the percentage reduction in the gall stone volume after treatment. The gall stone dissolution rate at six months was higher for UDCA than CDCA treatment (median 78 % v 48 %, p less than 0. 01), and for bedtime than mealtime administration (69 % v 39 %, p less than 0. 02). Both differences were greater for stones less than 8 mm diameter. The dissolution rate was faster for combination therapy than for CDCA alone at both six (82 % v 36 %, p less than 0. 05) and 12 months (100 % v 54 %, p less than 0. 05), but was not different from UDCA alone. We conclude that bile acid treatment should be confined to patients with small gall stones and that bedtime administration of combined UDCA and CDCA is likely to provide the most effective and safe combination...|$|E
