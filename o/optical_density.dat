5|$|The {{origin of}} the dust bands is less problematic. The dust has a very short lifetime, 100–1000 years, and should be {{continuously}} replenished by collisions between larger ring particles, moonlets and meteoroids from outside the Uranian system. The belts of the parent moonlets and particles are themselves invisible due to their low optical depth, while the dust reveals itself in forward-scattered light. The narrow main rings and the moonlet belts that create dust bands are expected to differ in particle size distribution. The main rings have more centimeter to meter-sized bodies. Such a distribution increases the surface area of the material in the rings, leading to high <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> in back-scattered light. In contrast, the dust bands have relatively few large particles, which results in low optical depth.|$|E

Spectrophotometers can measure intensity of light very accurately. The cell culture is placed in a transparent cuvette and the absorption is measured relative to medium alone. <b>Optical</b> <b>density</b> (OD) is directly proportional to the biomass in the cell suspension in a given range that is specific to the cell type. Using spectrophotometry for measuring the turbidity of cultures is known as turbidometry.|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{determination of}} the total carotenoid and the total chloraphyll chloroplast was investigatgd. As the chlorophylls and the carotenoids {{were found to be}} solubilized by the cationic detergents, the total carotenoid determinations were carried out by the so-called elimination method, in which the both isolated pigments from spinach leaves were used as the standards and only the carotenoid was determined spectrophotometrically. Namely, cetyldimethyl ammonium chloride was used as the solubilizing agent, and in absorption spectra of the solubilized total chlorophyll aqueous solutions the two wavelengths having the identical <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> (401 and 443 nm) might be arbitrarily determined. As the first order relationship between the total carotenoid quantities and the differences of these <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> was able to be established, the carotenoid determinations of the solubilized chloroplasts were also taken place by estimating the <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> in the two wavalength. The total chlorophyll determinations were carried out by the estimation of the <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> of the two wavelength (620 and 667 nm). The determination examples of both pigments in some chloroplasts were carried out with these methods...|$|R

Serum samples were considered positive if the mean <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> were higher than cut-off point. For consideration as positive following the criteria of multiple-antigen ELISA, the serum tested specifically react with any antigen when the cut-off value was calculated from the mean <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> plus three standard deviations (Zhang et al. 2009).

40|$|Spectroscopic and {{histological}} {{study of}} CO 2 laser interaction with rats tissues were carried out. We detected {{for the first}} time the changes in optical absorption spectra of rat's tissues with selective CO 2 laser <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> ranging from 20. 64 to 34. 40 W/cm 2. The laser exposed tissues show higher absorbance in hemoglobin than that for the unexposed tissue. Using the same laser and same <b>optical</b> <b>densities,</b> the absorption spectra of fresh blood were measured. Much intense peaks of hemoglobin than that for the corresponding peaks for the tissue were detected. A scheme based on recent experimental findings is proposed for explanation of this novel phenomenon. The histological study shows thermal damage of blood vessels localized at the dermis layer. At high laser <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> a vessel rupture with hemorrhage were occurred. The results indicate a pronounced modification of skin absorption properties by laser irradiation.

25|$|Superior {{and much}} more {{expensive}} {{is the use of}} interference contrast. Differences in <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> will show up as differences in relief. A nucleus within a cell will actually show up as a globule in the most often used differential interference contrast system according to Georges Nomarski. However, it has to be kept in mind that this is an optical effect, and the relief does not necessarily resemble the true shape. Contrast is very good and the condenser aperture can be used fully open, thereby reducing the depth of field and maximizing resolution.|$|E
25|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun {{with the naked eye}} permanently damages human vision, amateur observation of sunspots is generally conducted using projected images, or directly through protective filters. Small sections of very dark filter glass, such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope eyepiece can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose hydrogen-alpha narrow bandpass filters and aluminum-coated glass attenuation filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high <b>optical</b> <b>density)</b> on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the eyepiece.|$|E
25|$|More {{sophisticated}} techniques {{will show}} proportional differences in <b>optical</b> <b>density.</b> Phase contrast {{is a widely}} used technique that shows differences in refractive index as difference in contrast. It {{was developed by the}} Dutch physicist Frits Zernike in the 1930s (for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953). The nucleus in a cell for example will show up darkly against the surrounding cytoplasm. Contrast is excellent; however it is not for use with thick objects. Frequently, a halo is formed even around small objects, which obscures detail. The system consists of a circular annulus in the condenser, which produces a cone of light. This cone is superimposed on a similar sized ring within the phase-objective. Every objective has a different size ring, so for every objective another condenser setting has to be chosen. The ring in the objective has special optical properties: it, first of all, reduces the direct light in intensity, but more importantly, it creates an artificial phase difference of about a quarter wavelength. As the physical properties of this direct light have changed, interference with the diffracted light occurs, resulting in the phase contrast image. One disadvantage of phase-contrast microscopy is halo formation (halo-light ring).|$|E

2500|$|Changes in the (M-L) bond {{distances}} {{are going}} to affect the symmetry and electronic states of metal complexes. [...] UV-vis spectroscopy is a very useful tool for the determination of the changes of electronic states due to the SCO. [...] For example, the HS and LS states of an FeII compound such as FeII(pic)3Cl2·EtOH, can be followed with UV-vis spectroscopy. [...] The absorption spectra of these FeII molecules at different temperatures clearly show the change in intensities of the spin allowed transitions, due to these symmetric changes. Similarly to FT-IR, the intensities of the absorption bands are proportional to the fraction of metal centers in the corresponding spin state; the more intense the band, the higher the fraction of metal centers in that spin state. [...] In Figure 9, the 5T2→5E absorption band, (left spectrum), corresponds to the HS transition and is centered at 830nm. [...] The <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> of the HS band is proportional to the γHS, and a γHS vs. temperature can be plotted as in Figure 10.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious {{structural}} characteristic of bacteria is (with some exceptions) their small size. For example, Escherichia coli cells, an [...] "average" [...] sized bacterium, are about 2µm (micrometres) long and 0.5µm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6 - 0.7 μm3. [...] This corresponds to a wet mass of about 1 picogram (pg), assuming that the cell consists mostly of water. The dry mass of a single cell can be estimated as 23% of the wet mass, amounting to 0.2 pg. About half of the dry mass of a bacterial cell consists of carbon, and also about half of it {{can be attributed to}} proteins. Therefore, a typical fully grown 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli (at an <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> of 1.0, corresponding to ca. 109 cells/ml) yields about 1 g wet cell mass. Small size is extremely important because it allows for a large surface area-to-volume ratio which allows for rapid uptake and intracellular distribution of nutrients and excretion of wastes. At low surface area-to-volume ratios the diffusion of nutrients and waste products across the bacterial cell membrane limits the rate at which microbial metabolism can occur, making the cell less evolutionarily fit. The reason for the existence of large cells is unknown, although it is speculated that the increased cell volume is used primarily for storage of excess nutrients.|$|E

Before starting the dialysis session, filters and lines are checked for residual levels of peracetic acid {{by means of a}} non-quantitative colorimetric test that is visually interpreted. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate a new quantitative spectrophotometric test for detection of peracetic acid residues. Methods: Peracetic acid solutions were prepared in concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 10 ppm. A reagent (potassium-titanium oxide + sulfuric acid) was added to each sample in proportions varying from 0. 08 to 2. 00 drops/mL of solution. <b>Optical</b> <b>densities</b> were determined in a spectrophotometer using a 405 -nm filter and subjected to visual qualitative test by different observers. Results: A relation between peroxide concentrations and respective <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> was observed and it was linear with R 2 > 0. 90 for all reagent/substrate proportions. The peak <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> were obtained with the reagent/substrate ratio of 0. 33 drops/mL, which was later standardized for all further experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative tests yielded a specificity of 100 %. The quantitative test was more sensitive than the qualitative test and resulted in higher positive and negative predictive values. There was a difference between observers in the qualitative test and some samples with significant amounts of peroxide were not detected. Conclusion: A quantitative spectrophotometric test may improve detection of residues of peracetic acid when compared to the standard visual qualitative test. This innovation may contribute to the development of safer standards for reuse of hemodialysis filters...|$|R
