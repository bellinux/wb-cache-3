Using a panel database of 3221 bank-year observations from 40 countries and controlling for unobservable bank effects and for the endogeneity of explanatory variables, we find that bank income smoothing depends on investor protection, disclosure, regulation and supervision, financial structure, and financial development. Results suggest there is less bank income smoothing {{not only with the}} strength of investor protection, but also with the extent of accounting disclosure, restrictions on bank activities, and <b>official</b> and private <b>supervision,</b> while there is more income smoothing with market orientation and development of a country's financial system. ...|$|R

50|$|In 1975 the Council for Religious Affairs (CRA) {{was given}} an <b>official</b> legal <b>supervision</b> role over the church (prior to this it had {{unofficial}} control). Every parish was placed {{at the disposal of}} the CRA, which alone had the power to grant registration. It was illegal for a religious community to practice their faith without CRA approval (including public prayers, meeting together, etc.) Until a religious community was registered was the CRA, it could not practice its faith. In order to be registered it needed to submit a petition to the local government which would then send it to the CRA with its own comments and recommendations within a period of no longer than one month. The CRA, however, could take as much time as it chose before it came to the decision of registering a parish. This greatly weakened the church, which earlier had only needed to deal with local government with which it had the power to appeal. The new policy was designed to more greatly strangle the Church. This was accompanied by intimidation, blackmail and threat to the clergy, and as a whole it was meant to demoralize the Church.|$|R
50|$|In {{medieval and}} early modern times, the state mining {{regulations}} obliged mining companies to employ pit <b>officials</b> for the <b>supervision</b> of their mines.

The hiring and firing of pit officials was the responsibility of the mining authority or Bergamt; at best the mine owners had a say and could impress their wishes on the Bergmeister in this regard. With the reform of mining law in the years from 1851 to 1865, there was a change in the official status of the Steiger. The Steiger was no longer a state official, but a private officer. Despite this change, Steigers continued to be employed by the mining authority.|$|R
