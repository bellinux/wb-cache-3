50|$|Objectification of Women: Objectification {{of women}} in Pseudolus is {{represented}} mainly through the pimp Ballio’s treatment of his slave and prostitute, Phoenicium. Ballio sells her, though he has promised to sell her to her true love, like an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> to the Makedonian soldier, Polymachaeroplagides, in exchange for 2000 drachmae. His treatment of her and of his other slave prostitutes whom he threatens to put on meat hooks {{if they do not}} provide enough cash show the abuse of his power and authority over them. Certainly slavery is legal at this time. But Ballio could still show some consideration and care for his charges as fellow human beings. Such is not the case. His abuse would most likely have resonated with other women in his audience. (Nathan Johnston). In addition, the objectification {{of women in}} the play is accentuated by Phoenicium’s being mute and a non-actor throughout the plot.

50|$|The {{creation}} of a European community patent system, which {{would lead to a}} single unitary patent in the European Union (or its predecessor the European Community), has been debated since the 1970s. In 2012 agreement was reached between all European Union Member States except Italy and Spain on a European patent with unitary effect, more commonly known as the unitary patent, a proposed new type of patent that would be valid in participating member states of the European Union. Unitary effect can be registered for a European patent upon grant, replacing validation of the European patent in the individual countries concerned. The unitary effect means a single renewal fee, a single (group of) owner(s), a single <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> and uniform protection, which means that revocation as well as infringement proceedings are to be decided for the unitary patent as a whole rather than for each country individually.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interface}} between two important institutional pillars of market exchange – Intellectual Property (IP) law and Antitrust law – in light of a theory of property rights incompleteness. This theory interprets property as an incomplete bundle of both defined and undefined rights over actual and potential uses of given resources and defines externalities as joint claims over rival production uses of undefined entitlements, irrespective of whether the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights has a tangible or intangible nature. The paper argues that traditional distinctions between physical property and IP based on attributes of tangibility, rivalry and excludability are misleading and bases on the substantial homogeneity of property rights and IPRs an argument supporting the complementarity between IP law and Antitrust law. Far from being an unjustified ex-post limitation to existing property rights, likely to undermine ex-ante incentives, Antitrust intervention {{represents one of the}} means by which incompletely specified property rights (both intellectual and tangible) might be redefined over time as externalities emerge. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{normative}} analysis of intellectual property rights, {{in light of the}} technological revolution of the Internet and accompanying technologies. After a brief overview of the various philosophical justifications for awarding intellectual property rights, it identifies two major Law and Economics paradigms for the analysis of intellectual property: the incentives paradigm, which is founded upon the public goods analysis of neo-classical microeconomic theory, and the tragedy of the commons literature, which is based on the economic analysis of externalities. The paper raises several points of critique towards both frameworks of analysis and especially towards their inability to point to the desirable extent of intellectual property rights (IPR) and the direction of their reform required {{as the result of the}} recent technological revolution. It further criticizes the dominant contemporary Law and Economics writings in this field as shifting to a new proprietary paradigm that pre-assumes information to be an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> overlooking its fundamental differences from physical property and focusing on its management rather than on its initial justifications. The paper is concluded with some tentative thoughts on the general notion of Property Rights in light of the contemporary approach concerning intellectual property. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between property rights {{and the protection of}} environmental compartments. The thesis is divided into chapters corresponding to individual compartments, namely soil, minerals, energy, water, air, organisms and ecosystems. Each chapter defines given compartment and then describes its current Czech regulation. This thesis doesn't deal with all legislation in the area of environmental protection, but only with provisions related to ownership, namely whether given compartment can be an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights and if possible whether its owner's treatment of this compartment can be restricted in the interest of its protection. Some chapters are further divided into sub-chapters due to quantity of laws concerning corresponding environmental compartment, e. g. the chapter about ownership of organisms differentiates animals from other organisms and further divides them into animals in captivity and free-living ones. Chapters about soil, minerals, water and organisms are ended with partial conclusions summarising my knowledge and thoughts about their respective topics, while the conclusion of the thesis as whole represents combination of synthesis of those partial conclusions and my opinions on overall legal regulation of property rights to environmetal compartments...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{critique}} {{aspects of the}} law relating to in vitro fertilisation (‘IVF’) treatment in the United Kingdom. Focusing {{on the case of}} Evans v Amicus Healthcare Ltd [2003] EWHC 2161 (Fam), where two women sought to have their embryos transferred after the consent of their partners had been withdrawn, I discuss the legal constructions applied to embryos and participants to IVF treatment. In the Evans case the Judge’s decision to reject the women’s claim was popularly accepted as morally, ethically and legally correct. I argue, however, that because the treatment of embryos is founded upon a constructed (and changeable) division between a human subject and an <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> there is no greater coherence or legitimacy in the current law than would have been the case had the claimants’ submissions been accepted. I then discuss how a presumption of equal rights over the embryo can, in practice, consistently prejudice the interests of women despite an appearance of neutrality. Drawing on the work of Michel Foucault and Judith Butler I go on to consider the ways in which law manages to appear fair and neutral despite its internal inconsistencies. Finally, I explore some alternatives to the current law...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the ability of our state to guarantee the rights <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property,</b> which {{is a prerequisite for}} further integration of Ukraine in the sphere of international commercial trade. Affective functioning <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> protection system is impossible without creation of an effective system of protection <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> rights in the country, and with no protection for these rights at the international level through the relevant international agreements.

40|$|During {{the past}} twenty years human {{biological}} materials have become increasingly important for research as well as for therapeutic uses and related commercial exploitation. The scientific and regulatory conditions for their procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution have been reflected upon widely and developed in both the civil law and the common law domains. In the normative puzzle taking place around the biobanking of human biological materials and information, the basic legal perspectives underlying most normative analyses remain anchored to the concepts of autonomy – also conceived of as privacy [...] and property. The former has been primarily developed in Europe, the latter in the U. S. Both are showing some failures, while the normative picture as a whole appears inadequate. This contribution explores the main existing legal frameworks for biological materials, both in the U.

The legal fate of bodily materials is somewhat {{similar to that of the}} environment. In both instances, the notions of subject of rights (the rights holder) and of <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> (the object held) have failed to fully represent the potential for collective sharing.
