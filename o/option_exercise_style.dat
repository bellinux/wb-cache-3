5000|$|A Canary {{option is}} an <b>option</b> whose <b>exercise</b> <b>style</b> lies somewhere between European options and Bermudian options. (The name {{refers to the}} {{relative}} geography of the Canary Islands.) Typically, the holder can <b>exercise</b> the <b>option</b> at quarterly dates, but not before a set time period (typically one year) has elapsed. The ability to <b>exercise</b> the <b>option</b> ends prior to the maturity date of the product. The term was coined by Keith Kline, {{who at the time}} was an agency fixed income trader at the Bank of New York.|$|R
5000|$|A Verde {{option is}} an <b>option</b> whose <b>exercise</b> <b>style</b> lies somewhere between European options and Canary options. (The name {{refers to the}} {{relative}} geography of the Cape Verde Islands.) The holder can <b>exercise</b> the <b>option</b> at incremental dates (typically on an annual basis, sometimes less frequently), but not before a set time period has elapsed. The ability to <b>exercise</b> the <b>option</b> ends prior to the maturity date of the product. The term was first coined by John Young, an agency fixed income trader at Hapoalim Securities in New York.|$|R

40|$|Several recent papers {{document}} that {{the magnitude of}} potential gains from stock-based compensation is positively related to the likelihood of misreporting. In a sample of firms that announce restatements of their financial statements from 1997 to 2002, we examine whether managers realize these potential gains occurring from their accounting choices. After controlling for diversification needs and stock price impact, we find no significant evidence of higher <b>option</b> <b>exercises</b> by executives in the misreported years. However, for firms that {{are more likely to}} have made deliberate aggressive accounting choices, we find significant evidence of higher <b>option</b> <b>exercises.</b> For these firms, <b>option</b> <b>exercises</b> are higher by 20 - 60 % in comparison to industry and size matched nonrestating firms. <b>Options</b> <b>exercises</b> by executives are also increasing in the magnitude of the restatement as captured by the effect of the restatement on net income. These higher <b>option</b> <b>exercises</b> tend to be more pervasive and are not just confined to the CEO and CFO of the firm. ...|$|R

40|$|We rigorously {{model the}} <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> and {{portfolio}} choice problem of opti-mistic executives. Our analysis motivates two novel indicators of optimism, {{which can be}} easily inferred using standard data sets: (i) the retention of {{a significant proportion of}} stocks obtained from <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> and (ii) the voluntary holding of shares. Theory suggests these are superior to alternative indicators based on exercise behavior. In a large cross-section, our measures of CEO optimism explain investment intensity and leverage better than those used previously. We confirm the following implications of the model empirically: optimistic executives delay <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> and also capture a higher proportion of the American option value...|$|R
40|$|Many {{economic}} decisions can {{be described}} as an <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> or optimal stopping problem under uncertainty. Motivated by experimental evidence such as the Ellsberg Paradox, we follow Knight (1921) and distinguish risk from uncertainty. To afford this distinction, we adopt the multiple-priors utility model. We show that the impact of ambiguity on the <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> decision depends on the relative degrees of ambiguity about continuation payoffs and termination payoffs. Consequently, ambiguity may accelerate or delay <b>option</b> <b>exercise.</b> We apply our results to firm investment and exit problems, and show that the myopic NPV rule can be optimal for an agent having an extremely high degree of ambiguity aversion. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{economic}} decisions can {{be described}} by an <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> problem. The standard real options approach {{emphasizes the importance of}} uncertainty in determining option value and timing of <b>option</b> <b>exercise.</b> No distinction between risk and uncertainty is made. Motivated by the experimental evidence such as the Ellsberg Paradox, we follow Knight (1921) and distinguish risk from uncertainty. To afford this distinction, we adopt the multiple-priors utility model to analyze an <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> problem. We also provide several examples to illustrate that our model can explain some phenomena that are hard to reconcile with the standard real options model. These examples include real investment, job search, firm exit, firm default, and youth suicide...|$|R

3000|$|Given {{the role}} of {{asymmetric}} information, changing the full-information supposition will add notable realism to the models of <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> and technology investments. A few recent studies involve asymmetric information in their models. For example, Grenadier (1999) shows how information externalities may be created through noted <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> decisions. Nadiminti et al. (2002) analyze intrafirm resource assignment under asymmetric information and negative externalities [...]. These studies represent the fast evolution of the field.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine whether the {{proceeds}} from stock <b>option</b> <b>exercises</b> can influence on investment in Taiwanese listed firms. Since the proportion of high-tech firms account for the most in Taiwan, the study expects that the sensitivity of R&D expenses to the cash inflows received from <b>exercising</b> stock <b>options</b> is significantly positive, In addition, high percentage of firms in Taiwan are multinational enterprises which tend to invest in oversees where the costs of running businesses are lower. Therefore, the study predicts the effect of <b>exercising</b> stock <b>options</b> on FDI is also statistically positive. The data is collected from Taiwanese Economic Journal database, including 2, 218 firm-year stock option observations from 402 listed firms between 2003 and 2009. Other financial data are merged with the stock option data by hand collecting. The final sample used in the analysis comes to 2, 814 firm-year observations. The panel data analysis is used in the study. Furthermore, in order to investigate whether the influence of the proceeds from stock <b>option</b> <b>exercises</b> on investment can vary cross different financing constraints, the regression discontinuity approach is also employed. The study expects that the effect of the stock option proceeds on investment is greater for firms facing high cost financing. The results indicate the influence of the stock option proceeds on R&D is larger than the influence on FDI. The coefficient estimates explain that $ 0. 948 of each dollar of the proceeds from stock <b>option</b> <b>exercises</b> is assigned to R&D expenditures and 0. 498 of each dollar of the stock <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> proceeds is allocated to FDI spending. However, the correlation between the proceeds from stock <b>option</b> <b>exercises</b> and investment is not significant when firms face costly external financing...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide new}} {{evidence}} of cyclical variation in mortgage default <b>option</b> <b>exercise.</b> For a given level of negative equity, borrower propensity to default rose markedly during {{the financial crisis}} and among hard-hit metropolitan areas. Results show that shifts in borrower behavior were more salient to crisis-period defaults than were adverse shocks to home equity. Analysis of time-series and panel data indicates that local economic conditions, consumer sentiment, and federal foreclosure mitigation programs explain much of {{the rise in the}} negative equity beta. Difference-in-difference tests further corroborate unintended consequences of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) in boosting borrower default <b>option</b> <b>exercise...</b>|$|R

40|$|I {{identify}} three <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> strategies executives engage in, including (i) exercising {{with cash}} and immediately selling the shares, (ii) exercising with cash {{and holding the}} shares, and (iii) delivering some shares to the company to cover the exercise costs and holding the remaining shares. Stock price patterns suggest executives manipulate <b>option</b> <b>exercises.</b> They use private information to increase the profitability of all three strategies, and likely backdated some exercise dates in the pre-Sarbanes-Oxley period to enhance the profitability of the latter two strategies, where the executive's company is the only counterparty. Backdating is associated with reporting of internal control weaknesses. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether insiders use private information {{to time the}} exercises of their executive stock options. Before May 1991, insiders had to hold the stock acquired through <b>option</b> <b>exercise</b> for 6 months. Exercises from that regime precede significantly positive abnormal stock performance, suggesting the use of inside information to time exercises. By contrast, we find little evidence of such timing since insiders {{have been able to}} sell acquired shares immediately. Now, such timing should show up as negative abnormal stock returns after <b>option</b> <b>exercise.</b> However, we find negative stock performance only after exercises by top managers at small firms.

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} {{the advantage of}} broad-based stock option plans over cash compensation when the …rm needs to …nance both current and future investment {{in an environment where}} external …nance is costly. Intuitively, the company obtains funds for investment in the current period by cutting …xed wages through the issuance of stock options. The company receives additional funds in later periods when it collects the cash proceeds and tax savings from <b>option</b> <b>exercises.</b> Importantly, the cash in‡ow arising from <b>option</b> <b>exercises</b> is correlated with improvements in the …rm’s investment opportunities, thus providing funds in precisely those states of the world where the demand for investment is high. Option grants in the current period therefore allow the …rm to relax both its current and future …nancing constraints and to increase investment in positive NPV projects. Consistent with the predictions of the model, we estimate that …rms increase investment by $ 0. 38 for each dollar of proceeds received from the <b>exercise</b> of stock <b>options,</b> and that the sensitivity of investment to proceeds from <b>option</b> <b>exercises</b> is higher in …rms likely to face …nancing constraints...|$|R
