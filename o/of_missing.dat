5|$|Of the 50 {{recovered}} episodes, several {{are missing}} short segments – due either to overseas censorship or to {{damage to the}} surviving film print. The following table shows all affected episodes, and the total duration <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> material.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conspiracy}} claim regards a patch <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> data in Google Sky {{near the}} constellation of Orion, which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted. However, the same region of sky can still be viewed by thousands of amateur astronomers. A scientist at Google said that the missing data {{is due to a}} glitch in the stitching software used to piece the images together.|$|E
5|$|Chaoyangsaurus is {{recovered}} {{in a more}} basal position than Psittacosauridae, although Chinnery's original analysis finds it within Neoceratopsia. Protoceratopsidae {{is considered to be}} the sister group of Ceratopsoidea. The fragmentary Asiaceratops was included in these studies and is found to have a variable position, either as a basal neoceratopsian or as a leptoceratopsid, most likely due to the amount <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> information. Removal of Asiaceratops stabilizes the entire cladogram.|$|E
5|$|Compounding matters was {{the fact}} that the {{supposedly}} deceased actors had signed contracts with the production which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. This was done in order to promote the idea that Cannibal Holocaust was truly the recovered footage <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> documentarians. During the subsequent court proceedings, questions arose as to why the actors were in no other media if they were alive as Deodato claimed.|$|E

5|$|Early Jurassic uplift {{created an}} {{unconformity}} above the Chinle Formation that represents about ten million years <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> sedimentation {{between it and}} the next formation, the Moenave. Periodic incursions of shallow seas from the north during the Jurassic flooded parts of Wyoming, Montana, and a northeast–southwest trending trough on the Utah/Idaho border. The Moenave was deposited in a variety of river, lake, and flood-plain environments.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} Farmer left office, Comer {{announced}} that he had requested a full audit of the department by newly elected Democratic State Auditor Adam Edelen. Among the items Comer asked Edelen to investigate were 171 items <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> agriculture department property valued at about $334,000 and another 103 items worth about $146,000 that were supposed to be returned to the state as surplus but could not be accounted for. A week later, Farmer returned some of the missing items.|$|E
5|$|In December 2012 the Radio Times listings {{magazine}} {{announced it}} was launching the hunt for more Doctor Who episodes, to tie-in with the show's 50th anniversary. The Radio Times issued its own list <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> episodes.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the official list <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> episodes, also missing is the original Episode 1 of The Daleks. At some point after the recording, {{it was discovered that}} a technical problem had caused backstage voices to be heard on the resulting videotape; in early December 1963, the episode was remounted with a different costume for Susan. The only surviving portion is the reprise at the beginning of Episode 2.|$|E
5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the elements and the location <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties.|$|E
5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to be because <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E

5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Fleet Air Arm's Sea King fleet commenced faster than initially planned following {{the loss of a}} Sea King during a humanitarian aid mission in Indonesia in April 2005, resulting in nine deaths. Investigators uncovered serious faults in the condition of the Sea King's mechanical flight control system, resulting from maintenance deficiencies. In May 2007, the six remaining Sea Kings were grounded for two months following the discovery of a number <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> parts.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|Although the BBC has {{invested}} in the reconstruction of episodes using animation, it has never attempted to do anything {{in the way of}} complete re-staging <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> episodes; the closest that it has come to this was the recreation of parts of various serials, including the completely missing Marco Polo, in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time produced for the 50th anniversary in 2013. However, in 2012 a reimagined version of The Power of the Daleks, written by, directed by, and starring Nick Scovell, was released on YouTube in three parts before it was shown complete at the Power:Reimagined convention in September 2012.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{only two}} players left from the {{championship}} team, McNamara and Syracuse struggled through the 2005–2006 regular season. Two highlights were the 38 points McNamara scored against Davidson College, the second-most points ever scored by a Syracuse player at the team's home arena, the Carrier Dome, and a 30-point performance against the visiting Louisville Cardinals. Syracuse finished with a losing record in the Big East; the team was in danger <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> the NCAA Tournament unless it secured the conference's automatic bid by winning the Big East's postseason tournament.|$|E
5|$|Associate vicar Dan Clark led a {{memorial}} service for Yeates at Christ Church in Clifton on 2 January 2011. Prayers for her were also said at the church on 17 December 2011, the first anniversary of her death, while visitors left tributes and messages of condolence for her family. Greg Reardon started a charity website in Yeates' memory to raise funds on behalf of families <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> people. Yeates' friends and family planted {{a memorial}} garden at the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens in Romsey where she had worked as a student. Building Design Partnership and the local NHS trust announced plans to commemorate her with a memorial in a garden she had been designing for a new £430 million hospital in Southmead, Bristol.|$|E
5|$|English chemist John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers from 1863 to 1866 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar {{physical and chemical properties}} recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music. This so termed Law of Octaves, however, was ridiculed by Newlands' contemporaries, and the Chemical Society refused to publish his work. Newlands was nonetheless able to draft a table of the elements and used it to predict the existence <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> elements, such as germanium. The Chemical Society only acknowledged the significance of his discoveries five years after they credited Mendeleev.|$|E

50|$|Another useful metric to {{test the}} {{performance}} is Power law <b>of</b> cache <b>misses.</b> It gives you the number <b>of</b> <b>misses</b> when you change {{the size of the}} cache, given that the number <b>of</b> <b>misses</b> for one <b>of</b> the cache sizes is known. Similarly, when you want {{to test the}} performance of the cache in terms <b>of</b> <b>misses</b> across different associativities, Stack distance profiling is used.|$|R
