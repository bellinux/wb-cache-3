5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event.

Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Circinus X-1 is an X-ray {{binary star}} system that {{includes}} a neutron star. Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in black hole systems. Located at 19,000light-years, the pulsar PSR B1509-58, also called the Circinus Pulsar, has expelled a 20-light-year-long jet of material from its southern pole, clearly visible in the X-ray spectrum. Another supernova remnant in Circinus is that of SN 185.

5|$|The UNCRO {{mission was}} ended by UNSC Resolution 1025, passed on 30 November 1995. The {{resolution}} {{was passed in}} the wake of the Erdut Agreement between Croatia and representatives of Serbs in Sector East. It defined mechanisms for peaceful restoration of the region to Croatian control and established an interim period ending on 15 January 1996, when authority was to be transferred from UNCRO to a new transitional force to be deployed to the area. When the interim period expired, the UNSC adopted resolutions 1037 and 1038, which established the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium in the former Sector East and the United Nations Mission of <b>Observers</b> <b>in</b> Prevlaka. Commencement of the two new missions coincided with NATO's arrival in Bosnia and Herzegovina to enforce the Dayton Accords.|$|E

The 1st Brigade consisted of three organic battalions: 1–32nd Infantry, 1–87th Infantry, and 2–22nd Infantry.

After its activation, the brigade participated in numerous exercises, including Honduras, Panama, the National Training Center (Fort Irwin, CA), the Joint Readiness Training Center (Fort Polk, LA), REFORGER 88 and 90, and operational deployments to the Multinational Force and <b>Observers</b> <b>in</b> the Sinai.|$|E

5|$|During 1941 and {{the first}} months of 1942 Japan conquered or {{established}} de facto rule over almost the entire South China Sea region. Control of the sea was vital to the Japanese economy, as it was the conduit through which essential supplies of oil and other natural resources passed from occupied Malaya, Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. As the war turned against Japan, convoys of ships passing through the South China Sea frequently came under attack from Allied submarines and – by late 1944 – aircraft. These attacks were guided by information gained from signals intelligence and long-range air patrols, supplemented by reports from coast watchers along the Chinese coast and other <b>observers</b> <b>in</b> Asian ports. While losses of oil tankers and freighters were increasingly heavy, the Japanese Government continued to order ships to make the voyage. In an attempt to limit losses, convoys and individual ships took routes well way from the established sea lanes, or sailed close to the shore and operated only at night.|$|E

5|$|Lie {{groups are}} of {{fundamental}} importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, {{as well as}} translations {{in space and time}} are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two <b>observers</b> <b>in</b> motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory.|$|E

5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to <b>observers</b> <b>in</b> the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E
