5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution {{had a profound effect on}} both <b>on</b> <b>population</b> and urbanisation, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford.|$|E
5|$|The Algodones Dunes {{were formed}} from sand {{deposited}} by Lake Cahuilla, which was transported by wind toward the area. During its existence, the lake supported a rich biota with fish, bivalves and vegetation on its shorelines. These resources supported human populations on its shores, {{as evidenced by}} a number of archeological sites and mythological references to the lake in the traditions of the Cahuilla. The lake may have had profound effects <b>on</b> <b>population</b> genetics and language history of the surrounding regions.|$|E
5|$|The name King was {{not used}} again after the season, {{although}} {{it was on the}} naming list for 1951 and 1952 due to being part of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. The Phonetic Alphabet was decommissioned in 1953 in favor of using female names. Based <b>on</b> <b>population</b> growth in south Florida, it is estimated that a storm identical to Hurricane King would cause $2.8billion in insured damage if it struck in 2001, with the total roughly split between Broward and Miami-Dade counties.|$|E

5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both <b>on</b> <b>population</b> and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2015 Louisiana Laws Revised Statutes, {{residents}} of any unincorporated area may propose to incorporate as a municipality if the area meets prescribed minimum population thresholds. Municipal corporations are divided based <b>on</b> <b>population</b> into three classes: cities, towns, and villages. Those having five thousand inhabitants or more {{are classified as}} cities; those having less than five thousand but more than one thousand inhabitants are classified as towns; and those having one thousand or fewer inhabitants are classified as villages. The governor may change the classification of the municipality if the board of aldermen requests a change and a census shows that the population has increased or decreased making it eligible for a different classification. Municipalities are granted powers to perform functions required by local governments including the levy and collection of taxes and to assume indebtedness.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory <b>on</b> <b>population</b> growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

5|$|Each {{county is}} run by a commissioners' court, {{consisting}} of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts drawn based <b>on</b> <b>population)</b> and a county judge elected from all the voters of the county. In smaller counties, the county judge actually does perform judicial duties, but in larger counties, the judge's role is limited to serving on the commissioners' court. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by the voters, but the commissioners' court determines their office budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan; the one exception is the board of trustees of the Dallas County department of education (the Harris County trustees were elected on a nonpartisan basis until 1984).|$|E
5|$|Independence from Europe {{has called}} for stricter {{immigration}} policy to be implemented in the UK, but has refused to set a statistical migration target. It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left the European Economic Area (EEA), citing pressures <b>on</b> <b>population</b> growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also face more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hopes, would justify the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights <b>on</b> <b>population</b> dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E

5|$|Saint Paul's Department of Planning and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into {{seventeen}} Planning Districts, {{created in}} 1979 to allow neighborhoods {{to participate in}} governance and use Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement directly from the city, the councils share a pool of funds. The councils have significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they organize residents. The boundaries are adjusted depending <b>on</b> <b>population</b> changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods. Though these neighborhoods changed overtime, preservationists have saved many of their historically significant structures.|$|E
5|$|The Livestock Conservancy {{maintains}} a conservation priority list that divides endangered breeds of horses, asses, sheep, goats, cattle, rabbits, {{pigs and poultry}} into five categories based <b>on</b> <b>population</b> numbers and historical interest. The organization has published several books, and works with breed registries and other groups on several aspects of breed preservation, including genetic testing, historical documentation, animal rescue and marketing. Preservation of genetic material is of special interest to the Conservancy, and {{for a period of}} time it maintained a gene bank that was later transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture. It has also developed and published several heritage definitions, including parameters for heritage breeds of cattle and poultry.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions <b>on</b> <b>population</b> trends.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea came}} to him after {{attending}} the first Jubilee {{in the city of}} Rome, in 1300, where he realized that Rome's many historical achievements were well-known, and he desired to lay out a history of the origins of his own city of Florence. In his Cronica, Villani described in detail the many building projects of the city, statistical information <b>on</b> <b>population,</b> ordinances, commerce and trade, education, and religious facilities. He also described several disasters such as famines, floods, fires, and the pandemic of the Black Death in 1348, which would take his own life. Villani's work on the Cronica was continued by his brother and nephew after his death. It has been described as the first introduction of statistics as a positive element in history.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} evolutionary theory before Darwin's {{was that of}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck; based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Thomas Malthus's writings <b>on</b> <b>population</b> growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.|$|E
5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends <b>on</b> <b>population</b> size, with {{fixation}} occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account {{factors such as the}} level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based <b>on</b> <b>population</b> of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E
5|$|By December 1966 some Australian officers, {{including}} Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, the 5 RAR commanding officer, {{had begun}} to reassess their operational aims. Warr argued that they should move away from conventional operations and instead focus <b>on</b> <b>population</b> control and disrupting communist supply lines and freedom of movement. Assessing that with just two infantry battalions 1 ATF {{did not have the}} strength to destroy the Viet Cong forces then in Phuoc Tuy, Warr favoured cordon and search operations to eliminate cadres and block the supply of rice from the villages. On 7 January 1967, Brigadier David Jackson was replaced as Commander 1 ATF by Brigadier Stuart Graham, and he subsequently approved Warr's proposed concept of operations. Two days later 5 RAR conducted a successful cordon and search of the village of Binh Ba as part of Operation Caloundra, screening 1,500 villagers and interrogating 591. Nine confirmed members of the Viet Cong were captured, while five draft dodgers were also detained. By mid-afternoon the operation had concluded without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} war {{approaching}} a stalemate strategically, the Australians were substantially reinforced following the trend of further American troop increases, with a third infantry battalion arriving in December, while a squadron of Centurion tanks and additional Iroquois helicopters were added in early 1968. Total Australian strength in Vietnam grew to over 8,000 men, its highest level during the war, effectively doubling the combat power available to the task force commander. Likewise, American military strength in Vietnam had risen to 486,000 men while South Vietnamese forces had expanded to 643,000 {{by the end of}} the year. In spite of this build up North Vietnamese strength in South Vietnam also increased growing to 278,000 men, and although communist strategy remained fundamentally one of protracted war, preparations for a strategic offensive had reached an advanced stage. Culminating in the Tet Offensive in early 1968, the offensive would aim to provoke a popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters and would take the form of a massive simultaneous surprise attack <b>on</b> <b>population</b> centres throughout South Vietnam. 1 ATF would be heavily involved in the fighting during Tet, deploying astride communist lines of communication in support of American and South Vietnamese forces defending the Long Binh-Bien Hoa complex north-east of Saigon during Operation Coburg, while also repelling repeated Viet Cong attacks against Ba Ria and Long Dien in Phuoc Tuy province.|$|E
