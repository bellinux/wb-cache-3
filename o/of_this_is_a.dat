5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and {{it may not have been}} in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the west window dates from 1875; it was made by Clayton and Bell and depicts the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. Also by Clayton and Bell is a window at {{the west end of}} the north wall of the nave {{depicting}} Enoch, Noah, Job and Abel. To the east <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> window designed by Michael Farrar-Bell dated 1985, to the memory of a local farmer, depicting the Creation. Beyond this is a window from 1901 made by Reuben Bennett which depicts the Good Shepherd with David and Miriam. On the south wall of the nave is a window from 1919 by Harry Clarke depicting Richard Coeur-de-Lion, saints and military emblems. In other windows on the south wall there are fragments of old glass. The north wall of the north transept contains a window with stained glass by Kempe which incorporates some pieces of medieval glass and depicts the Tree of Jesse. On the east wall of the transept are two windows by John Hardman which date from 1862 and 1864. The south transept contains a window dating from 1855 with stained glass by William Wailes. The east window was reglazed in 1876 by Clayton and Bell; it shows episodes from the life of Christ with figures of apostles and prophets. In the porch is more stained glass by Kempe, dating from 1878.|$|E

25|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{password}} cracker {{that attempts to}} guess the password for an encrypted file (assuming that the password has a maximum possible length).|$|E
25|$|Orbits are elliptical, {{with the}} heavier body at one {{focus of the}} ellipse. Special case <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{circular}} orbit (a circle is a special case of ellipse) with the planet at the center.|$|E
25|$|East <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> large iconostasis demarcating the Orthodox {{sanctuary}} before {{which is}} set the throne of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem {{on the south side}} facing the throne of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch on the north side.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{butterflies}} and moths migrate to escape from potentially harmful circumstances. Examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> shortage <b>of</b> proper food plants, an unfavorable climate, like cold or extreme rain or overpopulation.|$|R

50|$|Beyond {{platform}} 2 {{is another}} disused platform, formerly platform 1. Behind <b>this</b> <b>are</b> the sidings <b>of</b> the Traincare Depot; {{at the east}} end <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> old water tank and the brick offices which once served the GWR station.|$|R
25|$|In the 4th {{century the}} {{practice}} of creating paper rubbings of stone carvings such as calligraphic models and texts took hold. Among the earliest evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> stone inscription cut in mirror image from the early 6th century.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that this}} {{parametrization}} has a symmetry, where inverting {{the sign of}} a reverses x and y. In the terminology <b>of</b> , <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Type I linear system of conics, and is animated in the linked video.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> priest's door, {{recently}} replaced. There are traces of a piscina behind the panelling {{on the north}} wall. Before the altar are 18th-century tombs of the Vassal family, former owners of Cockethurst Farm, and a brass effigy of Thomas Burroughs dated 1600.|$|E
50|$|A {{spur track}} used {{to connect the}} station to the Legazpi Port, <b>a</b> proof <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> image <b>of</b> the area during the Japanese Occupation where a {{railroad}} crossing sign is visible and located beyond the station building.|$|R
50|$|Allopoiesis is {{the process}} whereby a system {{produces}} {{something other than the}} system itself. One example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> assembly line, where the final product (such as <b>a</b> car) <b>is</b> distinct from the machines doing the producing. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> in contrast with autopoiesis.|$|R

25|$|If drought {{continue}}s, {{and water}} levels continue to decrease, further measures are {{brought in to}} save water. The first stage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> hosepipe ban, which prevents the use of hosepipes, and {{can be applied to}} hot tubs, pressure washers and other similar devices in a future drought. These measures were brought in, particularly the ban on hosepipes, in 2006 and 1976.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many others}} in Guerrero, archeological sites along the Costa Grande do not have {{security}} {{due to the lack}} of resources. Many of the sites suffer from sacking by the local populations who sell items they find. Many of these items eventually find their way abroad. One serious example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> site in San Jerónimo, where local sacked a zone which contains stele.|$|E
25|$|According to its views, all {{widely held}} spiritual or {{religious}} belief systems are merely specific {{branches of a}} universal wisdom. The effect <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> resemblance of religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Buddhism, as well as new-age teachings, to Kabbalah. In accordance with this belief, the Kabbalah Centre does not present itself {{as an alternative to}} any religion in particular, but rather, as a supplement to it.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's {{relationship}} with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unlikely claim made some six years after the death.|$|R
25|$|This {{refrigeration}} method cools a contained area by melting ice, or by sublimating dry ice. Perhaps {{the simplest}} example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> portable cooler, where items {{are put in}} it, then ice is poured over the top. Regular ice can maintain temperatures near, but not below the freezing point, unless salt is used to cool the ice down further (as in a traditional ice-cream maker). Dry ice can reliably bring the temperature well below freezing.|$|E
25|$|This uses bottom-contact {{composite}} third rail, with an aluminium {{body and}} a steel contact surface. The advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> low-resistance, high-current-capacity rail with a durable steel surface for current collection. The rail may be surrounded by insulating material {{on the top and}} sides {{to reduce the risk of}} electrocution to railway staff and trespassers. The bottom-contact system is less prone to derangement by snow than top contact.|$|E
25|$|Habituation – This is {{a process}} in which the brain learns to ignore repetitive, {{meaningless}} stimuli while remaining sensitive to others. A good example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> person who can sleep through loud traffic in a large city, but is awakened promptly due to the sound of an alarm or crying baby. Reticular formation nuclei that modulate activity of the cerebral cortex are part of the ascending reticular activating system.|$|E
50|$|Hamilton next leads {{a mission}} to Italy to rescue Swedish {{businessmen}} from the Mafia. Even though Hamilton managed to finish the mission with help from his associates, many people died during the desperate fight to free the businessmen and the effect <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> vendetta against Hamilton.|$|R

25|$|One example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{study by}} Washburn, Wolters, & Yates {{in which they}} used shotgun {{proteomics}} on the proteome of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain grown to mid-log phase. They were able to detect and identify 1,484 proteins as well as identify proteins rarely seen in proteome analysis, including low-abundance proteins like transcription factors and protein kinases. They were also able to identify 131 proteins with three or more predicted transmembrane domains.|$|E
25|$|Normally batsmen never {{attempt to}} run byes when the wicket-keeper catches the ball. However, in {{situations}} {{at the end}} of a game when the batting team must score runs quickly in order to have a chance of winning, the batsmen may risk running a bye and hope that the wicket-keeper fumbles the ball or throws it inaccurately when attempting to run a batsman out. The usual result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> batsman's being run out, but sometimes the tactic pays off with a few One Day International matches having been won on byes.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not unusual}} for some animals to play with toys. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dolphin being trained to nudge a ball through a hoop. Young {{chimpanzees}} use sticks as dolls – the social aspect is seen by the fact that young females more often use a stick this way than young male chimpanzees. They carry their chosen stick and put it in their nest. Such behaviour is also seen in some adult female chimpanzees, but never after they have become mothers.|$|E
