5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> fall events.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} climactic eruptions {{released}} vast amounts <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> that blanketed much of central North America, falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns {{and led to the}} extinction of some species, primarily in North America.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect pasture, plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin ash falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction <b>of</b> <b>ash,</b> amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> fall. The acidic nature <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil’s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon arable crops, such as fruit, vegetables and grain. Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading.|$|E

5|$|Fly ash {{and bottom}} ash are two {{byproducts}} made through {{the burning of}} coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material {{in the construction industry}} and in the production of grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E

40|$|Lime-fly ash loess is {{composed}} <b>of</b> fly <b>ash,</b> lime and loess. It {{is a new}} material in subgrade backfill. Main factors to influence the strength <b>of</b> lime-fly <b>ash</b> loess are age, amount <b>of</b> fly <b>ash</b> and lime, ratio <b>of</b> fly <b>ash</b> to lime (1 :K), and moisture content. In order to observe the effect of each factor influencing the strength <b>of</b> lime-fly <b>ash</b> loess and find out the relationship between each other, this paper adopted orthogonal test design to conduct unconfined compression tests. The result shows that 90 d strength can be considered to calculate the strength <b>of</b> lime-fly <b>ash</b> loess in practice. And {{the most important factor}} to influence the 90 d strength <b>of</b> lime-fly <b>ash</b> loess is the amount <b>of</b> fly <b>ash</b> and lime, the second is moisture content, and then is the ratio <b>of</b> fly <b>ash</b> to lime (1 :K). These achievements are significant to the design and application <b>of</b> lime-fly <b>ash</b> loess in subgrade construction of loess areas...|$|R

5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, {{in order to prevent}} motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|Wet {{deposits}} <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> on {{high voltage}} insulators can initiate a leakage current (small amount of current flow across the insulator surface) which, if sufficient current is achieved, can cause ‘flashover’ (the unintended electrical discharge around {{or over the}} surface of an insulating material).|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E

5|$|Damage {{and efforts}} to control the spread of emerald ash borer have {{affected}} businesses that sell ash trees or wood products, property owners, and local or state governments. Quarantines can limit the transport <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> trees and products, but economic impacts are especially high for urban and residential areas due to treatment or removal costs and decreased land value from dying trees. Costs for managing these trees can fall upon homeowners or local municipalities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once is costly, so slowing down {{the rate at which}} trees die through removing known infested trees and treating trees with insecticides can allow local governments more time to plan, remove, and replace trees that would eventually die. This strategy saves money as it would cost $10.7 billion in urban areas of 25 states between 2009–2019, while removing and replacing all ash trees in these same areas at once would cost $25 billion. Some urban areas such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, have large amounts <b>of</b> <b>ash</b> with slightly more than 20% of their urban forest as ash.|$|E
