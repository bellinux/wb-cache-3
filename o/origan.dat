40|$|En el presente trabajo se evaluaron las tabletas de 100 mg de Plectranthus amboinicus (Lour.) Spreng. (orégano francés) sobre la musculatura lisa y su influencia en la transmisión colinérgica, para lo cual se utilizaron cobayos machos de la raza Hartley de 200 - 250 g de masa corporal, para la extracción de diferentes porciones de íleon. Como resultado se obtuvo que las tabletas 100 mg de P. amboinicus (Lour.) Spreng., a las diferentes concentraciones evaluadas, provocaron contracción inmediata de la musculatura lisa; el orégano francés mostró un marcado efecto antimuscarínico frente a las concentraciones inducidas por acetilcolina (ACh) de 10 - 6 a 10 - 3 M. La administración conjunta de P. amboinicus (Lour.) Spreng. 10 mg/mL y ACh 10 - 3 M no superó la contracción provocada por esta última de manera independiente y la atropina 3 x 10 - 12 M disminuyó las contracciones provocadas por las diferentes concentraciones de orégano francés y ACh 10 - 3 M, por lo que las tabletas evaluadas presentan tanto efecto agonista como antagonista de la transmisión colinérgica. In {{the present}} paper, {{the effects of}} Plectranthus amboinicus (Lour.) Spreg (French <b>origan)</b> 100 mg tablets on the smooth musculature, {{as well as their}} {{influence}} on the cholinergic transmission were evaluated by using male Hartley guinea pigs with 200 to 250 g of body mass for extracting different portions of ileum. It was observed that the P. amboinicus (Lour.) Spreg, 100 mg tablets at the different assessed concentrations provoked an immediate contraction of the smooth musculature. The French <b>origan</b> showed a marked antimuscarinic effect against Acethylcholine-induced contractions (ACh) from 10 - 6 to 10 - 3 M. The combined administration of P. amboinicus (Lour.) Spreg 10 mg/mL and ACh 10 - 3 M did not surpass the contraction induced by the latter in a independent way, whereas atropine 3 x 10 - 12 M decreased the contractions produced by different concentrations of French <b>origan</b> and ACh 10 - 3 M. That is why, the evaluated tablets present an agonist and antagonist effect of the cholinergic transmission...|$|E

Symptoms {{of the disease and}} characters of the fungus, both in nature and in culture, are described. Laboratory trials showed that temperature effect on conidial germination and fungal growth was the same, with an optimum of 25 - 30 ° C. Artificial inoculation tests on various Labiatae species revealed a different pathogenicity degree of the fungus: high on lavender and sage, moderate on basil and rosemary, low or absent on mint and <b>origan.</b> Encouraging results against this disease have been obtained with maneb, captafol and overall chlorthalonil and ipradione.

40|$|The {{tradition}} of inventing calligraphic characters is a Chinese art form {{that has its}} <b>origans</b> in shamanist beliefs and their influence upon early Taoist practices. Secret diagrams, talismans, and characters {{were believed to be}} mystical mediums containing spirits that could be called upon to aid or protect people from misfortunes such as evil forces, illnesses, natural disasters, and malicious acts. Because the configurations were secret, the artist/priest often strategically transgressed the rules governing Chinese brush technique, creating free, nonconformist ideograms that were sometimes performed by illiterate writers whose interpolations further modified their origins in conventional written form. Amongst artists and calligraphers during the Sung Period [960 - 1279] there was a flowering of this uniquely nonfigurative visual art discipline. Because of this development, which was augmented by the Taoist alchemic search for an elixir of life, the character that signifies longevity (shou, Chinese, or tho in Vietnamese) became the subject of prolific graphic improvisation. It was often paired with the character that signifies happiness, or felicity, (fu, Chinese, or phuoc in Vietnamese) in grids of ten by ten characters, equalling one hundred longevity, and one hundred happiness characters, positioned side by side. Common forms of the characters adorned artefacts and architecture, becoming mystical and secular talismans to promote a long, happy life...|$|R
40|$|People's {{councils and}} their {{executive}} <b>origans</b> governing {{according to the}} provisions of Constitution of the Polish People's Republic have to administer and control economic and cultural activities on their area. It is also the area of functioning of units of socialized economy. State enterprises and cooperatives are of a particular importance amnog them. The economic reform initiated in 1982 has extended substantially self-containment of these subjects and self- government of their workers. On July 1, 1984 the new Act on the People's Councils and Local Self-Government System is put into force. Consequently {{there is a problem}} emerging of establishing a relation between people's councils of extended competence and self-governing and self-contained enterprises and cooperatives. What is the extent and legal means of council's intervention into activities of those enterprises? In the light of present regulation local organs of state administration can exercise their power on the socialized economy units only on the grounds of explicit statutory authorisations and with the use of means designed in the statute. It can be therefore inferred that any decision or another binding act of will of administration organ addressed to enterprises or cooperatives has to be based on statutory grounds. The said principle is expressed in the People's Councils System Act. the State Enterprises Act of 25 September 1981 and the Cooperative Law Act of 16 September 1982. Only m exceptional cases the acts authorize organs of state administration to give decisions binding units of socialized economy in the scope of their statutory activities, it may be the case of calamity or needs of state defense. Forms of control influence gained a substantial importance (i. e. agreements between organs of administration and organs of enterprises and cooperatives. Rights to control are vested with people's council, its presidium organ and its comissions. Principles of cooperation between organs of people's council and organs of workers self government in enterprises and cooperative self-government are also defined in the Act of July 20, 1933. Cooperation on that field is designed to increase a rank of various forms of social self-government. The state enterprises have a various legal status. They are operating either according to the so-called general principles or they are enterprises of social utility. The latter are of particular importance for people's councils. It is their task to fulill needs of community in a current and continuous way. Therefore in this case the organs of local administration can exercise larger competence. They confirm an enterprise's statute, its annual plan and give a consent to its accession to association. Competence of local organs of administration is much narrower in case of enterprises established by central and general organs of state administration. Practice of relations between organs of administration and units of socialized economy can not be assessed accurately on account of a short time passed since the enactment of the relevant statutes. The practice is to a large extent determined by the economic reform which itself is constantly evolving.

40|$|We briefly {{summarize}} {{our study}} on anisotropy of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic-Rays (UHECRs), {{in which we}} define a statistics that measures the correlation between UHECRs and Large Scale Structure (LSS). We also comment here on recently published paper by Koers and Tinyakov that compared our statistics to improved KS statistics. Key words: ultra high energy cosmic rays, cosmic rays, large scale structure PACS: 95. 85. Ry, 98. 65. -r The origin of cosmic rays of energies> 10 19 eV is a puzzle [1, 2, 3]. The arrival direction of UHECRs show no correlation with the galactic disk, which point towards extra-galactic <b>origan.</b> A suppression of the spectrum at ∼ 5 × 10 19 eV is expected due to the GZK suppression [4, 5]. The suppression was observed by HIRES [6] and the new Auger Observatory [7], see fig. 1 (a). Thus, cosmic-rays with energies above ∼ 5 × 10 19 eV can reach us only from sources with distance below ∼ 100 Mpc. In these distances, the Universe is not isotropic, implying that correlation with LSS can give us information {{on the origin of}} UHECRs. There are few leading candidates as the sources of UHECRs. Assuming that UHECR...|$|E
40|$|The {{synoptic}} Gospels {{according to}} Matthew, Mark and Luke are closely related. On approximately 640 places texts (somewhere longer and somewhere shorter) correspond {{in all three}} gospels or only in two, usually when the Gospel according to Mark has been shortened. This correspondence implies that all three gospels have the same <b>origan</b> which I call the proto-Gospel. Claude Tresmontant has proved that thils original Gospel was written in Hebrew. Only the Gospels according to Mark and Luke have the same order of the texts while in the Gospel according to Matthew this order has been changed so that approximately 2 / 3 of the text (excluding the Passion), which appear in different places in Matthew and Luke, have been united into six sermons, the first being the Sermon on the Mount which contains 26 narratives. For his Sermon on the Mount Matthew had only one protograph. This can be concluded {{from the fact that}} two scenes reour: they occur in the Sermon on the Mount and in a later text. This implies that the Greek Gospel according to Matthew is not the proto-Gospel. Matthew is either only the author of the protograph, i. e. the proto-Gospel and the revised text has kept häis name, or he is only the author of the revised text...|$|E
