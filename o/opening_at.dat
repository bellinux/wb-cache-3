The first offshore oilfield in the state opened in 1917 at Black Duck Bay on the Goose Creek field, although serious offshore exploration did not begin until the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1934, Himmler oversaw the {{creation}} of SS-Junkerschule (Junker schools), institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, political and ideological indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness as part of the SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them self-confidence. The first schools were established at Bad Tölz and Braunschweig, with additional schools <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> Klagenfurt and Prague during the war.|$|E

5|$|The Delichon martins were {{originally}} cliff nesters, breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff.

The two masseteric ridges, to which some of the chewing muscles are attached, are entirely separate, joining only at their front edges, which are located below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|These {{and other}} {{continuing}} fan activities eventually persuaded Universal Studios {{to produce a}} feature film, Serenity. (The title of Serenity was chosen, according to Whedon, because Fox still owned {{the rights to the}} name 'Firefly'). Numerous early screenings of rough film cuts were held for existing fans starting in May 2005 as an attempt to create a buzz to increase ticket sales when the final film cut was released widely on September 30, 2005. The film was not as commercially successful as fans had hoped, <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> number two and making only $40 million worldwide during its initial theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is the <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> {{the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices {{which allow}} hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated {{around the edges of the}} hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal <b>opening.</b> <b>At</b> autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|In January 1986, a {{governmental}} committee {{was established to}} discuss options {{for the management of}} Malta's public records. It was decided that a stand-alone National Archives of Malta would be established, to be headquartered in Rabat in a building that once housed a hospital. In addition, the Banca Giuratale in Mdina was identified as suitable to house the records of Malta's courts {{from the beginning of the}} occupation of Malta by the Knights Hospitaller to the early period of occupation by the United Kingdom. In September 1987, the transfer of court records to the Mdina building began and was completed in October 1988. The transfer of all other records to the Rabat facility was not completed until July 28, 1989, and the official opening of the building did not occur until May 28, 1994, when Ugo Mifsud Bonnici, the fifth President of Malta, presided over the <b>opening.</b> <b>At</b> that time, the officer in charge was Joe Caruana.|$|E
5|$|Kate and Sawyer stay at {{the second}} {{triangulation}} point, while Sayid goes to the third. After learning of Jack's situation from Sawyer, Kate goes to help, leaving the job of turning on the signal to Sawyer. Charlie squeezes through an <b>opening</b> <b>at</b> the cave and finds Jack, but while doing so, the opening collapses and traps Charlie and Jack inside. Charlie hesitantly pops Jack's shoulder back into place at Jack's request. Jack correctly guesses that Charlie is suffering from withdrawal, and Charlie assures Jack he's okay. Kate desperately tries to dig them out {{along with the other}} castaways, while the two worry about losing oxygen. Charlie sees a moth which leads him to an opening and the pair dig out of the cave.|$|E
