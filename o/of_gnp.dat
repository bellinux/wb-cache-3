5|$|In the end {{the reform}} proved unsuccessful.

Prices for items including food and transport rose by 100–300 percent, while the Soviet standard of living decreased sharply and the state budget deficit increased by an estimated 2030 percent <b>of</b> <b>GNP.</b> In the aftermath of the reform, inflation exceeded the 50 percent mark every month.|$|E
5|$|During his {{eighteen}} years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev's only major foreign policy innovation was détente. While sharing some similarities with Soviet policies pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev's adoption of détente significantly differed from Khrushchev's precedent in two ways. The first {{was that it}} was more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on arms control, crisis prevention, East–West trade, European security and human rights. The second part of the policy was based on the importance of equalising the military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union. Defence spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev's death in 1982, 15% <b>of</b> <b>GNP</b> was spent on the military.|$|E

Spending on the war effort quickly eclipsed spending on New Deal programs. In 1944 government spending on the war effort exceeded 40% <b>of</b> <b>GNP.</b> The US economy experienced dramatic growth during the Second World War mostly due to the deemphasis of free enterprise {{in favor of the}} imposition of strict controls on prices and wages.

25|$|Whatever the {{promises}} {{and the costs}} of the many kinds of reform attempted by the Velasco government, the ship sank because of inadequate attention to balances between spending and productive capacity, and between export incentives and import demand. The Velasco government inherited recessionary conditions in 1968, with a positive external balance and productive capacity readily available for expansion. It maintained effective restraint on spending and deficits for several years but then let things get out of control. The central government's deficit was no more than 1 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1970, but its own deficit plus that of the greatly expanded group of state firms reached 10 percent <b>of</b> <b>GNP</b> by 1975. Correspondingly, the external current-account balance was positive in the period 1968-70 but showed a deficit equal to 10 percent <b>of</b> <b>GNP</b> by 1975.|$|E
30|$|The {{toxicity}} <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> {{has been}} investigated at the cellular level. GNPs enter cells in a size- and shape-dependent manner [10, 11].

The uptake <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> is consistent with receptor-mediated endocytosis.

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} that the uptake rate of the surface-modified gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with folic acid by specific cells can be increased significantly, if the membranes of these cells have sufficient folic-acid receptors. Two human breast cancer cell lines were studied; one is MDA-MB- 435 S cell, and the other T- 47 D cell. The expression of the folic acid receptors of the former {{is much higher than}} that of the latter. These cells were incubated with media containing bare GNPs or GNPs conjugated with folic acid individually. Due to the unique optical behavior (i. e. surface plasmon resonance) <b>of</b> <b>GNPs,</b> the uptake amount <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> by cells can be identified by using the laser scanning confocal microscopy. Our experiments show that the uptake amount <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> in MDAMB- 435 S cells is higher than that in T- 47 D cells for the same culture time, if the culture medium contains bare GNPs. Moreover, if the GNPs conjugated with folic acid are used for the culture, the uptake rate <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> by MDA-MB- 435 S cells is improved more. In contrast, the uptake rates <b>of</b> both <b>GNPs</b> are almost the same by T- 47 D cells. The phenomenon indicates that the uptake rate <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> can be improved via the ligand-receptor endocytosis, compared with the nonspecific endocytosis. Therefore, the uptake rate <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> conjugated with folic acid by MDA-MB- 435 S cells is higher than that <b>of</b> bare <b>GNPs...</b>|$|R

25|$|Second, {{and more}} important, was {{the level and}} quality of {{investment}} that persisted through the 1980s.

As a latecomer to modernization, Japan was able to avoid some of the trial and error earlier needed by other nations to develop industrial processes. In the 1970s and 1980s, Japan improved its industrial base through licensing from the US, patent purchases, and imitation and improvement of foreign inventions.

40|$|Background. The gold {{nanoparticles}} (GNPs) {{have potential}} applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy. In {{an attempt to}} characterise the potential toxicity or hazards <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> as a therapeutic or diagnostic tool, the fluorescence spectra in several rat organs in vivo were measured after intraperitoneal administration <b>of</b> <b>GNPs.</b> Methods. The experimental rats were divided into control and six groups (G 1 A, G 1 B, G 2 A, G 2 B, G 3 A, and G 3 B; G 1 : 20 [*]nm; G 2 : 10 [*]nm; G 3 : 50 [*]nm; A: infusion <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> for 3 days; B: infusion <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> for 7 days). The fluorescence measurements were investigated in the liver, kidney, heart, and lung organs of rats after intraperitoneal administration <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> for periods <b>of</b> 3 and 7 days in vivo. Results. The 10 and 20 [*]nm GNPs exhibited spherical morphology shape, while the 50 [*]nm GNPs exhibited hexagonal shape. A sharp decrease in the fluorescence intensity induced with the larger 50 [*]nm GNPs in the liver, kidney, heart, and lung organs of rats at the exposure duration of 3 and 7 days in vivo compared with the smaller 10 and 20 [*]nm GNPs was observed. Conclusions. The decrease in fluorescence intensity {{may be attributed to}} occurrence of strong quenching, decrease in number and surface area <b>of</b> <b>GNPs,</b> and high clearance <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> via urine and bile. Moreover, decreasing size may lead to an exponential increase in surface area relative to volume, thus making GNPs surface more reactive on aggregation and to its surrounding biological components. The size, shape, surface area, number, and clearance <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> {{play a key role in}} toxicity and accumulation in the different rat organs. This study demonstrates that fluorescence peak intensity is particle size and exposure duration dependent. This study suggests that fluorescence intensity can be used as a useful tool for pointing to bioaccumulation and toxicity induced by GNPs in the different rat organs...|$|R

Methods Animals were randomly divided into 3 GNPs-treated rats groups and one control group (CG). The 10, 20 and 50 nm GNPs were administered intraperitonealy at the rate of 3 or 7 days as follows: Group 1 : received infusion <b>of</b> 100 μl <b>GNPs</b> <b>of</b> size 10 nm for 3 or 7 days; Group 2 : received infusion <b>of</b> 100 μl <b>GNPs</b> <b>of</b> size 20 nm for 3 or 7 days; Group 3 : received infusion <b>of</b> 100 μl <b>GNPs</b> <b>of</b> size 50 nm for 3 or 7 days.

40|$|Abstract Background Rheological {{analysis}} {{can be employed}} as a sensitive tool in predicting the physical properties <b>of</b> gold nanoparticles (<b>GNPs).</b> Understanding the rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> can help to develop a better therapeutic cancer product, since these physical properties often link material formulation and processing stages with the ultimate end use. The rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> have not been previously documented. The present study attempted to characterize the rheological properties of different sizes <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> at: 1) fixed temperature and wide range of shear rates; 2) varied temperature and fixed shear rate. Methods 10, 20 and 50 nm GNPs {{was used in this}} study. Several rheological parameters <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> such as viscosity, torque%, shear stress and shear rate were evaluated using Brookfield LVDV-III Programmable rheometer supplied with temperature bath and controlled by a computer. To measure fluid properties (viscosity as function of shear rate), e. g., to determine whether the flow is Newtonian or non-Newtonian flow behaviour, and viscoelasticity (viscosity as function of temperature), rheological parameters were firstly measured at starting temperature of 37 °C and wide range of shear rates from 375 to 1875 s - 1, and secondly at a gradual increase of temperature from 37 to 42 °C and fixed shear rate of 1875 s - 1. Results The 10, 20 and 50 nm GNPs showed mean size of 9. 45 ± 1. 33 nm, 20. 18 ± 1. 80 nm, and 50 nm GNPs, respectively. The 10 and 20 nm GNPs showed spherical morphology while 50 nm GNPs showed hexagonal morphology using the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The relation between viscosity (cp) and shear rate (s - 1) for 10, 20 and 50 nm GNPs at a temperature of 37 °C showed non-Newtonian behaviour. Although the relationship between SS (dyne/cm 2) and SR (s - 1) for 10, 20 and 50 nm GNPs was linearly related however their fluid properties showed non-Newtonian behaviour. Conclusions The torque%, viscosity (cp) and SS (dyne/cm 2) <b>of</b> all <b>GNP</b> sizes decreased with increasing the temperature and with decreasing the GNP size (for each fixed temperature value). For each shear rate value, the viscosity <b>of</b> all <b>GNPs</b> decreased with decreasing the GNP size. This study demonstrates that the physical, dimensional and morphological changes <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> have effective influence on their rheological properties. To understand and categorize the role <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> in drug delivery and cancer therapy, <b>GNPs</b> <b>of</b> varying size, number of particles, shape and surface should be taken into consideration. Moreover, further additional in vivo studies after administration <b>of</b> <b>GNPs</b> in rats should be performed to support this hypothesis. </p...|$|R
