25|$|An {{amendment}} {{becomes an}} <b>operative</b> <b>part</b> of the Constitution {{when it is}} ratified by the necessary number of states, {{rather than on the}} later date when its ratification is certified. No further action by Congress or anyone is required. On three occasions, Congress has, after being informed that an amendment has reached the ratification threshold, adopted a resolution declaring the process successfully completed. Such actions, while perhaps important for political reasons, are, constitutionally speaking, unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{concluding}} {{paragraph of}} the advisory opinion (paragraph 123), which is the <b>operative</b> <b>part</b> of the ruling (dispositif) contains three vote tallies: it proclaims that the Court unanimously found that it had jurisdiction to reply to the General Assembly's request for an advisory opinion; given that the case law of the Court recognises that it has the discretion to comply with such requests, the Court decided by nine votes to five to comply with this particular advisory opinion request. And, {{on the merits of}} the case, by ten votes to four, the Court decided that the declaration of independence was not in violation of international law.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposed}} amendment {{becomes an}} <b>operative</b> <b>part</b> of the Constitution {{as soon as}} it is ratified by three-fourths of the States (currently 38 of the 50 States). There is no further step. The text requires no additional action by Congress or anyone else after ratification by the required number of states. Thus, when the Office of the Federal Register verifies that it has received the required number of authenticated ratification documents, it drafts a formal proclamation for the Archivist to certify that the amendment is valid and {{has become part of the}} nation's frame of government. This certification is published in the Federal Register and United States Statutes at Large and serves as official notice to Congress and to the nation that the ratification process has been successfully completed.|$|E

500|$|Another tax protester {{argument}} centers {{upon the}} pending and inoperative Titles of Nobility Amendment. [...] Proposed as {{an amendment to}} the Constitution by the 11th Congress in 1810, it would, if ratified by the required number of states, strip United States citizenship from any citizen who accepted a title of nobility from a foreign government. [...] The contention here is that this amendment was in fact ratified by the required number of states (in the 1810s) to have become an <b>operative</b> <b>part</b> of the Constitution, and that, because this is so, actions taken by lawyers and judges, who use the title Esquire–asserted to be a title of nobility and monarchical–are unconstitutional. In fact, the use of [...] "Esquire" [...] by lawyers and judges is merely an informal custom in the United States, not a title with any legal standing. This contention, rarely raised before courts, was most recently addressed in Campion v. Towns, No.CV-04-1516PHX-ROS, *2 n.1 (D. Ariz. 2005) as a defense to a charge of tax evasion.

60|$|The {{reason for}} the Crown as it is, for the Lords as they are, is my {{reason for the}} Commons as they are, the electors as they are. Now, if the Crown and the Lords, and the judicatures, are all prescriptive, so is the House of Commons of the very same origin, and of no other. We and our electors have powers and {{privileges}} both made and circumscribed by prescription, {{as much to the}} full as the other parts; and as such we have always claimed them, and on no other title. The House of Commons is a legislative body corporate by prescription, not made upon any given theory, but existing prescriptively--just like the rest. This prescription has made it essentially what it is--an aggregate collection of three parts--knights, citizens, burgesses. The question is, whether this has been always so, since the House of Commons has taken its present shape and circumstances, and has been an essential <b>operative</b> <b>part</b> of the Constitution; which, I take it, it has been for at least five hundred years.|$|E

40|$|International audience— Smart vision {{systems on}} a chip are {{promising}} for embedded applications. Currently, {{flexibility in the}} choice of integrated pre-processing tools is obtained at the expense of total silicon area and fill factor, which are otherwise optimized provided that the sensor performs a specific task. We propose a new architecture based on macropixel-level processing to improve the trade-off by using the same processing elements (PEs) for a whole group of pixels. In this paper, we show through functional simulations the feasibility of using macropixel PEs, with analog <b>operative</b> <b>parts</b> to avoid analog to digital converter (ADC) bottlenecks and digital controls, distributed {{in and out of the}} matrix of pixels. PEs are designed to be suitable for coefficient-reconfigurable spatial filtering as well as temporal difference.
