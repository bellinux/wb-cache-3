Beginning with a tu quoque, that the Arminian doctrine involves consequences as bad as the Calvinistic view, he proceeds to object to the term [...] "author of sin," [...] though he ends by admitting that, in a certain sense, it is applicable; he proves from Scripture, that God is the disposer and <b>orderer</b> of sin; and then, by an elaborate false analogy with the darkness resulting from the absence of the sun, endeavours to suggest that he is only the author of it in a negative sense; and, finally, he takes refuge in the conclusion that, though God is the <b>orderer</b> and disposer of those deeds which, considered in relation to their agents, are morally evil, yet, inasmuch as His purpose has all along been infinitely good, they are not evil relatively to him.|$|E

60|$|Let us arrange in some order {{a number}} of {{converging}} considerations that all point in this direction. (1) It is broadly true, no doubt, that the weapon of the employer has hitherto been the threat of dismissal, that is, the threat of enforced starvation. He is a Sultan who need not order the bastinado, {{so long as he}} can order the sack. But there are not a few signs that this weapon is not quite so convenient and flexible a one as his increasing rapacities require. The fact of the introduction of fines, secretly or openly, in many shops and factories, proves that it is convenient for the capitalists to have some temporary and adjustable form of punishment besides the final punishment of pure ruin. Nor is it difficult to see the commonsense of this from their wholly inhuman point of view. The act of sacking a man is attended with the same disadvantages as the act of shooting a man: one of which is that you can get no more out of him. It is, I am told, distinctly annoying to blow a fellow creature's brains out with a revolver and then suddenly remember that he was the only person who knew where to get the best Russian cigarettes. So our Sultan, who is the <b>orderer</b> of the sack, is also the bearer of the bow-string. A school in which there was no punishment, except expulsion, would be a school in which {{it would be very difficult}} to keep proper discipline; and the sort of discipline on which the reformed capitalism will insist will be all of the type which in free nations is imposed only on children. Such a school would probably be in a chronic condition of breaking up for the holidays. And the reasons for the insufficiency of this extreme instrument are also varied and evident. The materialistic Sociologists, who talk about the survival of the fittest and the weakest going to the wall (and whose way of looking at the world is to put on the latest and most powerful scientific spectacles, and then shut their eyes), frequently talk as if a workman were simply efficient or non-efficient, as if a criminal were reclaimable or irreclaimable. The employers have sense enough at least to know better than that. They can see that a servant may be useful in one way and exasperating in another; that he may be bad in one part of his work and good in another; that he may be occasionally drunk and yet generally indispensable. Just as a practical school-master would know that a schoolboy can be at once the plague and the pride of the school. Under these circumstances small and varying penalties are obviously the most convenient things for the person keeping order; an underling can be punished for coming late, and yet do useful work when he comes. It will be possible to give a rap over the knuckles without wholly cutting off the right hand that has offended. Under these circumstances the employers have naturally resorted to fines. But there is a further ground for believing that the process will go beyond fines before it is completed.|$|E
6000|$|Of repose, and its exalting power, I {{have already}} said enough for our present purpose, though I have not {{insisted on the}} {{peculiar}} manifestation {{of it in the}} Christian ideal as opposed to the pagan. But this, as well as other questions relating to the particular development of the Greek mind, is foreign to the immediate inquiry, which therefore I shall here conclude in the hope of resuming it in detail after examining the laws of beauty in the inanimate creation; always, however, holding this for certain, that of whatever kind or degree the short coming may be, it is not possible but that short coming should be visible in every pagan conception, when set beside Christian; and believing, for my own part, that there is not only deficiency, but such difference in kind as must make all Greek conception full of danger to the student in proportion to his admiration of it; as I think has been fatally seen in its effect on the Italian schools, when its pernicious element first mingled with their solemn purity, and recently in its influence on the French historical painters: neither can I from my present knowledge fix upon an ancient statue which expresses by the countenance any one elevated character of soul, or any single enthusiastic self-abandoning affection, much less any such majesty of feeling as might mark the features for supernatural. The Greek could not conceive a spirit; he could do nothing without limbs; his god is a finite god, talking, pursuing, and going journeys;[77] if at any time he was touched with a true feeling of the unseen powers around him, it was in the field of poised battle, for there is something in the near coming of the shadow of death, something in the devoted fulfilment of mortal duty, that reveals the real God, though darkly; that pause on the field of Platæa was not one of vain superstition; the two white figures that blazed along the Delphic plain, when the earthquake and the fire led the charge from Olympus, were more than sunbeams on the battle dust; the sacred cloud, with its lance light and triumph singing, that went down to brood over the masts of Salamis, was more than morning mist among the olives; and yet what were the Greek's thoughts of his god of battle? No spirit power was in the vision; it was a being of clay strength and human passion, foul, fierce, and changeful; of penetrable arms and vulnerable flesh. Gather what we may of great, from pagan chisel or pagan dream, and set it beside the <b>orderer</b> of Christian warfare, Michael the Archangel: not Milton's [...] "with hostile brow and visage all inflamed," [...] not even Milton's in kingly treading of the hills of Paradise, not Raffaelle's with the expanded wings and brandished spear, but Perugino's with his triple crest of traceless plume unshaken in heaven, his hand fallen on his crossleted sword, the truth girdle binding his undinted armor; God has put his power upon him, resistless radiance is on his limbs, no lines are there of earthly strength, no trace on the divine features of earthly anger; trustful and thoughtful, fearless, but full of love, incapable except of the repose of eternal conquest, vessel and instrument of Omnipotence, filled like a cloud with the victor light, the dust of principalities and powers beneath his feet, the murmur of hell against him heard by his spiritual ear like the winding of a shell on the far-off sea-shore.|$|E

40|$|Raspravlja se o salonitanskom kipu u oklopu (loricatus, statua loricata) koji je sredinom 19. stoljeća završio u privatnoj kolekciji u Grazu, a godine 2010. na aukciji brokerske kuće Sotheby 2 ̆ 7 s prodan je novom američkom vlasniku. Razmatraju se teme mogućega mjesta nalaza kipa, forme i ikonografije, tehnologije izrade, izvornoga izgleda, datacije i atribucije te radioničkoga podrijetla. Zaključne su teze interpretacije da je kip nastao u nekoj od radionica u Italiji, moguće u samome gradu Rimu, te da dataciju,osim u predloženo Tiberijevo doba, možda treba protegnuti i u kasnije klaudijevsko doba. In 2010 the Croatian {{public was}} {{surprised}} by the news on the armoured statue (loricatus) of Salona that appeared in a Sotheby 2 ̆ 7 s auction. According to the information available on the Internet, the statue was bought by the Frederic J. Iseman Art Trust, a trust of the New York businessman F. J. Iseman. In 2011 the statue was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Arts in New York, to have been displayed in their Greek and Roman Wing (Figure 1). Till the end of 2015 it is lent to the Yale University Art Gallery. It has been subjected to no significant restoration, except for the two steel pipes that are inserted in its upper legs and fixed in a wider cubic pedestal making a single (mobile) unit with the statue now. The facts that all the texts of importance on the statue are in the German language and that the statue is little known to the Croatian public, in spite of it being the most valuable monument that has ended up outside Croatia, have brought to the decision on dedicating it a paper in the Croatian language too. The reasons are, of course, of interpretative nature as well. Its former Austrian owners confirmed a previous tradition that the statue came from Salona. According to their story, it was acquired by their ancestor, Aloys Maximilan Neumann (1829 - 1906), in Split in the mid 19 th century from an unknown collector, when he was told that the statue had been found in the five kilometres far Salona. In his paper from 2009, E. Pochmarski states that »lately as the place of its discovery with great certainty is being mentioned one of the double temples at the northern side of the Salona 2 ̆ 7 s forum«. However, a more detailed analysis of the information that lead Pochmarski to his conclusion indicates this is not an information from some older manuscript or oral tradition but a (re) construct that can be proven in no way. It is possible that Pochmarski misunderstood Croatian authors 2 ̆ 7 texts, because D. Rendić-Miočević as the possible place of presentation (!) of the statue suggests the low structure between the small temples, J. Jeličić states generally that it stood at the forum, whereas Pochmarski unexpectedly relates it to the double temples, which Rendić-Miočević treats just as a chronological link. That the statue could not have been related to the forum as early as in the 19 th century is indicated {{by the fact that the}} location of the forum in Salona has been known only since the Dyggve 2 ̆ 7 s researches performed in the 1930 s. Conclusion, therefore, occurs that the statue does origin from Salona and that it was most probably discovered in the wider area of the forum, where as the location of discovery should be excluded neither the location of the curia nor of the baths further north. W. Schmid deems the statue to have been made of six segments for easier transport, which means this is an import. According to him, the supporting element was by his left leg and covered by the robe drapes. K. Stemmer misses a detail and does not mention the statue 2 ̆ 7 s composite nature at all, wherefore he does not take it as an example in his paper on sculpturing techniques. His opinion can be indirectly read from his categorising it in the V scheme. All examples of this scheme, without exception, have their supporting elements by their right standing leg. In all other schemes, too, the support is normally by the body weight bearing leg. In his recent revision, E. Pochmarski rightly criticizes the Schmid 2 ̆ 7 s thesis on the support and is the first to take standing that this element must have been by the right leg and that it must have carried the right forearm as well. The support almost certainly had to be behind the right leg, however whether the right arm was also on it cannot be stated with certainty (more probably it was not). Pochmarski subjected to revision also the Schmid 2 ̆ 7 s thesis on the statue being made of six segments, and of great importance is the Schmid 2 ̆ 7 s noticing that the torso was made of two segments - of two allegedly different sorts of marble - the upper white and the lower rather greyish marbles, of similar medium sized crystals. Pochmarski deems the forearms not to have been detached from the upper arms, but that these had been made of a single piece and then broken (!), that the groove for iron insert in the right upper arm (below the tunic) has remained from a Roman time or later restoration, and that the left arm had not been designed to be connected with the forearm but that these had also made a single piece, but following the break the place of the break was smoothed. The presented interpretation overlooked a few important details. The first one is that the robe drapes obviously were over the left arm and that this bore a significant weight, this moreover so as it could have held an attribute as well. Making it of a single piece with the torso was a failure from the beginning. The metal pteriges and leather straps of lining at the left hip show signs of being unfinished (Figure 11), this however not necessarily indicating a monolithic make of the arm. The wrist in front of the drape was protruded forward, did not hinder making the relief, wherefore it was probably made separately. The right arm was positioned hanging and perhaps just a little forward and apart from the body, and it could have held an attribute, unless it was in the left hand. Such posture and weight again put in danger the hand made as a single piece with the body. The pteriges at the right hip, however, are fully completed (Figure 9). If the arm were made of a single piece, it could not have been completed, as it is the case with the left hip. Covering the connection with the robe is a logical solution, known at numerous imperial statues. Thus, the statue had to be made of at least five sections: torso with upper arms (1), base with support, legs and thighs (2), head (3), larger part of the right arm (4), and the left wrist (5). It is not known by what kind of installation the two surviving segments were connected because this has never been examined. On whether the statue was painted and whether it contains paint traces, too, there are no information in the existing literature. According to Schmid, the statue of Solin was made as imitation of a bronze statue of the later Augustean period, and celebrated Tiberius as the defeater of the Pannonians and the Delmatae (the 6 - 9 AD uprising). Schmid finds the Illyrian character of the tropaeum in the head dress where he sees a field cap similar to that worn by the Celts (Figures 4 - 5), having recognised the same also at the statue of Vis/Zagreb (Figure 12). Stemmer too deems the statue to have been made after the Augustean prototype, and dates it to the Tiberian period, agreeing with the observation that the relief decoration reminds of that on bronze statues. About the Schmid 2 ̆ 7 s explanation of the contents of the back side of the statue and presentation of the tropaeum (connections with Tiberius) he says this does not contradict the stylistic analysis. Pochmarski returns to the Schmid 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation, deeming the statue to have been created at the end of the Augustean period and in Salona (!), to celebrate the Tiberius 2 ̆ 7 Illyric victories. A somewhat wider dating, from around 30 till around 60, is advocated by C. C. Vermuele (III). Croatian authors took various stands about the statue. The Schmid 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation made source to the Rendić-Miočević 2 ̆ 7 s thesis that the statue of Solin could present August himself, and that in Zagreb (from Vis) Tiberus. The thesis has found its supporters in the recent times as well. The Schmid 2 ̆ 7 s and Stemmer 2 ̆ 7 s analysis are followed by the texts written on the statue on several occasions by N. Cambi. His repeated opinion is that the statue is from te Tiberius 2 ̆ 7 period and that it most probably belonged to the August 2 ̆ 7 s successor. Following repeated analysis of some contextual levels, the offered dating and attribution theses can be made certain additions and corrections. The generally accepted (Schmid 2 ̆ 7 s) observation that production of the relief reminds of that of bronze statues cannot be significantly objected, however the question is whether this connection has a precise chronological value. Is it possible that, for instance, on a Claudius period statue as relics appear formative and stylistic details of the Augustean period? Pochmarski correctly noticed that Stemmer at no place determined the meaning of the expression »basic type« relative to the original or the prototype, and it remains unclear as to what extent replicas represent a type in the original, and to what extent new creations depart from the prototype. While Schmid finds the very appearance of a tropaeum with Victorias, together with the discovery location and suggestive reasons, to suffice to relating it to Tiberius, Stemmer concludes that symmetrical positioning of Victorias / Nicas is a decorative-symbolic image with no historic reference; according to him, only the tropaea showing squatting imprisoned barbarians at the bottom have an allegorical character. Given the way in which it is conceived, the tropaeum at the statue really has little to do with the famous Gemma Augustea or the tropaeum of Gardun. The only common points are in the execution of the elegant curls and shields. If the <b>orderers</b> or|$|R

In 1539, King Francis Ist ordered in the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, {{as part of a}} wider legislation regarding the policing of Church benefices, to keep vital records registers in the various Church local institutions (mainly parishes). The Ordinance <b>orderer</b> the creation of at least a register of baptisms, as a proof of one's date of birth, and a register of burials of churchmen, as a proof of one's date of death. Though both registers were kept by religious authorities, they were authenticated by a public notary, always a layman, and were kept in the local royal administration's archives. In fact, as the Church kept parish registers since the Middle Ages (the oldest one in France is Giry's, of 1303), these registers were used to meet the ordinance's dispositions ...|$|E

[...] According to the Brahmajāla Sutta (DN.1), a Mahābrahmā is a being from the Ābhāsvara worlds who falls into a lower world through exhaustion of his merits and is reborn alone in the Brahma-world; forgetting his former existence, he imagines himself to have come into existence without cause. Note that even such a high-ranking deity has no intrinsic knowledge of the worlds above his own. Mahābrahmā is 1 [...] yojanas tall. His lifespan variously said to be 1 kalpa (Vibhajyavāda tradition) or 1 [...] kalpas long (Sarvāstivāda tradition), although it would seem that it could be no longer than [...] of a mahākalpa, i.e., all of the mahākalpa except for the , because that is the total length of time between the rebuilding of the lower world and its destruction. It is unclear what period of time [...] "kalpa" [...] refers to in this case. The height of this world is 10,240 yojanas above the Earth.|$|E
50|$|I {{have always}} {{believed}} {{the law to}} be this, that when an offer is made to another party, and in that offer there is a request express or implied that he must signify his acceptance by doing some particular thing, then {{as soon as he}} does that thing, he is bound. If a man sent an offer abroad saying: I wish to know whether you will supply me with goods at such and such a price, and, if you agree to that, you must ship the first cargo {{as soon as you get}} this letter, there can be no doubt that as soon as the cargo was shipped the contract would be complete, and if the cargo went to the bottom of the sea, it would go to the bottom of the sea at the risk of the <b>orderer.</b> So again, where, as in the case of Ex parte Harris, a person writes a letter and says, I offer to take an allotment of shares, and he expressly or impliedly says, If you agree with me send an answer by the post, there, as soon as he has sent that answer by the post, and put it out of his control, and done an extraneous act which clenches the matter, and shews beyond all doubt that each side is bound, I agree the contract is perfectly plain and clear.But when you come to the general proposition which Mr. Justice Brett seems to have laid down, that a simple acceptance in your own mind, without any intimation to the other party, and expressed by a mere private act, such as putting a letter into a drawer, completes a contract, I must say I differ from that. It appears from the Year Books that as long ago as the time of Edward IV, Chief Justice Brian decided this very point. The plea of the Defendant in that case justified the seizing of some growing crops because he said the Plaintiff had offered him to go and look at them, and if he liked them, and would give 2s. 6d. for them, he might take them; that was the justification. That case is referred to in a book which I published a good many years ago, Blackburn on Contracts of Sale, and is there translated. Brian gives a very elaborate judgment, explaining the law of the unpaid vendor's lien, as early as that time, exactly as the law now stands, and he consequently says: “This plea is clearly bad, as you have not shewn the payment or the tender of the money;” but he goes farther, and says (I am quoting from memory, but I think I am quoting correctly), moreover, your plea is utterly naught, for it does not shew that when you had made up your mind to take them you signified it to the Plaintiff, and your having it in your own mind is nothing, for it is trite law that the thought of man is not triable, for even the devil does not know what the thought of man is; but I grant you this, that if in his offer to you he had said, Go and look at them, and if you are pleased with them signify it to such and such a man, and if you had signified it to such and such a man, your plea would have been good, because that was a matter of fact.I take it, my Lords, that that, which was said 300 years ago and more, is the law to this day, and it is quite what Lord Justice Mellish in Ex parte Harris accurately says, that where it is expressly or impliedly stated in the offer that you may accept the offer by posting a letter, the moment you post the letter the offer is accepted. You are bound from the moment you post the letter, not, as it is put here, from the moment you make up your mind on the subject.But my Lords, while, as I say, this is so upon the question of law, it is still necessary to consider this case farther upon the question of fact. I agree, and I think every Judge who has considered the case does agree, certainly Lord Chief Justice Cockburn does, that though the parties may have gone no farther than an offer on the one side, saying, Here is the draft,—(for that I think is really what this case comes to,)—and the draft so offered by the one side is approved by the other, everything being agreed to except the name of the arbitrator, which the one side has filled in and the other has not yet assented to, if both parties have acted upon that draft and treated it as binding, they will be bound by it. When they had come so near as I have said, still it remained to execute formal agreements, and the parties evidently contemplated that they were to exchange agreements, so that each side should be perfectly safe and secure, knowing that the other side was bound. But, although that was what each party contemplated, still I agree (I think the Lord Chief Justice Cockburn states it clearly enough), that if a draft having been prepared and agreed upon as the basis of a deed or contract to be executed between two parties, the parties, without waiting for the execution of the more formal instrument, proceed to act upon the draft, and treat it as binding upon them, both parties will be bound by it. But it must be clear that the parties have both waived the execution of the formal instrument and have agreed expressly, or as shewn by their conduct, to act on the informal one. I think that is quite right, and I agree with the way in which Mr. Herschell in his argument stated it, very truly and fairly. If the parties have by their conduct said, that they act upon the draft which has been approved of by Mr. Brogden, and which if not quite approved of by the railway company, has been exceedingly near it, if they indicate by their conduct that they accept it, the contract is binding.|$|E
