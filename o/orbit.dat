For still larger h, a family of short-period trapped <b>orbits</b> appears, with continuously growing size.

5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the <b>orbit</b> of Amalthea.

On the next and final <b>orbit</b> (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet.

5|$|Eris's <b>orbit</b> {{is highly}} eccentric, and brings Eris to within 37.9AU of the Sun, a typical {{perihelion}} for scattered objects.

5|$|For {{a stable}} <b>orbit</b> the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to <b>orbit</b> its star, the maximum stable <b>orbit</b> for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star.

Namaka orbits Haumea in 18 {{days in a}} {{moderately}} elliptical, non-Keplerian <b>orbit,</b> and as of 2008 was inclined 13° with respect to Hiʻiaka, which perturbs its <b>orbit.</b> Because the impact that created the moons of Haumea {{is thought to have}} occurred in the early history of the Solar System, over the following billions of years it should have been tidally damped into a more circular <b>orbit.</b> Namaka's <b>orbit</b> has likely been disturbed by orbital resonances with the more-massive Hiʻiaka due to converging orbits as they moved outward from Haumea due to tidal dissipation. They may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital resonance several times; they currently are in or at least close to an 8:3 resonance.
