5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the <b>orbit</b> of Amalthea.

On the next and final <b>orbit</b> (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet.

5|$|For {{a stable}} <b>orbit</b> the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to <b>orbit</b> its star, the maximum stable <b>orbit</b> for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be no greater than a week (7 days) {{in order to have a}} stable <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
