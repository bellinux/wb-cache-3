25|$|In December 2009, one decliner, 27-year-old Jeremiah Valentine {{pleaded guilty}} to second-degree murder in Creba's death and was given a life {{sentence}} with no chance of parole for 12 years. And in April 2010, a jury found Louis Woodcock, 23, and Tyshaun Barnett, 22, guilty of manslaughter in the 15-year-old's death, but not guilty of the more serious offence of second-degree murder. They were also found guilty of four counts each of aggravated assault, relating to <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> wounded by stray bullets that day.|$|E
25|$|<b>Other</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> {{associated}} with the Bahá'í Faith either had Bahá'í backgrounds or were not connected with the religion at all. For example, it was often rumoured that the Prime Minister Amir-Abbas Hoveida was a Bahá'í. While Hoveida's {{father had been a}} Bahá'í, he had left the religion and Hoveida himself was not religious. Other people rumoured to be Bahá'ís included Mahnaz Afkhami, who was the Minister for Women's Affairs and the daughter of a Bahá'í mother, and Farrokhroo Parsa, a cabinet member who was not connected to the religion at all. Chehabi notes that the allegations that half of the Shah's cabinet were Bahá'ís are fanciful and, given the persecution the Bahá'ís have suffered, irresponsible exaggerations.|$|E

25|$|The {{first day}} of the trial {{consisted}} of personal testimonies of a number of witnesses, which included one of the victim's girlfriend who had left the house in the early morning before the murders, a mail carrier, house cleaner, neighbors who had entered the house in the evening after registering smoke, and <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> text messaging either with the victims or with Dahlgren {{on the day of the}} killings. On the second day, more testimonies were, after State Attorney's and Dahlgren's consent, read by the judge. This was followed by questioning of expert witnesses. According to toxicology report, there were no drugs nor alcohol in the blood of the victims. According to a sexologist testimony, Danhlgren was not a sadist, despite being interested in sadomasochism. His sexual orientation could not be determined due to his sexual immaturity.|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{rented the}} flat from Starr in 1965, and asked Sommerville to install {{recording}} equipment (including two Revox reel-to-reel tape machines); planning {{to use it}} as a demo studio, and for recordings of spoken-word albums. The house was not far from the Abbey Road studio where The Beatles recorded, and Jane Asher's parents' house at 57WimpoleStreet, London, where McCartney was living at the time. He recorded a demo version of [...] "I'm Looking Through You" [...] at Montagu Square in late March1965, and worked on the composition of [...] "Eleanor Rigby". Sommerville moved into the flat, even though it was supposed to only be used as a studio, but defended the move by stating that he had to be [...] "on call at all times". Sommerville recorded Burroughs there, for Apple's Zapple label offshoot, but discouraged <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> interested, believing he was working for McCartney exclusively.

Andy tells his co-workers that he stepped in when a [...] "gang" [...] harassed Pam, and Pam plays along out of gratitude to Andy. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) arranges a meeting in the conference room to discuss self-defense. Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother (Tig Notaro) and half-apologizes to him and Pam. Kelly asks Toby to demonstrate how to defend oneself when being attacked by a girl, and begins physically harassing him; Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up, resulting in his other eye being blackened. The rest of the office laughs but shuts up when Andy points out he got hit twice because he defended <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> being attacked. The episode concludes with Andy noting that he took a bunch of pain medication, drank a bottle of wine, and took his pants off, thus greatly improving his feelings as the day ends.|$|E
500|$|According to Jenna Fischer, {{the series}} used an unusual casting process {{which did not}} involve a script. The {{producers}} would ask the actors several questions and they would respond as the characters they were auditioning for. NBC programmer Kevin Reilly originally suggested Paul Giamatti to producer Ben Silverman {{for the role of}} Michael Scott, but the actor declined. Martin Short, Hank Azaria, and Bob Odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part. In January 2004, Variety reported that Steve Carell, of the popular Comedy Central program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, was in talks to play the role. At the time, he was already committed to another NBC mid-season replacement comedy, Come to Papa, but the series was quickly canceled, allowing his full commitment to The Office. Carell later stated that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the British series before he auditioned. He did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying Gervais' characterizations. <b>Other</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> considered or auditioned for the role included Ben Falcone, Alan Tudyk, Jim Zulevic, and Paul F. Tompkins. Rainn Wilson was cast as power-hungry sycophant Dwight Schrute, and he watched every episode of the series before he auditioned. Wilson had originally auditioned for Michael, a performance that he described as a [...] "terrible Ricky Gervais impersonation"; however, the casting directors liked his audition as Dwight much more and hired him. Seth Rogen, Matt Besser, Patton Oswalt, and Judah Friedlander also auditioned for the role.|$|E

2500|$|During the Great Depression, 20-month-old Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., son {{of famous}} aviator Charles Lindbergh, was {{abducted}} {{from his home}} near Hopewell, New Jersey. A long investigation ensued as detectives attempted to round up the kidnapper of the baby. The police proceeded to seal off many roads {{in order to prevent}} the kidnapper's escape, and interrogated the members of the Lindbergh household. The stress of being under police questioning led to the suicide of Violet Sharpe. Dr. John F. Condon became a negotiator between the kidnapper [...] "John" [...] and the Lindbergh family. The kidnapper demanded a ransom of $50,000, which was paid but {{turned out to be a}} hoax.

I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always a question I will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... It was a strange feeling. There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E
2500|$|The Ventura/Monsoon duo of {{heel and}} babyface were the {{original}} broadcast duo, setting the standard which all who followed would attempt to emulate, especially Ventura's charismatic pro-heel character which was a {{first of its kind}} as previous wrestling commentators had almost always been in favor of the fan favorites. The pair commentated on all the WWF pay-per-views together {{with the exception of the}} first two SummerSlams and the 1990 Royal Rumble (at SummerSlam 1988 Ventura was the guest referee for the main event so Monsoon commentated with [...] "Superstar" [...] Billy Graham, while Ventura was paired with Tony Schiavone at both SummerSlam 1989 and the Royal Rumble). When Ventura left the WWF in mid-1990, he was replaced in commentary by Monsoon's Prime Time Wrestling co-host, heel manager Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan, another duo that subsequent wrestling commentary teams have often tried to emulate. The two also formed a close real-life friendship which Heenan often recalls fondly. In his WWE Hall of Fame induction speech in 2004, Heenan finished by saying that only one thing was missing – that he wished Monsoon was there. <b>Other</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> often paired with Monsoon in the broadcast booth included Lord Alfred Hayes, Johnny Polo, [...] "Superstar" [...] Billy Graham, Hillbilly Jim, Tony Schiavone, Jim Neidhart, Randy Savage and Jim Ross.|$|E
