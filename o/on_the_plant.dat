5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces the targeting of a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E

5|$|Like all sundews, D. anglica uses stalked {{mucilaginous}} glands called tentacles which cover its laminae to attract, trap, and digest small arthropods, usually insects. These {{are attracted}} by a sugary scent exuded by the glands, and upon alighting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> {{adhere to the}} sticky drops of mucilage. Although most of its prey consists of small insects such as flies, bulkier insects with large wings are also caught. Small butterflies, damselflies, and even dragonflies can become immobilized by the plant's sticky mucilage.|$|E
5|$|The Lānai hookbill is {{only known}} to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe. The type {{specimen}} was caught while feeding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> and its berries were subsequently discovered in its stomach. It is considered likely that the hookbill additionally ate akoko fruits due to their similarity in size and shape to those of the ōpuhe. However, the hookbill's unique bill is considered unlikely to have evolved if the species was purely frugivorous, and {{it has been suggested that}} the hookbill specialized in eating snails. The species was very active while searching for food, constantly flying from tree to tree. While perched it shifted restlessly.|$|E
5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E

5|$|Eggs are {{individually}} {{deposited on}} leaf hairs and corn silks (not in reference given). The eggs are initially pale green in color, {{but over time}} they turn yellowish and then grey. Eggs are 0.5mm in height and average about 0.55mm in diameter. They hatch after 66 to 72 hours of development. Once larvae have breached the chorion, they spend up to 85% of their time emerging from their shell. In this eclosion process, the larvae work to make the exit hole larger than their heads. Larvae {{spend the rest of}} the time making a silk meshwork around the exit hole; this both helps them escape the shell and helps them find the shell afterwards so they can feed on it. After feeding on their shell, larvae rest about 3 minutes before they begin feeding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> material around them.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, gardens became focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> conservation. The Botanic Gardens Conservation Secretariat was {{established}} by the IUCN, and the World Conservation Union in 1987 {{with the aim of}} coordinating the plant conservation efforts of botanical gardens around the world. It maintains a database of rare and endangered species in botanical gardens' living collections. Many gardens hold ex situ conservation collections that preserve genetic variation. These may be held as: seeds dried and stored at low temperature, or in tissue culture (such as the Kew Millennium Seedbank); as living plants, including those that are of special horticultural, historical or scientific interest (such as those held by the NCCPG in the United Kingdom); or by managing and preserving areas of natural vegetation. Collections are often held and cultivated with the intention of reintroduction to their original habitats. The Center for Plant Conservation at St Louis, Missouri coordinates the conservation of native North American species.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E

5|$|Training {{also took}} place at Port Sunlight, where they were shown how to destroy large {{condensers}} of the kind found in the plant. The sappers were given detailed briefings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> and the surrounding area, and were trained on large models and mock-ups of the buildings that the plant was composed of, all based on {{information provided by the}} SOE agents who had arrived earlier in the month. Because the operation was considered to be extremely important, and its results vital to the Allied war effort, security efforts were extremely thorough. A cover story was provided for the sappers as they conducted their training; a rumour was spread that they were training to compete against a company of American engineers in a fictional 'Washington Cup' athletic event, which involved a long route march to be completed either by glider or parachute, followed by a complex demolition task and finally a demanding endurance test. The departure airfield was also sealed off to civilians and non-essential military personnel, and all mail and telephone calls were censored.|$|E
5|$|While French {{innovations}} enriched {{the cuisine}} in many ways, not every innovation was favorable. Since the French {{introduction of the}} prickly pear cactus in the 18thcentury, the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves {{during the dry season}} between July and December. However, in 1925, a French colonist wishing to eradicate the cactus on his property in the southwestern town of Toliara introduced the cochineal, an insect known to be a parasite of the plant. Within five years, nearly all the prickly pear cactus of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out, sparking a massive famine from 1930–1931. Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways, the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land.|$|E
5|$|The Headquarters {{staff of}} Combined Operations at the War Office was tasked with devising {{a plan for}} the glider-borne assault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> as it had been with {{previous}} airborne and commando operations, such as Operation Biting. This was the first British airborne operation ever to use gliders; all previous operations had been conducted solely with parachutists. The staff decided that although gliders would be the most suitable for the operation due to the heavy loads to be carried by the airborne troops, and the possibility that they could be widely dispersed if they were dropped by parachute, the airborne troops would still be trained for a possible parachute insertion if the landing zone for the gliders was found to be unsuitable. Because of the complicated and technical nature of the operation, which would see the plant rigged with explosives and then detonated, it was believed that a minimum of twelve to sixteen men was required, and that they would all have to be skilled engineers. The important nature of the operation also led to the force being doubled in order to duplicate it, to ensure that even if half of the force were killed, the survivors would have the necessary skills to complete the operation. The selected troops were volunteer parachutists chosen from the sappers of 9th Field Company (Airborne) Royal Engineers and 261st Field Park Company (Airborne) Royal Engineers attached to 1st Airborne Division, because the only parachute-trained Royal Engineers unit in existence at the time, 1st Parachute Squadron Royal Engineers, was already deployed in North Africa with 1st Parachute Brigade. Both of the duplicated units that were to participate in the operation were to be commanded by officers from the Royal Engineers; the first by Lieutenant A.C. Allen and the second by Second-Lieutenant M.D. Green, who was later replaced by Lieutenant D.A. Methven when he was injured during a training accident three days before the operation was to begin.|$|E
