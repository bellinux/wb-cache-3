5|$|Delay issues aside, the {{development}} team encountered further {{challenges in the}} creation of the game. Implementing the top-down perspective became a particular issue and resulted in a lot <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error. With a true top-down view, players would be unable to see characters' faces and bodies. To circumvent this issue, objects in the world were tilted at an angle so that they were more visible in the top-down view. Mouri requested that the game run at sixty frames per second instead of thirty to stabilise the stereoscopic 3D and smoothen movement animations. While doubling the frame rate increased the processing load, it allowed the developers to implement a feature where players could select items by dragging and dropping them from their inventory using the Nintendo 3DS's touchscreen and stylus; at thirty frames per second this feature felt too sluggish for the stylus's movement.|$|E
5|$|Hudson {{explained}} {{that they wanted to}} evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of Knights of the Old Republic into a real-time third-person shooter interface. The combat was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface. It was also designed so that players would not need to press many buttons to pull off the squad's different attack combinations. The team worked closely with Microsoft on several elements of the interface to make sure the combat was tactical enough, and went through a lot <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error to balance the combat between role-playing game and shooter. Creating a great sense of discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations. Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, the tools and technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.|$|E
5|$|So the {{production}} could be managed {{in the short}} time available, the movie's development was separated into three phases, with each phase being dedicated to a particular part of {{the production}} process and run by a different unit director answering to Nozue. The movie went through multiple phases <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error until the final product was solidified. Kingsglaive was kept a secret until 2016 when it was near completion, as the developers felt that they had announced its parent video game too early. So as to remain close to the development of Final Fantasy XV, the lead staff of Kingsglaive moved from Visual Works to Business Division 2, the department of Square Enix responsible for the game's development. This was part of an overall shift in development methods when the game was changed from a spin-off to a mainline entry. In addition to the staff of Advent Children, Western companies in gaming and movie production were involved: Digic Pictures, who had worked on the graphics for the Assassin's Creed series; and Image Engine, who had worked on multiple films including Jurassic World (2015) and the television series Game of Thrones. According to Nozue, around 50 different companies were involved in the film's production: among these was Europe-based company Puppetworks Animation Studio. The internal team was estimated at around 50 people. The cooperation of studios overseas meant that work on the movie could proceed continuously. Without this external aid, Nozue estimated that they would have needed a staff of five hundred people to complete the film in the given timeframe.|$|E

Workers were frequently retrained to familiarise themselves with the work systems and cultures of foreign MNCs. The government also started several new industries, such as steel mills under 'National Iron and Steel Mills', service industries like Neptune Orient Lines, and the Singapore Airlines.|$|E

25|$|The Upper Hunter {{region was}} first planted in 1860 by a German settler named Carl Brecht. From his {{vineyard}} planted {{at the junction}} of Wybong Creek and the Goulburn river, Brecht's wines would win numerous gold medals at international wine competitions in the 1870s. Brecht's success would spur some interest in the area but the same turn of the 20th century events that saw decline throughout the Hunter Valley would compound to virtually extinguish all viticulture in the Upper Hunter. It wasn't until the 1960s when Penfolds purchased land near Brecht's old Wybong estate that significant viticulture interest in the Upper Hunter re-emerged. Through many years <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error, the viticulturalists at Penfolds were able to determine that the area was most suitable for white wine grape varieties.|$|E
25|$|While most of Australia's wine {{industry}} was directly {{influenced by the}} involvement of the British, the Barossa Valley was shaped by the influence of German settlers fleeing persecution from the Prussian province of Silesia. In 1841, the South Australian Company (under orders of one of its shareholders George Fife Angas) chartered three ships to Silesia to offer refuge and land in the Barossa Valley to any settler willing to volunteer to help establish the colony. Nearly 500 families accepted the offer and settled in the Barossa Valley. After trying many types of agricultural crops, the settlers found the warm fertile valley to be ideally suited for viticulture. The early years of the Barossa Valley winemaking ushered in a long period <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error for while the settlers were skilled farmers, their previous homeland of Silesia had little to no winemaking tradition.|$|E
25|$|The {{two primary}} grapes of the Cote de Nuits, pinot noir and Chardonnay, are {{believed}} to be indigenous to the Burgundy wine region. Through centuries <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error, the two varieties have shown to produce the most consistent quality in the region. Broadly speaking, pinot noir tends to be planted in areas with high proportion of marl while Chardonnay is most often found in vineyards that are dominated by limestone. As the Cote de Nuits has many areas with significant amounts of marl, pinot noir is the dominant planting in the area. As a grape variety, pinot noir is very reflective of the terroir it is grown in which, coupled with the highly variable soils of the area, can cause two Cote de Nuits wine producers in the same year and by the same producer to be dramatically different due to where exactly they were grown.|$|E
