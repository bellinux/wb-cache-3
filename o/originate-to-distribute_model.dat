Most of the attention is paid to two in this context absolutely crucial markets and to their pre-crisis development [...] the American real estate market and the American mortgage market. Within my real estate market analysis I describe the reasons for the emergence of the price bubble, the burst of which essentially triggered the financial crisis.

We investigate the incentives for using OTD lending {{and its impact on}} credit supply and bank risk taking behavior based on their involvements in the OTD model and bank size. Banks involved into OTD lending have more OTD loans and riskier mortgage portfolios. Funding cost reduction and liquidity needs are more important for high-OTD banks and small banks and regulatory capital arbitrage can only be found in small banks. Moreover, we find that OTD lending increase credit supply, but it has adverse effect on bank risk, especially for small banks involved in the model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{demonstrate}} {{a link between}} the twin storms underlying the current financial crisis – the market for collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and the market for leveraged loans. We show that structural changes in credit markets that led to the explosion in CDOs created an increased supply of bank loans for funding LBOs. This structured lending supported by CDOs led to cheaper credit, looser covenants, and more aggressive use of bank loans in financing LBOs. However, {{in sharp contrast to the}} LBO boom in the late 1980 s, this easy credit did not lead to riskier LBO deals or deal structures. Our findings point to the effects of disintermediation of banks as they switched from an originate-and-hold to an <b>originate-to-distribute</b> lending <b>model...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{which began in}} the summer of 2007 {{has its roots in the}} under-estimation of systemic risk, in turn due to the absence of a macroprudential approach to the design of financial regulation and macroeconomic policies, as well as the excessively optimistic judgment of the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model</b> of banking. The ongoing process of reform of the global financial system aims to correct these mistakes.

40|$|While the {{unfolding}} financial turmoil has involved new elements, more fundamental elements have remained the same. New elements include structured credit, the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> business <b>model</b> and expanded markets for repurchase agreements (repos). The recurrence of crises reflects a basic procyclicality in the system, which is characterised by a build-up of risk-taking and leverage {{in good times}} and an abrupt withdrawal from risk and an unwinding of leverage in bad times. To deal with the adverse liquidity spiral that has characterised the current crisis, central banks have tried {{to strike a balance}} between the importance of the continued availability of market liquidity as a public good and the moral hazard that any market intervention may induce. In proposing long-term responses to the crisis, the Financial Stability Forum has focused on areas where incentives for risk-taking may be aligned more properly and areas where risk management may be made more robust. Nonetheless, a recognition that the procyclicality of the system lies at the root of the crisis would suggest more aggressive countercyclical measures are needed. 1...|$|R
40|$|An <b>originate-to-distribute</b> (OTD) <b>model</b> of lending, {{where the}} {{originator}} of a loan sells it to various third parties, {{was a popular}} method of mortgage lending {{before the onset of}} the subprime mortgage crisis. We show that banks with high involvement in the OTD market during the pre-crisis period originated excessively poor-quality mortgages. This result is not explained away by differences in observable borrower quality, geographical location of the property, or the cost of capital of high- and low-OTD banks. Instead, our evidence supports the view that the originating banks did not expend resources in screen-ing their borrowers. The effect of OTD lending on poor mortgage quality is stronger for capital-constrained banks. Overall, we provide evidence that lack of screening incentives coupled with leverage-induced risk-taking behavior significantly contributed to the current subprime mortgage crisis. (JEL G 11, G 12, G 13, G 14) The recent crisis in the mortgage market is having an enormous impact on the world economy.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} studies {{the impact of}} house price {{expectations}} together with securitization, on the magnitude of risky mortgage lending by banks. This chapter first presents a simple model to explore the impact of both house price expectations {{and the growth of}} securitization on the extent of subprime lending. The model shows that a high expectation of housing prices not only increases lenders' willingness to lend to riskier borrowers, but, in addition, enhances the attractiveness of the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> (OTD) <b>model</b> of lending. Access to securitization markets also amplifies banks' incentives to lend to sub-prime borrowers and leads to a worsening of mortgage-market credit quality. Thus, when housing prices decline, the extent of defaults is magnified with OTD lending. Empirical findings confirm the model's predictions. In particular, the results show that, in markets with higher housing price growth, banks with higher OTD participation extended mortgages to riskier borrowers, and thus, had larger incidence of defaults once house prices declined. The second chapter models the interaction between lending institutions and credit rating agencies under different economic scenarios, where an originator window dresses claims it issues and a credit rating agency (CRA) screens. Both window dressing and screening efforts are shown to depend {{on the state of the}} economy: better states exhibit greater window dressing and less screening. The rating quality and default probability for given ratings also vary with economic conditions, and credit spreads adjust to such variations. The third chapter examines how retirement affects households portfolio choice. Conventional wisdom suggests that when income is substantially reduced after retirement, households should hold more safe assets in their portfolios. The data, however, show that, on average, retirement causes an approximately five to seven percent increase in the share of risky assets in households' portfolios. In addition, this positive shift mostly happens right after retirement immediately and is mainly driven by the fact that households without risky assets start to hold risky assets after retirement. Evidence in support of (a) shifts in risk tolerance and (b) spending additional time tracking the stock market is presented...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, bank credit has evolved from the {{traditional}} relationship banking model to an <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model</b> where banks can originate loans, earn their fee, and then sell them off to investors who desire such exposures. We show that the borrowers whose loans are sold in the secondary market underperform other bank borrowers by between 8 % and 14 % per year on a risk-adjusted basis over the three-year period following the sale of their loan. Furthermore, they suffer a value destruction of about 15 % compared to their peers over the same period. This effect is more severe for small, high leverage, speculative grade borrowers. There are two alternative explanations for this underperformance - either banks are originating and selling bad loans based on unobservable private information, similar to {{the events in the}} current subprime mortgage crisis, and/or the severance of the bank-borrower relationship allows the borrowers to undertake suboptimal investment and operating decisions, {{in the absence of the}} discipline of bank monitoring. Our results also show that borrowers whose loans are not sold in the secondary market do not underperform their peers, reinforcing the inference that bank loan financing is indeed “special”, except for borrowers whose loans are sold. In light of these moral hazard and adverse selection problems, the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model</b> of bank credit may not entirely be “socially desirable”. We propose regulatory restrictions on loan sales, increased disclosure, and a loan trading exchange with a clearinghouse as mechanisms to alleviate these problems...|$|E

The mortgage lending business, especially {{with the rise of}} the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model,</b> had competitors with very different non- mortgage activities and regulation. I show that in local markets, when banks increased their share of mortgages relative to lenders such as mortgage brokers, home prices started increasing at a faster pace.

When national home prices increased at a faster pace, there was a shift from banks to mortgage brokers in local markets. Mortgage loans...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effects of economic shocks on acquisition outcomes and the sources of housing market bubble. The first essay investigates how the combined effects of target firm- and industry-level distress affect acquisition outcomes through the fire-sale channel. I show that distressed targets are sold at discounts when the target industry is in distress. Consistent with the Shleifer and Vishny model, the fire-sale effects cause distressed targets {{to be sold to}} industry outsiders and acquirers to gain higher return by exploiting target's weakened bargaining power. I further demonstrate the fire-sale effects in acquisitions by showing that these findings are stronger for targets with acquirers that are in different industries or where targets have high industry asset-specificity. I then examine the contagion effects of fire-sale acquisitions on target rivals in the same industry. I find that rivals earn negative abnormal returns at the announcement due to negative information from fire-sale acquisitions. Overall, the results show that the fire-sale discount in distressed target acquisitions is an important determinant of financial distress costs of a firm and contributes to industry-specific contagion of economic shocks. In the second essay, I explore (with a coauthor) whether state-level variation in recourse mortgage laws affects housing prices and mortgage lending. In a state with non-recourse mortgage law, borrowers have limited liability on their mortgage loan. We find that non-recourse law results in larger bubbles in housing prices, and identify the causal effects by comparing housing prices in contiguous border county-pairs in the United States and examine discontinuities at state borders. We also explore whether mortgage lending behavior in non-recourse states reflects anticipation of additional risk. We find that loan-to-value ratio is lower and mortgage interest rate and loan denial rate are higher in non-recourse states, which suggest that lenders are aware of additional risk in non-recourse loans. However, we find that because the emergence of the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> (OTD) <b>model</b> in the housing markets enables lenders to effectively shift the risks to other investors, mortgage lending behavior does not fully reflect the higher risk...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} an increased institutional involvement in the recently emerging lending business known as peer-to-peer lending (P 2 PL). Since the P 2 PL business itself {{is a type of}} <b>originate-to-distribute</b> (OTD) lending <b>model</b> – in which the originator never carries the risk for the loans – this thesis investigates the effects it can have {{on the quality of the}} screening of potential borrowers, and if it could create a misalignment of interests between different stakeholders in the P 2 PL market. It also examines how the information asymmetry in the screening process is affecting moral hazard behavior and adverse selection problems. From the empirical research – which was gathered from interviews with significant participants in the Swedish P 2 PL market and the financial market as a whole – the authors find that an increased institutional involvement seems to come hand-in-hand with an increased loan volume, which creates incentives for the P 2 PL companies to ease their screening of borrowers and thus decreasing the average quality of the loans they originate. Furthermore, it shows evidence of great similarities between the current P 2 PL market and the sub-prime mortgage market that was the cause of the financial crisis in 2008. By comparing different geographic P 2 PL markets the thesis is providing the reader with four development phases that the P 2 PL markets seem to follow...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the case for}} mortgage covered bonds {{as an alternative to}} the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> mortgage funding <b>model.</b> It argues that the economic incentives provided to market participants under the covered bonds model are less susceptible to moral hazard even while retaining the key benefits of securitization such as capital market funding and flexibility in risk allocation. Notwithstanding these advantages, however, limited market size and the greater pro-cyclicality of mortgage loan quality in the United States - potentially reflecting borrower incentives under the personal bankruptcy framework - impose limits on the benefits ensuing from this model. The analysis underscores the need for a comprehensive legal-regulatory framework to underpin market development and discusses a number of ways in which the current draft legislation may be further strengthened. A potential strategy to hasten market development within the current institutional framework is identified.

40|$|During the Subprime crisis {{the entire}} banking {{industry}} risked collapsing under an unprecedented lack of liquidity. This work tries and find what channel allowed {{a relatively small}} systemic shock, the increased mortgage delinquency in the US housing market, to spread worldwide with such a terrific impact. I develop a model of financial contagion where banks adopting the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model</b> satisfy their liquidity needs through repurchase agreements in the money market. I assume there are no early diers in the economy, and I look at crises originating from inaccurate forecasting of asset returns by some banks.

40|$|The {{move from}} the originate-to-hold to <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model</b> of lending profoundly {{transformed}} the functioning of credit markets and weakened the natural asset transformation function performed by financial intermediaries for centuries. This shift also compromised the role of banks in channeling monetary policy initiatives, and undermined the importance of traditional asset-liability practices of interest rate risk management. The question is, therefore, whether securitisation is conducive to the optimal hedging of bank interest rate risk. The empirical results reported in this work suggest that banks resorting to securitisation do not, on average, achieve an unambiguous reduction in their exposure to the term structure fluctuations. Against this background, banks with very high involvement in the originate-to-distribute market enjoy lower interest rate risk. This however by no means implies superior risk management practices in these institutions but is merely a result of disintermediation. ...|$|E
40|$|Prima facie {{securitisation}} {{played a}} prominent role in the recent global financial crisis. Moral hazard associated with securitisation is the key element behind the failure of securitisation. Risk retention is the US legislator's response to address the moral hazard issue associated with the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model.</b> This paper adopts a lexieconomic framework to analyse the risk retention provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and proves that said provisions are not capable of eliminating moral hazard associated with securitisation. This paper argues that in order to ensure proper screening of the borrower, the cost for the lender for not engaging in proper screening and monitoring should be higher than the benefits she gains by not screening.

40|$|Financial reform {{legislation}} passed by Congress in 2010 requires mortgage originators to retain some loss exposure on the mortgages they securitize. Recent research compares {{the performance of}} mortgage-backed securities for different types of issues in which originators retain different degrees of loss exposure. The findings suggest that retention of even modest loss exposure by originators reduces moral hazard and is associated with significantly lower loss rates on these securities. Many analysts believe that, during the housing boom of the 2000 s, the widespread securitization of residential mortgages fundamentally altered the incentives of {{key players in the}} loan origination and funding process. A basic problem with the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model</b> of lending is that mortgage originators and the sponsors of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) have too little “skin in the game,” these critics argue. In contrast to traditional lending, in which vertically integrated lenders own and service the loans they originate, securitization involves different agents performing different services, often for fees that are unrelated to the performance of the securitized mortgage loans. A resulting danger is that originators and sponsors pay too little attention to the riskiness of the mortgages they originate or place into pools they sponsor...|$|E
40|$|This article {{questions}} {{the efficiency of}} the shareholder primacy model of corporate governance in light of the financial calamities that have plagued {{the first decade of the}} 21 st century. Reform efforts following the global financial crisis have focused on failures in securities regulation, but that is only part of the story. Effective reform measures must also address the legal and normative prescriptions found within existing governance structures, and the collateral effect those prescriptions have on political and regulatory inaction. There was strong ideological support for the shareholder primacy model at the start of the century. Following the corporate and accounting scandals of 2001 and 2002, three scholarly perspectives emerged addressing the effectiveness of the model. This article continues the dialogue on those perspectives and examines two factors that contributed to the collapse of the US subprime mortgage market: the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model</b> of lending. The examination reveals how the shareholder primacy model played a key role in the onslaught of the global financial crisis by incentivizing the obstruction of efficient regulation. Alongside this analysis is an interwoven account of the evolution of law and economics scholarship. The article provides a timely outlook on how the shareholder primacy model encourages corporate behaviour that perpetuates the likelihood of future crises. It concludes by offering potential solutions for reform...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{produced}} for “In Berle’s Footsteps,” a symposium marking {{the launch of}} the Adolf A. Berle, Jr. Center on Corporations, Law and Society at the University of Seattle School of Law. It considers the light that the “derivatives revolution” sheds on the theoretical perspectives of Roberto Unger and Adolf Berle. While an unlikely pair, both Unger and Berle focused, in different ways, on the same issues: property, the power associated with property, and the impact of “smashing the atom” of traditional property rights. For Unger, breaking down consolidated property holding at the societal level was a pro-democratic move. For Berle, analyzing corporate law, the separation of ownership from control risked promoting exactly the kind of concentration of power that Unger, through destabilization, sought to destroy. Financial derivatives products deconstruct property well beyond what Berle contemplated, and through a fundamentally different mechanism than what Unger envisioned. Both the differences and the similarities between real life and theory are illuminating. We describe the effects of derivatives at three levels: at the level of corporate law; of financial firm practices and the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model,</b> and of the global over-the-counter derivatives market. In each case, we find that the fluidity produced by disassembling traditional property rights creates a space within which sophisticated parties are able to consolidate and reaffirm their power. Thus while Unger’s claim about the necessity of “destabilization rights” still resonates, Berle’s insight into the human will to power is central to understanding the risks associated with that destabilization...|$|E
40|$|A {{broad array}} of {{domestic}} institutional factors –including problems with the <b>originate-to-distribute</b> <b>model</b> for mortgage loans, deteriorating lending standards, deficiencies in risk management, conflicting incentives for the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and shortcomings of supervision and regulation– were the primary sources of the US housing boom and bust and the associated financial crisis. In addition, the extended rise in US house prices was likely also supported by long-term interest rates (including mortgage rates) that were surprisingly low, given the level of short-term rates and other macro fundamentals –a development that Greenspan (2005) dubbed a “conundrum. ” The “global saving glut” (GSG) hypothesis (Bernanke, 2005 and 2007) argues that increased capital inflows to the United States from countries in which desired saving greatly exceeded desired investment –including Asian emerging markets and commodity exporters– were an important reason that US longer-term interest rates during this period were lower than expected. This essay investigates further the effects of capital inflows to the United States on US longer-term interest rates; however, we look beyond the overall size of the inflows emphasised by the GSG hypothesis to examine the implications for US yields of the portfolio preferences of foreign creditors. We present evidence that, {{in the spirit of}} Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2009), foreign investors during this period tended to prefer US assets perceived to be safe. In particular, foreign investors –especially the GSG countries–acquired a substantial share of the new issues of US Treasuries, Agency debt, and Agency-sponsored mortgage-backed securities. The downward pressure on yields exerted by inflows from the GSG countries was reinforced by the portfolio preferences of other foreign investors. We focus particularly on the case of Europe: although Europe did not run a large current account surplus as did the GSG countries, we show that it leveraged up its international balance sheet, issuing external liabilities to finance substantial purchases of apparently safe US “private label” mortgage-backed securities and other fixed-income products. The strong demand for apparently safe assets by both domestic and foreign investors not only served to reduce yields on these assets but also provided additional incentives for the US financial services industry to develop structured investment products that “transformed” risky loans into highly-rated securities. Our findings do not challenge the view that domestic factors, including those listed above, were the primary sources of the housing boom and bust in the United States. However, examining how changes in the pattern of international capital flows affected yields on US assets helps provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} origins and dynamics of the crisis. ...|$|E
