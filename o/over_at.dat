5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> its 33-yard line. Needing a score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, {{preventing them from}} gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech had to play defense as Kansas took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to run the ball {{in an effort to}} keep the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first down on the ground before the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two deep inside Virginia Tech territory.|$|E
5|$|After the missed kick, California took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> its 12-yard line. Aaron Rodgers {{completed}} three {{passes for}} 58yards and Arrington added 15yards on an end-around run.

Tech received the post-touchdown kickoff and gained two quick first downs, but after advancing the ball beyond its own 40-yard line, was forced to punt it back to California.|$|E
5|$|After {{the third}} Louisville punt, Virginia Tech took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> its 46-yard line.

After losing seven yards on the next play, Marcus Vick completed a 19-yard pass to tight end Jeff King, driving the Hokies into Louisville territory {{for the first time}} in the quarter. Two plays later, Vick connected with wide receiver Justin Harper on a 33-yard pass that resulted in the Hokies' first touchdown of the game.

5|$|Another seventh-place {{finish in}} the 2000–01 season was {{followed}} by two less successful seasons, and they were relegated to the second-tier with a then-record low 19 points in 2003. Former Ireland manager Mick McCarthy took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the club, and, in 2005, he took Sunderland up as champions {{for the third time}} in less than ten years. However, the club's stay in the top flight was short-live as Sunderland were once again relegated, this time with a new record-low total of 15 points. McCarthy left the club in mid-season, and he was replaced temporarily by former Sunderland player Kevin Ball. The record-low fifteen-point performance was surpassed in the 2007–08 season by Derby County, who finished on eleven points.|$|E
5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall <b>over.</b> <b>At</b> high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1904 season, {{after passing}} his final medical examinations, Verge left Sydney University and stopped playing rugby for the team. A. J.

The older Verge was granted a blue, and was elected a vice-president of the club. However, he returned to the team for the tour of New Zealand in September 1906.

5|$|Auburn's offense took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> its one-yard line after Tech's {{failure to}} score. Jason Campbell orchestrated a {{successful}} drive that took Auburn from {{the shadow of}} its own end zone, completing passes of 16yards, 15yards, and 37yards in the process. Inside the Virginia Tech red zone, however, the Auburn offense again stumbled. As it had in its two previous scoring drives, Auburn was forced to send in kicker John Vaughn despite being inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. Vaughn's 24-yard kick was successful, and with 1:50 remaining in the second quarter, Auburn extended its lead to 9–0.|$|E
5|$|B. edulis is {{the type}} species of the genus Boletus. In Rolf Singer's {{classification}} of the Agaricales mushrooms, {{it is also the}} type species of section Boletus, a grouping of about 30 related boletes united by several characteristics: a mild-tasting, white flesh that does not change colour when exposed to air; a smooth to distinctly raised, netted pattern <b>over</b> <b>at</b> least the uppermost portion of the stem; a yellow-brown or olive-brown spore print; white tubes that later become yellowish then greenish, which initially appear to be stuffed with cotton; and cystidia that are not strongly coloured. Molecular analysis published in 1997 established that the bolete mushrooms are all derived from a common ancestor, and established the Boletales as an order separate from the Agaricales.|$|E
5|$|Browns center Mike Scarry {{left before}} the season to become the head coach at Western Reserve. Frank Gatski took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the {{position}} after Scarry's retirement.

Browns games were televised {{for the first time}} in 1948 on 84 stations across the country.

5|$|Buffalo took <b>over</b> <b>at</b> {{their own}} 19-yard line and {{promptly}} earned their 1stfirstdown {{of the game}} on a 10-yardpass from quarterback Drew Willy to wide receiver Naaman Roosevelt. The Bulls' drive stalled from there, forcing them to punt. The punt struck the ground and hit UConn's Jonathan Jean-Louis, who was attempting to block for the punt return; Buffalo recovered the loose ball, giving them back possession at the Connecticut 23-yard line.

There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.|$|E
