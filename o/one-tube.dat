40|$|Rapid and {{sensitive}} detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. Tb) in cerebrospinal fluid {{is crucial in}} the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM), but conventional diagnostic technologies have limited sensitivity and specificity or are time-consuming. In this work, a novel, highly sensitive molecular diagnostic method, <b>one-tube</b> nested PCR-lateral flow strip test (OTNPCR-LFST), was developed for detecting M. tuberculosis. This <b>one-tube</b> nested PCR maintains the sensitivity of conventional two-step nested PCR and reduces both the chance of cross-contamination and the time required for analysis. The PCR product was detected by a lateral flow strip assay, which provided a basis for migration of the test to a point-of-care (POC) microfluidic format. The developed assay had an improved sensitivity compared with traditional PCR, and the limit of detection was up to 1 fg DNA isolated from M. tuberculosis. The assay was also specific for M. tuberculosis, and no cross-reactions were found in other non-target bacteria. The application of this technique to clinical samples was successfully evaluated, and OTNPCR-LFST showed 89 % overall sensitivity and 100 % specificity for TBM patients. This <b>one-tube</b> nested PCR-lateral flow strip assay is useful for detecting M. tuberculosis in TBM due to its rapidity, high sensitivity and simple manipulation...|$|E

40|$|Background Tuberculosis (TB) {{infection}} is a contagious disease due to infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MTB) causing global health burden. There is increasing {{effort to develop}} early case detection methods and also {{to address the issue}} of multidrug resistance TB (MDR-TB). Molecular methods have been applied to provide rapid and accurate diagnosis. In addition to commercial kits being available for the detection of MTB from clinical specimens, In-house PCR assays have also been developed for the detection of MTB, and can be adjusted according to the laboratories’ own demand. Several molecular techniques like TaqMan probes and Hybridization probes may be applied to target for markers of MTB, e. g. 16 s rRNA and IS 6110. Detection of the mutation genes, for example, katGfor isoniazid (INH), enables determination of susceptibility of the antibiotic more rapidly than traditional culture methods, and is especially useful due to the increasing emergence of MDR-TB. A wide range of genes have been reported to be related to the resistance of INH, katG 315 mutation is the most common gene among them. Therefore, genotyping katG 315 allows determination of the susceptibility of INH. Objective The first objective is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of IS 6110 <b>One-tube</b> Nested Real-Time PCR for the detection of MTB. Clinical pulmonary specimens collected from Tuen Mun Hospital were retrieved for investigation. All the specimens have already been tested for COBAS TaqMan MTB test and culture results have been obtained for all the samples. During the first stage of the study, all the specimens were tested with IS 6110 <b>One-tube</b> Nested Real-Time PCR. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic odds ratio were obtained from the comparison with the gold standard of MTB detection, i. e., culture. During the second stage of the study, samples were selected to undergo katG 315 HybProbe Real-Time PCR assay to determine the genotype of katG. The performance of the assay was evaluated statistically. Result In the first stage of the study, 200 samples were tested with IS 6110 <b>One-tube</b> Nested Real-Time PCR. The assay was found to have a sensitivity of 76. 92 %, specificity of 98. 52 %, positive predictive value of 96. 15 %, negative predictive value of 89. 86 % and the diagnostic odds ratio of 221. 667. In the second stage of the study, 66 samples were selected and tested for katG 315 HybProbe Real-Time PCR assay, 36 samples were successfully genotyped while 30 samples failed to be genotyped. The only culture proven INH resistance specimen was not amplified at first, and culture isolate was extracted for genotyping again. The repeated test confirmed the genotype of the resistance strain to be a mutant. Conclusion katG 315 HybProbe Real-Time PCR assay is a valid approach for genotyping katG. However, the sensitivity and efficiency has to be improved before application for clinical use. From the statistics obtained, COBAS TaqMan PCR assay, which is routinely used in Tuen Mun Hospital, is statistically proven to have comparatively better performance than the IS 6110 <b>One-tube</b> Nested Real-Time PCR. Improvement on the assay is required for IS 6110 <b>One-tube</b> Nested Real-Time PCR. However, there is great potential of applying both IS 6110 <b>One-tube</b> Nested Real-Time PCR and katG 315 HybProbe Real-Time PCR assay in clinical use with the same platform available. published_or_final_versionMicrobiologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|E

40|$|The single {{frequency}} {{noise figure}} of a <b>one-tube</b> amplifier, such as that shown in Fig. VIII- 1, depends upon the coupling of the tube to the signal source. There exists an optimum coupling network for which the noise figure assumes a minimum value. This minimum value is then the greatest lower bound of the noise figure of such an amplifier. Similarly, for an amplifier using more than one tube, the noise figure will depend upon the interconnection of the tubes and the source. In general, for such an amplifier, the noise from any noise source reaches the output through more than one transmission path. Hence it seems possible that, through an appropriate interconnection of the tubes, cancellation effects among the transmissions through these paths {{may result in a}} very low noise figure; in particular, a noise figure lower than the greatest lower bound for the <b>one-tube</b> amplifier.

40|$|Interpretation of {{capillary}} electrophoresis results derived from multiplexed fluorochrome-labeled primer sets can be complicated by small peaks, {{which may be}} incorrectly interpreted as clonal T-cell receptor-γ gene rearrangements. In this report, different assay designs were used to illustrate how design may adversely affect specificity. Ten clinical cases, with subclonal peaks containing {{one of the two}} infrequently used joining genes, were identified with a tri-color, <b>one-tube</b> assay. The DNA was amplified with the same NED fluorochrome on all three joining primers, first combined (one-color assay) and then amplified separately using a single NED-labeled joining primer. The single primer assay design shows how insignificant peaks could easily be wrongly interpreted as clonal T-cell receptor-γ gene rearrangements. Next, the performance of the <b>one-tube</b> assay was compared with the two-tube BIOMED- 2 -based TCRG Gene Clonality Assay in a series of 44 cases. Whereas sensitivity was similar between the two methods (92. 9 % vs. 96. 4 %; P = 0. 55), specificity was significantly less in the BIOMED- 2 assay (87. 5 % vs. 56. 3 %; P = 0. 049) when a 2 × ratio was used to define clonality. Specificity was improved to 81. 3 % by the use of a 5 × peak height ratio (P = 0. 626).

40|$|Determination of {{retroviral}} load is {{an important}} tool {{in the investigation of}} the success of therapeutic or vaccination trials in patients infected with lentiviruses such as HIV, or with their simian (SIV) or feline (FIV) counterparts. We have developed an <b>one-tube</b> quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay based on the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (TaqMan) to quantify the viral load of FIV-infected cats. Two different primer/probe systems were designed to detect a broad range of clade A FIV isolates. Both systems are characterized by excellent reproducibility, high sensitivity, and a wide range of quantification. As a consequence of this improved precision in the quantitative RT-PCR, preassay variations have greater impact on the accuracy of the viral load estimation. To compensate for these variations, we improved the assay and developed a multiplex real-time RT-PCR, which allows simultaneous calculation of the viral copy number and the individual recovery rate in an <b>one-tube</b> reaction. This enables the rapid and accurate calculation of copy number independent of preassay variations. In further studies, two additional real-time RT-PCR assays were designed and used to investigate the influence of sequence variations in the binding regions for either the primers or probe. Sequence mismatches in this region had a significant effect (up to 4 logarithmic decades) on reaction efficiency. In view of the inherent variability of retroviral sequences, these results underline the necessity to check reaction efficiencies before determining viral load...|$|E

40|$|Amplification of a 3 -kb {{genome region}} from the RNA {{polymerase}} gene to the 3 ' poly(A) tail of small round-structured virus (SRSV) by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) {{has been difficult}} to achieve because of a stable secondary structure in a region between the RNA polymerase gene and the 5 ' end of the second open reading frame. We have developed a <b>one-tube</b> RT-PCR method to efficiently amplify this region. The method comprises three procedures: purification of poly(A) + RNA from a starting RNA solution by oligo(dT) 30 covalently linked to latex particles, buffer exchange, and continuous RT and PCR in a single tube containing all reaction components. The key elements of this method are (i) first-strand cDNA synthesis with the Superscript II version of RNase H- Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at 50 degrees C for 10 min by using the RNA-oligo(dT) 30 hybrid on the latex particles as the template and primer, and (ii) PCR by Taq and Pwo DNA polymerases mixed together with a mixture of 12 phased oligo(dT) 25 antisense primers. The detection threshold of the <b>one-tube</b> RT-PCR method was as little as 0. 2 ng of the crude RNA used as the source of the template.

To minimize the working time and the risk of carryover contamination during the multi-step procedure of PCR the multiplex real-time RT-PCR for the simultaneous detection of genogroup I (GI) and II (GII) offers advantages for the handling of large amounts of clinical specimens. Methods We have developed and evaluated a multiplex <b>one-tube</b> RT-PCR using a combination of optimized GI and GII specific primers located in the junction between ORF 1 and ORF 2 of the norovirus genome. For the detection of GI samples, a 3 '- minor groove binder-DNA probe (GI-MGB-probe) were designed and used for the multiplex real-time PCR. Results Comparable results to those of our in-house nested PCR and monoplex real-time-PCR were only obtained using the GI specific MGB-probe. The MGB-probe forms extremely stable duplexes with single-stranded DNA targets, which enabled us to design a shorter probe (length 15 nucleotides) hybridizing to a more conserved part of the GI sequences. 97 % of 100 previously norovirus positive specimens (tested by nested PCR and/or monoplex real-time PCR) were detected by the multiplex real-time PCR.

We further argue that the above ϕ_s dependence of the correlation structure can be understood in terms of <b>one-tube</b> model, as due to an interplay between the background elliptic flow caused by the initial state global geometry and the flow produced by fluctuations.

40|$|International audienceThe {{simultaneous}} {{detection of}} DNA from different potentially allergenic food ingredients by a ligation-dependent probe amplification (LPA) system is described. The approach allows {{the detection of}} several targets in a <b>one-tube</b> assay. Synthetic oligonucleotides were designed to detect DNA from peanut, cashew nut, pecan nut, pistachio nut, hazelnut, sesame seeds, macadamia nut, almond, walnut and brazil nut. The specificity of the system was tested with DNA from more than 50 plant and animal species. The sensitivity of the method was shown to be suitable to detect allergenic ingredients in the lower ppm range. The limit of detection (LOD) {{for the detection of}} single allergens in different food matrices was determined to 5 mg/kg. The novel analytical strategy represents a useful tool for the surveillance of the established legislation on food allergens in the European Union...|$|E
40|$|Non-peer-reviewedThe Laser-Doppler (LD) {{method is}} {{extensively}} used in clinical experiments for microcirculation measurement. The results of LD perfusion measurements depends on technical {{factors such as}} laser light wavelength, LD prob e arrangement, and signal processing algorithm. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the output of various signal processing algorithms (LDP) with the use of digital spectral analysis of the photodetector current. Comparison is made with the output of a commercial LD instrument (LDF). The results obtained using a simple <b>one-tube</b> physical model confirm that the best linearity of response of the LD instrument for changes of flow velocity is given by the algorithm based on first moment of power spectral density of AC component of photodetector's signal.
