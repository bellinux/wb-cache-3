One battalion on march NE of Ypres was practically wiped <b>out</b> <b>today</b> in attack by sixty aircraft. Withdrawal over open roads without adequate fighter support very costly.

Anna served as a victim advocate with the Collier County Sheriff’s Office and an outreach coordinator for the Immokalee Shelter for Abused Women in Collier County, Florida for 10 years. Her first human trafficking case developed from a “home visitation”, in where she was following up on a domestic violence incident.

Anna identified “red flags” that made her suspicious and eventually she helped get the victim <b>out.</b> <b>Today</b> the Tecum case has become a major case study by agencies including USDOJ, FSU, Croft Institute for International and New York Times.

500|$|The LFR {{navigation}} system required, at a minimum, only a simple AM radio receiver {{on board the}} aircraft to accurately navigate the airways under instrument meteorological conditions, and even execute an instrument approach to low minimums. On the downside, however, it had only four course directions per station, was sensitive to atmospheric {{and other types of}} interference and aberrations, and required pilots to listen for hours to an annoying monotonous beep, or a faint stream of Morse codes, often embedded in background [...] "static". Its eventual replacement, the VHF band VOR {{navigation system}}, had many advantages. The VOR was virtually immune to interference, had 360 available course directions, had a visual [...] "on course" [...] display (with no listening needed), and was far easier to use. Consequently, when the VOR system became available in the early 1950s its acceptance was rapid, and within a decade the LFR was mostly phased out. VOR itself is gradually being phased <b>out</b> <b>today</b> in favor of the far superior Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|E

Deborah Evans-Price of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars, commenting that [...] "With this new set, [...] Hall and his companions again deliver songs that are musically engaging and lyrically insightful... Few acts more eloquently capture the complexities of being a Christian in today’s tumultuous world, but these fine folks continue to help light the path for the rest of us". Jennifer E. Jones of cbnmusic.com gave it four out of five spins, opining that [...] "There’s a reason why Casting Crowns {{is one of the best}} Christian bands <b>out</b> <b>today,</b> and that reason is evident when you listen to The Altar and The Door. After three albums, lead singer/songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot... The Altar and The Door leaves plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus". Mark Lawrence of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, saying [...] "Traditionally album number three is a defining point in a band's legacy: some bands self implode and produce an album high on production sheen but low on song quality... other bands though go on to produce their masterpiece... The Altar and the Door leans closer to the masterpiece than the flop but leaves you with a sense that they have even greater things to come... The Altar And The Door' is clearly a Casting Crowns album in sound, content and style but this is far from being a negative thing and will appeal to both existing fans as well as draw in new ones". Brian Mansfield gave it two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that [...] " [...] concern themselves with the space between the title’s two fixtures– that is, between intention and action, between doing good and getting in the way, or, as one song puts it, between “the God we want and the God who is.” That’s a space worth exploring, and the band’s motives may be the best, but their anthems are as predictable as a televangelist’s tears: start soft, build big, then cue the strings".|$|E

2500|$|However, the praise, and in {{particular}} the labeling of the book as a Chicana/o text, has not been uncontested. Problematic especially to literary scholars who identify as Chicanos has been the fact that Caballero is coauthored—by a Mexican-American woman in partnership with an Anglo-American woman—thus calling into question the text's authenticity. Critics have also been troubled by González's own aristocratic heritage and her association with J. Frank Dobie, whose [...] "paternalist attitude" [...] toward heritage Mexicans is much maligned. [...] In her defense of the novel, Cotera acknowledges that the [...] "politics of its production" [...] complicate our ability to classify it as either a [...] "Chicana/o" [...] or [...] "feminist" [...] text, but that it nevertheless warrants study. In similar fashion, literary historian Andrea R. Purdy writes: [...] "Regardless of her motives, [...] choices provide an interesting forum for further discussion and analysis".
