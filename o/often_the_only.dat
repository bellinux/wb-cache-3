5|$|Less {{expensive}} cloth paintings (tüchlein) {{were more}} common in middle-class households, and records show {{a strong interest in}} domestically owned religious panel paintings. Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter. Alterations varied from having individualised panels added to a prefabricated pattern, to the inclusion of a donor portrait. The addition of coats-of-arms were <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> change – an addition seen in van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, which exists in several variations.|$|E

For what she has really suffered, there is never a sober night that I do not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. In an odd way, perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)...

5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E

5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue.

5|$|Shirley Williams's {{political}} career (the House of Commons regularly sat until 10 pm) {{meant that the}} couple {{spent a lot of}} time apart. They bought a house in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, near the border with north Cambridgeshire, while she lived in Phillimore Place during the week to be close to the Houses of Parliament. Sunday was <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> day they were together. The differences in their personal values– he was an atheist, she a Catholic– placed a further strain on their relationship. It reached breaking point in 1970 when Williams formed a relationship with Patricia Law Skinner, a commissioning editor for Cambridge University Press and wife of the historian Quentin Skinner. She had approached Williams to write the opposing view of utilitarianism for Utilitarianism: For and Against with J. J. C. Smart (1973), and they had fallen in love.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, the bowmouth {{guitarfish}} {{is caught}} incidentally or intentionally by artisanal and commercial fisheries using trawls, gillnets, and line gear. The fins are extremely valuable {{due to their}} use in shark fin soup, and are <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> parts of the fish kept and brought to market. However, the meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted, and it is highly esteemed in India. When caught as bycatch in trawls, the bowmouth guitarfish is considered a nuisance because its strength and rough skin {{make it difficult to}} handle, and as the heavy ray thrashes in the net it can damage the rest of the catch. In Thailand, the enlarged thorns of this species are used to make bracelets.|$|E

5|$|Veracruz is {{the most}} {{dangerous}} place in Mexico for journalists; at least nine journalists have been killed since Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa took office in 2010, many of them by the Los Zetas drug cartel. Most of these reporters were killed under unclear circumstances, and few arrests have been made in their respective investigations. Given the high levels of corruption, criminal impunity, and drug-related attacks against the press all across Veracruz, many local journalists have decided to leave the state and relocate in other parts of Mexico. The atmosphere in Veracruz has also forced many media outlets to self-censor and stop reporting on the drug violence. With traditional reporting being too dangerous and intimidating, social media and blogs are <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> outlets for reporting serious crimes.|$|E

25|$|Urban poverty {{encourages}} {{the formation and}} demand for slums. With rapid shift from rural to urban life, poverty migrates to urban areas.
