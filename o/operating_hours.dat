5|$|All {{stations}} except Chester {{connect to}} surface TTC bus and/or streetcar routes during regular <b>operating</b> <b>hours.</b> Such connections involve a transfer, {{which is a}} free supplementary ticket, obtained {{at the point of}} entering the transit system, allowing the rider to transfer to another route, or a fare-paid terminal, which is an area within an interchange only accessible to holders of valid tickets or tokens.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, the power stations' <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> were {{decreased}} due {{to the opening of}} the much larger Blyth power station in Northumberland. This meant that less ash was produced by the Stella and Dunston stations; so {{by the end of the}} 1960s, the CEGB sold Hexhamshire Lass and Bobby Shaftoe. The former went to a firm in Fareham, Hampshire, where it worked as a sand dredger until scrapped in 1993; the latter to a French dredging company.|$|E
5|$|BART service begins around 4:00 am on weekdays, 6:00 am on Saturdays, and 8:00 am on Sundays. Service ends {{every day}} near midnight with station closings timed {{to the last}} train at station. Two of the five lines, the Warm Springs/South Fremont–Daly City and Richmond–Daly City/Millbrae lines, do not have evening (after ~6:00p.m. and ~9:00p.m., respectively) or Sunday service, but all {{stations}} remain accessible by transfer from the other lines. The Coliseum–Oakland International Airport AGT line runs every 6 minutes, with approximately the same <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> as the five rapid transit lines.|$|E

5|$|A {{decreased}} budget led to Nokomis {{losing its}} Saturday <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> in 2004. The Nokomis East Neighborhood Association, Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, {{and members of}} the community subsequently put funds towards keeping the library open on Saturdays until in mid-2005 when money was reallocated in the budget for continued Saturday operation. Further budget woes continued to plague the Minneapolis Public Libraries as of early 2007, by which point the system had had to temporarily close three different branches in part due to a loss of local government aid. A merger with the Hennepin County Libraries was approved by both systems' boards along with the Minneapolis City Council and Nokomis reopened at 10 am on January 2, 2008, as a Hennepin County Library. It remained the only building in the newly expanded 41-library system to be named for a fictional character.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen {{to live in the}} dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis.|$|E
5|$|The DSTT is {{open for}} 20 hours on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5:00am to 1:00am the {{following}} day, and for 18 hours on Sundays, from 6:00am to midnight. At {{the time of its}} opening in 1990, the Metro Bus Tunnel only operated from 5:00am to 7:00pm on weekdays and 10:00am to 6:00pm on Saturdays, with no Sunday service; the <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> were temporarily extended into weekday nights from 1998 to 2000 {{at the request of the}} Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Mariners, but were cut after the passage of Initiative 695 and subsequent loss of motor vehicle excise tax revenue. Preparations for Link light rail service restored late-night and full weekend hours for the tunnel, introduced in June 2009 after Sound Transit Express route 550 moved all of its trips into the tunnel.|$|E
3000|$|SimBa {{creates an}} upward and {{downward}} regulation list of bids {{based on the}} marginal cost function, bidding price and production capacity for each unit. Due to the uncertain nature of wind, the wind power within the <b>operating</b> <b>hour</b> cannot {{be the same as}} its estimated value, thus it can create power imbalance within the <b>operating</b> <b>hour.</b> This imbalance is partially compensated by FRR, i.e., through the activation of additional regulating bids in the control room from the NOIS list and with an AGC which has reserved capacity of ± 90 MW, and it acts on the border of Western Denmark with Germany [7]. However, for the present investigation, it is assumed that the power imbalance within the <b>operating</b> <b>hour</b> is controlled only through AGC, by providing ΔP [...] SET [...] to the conventional power plant (i.e., centralised combined heat and power plant (CHP)) as a secondary response. ΔP [...] SET [...] represents the required change in the participating generating power set points in the imbalanced area.|$|R

5|$|With closer {{proximity}} to schools, more parking, and double {{the availability of}} shelf space, the village purchased the former station for $12,500 ($ today) and leased the building and its acre of land to the library. The library required $20,500 ($ today) for purchasing and renovating the building; it raised $14,000 ($ today) from village residents, with the remainder funded by the village board. On April 19, 1959, the refurbished building was dedicated and the village board named the street {{that led to the}} library Library Road. With its own space, the library increased its collection, hired more staff, and doubled its <b>operating</b> <b>hours.</b> Also in 1959, the library received its absolute charter, and transferred the charter in 1964 from a free library association to a fully tax-supported public library and thus changed its name from the Briarcliff Free Library to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library.|$|E

This will be extended to Lines 3, 4, 6, and 11 to 13 by July 1, 2017. By the end of 2018, all the stations in the city center will extend their <b>operating</b> <b>hours</b> after midnight.|$|E

30|$|A set of {{simulations}} {{has been}} carried out to illustrate the performance of the power system model on the focus of active power balanced control. The simulations are performed using the time series for generation, load and power exchange generated by HA power balancing model (SimBa) for the Danish power system and are the assumptions for the year 2020 based on the real data from the year 2009. The conventional generation and the power exchange are using HA time series, while WPP generates the available wind power. Power imbalance appears within the <b>operating</b> <b>hour,</b> if HA wind power forecast {{is not the same as}} available wind power. This imbalance is compensated by AGC and by activating the regulating bids from CHPs within the <b>operating</b> <b>hour</b> by an algorithm (rolling balance), developed for this study.|$|R
