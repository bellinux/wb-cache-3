5|$|A review makes {{reference}} {{to a number of}} studies that show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks.

40|$|The central {{topic of}} this thesis {{focuses on the}} {{accommodation}} <b>of</b> fuzzy <b>spatial</b> objects in a GIS. Several issues are discussed theoretically and practically, including the definition <b>of</b> fuzzy <b>spatial</b> objects, the topological relations between them, the modeling <b>of</b> fuzzy <b>spatial</b> objects, the generation <b>of</b> fuzzy <b>spatial</b> objects and the utilization <b>of</b> fuzzy <b>spatial</b> objects for land cover changes...|$|R

5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling <b>of</b> <b>spatial</b> depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|Essai is {{considered}} the first complete treatise on economics, with numerous contributions to the science. These contributions include: his cause and effect methodology, monetary theories, his conception of the entrepreneur as a risk-bearer, and the development <b>of</b> <b>spatial</b> economics. Cantillon's Essai had significant influence on the early development of political economy, including the works of Adam Smith, Anne Turgot, Jean-Baptiste Say, Frédéric Bastiat and François Quesnay.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies by}} Rasmussen and her {{international}} colleagues {{looked at the}} importance of energy availability, and a 2007 paper showed that global patterns <b>of</b> <b>spatial</b> turnover are driven principally by widespread species rather than restricted ones. This complements other work, and helps to establish a unified model of how terrestrial biodiversity varies both within and between the Earth's major land masses.|$|E
30|$|A {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted to examine the theoretical impacts <b>of</b> using <b>spatial</b> neighbourhoods constrained by terrain. When a broad phenomenon, such as terrain, influences the mean <b>of</b> a <b>spatial</b> process, landscapes exhibit first-order non-stationarity and violate the assumption <b>of</b> most <b>spatial</b> statistics (Kabos and Csillag 2002). The aim of the simulation is to examine the impact of accounting for terrain constraints when doing spatial analysis on point patterns that exhibit first-order non-stationarity.|$|R

5|$|Plants {{depend on}} certain edaphic (soil) and climatic factors in their {{environment}} but can modify these factors too. For example, they can change their environment's albedo, increase runoff interception, stabilise mineral soils and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants compete with other organisms in their ecosystem for resources. They interact with their neighbours at a variety <b>of</b> <b>spatial</b> scales in groups, populations and communities that collectively constitute vegetation. Regions with characteristic vegetation types and dominant plants as well as similar abiotic and biotic factors, climate, and geography make up biomes like tundra or tropical rainforest.|$|E
5|$|Sustainability {{measurement}} is a {{term that}} denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability. The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are evolving: they include indicators, benchmarks, audits, sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic, indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems. They are applied {{over a wide range}} <b>of</b> <b>spatial</b> and temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|Two {{proposed}} {{forms for}} dark energy are the cosmological constant, a constant energy density filling space homogeneously, and scalar {{fields such as}} quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually {{also included in the}} cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy. Scalar fields having only a slight amount <b>of</b> <b>spatial</b> inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant.|$|E

40|$|The {{representation}} <b>of</b> complex <b>spatial</b> domains {{in conventional}} databases suffers from fragmented representation of object structure, lack <b>of</b> instance-level <b>spatial</b> relationships, and {{the generation of}} large combinatoric search spaces in query analysis. The deductive capabilities provided by a deductive database offer some assistance in solving these problems, in particular by enabling spatial reasoning to be performed by a Geographic Information System (GIS). Deduction in the database is used to support the natural representation <b>of</b> complex <b>spatial</b> object structures in single and multi-layered Geographic DataBases (GDB), inference <b>of</b> implicit <b>spatial</b> relationships, and the manipulation <b>of</b> multiple resolution <b>spatial</b> representations. In addition, deductive capabilities are shown to be essential for automatic data input and update in a GDB. Coupled with appropriate structural representation, spatial reasoning is an important tool for the realization of an effective GDB. 1 [...] ...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that women tend to rely more on visual {{information}} than men in a number <b>of</b> <b>spatial</b> tasks related to perceived orientation. However, 'visual dependence' {{has been found to be}} task specific and not a general characteristic <b>of</b> <b>spatial</b> processing that differs between the sexes. Here an alternative hypothesis suggests that heightened visual dependence in females does not generalize to all aspects <b>of</b> <b>spatial</b> processing but is probably attributable to task-specific differences in how male and females brains process multisensory spatial information.|$|E
