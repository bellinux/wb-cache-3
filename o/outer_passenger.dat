5000|$|In 1972, {{the first}} SR.N4s were {{temporarily}} withdrawn for conversion to Mk.II specification which would provide for seven further car spaces and 28 more passengers. The {{first of the}} enlarged craft, the Swift, entered service {{at the beginning of}} February 1973. The capacity increase was achieved by removing an inner passenger cabin in order to accommodate the extra cars and widening the <b>outer</b> <b>passenger</b> cabin: this was achieved without changing the overall footprint of the craft. New aircraft-style forward-facing seats created an atmosphere of enhanced sophistication, and a redesigned skirt was intended to reduce window spray, enhancing the view out for passengers, and to give a smoother ride in rough seas: contemporary reports nevertheless commented on the [...] "unsprung" [...] nature of the ride.|$|E

50|$|The British Rail Class 302 (pre-TOPS AM2) was {{a type of}} {{electric}} multiple unit (EMU) introduced between 1958 - 1960 for <b>outer</b> suburban <b>passenger</b> services on the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway route. This class of multiple unit was constructed using the Mark 1 bodyshell and was slam-door.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} {{equipped}} by two <b>outer</b> platforms for <b>passenger</b> service, served {{only by the}} local trains RB10 (in 2014: Berlin Hauptbahnhof - Jungfernheide - Nauen) and RB14 (Senftenberg-Nauen). The regional express trains do not call here.|$|R
50|$|Baypointe {{station is}} {{differentiated}} from other VTA light rail stations as it features three tracks and two island platforms. When Baypointe {{was used as}} a transfer station from 1999 to 2005, light rail vehicles on the line that terminates at Baypointe would stop and reverse direction on the center track, while the vehicles on other line would use the two <b>outer</b> tracks. <b>Passengers</b> could make a cross platform transfer with either line in any direction.|$|R
25|$|Trimeric autotransporter adhesins have {{a unique}} {{structure}}. The structure they hold is crucial to their function. They all {{appear to have a}} head-stalk-anchor structure. Each TAA is made up of three identical proteins, hence the name trimeric. Once the membrane anchor has been inserted into the <b>outer</b> membrane, the <b>passenger</b> domain passes through it into the host extracellular environment autonomously, hence the description of autotransporter. The head domain, once assembled, then adheres to an element of the host extracellular matrix, for example, collagen, fibronectin, etc.|$|R
50|$|The route was {{initially}} {{used only for}} freight. Briefly, in the late 1930s, there were services carrying factory workers to the Daimler-Benz armaments factory in the Genshagener Heide area. In the mid-1950s, passenger services started on the line. It was first served by some express and semi-fast passenger trains from East Berlin towards Dessau and there were also passenger trains on the section from Genshagener Heide to Michendorf, some continuing to Belzig. At times, up to about 1970, the section from Genshagener Heide to Großbeeren and continuing to Teltow was served by some trains during the peak hour because, on the one hand, the Ludwigsfelde car factory had been built near Genshagener Heide station and, on the other hand, it gave a connection towards Berlin. With {{the completion of the}} <b>Outer</b> Ring, <b>passenger</b> trains to Potsdam no longer stopped in Michendorf. Bergholz station provided an interchange with services to Michendorf. Some express trains from Berlin to Dessau continued to use the section between Saarmund and Michendorf.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, GM {{made its}} [...] "Air Cushion Restraint System" [...] (ACRS) {{available}} as a regular production option (RPO code AR3) in full-size Cadillacs, Buick and Oldsmobile models. The GM cars from the 1970s equipped with ACRS had a driver-side airbag, a driver-side knee restraint (which consists of a padded lower dashboard), and a passenger-side airbag. The passenger-side airbag protects both front passengers and unlike most newer ones, it integrated a knee cushion and a torso cushion, and it also had dual stage deployment which varied depending on {{the force of the}} impact. The cars equipped with ACRS had lap belts for all seating positions but they did not have shoulder belts. Shoulder belts were already mandatory equipment in the United States on closed cars without airbags for the driver and <b>outer</b> front <b>passenger</b> seating positions, but GM chose to market its airbags as a substitute for shoulder belts. Prices for this option on Cadillac models were USD$225 in 1974, USD$300 in 1975, and USD$340 in 1976.|$|R
50|$|In April 2012, Metro Trains {{acknowledged}} {{the practice of}} altering stopping condition of selected late-running trains (for example, stopping all station to express) {{in an attempt to}} make up lost time (thus meeting the Operational Performance Regime set by the State Government of Victoria). It has also been reported that selected services have terminated (turnaround) ahead of timetabled destination, forcing passengers to change in mid-journey. Metro Trains make these changes throughout the day, including peak hours. It claim such is for the greater good, however such can be very inconvenient to <b>outer</b> suburban <b>passengers,</b> who are forced to wait up to an hour between services. These come after Metro Trains failed to meet punctuality target in February 2012 and March 2012. It has been reported that the incidence of altered services has become more frequent since the introduction of the network wide new timetables on 22 April. Reportedly, at least 129 drivers' incident reports from mid-April to May record services that have been altered in the form of changing a stopping-all-stations to express or terminating a service early.|$|R
5000|$|The Las Colinas APT was envisioned as an {{automated}} circulator {{system for the}} developing Las Colinas Urban Center. The long range plan called {{for a total of}} 5 miles (8 km) of dual lane guideway and 20 stations. The system was to contain 3 inner loops and one <b>outer</b> loop, with <b>passengers</b> transferring between loops at four key interchanges. The community of Las Colinas was founded in 1973, but construction of the APT did not begin until 1979. The first phase construction contained 1.4 mi of guideway and 4 stations. ( [...] , Phase 1 remains the only fully constructed and operational track: see Current Operation for more details.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Function: The {{function}} of the [...] is to aid {{the movement of the}} polypeptide chain through the cell membrane, a process known as autotransport activity. The way TAAs translocate across the outer membrane remains to be elucidated, but it is thought that it translocates inside the beta-barrel, leading to transportation of the passenger domain from the C terminus to the N terminus through the beta-barrel lumen. In essence, the beta-barrel is a porin that sits within the bacterial <b>outer</b> membrane. The <b>passenger</b> domain or in other words coiled-coil stalk domain translocates through this pore. Additional functions of the membrane anchor is to oligomerise the stalk domain and to anchor the whole protein to the bacterial outer membrane.|$|R
50|$|Secretion of {{polypeptide}} chains {{through the}} outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria can occur via {{a number of}} different pathways. The type V(a), or autotransporter, secretion pathway constitutes the largest number of secreted virulence factors of any one of the seven known types of secretion in Gram-negative bacteria. This secretion pathway is exemplified by the prototypical IgA1 Protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The protein is directed to the inner membrane by a signal peptide transported across the inner membrane via the Sec machinery. Once in the periplasm, the autotransporter domain inserts into the <b>outer</b> membrane. The <b>passenger</b> domain is passed {{through the center of the}} autotransporter domain to be presented on the outside of the cell, however the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear.|$|R
50|$|Tiffin {{was born}} in Carlisle. After leaving Bishop Creighton School, he became a clerk on the London and North Western Railway, he joined the Foot Guards when the First World War broke out, later {{transferring}} to the Royal Artillery. He was wounded and invalided home, where army doctors advised him to find a more active occupation than his previous office job {{in order to improve}} his health. In 1919, therefore, he became a bus driver for the London General Omnibus Company. A trade unionist since 1912, he joined the Transport and General Workers' Union and rose rapidly through the ranks. In 1930, he was given the job of organising the workers on the company's new Green Line services throughout London and the Home counties and two years later he became a full-time union officer as <b>Outer</b> London <b>Passenger</b> Organiser. In 1940 he became the Area Organiser of Area No.1 (London and South East). He also served for seven years as chairman of the London Trades Council, struggling in vain against its domination by Communists (which eventually led to its disbandment by the Trades Union Congress (TUC)), and for four years as chairman of the London Labour Party. During the Second World War he commanded a Home Guard battalion and was TUC representative on the Territorial Army Advisory Committee.|$|R
5000|$|... == History == The {{station was}} opened in 1974 and {{consists}} of a mezzanine and two island platforms with four rail tracks. Before 2008, the station also offered two side platforms on the <b>outer</b> tracks, so <b>passengers</b> could (de)board on both sides. This {{was due to the}} fact that the station was also used by single ended tram cars, so each track had to have a platform on the right. To gain accessibility, the platforms for the trains from and to Dom/Hbf had to be elevated, as high-floor cars operate on this route. However, the other tracks, leading to the Ringe tunnel, are, only used by low-floor cars, so the island platforms were split in the middle into a low and a high side. Therefore, the platforms were widened, using the space by the former outer platforms which thus were removed.|$|R
40|$|The {{immunoglobulin}} A protease {{family of}} secreted proteins {{are derived from}} self-translocating polyprotein precursors which contain C-terminal domains promoting the translocation of the N-terminally attached passenger domains across gram-negative bacterial outer membranes. Computer predictions identified the C-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli adhesin involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA-I) {{as a member of}} the autotransporter family. A model of the beta-barrel structure, proposed to be responsible for outer membrane translocation, served as a basis for the construction of fusion proteins containing heterologous passengers. Autotransporter-mediated surface display (autodisplay) was investigated for the cholera toxin B subunit and the peptide antigen tag PEYFK. Up to 5 % of total cellular protein was detectable in the <b>outer</b> membrane as <b>passenger</b> autotransporter fusion protein synthesized under control of the constitutive P(TK) promoter. Efficient presentation of the passenger domains was demonstrated in the outer membrane protease T-deficient (ompT) strain E. coli UT 5600 and the ompT dsbA double mutant JK 321. Surface exposure was ascertained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence microscopy, and immunogold electron microscopy using antisera specific for the passenger domains. In strain UT 2300 (ompT+), the passenger domains were released from the cell surface by the OmpT protease at a novel specific cleavage site, R / V. Autodisplay represents a useful tool for future protein translocation studies with interesting biotechnological possibilities...|$|R
40|$|As {{with all}} {{classical}} monomeric autotransporters, IgA protease of Neisseria meningitidis is a modular protein consisting of an N-terminal signal sequence, a passenger domain and a C-terminal translocator domain (TD) that assists in the secretion {{of the passenger}} domain across the <b>outer</b> membrane. The <b>passenger</b> of IgA protease consists of three separate domains: the protease domain, the gamma-peptide and the alpha-peptide that contains nuclear localization signals (NLSs). The protease domain is released into the extracellular milieu either via autocatalytic processing or via cleavage by another autotransporter, NalP, expression of which is phase-variable. NalP-mediated cleavage results in {{the release of a}} passenger that includes the alpha- and gamma-peptides. Here, we studied the fate of the alpha-peptide when NalP was not expressed and observed strain-dependent differences. In meningococcal strains where the alpha-peptide contained a single NLS, the alpha-peptide remained covalently attached to the TD and was detected at the cell surface. In other strains, the alpha-peptide contained four NLSs and was separated from the TD by an IgA protease autoproteolytic cleavage site. In many of those cases, the alpha-peptide was found non-covalently associated with the cells as a separate polypeptide. The cell surface association of the alpha-peptides may be relevant physiologically. We report a novel function for the alpha-peptide, i. e. the binding of heparin - an immune-modulatory molecule that in the host is found in the extracellular matrix and connected to cell surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to improve the surface quality of highly {{reinforced}} polymer composites {{in order to make}} these materials applicable to the painted exterior of passenger cars. For the evaluation of the application sector of automotive exterior components, a catalogue of requirements was drawn up from technical specifications, internal standards, and legal requirements. Components in the horizontal decorative section of the outer skin, like front hood, boot lid, and roof, have to fulfil the highest optical and structural requirements. A survey of the automobile market concerning applications of fibre reinforced plastics in the exterior of cars showed {{the state of the art}} and certain tendencies. So far, only non-reinforced, short-fiber- or random-fiber-reinforced plastics have been able to fulfil the high surface requirements. Up to now, high material prices, the lack of mass production concepts, and insufficient surface quality have prohibited serial applications of CFRP in the <b>outer</b> skin of <b>passenger</b> cars. Therefore, different manufacturing technologies for exterior components in composites were examined and compared in an overview of processes. The process of resin transfer moulding (RTM) was identified to have great potential for serial production because of its achievable surface quality together with high specific mechanical properties of the composites. The goal of the current research was to find optimized combinations of materials, processes, and coatings, in order to realize a Class-A surface quality for CFRP parts in the RTM process. The main problem with the surface quality is the print-through of the reinforcement caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of the reinforcing fibres and the chemical and thermal shrinkage of the matrix material during processing.

Therefore, different manufacturing technologies for exterior components in composites were examined and compared in an overview of processes. The process of resin transfer moulding (RTM) was identified to have great potential for serial production:because of its achievable suriace quality together with high specific mechanical properties of 1 he composites. The goal of the current research was to find optimized combinations of materials, processes, and coatings, in order to realize a Class-A suriace quality for CFRP parts in the RTM process. The main problem with the suriace quality is the print-through of the reinforcement caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of the reinforcing fibres and the chemical and thermal shrinkage of the matrix material during processing. In order to periom a systematic investigation of the composite materials, the process parameters, and surtace treatments, an experimental RTM tool with a plate cavity was designed and produced in the suriace quality standard of a serial tool. Within the material optimization the comparison of five epoxy resins showed that the system 82 was the most promising for further investigations with regard to surface quality and cycle time. Within the comparison of the fibre reinforcements, the woven fabrics displayed a minor surface quality compared to the non-woven and non-crimp fabrics. lt was found out that multiaxial stitched fabrics with optimized placement technique, texturized, multifilament stitching yarns, and trikot-franse stitching pattern currently provide the best combination of surface quality and processability, Even better surface results were achieved with non-crimp fabrics that are fixed by an adhesive to a polyester mesh. However, the difficult processing and infiltration with matrix material still provide a hurdle to a possible serial application. As a result of the investigation, one type of randomly oriented cut glass mat with minimal fibre diameter and even fibre distribution was preferred as a core material to the commonly used continuous strand mats. Within the great variety of different surface veils, a few types could be identified to offer an effective reduction of long term waviness (from LW> 20 to LW 35 to SW 35 and strong fibre marking over the whole surtace. With the combination of optimization results, sample plates with LW< 5 could be produced. A visual evaluation could not determine any regular, oriented surface texture. The presented work showed solutions in material-process-coating-combinations and development potential to reach the required Class-A surface quality of automobile exterior parts with advanced composites. This provides the necessary foundation for further developments with the aim of a serial application...|$|R
