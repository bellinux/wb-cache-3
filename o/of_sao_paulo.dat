5|$|Expansion on {{the campus}} {{continued}} rapidly, with new buildings, institutes and expansions being added nearly every year. But by the late 1970s, the university faced a crisis.

In parallel, a medical school was being planned in Campinas, a demand from the local population that dated from the early 1940s. The School of Medicine of Campinas was created by law in 1959, but actual implementation never took place.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals did {{not take}} their loss of power gracefully. In May and June 1842, three uprisings broke out, in the provinces <b>of</b> <b>São</b> <b>Paulo,</b> Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. The rebels {{went so far as}} to arrest and hold hostage both Honório Hermeto's elderly father and uncle (who was also his father-in-law). As president, he {{commanded}} the provincial National Guard, and traveled through the province to organize a response. On 1 July, he advanced with troops towards Ouro Preto, where, after defeating the rebels, he freed his father and uncle. He joined forces there with Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then-Baron and later Duke of Caxias), who commanded the National Guard <b>of</b> <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> and Minas Gerais and was also married to one of Honório Hermeto's distant cousins. The remaining rebels were easily defeated, and by late August, the uprisings had been quelled. Among the rebel leaders was the former regent, Feijó, who was arrested. He died shortly afterwards in 1843. As Honório Hermeto returned from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro, he was welcomed with celebrations and demonstrations of joy by the authorities and populace of the districts he traversed.|$|E
5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, is the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University <b>of</b> <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, is expected to increase in line with inflation. This situation is aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E

5|$|During the Brazilian Revolution of 1930, Bahia {{served with}} Rio Grande do Sul—until that ship defected—and {{five or six}} destroyers {{off the coast of}} Santa Catarina; they were once again {{commanded}} by Belford Gomes. Two years later, when the state <b>of</b> <b>São</b> <b>Paulo</b> rebelled in the Constitutionalist Revolution, Bahia—under the command of Frigate Captain Lucas Alexandre Boiteux—and other vessels blockaded the rebel-held port of Santos. Bahia was under repair from 1934 into 1935. In November 1935, Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul sailed to Natal, the capital of Rio Grande do Norte, to lend support against another rebellion. As part of their mission, they were ordered to sink the steamship Santos on sight, as several escaping leaders of the revolution were on board.|$|E

The Stammers had a falling out with Mengele in late 1974 and {{bought a house}} in São Paulo; Mengele was not invited. The Stammers bought a bungalow in the Eldorado neighbourhood <b>of</b> <b>São</b> <b>Paulo,</b> which they rented out to Mengele.

The rector serves for a term of 4 years before a new election is held, and can not be reelected in the following term. Zeferino Vaz was the first rector and held the position for 12 years until his mandatory retirement.|$|E

5|$|Unicamp is {{responsible}} for around 15% of Brazilian research, a disproportionately high number when compared to much larger and older institutions in the country such as the University <b>of</b> <b>São</b> <b>Paulo.</b> It also produces more patents than any other research organization in Brazil, being {{second only to the}} state-owned oil company, Petrobras. Multiple international university rankings place it amongst the best universities in the world, with QS placing it in the Top 200 globally and ranking it the 11th best university under 50 years, and in 2015 it was rated as the best university in the country by Brazil's Ministry of Education.|$|E
5|$|Honório Hermeto {{pursued a}} typical course open to 19th century Brazilians who became {{affluent}} through family connections and patronage: a judicial career, with expectations of entering politics. On 14 October 1826, {{he was named}} to a three-year term as juiz de fora (external judge) with jurisdiction over the three villages in the province <b>of</b> <b>São</b> <b>Paulo.</b> On 25 August 1828, Honório Hermeto left São Paulo upon being promoted to the post of auditor da marinha (admiralty judge) in Rio de Janeiro, the imperial capital located {{in the province of}} same name. His tenure in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro helped expand his connections. Emperor Dom PedroI appointed him ouvidor (superior judge) in late 1828 and desembargador (regional appeal judge) in 1829, an office Honório Hermeto held until his retirement in 1848.|$|E
5|$|However, once {{he learned}} that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his {{relationship}} to Domitila.

He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children and provided a much needed sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.|$|E
