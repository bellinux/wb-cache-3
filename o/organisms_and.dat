5|$|Aside {{from the}} large numbers of organisms {{actually}} consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E

5|$|Biostratigraphy, {{the use of}} fossils to {{work out}} the chronological order in which rocks were formed, is useful to both paleontologists and geologists. Biogeography studies the spatial {{distribution}} of <b>organisms,</b> <b>and</b> is also linked to geology, which explains how Earth's geography has changed over time.|$|E
5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Evolution {{is change}} in the {{heritable}} characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Evolutionary processes give rise to biodiversity {{at every level of}} biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual <b>organisms,</b> <b>and</b> molecules.|$|E

50|$|In the adaptationist view of evolution, the {{organism}} {{is a function}} of both the <b>organism</b> <b>and</b> environment, while the environment is only a function of itself. The environment is seen as autonomous and unshaped by {{the organism}}. Lewontin instead believed in a constructivist view, in which the organism {{is a function of}} the <b>organism</b> <b>and</b> environment, with the environment being a function of the <b>organism</b> <b>and</b> environment as well. This means that the organism shapes the environment as the environment shapes the organism. The organism shapes the environment for future generations.|$|R

Assemblages bearing Kimberella often also bear fossils of Andiva, Yorgia, Dickinsonia, Tribrachidium and Charniodiscus, suggesting that it lived alongside these organisms.|$|E
5|$|The ENA {{has grown}} out of the EMBL Data Library which was {{released}} in 1982 as the first internationally supported resource for nucleotide sequence data. As of early 2012, the ENA and other INSDC member databases each contained complete genomes of 5,682 <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> sequence data for almost 700,000.|$|E
5|$|Archaea are prokaryotic {{unicellular}} <b>organisms,</b> <b>and</b> {{form the}} first domain of life, in Carl Woese's three-domain system. A prokaryote {{is defined as}} having no cell nucleus or other membrane bound-organelle. Archaea share this defining feature with the bacteria {{with which they were}} once grouped. In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, and thereby split the prokaryote domain.|$|E

5|$|Biogeography (an {{amalgamation}} {{of biology}} and geography) is the {{comparative study of}} the geographic distribution of <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, the theory of island biogeography, published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 {{is considered one of}} the fundamentals of ecological theory.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} element {{in the human body}} and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role in}} the physiology and biochemistry of <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a second messenger, in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, prokaryotes were {{regarded}} as a single group of <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. For example, microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls, their shapes, and the substances they consume. In 1965, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling proposed instead using the sequences of the genes in different prokaryotes to work out how they are related to each other. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today.|$|E

5|$|In {{the form}} of {{chloride}} ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living <b>organisms,</b> <b>and</b> artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils {{as part of the}} immune response against bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E
5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> are the second {{arm of the}} innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E

5|$|Microbes are {{important}} in human culture and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods, treat sewage, produce fuel, enzymes and other bioactive compounds. They are essential tools in biology as model <b>organisms,</b> <b>and</b> have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. They are a vital component of fertile soils. In the human body microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora. They are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases, and as such are the target of hygiene measures.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act {{at different}} levels of organisation, such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> species. Selection can act at multiple levels simultaneously. An example of selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons, which can replicate and spread throughout a genome. Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, may allow the evolution of cooperation, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Other {{proteins}} that serve structural functions are motor proteins such as myosin, kinesin, and dynein, which {{are capable of}} generating mechanical forces. These proteins are crucial for cellular motility of single celled <b>organisms</b> <b>and</b> the sperm of many multicellular organisms which reproduce sexually. They also generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles and play essential roles in intracellular transport.|$|E
