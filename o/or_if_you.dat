Using the secondary shift, you may only type one <b>or</b> (<b>if</b> <b>you</b> use it simultaneously with the normal shift key) two additional letters with each key, whereas using a dead key, a specific diacritic can be attached to a number of different base letters.|$|E
25|$|Niggle's yearnings after {{truth and}} beauty (God's creations) are echoed in his great painting; after death, Niggle is rewarded with the {{realisation}} (the making-real) of his yearning. <b>Or,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> prefer, Niggle's Tree always existed – he simply echoed {{it in his}} art. From a metanarrative viewpoint, Tolkien's Arda is itself a subcreation designed to honour the true stories of the real world.

25|$|The stadium {{has created}} an in stadium app {{designed}} specifically for home football games for the 49ers to provide a better fan experience for fans and guests. The app can be downloaded for free off of the App Store and Google Play. Features are limited on non football game days <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are outside {{the vicinity of the}} stadium. However, when having the app within the stadium on game and event days you have many options including in-seat delivery, live streaming, navigation and much more. The app can be extended to other events hosted by the stadium if the third party would like to include its features for their guests.|$|E

2500|$|The band also {{revealed}} that within their concept album trilogy, Holy Wood serves as prequel to Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar despite the latter two preceding Holy Wood in release date. Each album contains its own distinct storyline, which can be linked {{together to create a}} larger overarching storyline encompassing all three. Manson has offered this {{much in the way of}} an interpretation: [...] " [...] wanting to fit into a world that didn't want me, and fighting really hard to get there. [...] are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with Holy Wood, then Mechanical Animals really talks about how that revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then Antichrist Superstar is where you're given a choice to decide if you're going to be controlled by the power that you created <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to destroy yourself and then start over.

2500|$|Bukowski died {{of leukemia}} on March 9, 1994, in San Pedro, aged 73, shortly after {{completing}} his last novel, Pulp. The funeral rites, orchestrated by his widow, {{were conducted by}} Buddhist monks. He is interred at Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes. An account of the proceedings {{can be found in}} Gerald Locklin's book Charles Bukowski: A Sure Bet. His gravestone reads: [...] "Don't Try", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington: [...] "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. <b>Or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like its looks you make a pet out of it."

2500|$|In June 2012, {{producer}} Edward R. Pressman assured {{fans that}} [...] "the original 1994 Crow film holds {{a special place}} in my heart. The current film is a 'reinvention' of James O'Barr's graphic novel for the 21st century. We're thrilled to have teamed with director Javier Gutiérrez and screenwriter Jesse Wigutow on this story, which remains true to the core of Eric Draven's plight for revenge. On the news of future remakes, however, O'Barr stated: [...] " [...] I don't have great expectations. I think the reality is, no matter who you get to star in it, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get Ridley Scott to direct it and spend 200 million dollars, you're still not gonna top what Brandon Lee and Alex Proyas did in that first ten million dollar movie." [...] On April 19, 2013, it was announced that Tom Hiddleston was in talks to play Eric. That same month, there were reports that Hiddleston would not be doing the film, but that Alexander Skarsgård was being eyed for the part. A week later, however, Skarsgård stated that he was not attached to the film.|$|E
2500|$|The oldest Germanic {{languages}} {{have the}} typical complex inflected morphology of old Indo-European languages, with {{four or five}} noun cases; verbs marked for person, number, tense and mood; multiple noun and verb classes; few or no articles; and rather free word order. [...] The old Germanic languages are famous for having only two tenses (present and past), with three PIE past-tense aspects (imperfect, aorist, and perfect/stative) merged into one and no new tenses (future, pluperfect, etc.) developing. [...] There were three moods: indicative, subjunctive (developed from the PIE optative mood) and imperative. [...] Gothic verbs {{had a number of}} archaic features inherited from PIE that were lost in the other Germanic languages with few traces, including dual endings, an inflected passive voice (derived from the PIE mediopassive voice), and a class of verbs with reduplication in the past tense (derived from the PIE perfect). [...] The complex tense system of modern English (e.g. In three months, the house will still be being built <b>or</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> had not acted so stupidly, we would never have been caught) is almost entirely due to subsequent developments (although paralleled in many of the other Germanic languages).|$|E

Then Berlusconi asks Saccà {{to find a job}} in RAI for a young woman explicitly telling him that this woman would serve as an asset in a secret exchange with a senator of the majority who would help him to cause Prodi, with his administration, to fall. After the publication of these wiretaps, Berlusconi has been accused by other politicians and by some journalists of political corruption through the exploitation of prostitution. Berlusconi said, in his own defence: [...] "In the entertainment world everybody knows that, in certain situations in RAI TV you work only if you prostitute yourself <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are leftist. I have intervened on behalf of some personalities who are not leftists and have been completely set apart by RAI TV."
