25|$|Responding to the {{popularity}} of Pritchard's and <b>other</b> <b>exposures</b> of masonic ritual, Grand Lodge, about this time, made changes to ritual and passwords {{to make it more}} difficult for outsiders to pass themselves off as masons. These changes were not universally accepted by affiliated lodges. The Goose and Gridiron (now Lodge of Antiquity No. 2), one of the original and most senior lodges of the constitution, never adopted them. For the unaffiliated, the innovations simply deepened the division. At the time, London was absorbing many economic migrants from Ireland. Those who were already Freemasons felt that they could not work with the new ritual, and the lodges they formed swelled further the numbers of unaffiliated lodges in the capital.|$|E

25|$|The letters sent to {{the media}} {{contained}} a coarse brown material, while the letters {{sent to the}} two U.S. Senators contained a fine powder. The brown granular anthrax mostly caused skin infections, cutaneous anthrax (9 out of 12 cases), although Kathy Nguyen's case of inhalation anthrax occurred {{at the same time}} and in the same general area as two cutaneous cases and several <b>other</b> <b>exposures.</b> The AMI letter which caused inhalation cases in Florida appears to have been mailed at the same time as the other media letters. The fine powder anthrax sent to the senators mostly caused the more dangerous form of infection known as inhalational anthrax (8 out of 10 cases). Postal worker Patrick O'Donnell and accountant Linda Burch contracted cutaneous anthrax from the Senate letters.|$|E
2500|$|Moenave Formation (Jurassic): Red {{and orange}} sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone. [...] There is some {{confusion}} about distinguishing between the Springdale sandstone {{member of the}} Moenave formation and the overlying Navajo sandstone, which is similar in appearance, in the St. George area. [...] It is now generally assumed that the red cliffs north of downtown (north of Red Hills Parkway) and at the Dixie Red Hills golf course {{are part of the}} Moenave formation. [...] <b>Other</b> <b>exposures</b> include cuts into the east and west Black Hills and {{the southern part of the}} Dixie Downs neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the orogeny the {{emplacement}} of a large batholith {{of granite}} occurred below what is now Devon and Cornwall. This granite is now exposed as Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor and several <b>other</b> <b>exposures</b> in Cornwall, including the Isles of Scilly. Granite tors form important elements in the landscape in these areas. Metamorphism of the country rocks and hydrothermal circulation of metal-rich fluids in the cooling rock provided the source of the extensive [...] deposits of the region (primarily copper and tin). Later weathering of the granite led to deposits of kaolin which has been excavated as it is an important source of china clay and ball clay used in the production of such products as porcelain and shiny printing paper.|$|E

6000|$|In Boston and Cambridge Henry James {{at length}} touched a purely {{literary}} circle. The beginning of such fruitful friendships {{as those with}} Professor C. E. Norton and Mr. W. D. Howells meant his open and professed dedication to literature. The Harvard Law School left as little direct impression on him as any of his <b>other</b> <b>exposures</b> to ordinary teaching, but at last he had finished with these makeshifts. His new friends helped him into his proper channel. Under their auspices {{he made his way}} into publication and became a regular contributor of criticism and fiction to several journals and reviews. There followed some very uneventful and industrious years, disturbed to some extent by ill-health but broken by no long absences from Cambridge. His constant companion and literary confidant was Mr. Howells, who writes to me that 'people were very much struck with his work in the magazine'--the Atlantic Monthly, of which this friend was at that time assistant editor--'but mostly not pleased with it. It was a common thing to hear them say, [...] "Oh, yes, we like Mr. James very much, but we cannot bear his stories".' Mr. Howells adds: 'I could scarcely exaggerate the intensity of our literary association. It included not only what he was doing and thinking himself in fiction, and criticism of whatever he was reading, but what other people were trying to do in our American magazines.' Beneath these activities we are to imagine the deep pre-occupation, growing and growing, of the idea of a possible return to Europe. It is not very clear why the satisfaction of his wish was delayed {{for as long as it}} was. His doubtful health can hardly have amounted to a hindrance, and the authority of his parents was far too light and sympathetic to stand in his way. Yet it is only by the end of 1868, as I find from a letter of that time, that a journey to Europe has 'ceased to look positively and aggressively impossible.' Thereafter things move more quickly, and three months later he arrives at the great moment, memorable ever afterwards, of his landing at Liverpool.|$|E
