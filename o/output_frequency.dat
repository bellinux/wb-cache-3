25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an <b>output</b> <b>frequency.</b> The <b>output</b> <b>frequency</b> is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the <b>output</b> <b>frequency</b> drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E
25|$|By convention, {{the term}} {{oscillators}} usually denotes integrated circuits (ICs) that supply single <b>output</b> <b>frequencies.</b> MEMS oscillators include MEMS resonators, sustaining amps, and additional electronics to set or adjust their <b>output</b> <b>frequencies.</b> These circuits often include phase locked loops (PLLs) that produce selectable or programmable <b>output</b> <b>frequencies</b> from the upstream MEMS reference frequencies.|$|R
25|$|Additional {{circuits}} called fractional-n {{phase lock}} loops (frac-N PLLs) multiply the resonator’s mechanical frequencies to the oscillator’s <b>output</b> <b>frequencies.</b> These highly specialized PLLs set the <b>output</b> <b>frequencies</b> under control of digital state machines. The state machines {{are controlled by}} calibration and program data stored in non-volatile memory and adjust the PLL configurations to compensate for temperature variations.|$|R

For the class of nonlinear Volterra systems, some interesting properties for system <b>output</b> <b>frequencies</b> are studied in this paper. These properties provide a novel insight into the <b>output</b> <b>frequencies</b> of Volterra systems, i. e., the periodicity of the <b>output</b> <b>frequencies.</b> They also demonstrate several novel frequency characteristics of system output spectrum such as the opposite property, and reveal clearly the nonlinear effects on system output spectrum from different nonlinearities. These new results have significance in the analysis and design of nonlinear systems and nonlinear filters {{in order to achieve}} a specific output spectrum in a desired frequency band by taking advantage of nonlinearities, and provide an important guidance to applications of Volterra system theory in practices for analysis and design of nonlinear systems.

25|$|MEMS {{oscillator}} suppliers {{solve the}} diversity problem by leveraging circuit technology. While quartz oscillators are usually built with the quartz crystals driven at the desired output frequencies, MEMS oscillators commonly drive the resonators at one frequency and multiply {{this to the}} designed <b>output</b> <b>frequency.</b> In this way, the hundreds of standard application frequencies and the occasional custom frequency can be provided without redesigning the MEMS resonators or circuits.|$|E
25|$|More complex {{electronic}} ballasts use programmed start. The <b>output</b> <b>frequency</b> {{is started}} above the resonance {{frequency of the}} output circuit of the ballast; and after the filaments are heated, the frequency is rapidly decreased. If the frequency approaches the resonant frequency of the ballast, the output voltage will increase {{so much that the}} lamp will ignite. If the lamp does not ignite, an electronic circuit stops the operation of the ballast.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} {{parameter}} {{to be considered}} is the <b>output</b> <b>frequency</b> of the power source. As the heat is predominantly generated in {{the surface of the}} component it is important to select a frequency which offers the deepest practical penetration depth into the material without running the risk of current cancellation. It will be appreciated that as only the skin is being heated time will be required for the heat to penetrate to the centre of the component and that if too much power is applied too quickly it is possible to melt the surface of the component whilst leaving the core cool. Utilising thermal conductivity data for the material and the customers specified homogeneity (physics) requirements regarding the cross sectional ∆T it is possible to calculate or create a model to establish the heat time required. In many cases the time to achieve an acceptable ∆T will exceed what can be achieved by heating the components one at a time. A range of handling solutions including conveyors, in line feeders, pusher systems and walking beam feeders are utilised to facilitate the heating of multiple components whilst delivering single components to the operator at the required time cycle.|$|E

In some configurations, the phase output is taken from {{the output of the}} register which introduces a one clock cycle latency but allows the adder to operate at a higher clock rate.|$|E
500|$|Atomic line filters may {{operate in}} the ultraviolet, visible and {{infrared}} regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In absorption-re-emission ALFs, the frequency of light must be shifted {{in order for the}} filter to operate, and in a passive device, this shift must be to a lower frequency (i.e. red shifted) simply because of energy conservation. This means that passive filters are rarely able to work with infrared light, because the <b>output</b> <b>frequency</b> would be impractically low. If photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are used then the [...] "output wavelength of the ARF should lie in a spectral region in which commercial, large-area, long-lived PMT's [...] possess maximum sensitivity". In such a case, active ALFs would have the advantage over passive ALFs as they would more readily, [...] "generate output wavelengths in the near UV, the spectral region in which well-developed photocathodes possess their highest sensitivity".|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that, in {{contrast}} to the case of linear systems where the possible <b>output</b> <b>frequencies</b> are exactly the same as the frequencies of the input, the possible <b>output</b> <b>frequencies</b> of nonlinear systems are much richer than the frequencies of the input. Consequently, a desired frequency domain energy transfer effect can be realized by a proper design of a nonlinear system. By exploiting nonlinearities in system design, signal energy can be moved or transferred to higher frequencies or lower frequencies, or it can be spread over a range of frequencies.

In the system design of a frequency synthesizer, states Manassewitsch, there are as many [...] "best" [...] design procedures as there are experienced synthesizer designers. System analysis of a frequency synthesizer involves <b>output</b> <b>frequency</b> range (or frequency bandwidth or tuning range), frequency increments (or resolution or frequency tuning), frequency stability (or phase stability, compare spurious outputs), phase noise performance (e.g., spectral purity), switching time (compare settling time and rise time), and size, power consumption, and cost.

2500|$|An optical {{parametric}} oscillator (OPO) is a parametric oscillator that oscillates at optical frequencies.

The high <b>output</b> <b>frequency</b> of an electronic ballast refreshes the phosphors in a fluorescent lamp so rapidly that there is no perceptible flicker. The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest. Lamps operated on magnetic ballasts have a flicker index between 0.04–0.07 while digital ballasts have a flicker index of below 0.01.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the magnetron's output make radar use of the device somewhat problematic. The first of these factors is the magnetron's inherent instability in its transmitter frequency. This instability results not only in frequency shifts from one pulse to the next, but also a frequency shift within an individual transmitted pulse. The second factor is that {{the energy of the}} transmitted pulse is spread over a relatively wide frequency spectrum, which requires the receiver to have a correspondingly wide bandwidth. This wide bandwidth allows ambient electrical noise to be accepted into the receiver, thus obscuring somewhat the weak radar echoes, thereby reducing overall receiver signal-to-noise ratio and thus performance. [...] The third factor, depending on application, is the radiation hazard caused by the use of high power electromagnetic radiation. In some applications, for example a marine radar mounted on a recreational vessel, a radar with a magnetron output of 2 to 4 kilowatts is often found mounted very near an area occupied by crew or passengers. In practical use these factors have been overcome, or merely accepted, and there are today thousands of magnetron aviation and marine radar units in service. [...] Recent advances in aviation weather avoidance radar and in marine radar have successfully replaced the magnetron with semiconductor microwave oscillators, which have a narrower <b>output</b> <b>frequency</b> range. [...] These allow a narrower receiver bandwidth to be used, and the higher signal to noise ratio in turn allows a lower transmitter power, reducing exposure to EMR.|$|E
