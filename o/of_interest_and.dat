The algorithms for automatic detection of defects, trained on existing images database with a machine learning software, are able to identify various elements: texture irregularities, pitot probes, rivets, openings, text, defects, corrosion, oil stains. A damage report is sent on the operator's touch pad with each area <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> the proposed classification with a probability percentage. After reviewing the images, the verdict is pronounced by a qualified inspector.|$|E
5|$|Following the Egyptian mania that {{gripped the}} country after the {{discovery}} of King Tut's tomb in 1922, Harvey's Pyramid project sparked a lot <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> was widely reported throughout the U.S. Tens {{of thousands of people}} came to Monte Ne during the 1920s to see its progress. Harvey continued to raise funds from events held at the amphitheater, such as conventions.|$|E

5|$|Netball is {{most popular}} in Commonwealth countries, {{and the most}} popular women's spectator sport in Australia and Tanzania and the effort to {{increase}} media attention and participation for women's sport often goes to Olympic sports with low participation rates, low rates <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> few facilities. Even then, historically, coverage of women's team sports in the Olympics has been limited. Instead, according to Jones, the media focus on female athletes in non-team competitions and on team sports played equally by both genders.|$|E
5|$|Rowing at Georgetown has a {{distinguished}} history {{dating back to}} the founding of the Boat Club in 1876. The team was however suspended from 1909 to 1920 due to lack <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> <b>and</b> involvement in World War I. Georgetown added a men's lightweight team in 1963, a women's team in 1975, and a women's lightweight team in 1996.|$|E

5|$|The Kepler spacecraft's {{first days}} of science {{activity}} revealed a series of transit events, in which some body (such as a planet) crosses in front of, and therefore dims, its host star.

5|$|The Liaison Office interviewed European refugee {{scientists}} and studied German physics journals. It compiled lists of German scientists <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> possible locations of nuclear research and industrial facilities, and the mining and stockpiling of uranium and thorium ores. Little thorium {{was available in}} Germany or German-occupied Europe, and attention soon centered on the mines at Joachimsthal in Sudetenland (the German-annexed part of Czechoslovakia). Aerial reconnaissance was carried out periodically, and production was measured by assessing {{the size of the}} piles of tailings.|$|E
5|$|Heilmann's {{articles}} were later collected and published {{as a book}} in Danish in 1916 with the title as in his series, Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming ("our present knowledge {{about the origin of}} birds"). This met the same lack <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> is thought to have been a result of publishing in Danish, as this made it inaccessible to many scientists working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English scientists, and the discipline in continental Europe was dominated by Germany and to a lesser degree France.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{decaying}} {{infrastructure and}} {{the withdrawal of}} subsidies brought {{the future of the}} line into doubt. As one of its last acts the Greater London Council paid for the replacement of two bridges on the line, allowing operations to continue. The centenary of the line in 1989 saw a renewal <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> an upgrading of the trains between Chalfont& Latimer and London Marylebone station made commuting more practical, and usage of the line stabilised. The introduction of London Underground S Stock in 2010 led to the replacement of the shuttle service with half-hourly through trains to and from London.|$|E
5|$|Later {{chapters}} {{provide evidence}} that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternate concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> <b>and</b> its ability to explain {{a wide range of}} observations.|$|E
5|$|Lobbying {{is common}} in Annapolis; {{there are more than}} 700 lobbyists {{registered}} with the state. While lobbyists may spend freely on advocacy, they are limited in gifts to legislators and in their ability to contribute to campaigns. Ethics issues related to lobbyists and other matters are handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, a twelve-member committee that includes six Senators. Members of the Senate may turn to either this committee or an ethics counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict. Members are encouraged to avoid conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> <b>and</b> are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state. In addition to employment prohibitions laid out in the state constitution, members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government.|$|E

5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> research. Alemtuzumab, {{daclizumab}} and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
5|$|Sabah state {{government}} also emphasises pre-school {{education in the}} state. This was followed with the aid from Sabah Foundation (Yayasan Sabah) and Nestlé who helped to establish pre-schools in the state. Sabah has two public universities: Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). Universiti Tun Abdul Razak (UNIRAZAK) has set up their regional centre in Kota Kinabalu. As of 2016, there is around 15 private colleges, two private university colleges together with other newly established colleges. In 1960, the overall literacy rate in North Borneo was only 24%. The recent findings in 2011 found the literacy rate have increase to 79%. Most of secondary schools leavers also did not continue their studies after completing their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) mainly due to financial burden as well {{because of the lack}} <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> confidence to continue their studies in local higher learning institutes, with a survey in 2015 saw only 16,000 out of more than 20,000 secondary schools leavers continuing their studies.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{combined}} poetic genius with {{a practical}} {{sense of the}} theatre. Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed. He reshaped each plot to create several centres <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Army {{had entered}} the Second World War with {{inadequate}} resources due to severe cutbacks {{at the hands of}} conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This was compounded by a lack <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>and</b> appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and military leadership. There was an assumption that the Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that would fight overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World War in the Middle East and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army not only had to provide its own logistic support, but support to its Allies as well.|$|E
5|$|The common {{term for}} a place at which one may dive is a dive site.

There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which {{are known for their}} convenience, points <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> <b>and</b> frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low.|$|E
