50|$|One area {{in which}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> can be applied is in the {{processing}} of mixtures of explosives. The family of explosives called amatols are mixtures of ammonium nitrate and TNT. Ammonium nitrate has an <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> of +20% and TNT has an <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> of −74%, so {{it would appear that}} the mixture yielding an <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> of zero would also result in the best explosive properties. In actual practice a mixture of 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% TNT by weight yields an <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> of +1%, the best properties of all mixtures, and an increase in strength of 30% over TNT.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> (OB, or OB%) is an {{expression}} {{that is used to}} indicate the degree to which an explosive can be oxidized. If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to form carbon dioxide from carbon, water from hydrogen molecules, all of its sulfur dioxide from sulfur, and all metal oxides from metals with no excess, the molecule is said to have a zero <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance.</b> The molecule is said to have a positive <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a negative <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> if it contains less oxygen than is needed; the combustion will then be incomplete, and large amount of toxic gases like carbon monoxide will be present.

50|$|The {{mixture is}} {{affected}} by humidity because ammonium nitrate is highly hygroscopic. Ammonal's ease of detonation depends on fuel and oxidizer ratios, 95:5 ammonium nitrate and aluminum being fairly sensitive, however not very <b>oxygen</b> <b>balanced.</b> Even copper metal traces are known to sensitize bulk amounts of ammonium nitrate and further increase danger of spontaneous detonation during a fire, most likely due {{to the formation of}} tetramines.

40|$|Urban areas play an {{important}} role in the global carbon cycle, and human-induced carbon emissions from urban areas urgently need to be reduced. Therefore, understanding the relationship between carbon sources and sinks is the first step toward mitigating the effect of urban areas on climate change. Combined with the land use and land cover (LULC) empirical coefficients and statistical methods, urban carbon and <b>oxygen</b> <b>balances</b> in Beijing were evaluated. In this study, the carbon sequestration and oxygen emission capabilities of various LULC types were calculated, and the partitioning of carbon emissions and oxygen consumption in Beijing were estimated. The evaluation results indicated that the ecosystem services from the LULC in an area were not adequate to offset the urban carbon emissions and oxygen consumption. The areas with a high capacity for carbon sequestration and oxygen emissions were primarily distributed in the exurban districts of Beijing, and the carbon and <b>oxygen</b> <b>balances</b> in the exurban districts were superior to those of core urban areas. Industrial fossil fuel consumption dominated all of the human-induced carbon sources.

50|$|Because sensitivity, brisance, and {{strength}} are properties {{resulting from a}} complex explosive chemical reaction, a simple relationship such as <b>oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> cannot be depended upon to yield universally consistent results.

Since these mixtures contain rather strong oxidizers and a fuel, they have the potential of being highly sensitive liquid explosives. Studies showed such mixtures are not exceptionally sensitive to mechanical impact and friction or thermal initiation. However, these mixtures at <b>oxygen</b> <b>balanced</b> proportions are extremely sensitive to induced shock and are capable of propagating explosive reactions at film thicknesses less than 0. 5 mm.

50|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>balance</b> {{applies to}} {{traditional}} explosives mechanics {{with the assumption}} that carbon is oxidized to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide during detonation. In what seems like a paradox to an explosives expert, Cold Detonation Physics uses carbon in its most highly oxidized state as the source of oxygen in the form of carbon dioxide. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>balance,</b> therefore, either does not apply to a CDP formulation or must be calculated without including the carbon in the carbon dioxide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Past, present, and {{possible}} future {{changes in the}} Baltic Sea acid–base and <b>oxygen</b> <b>balances</b> were studied using different numerical experiments and a catchment–sea model system in several scenarios including business as usual, medium scenario, and the Baltic Sea Action Plan. New CO 2 partial pressure data provided guidance for improving the marine biogeochemical model. Continuous CO 2 and nutrient measurements with high temporal reso-lution helped disentangle the biogeochemical processes. These data and modeling indicate that traditional under-standings of the nutrient availability–organic matter pro-duction relationship do not necessarily apply to the Baltic Sea. Modeling indicates that increased nutrient loads will not inhibit future Baltic Sea acidification; instead, increased mineralization and biological production will amplify the seasonal surface pH cycle. The direction and magnitude of future pH changes are mainly controlled by atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Apart from decreasing pH, we project a decreasing calcium carbonate saturation state and increasing hypoxic area...|$|R

40|$|Storage product {{accumulation}} in {{seeds of}} major crop species {{is limited by}} their low internal oxygen concentration. Adjustment of energy and storage metabolism to oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) in seeds is highly relevant for agriculture and biotechnology. However, the mechanisms of low-oxygen sensing and balancing remain a mystery. Here, it is shown that normal hypoxia in seeds of soybean (Glycine max) and pea (Pisum sativum) triggers a nitrite-dependent increase in endogenous nitric oxide (NO) concentrations. NO, in turn, reduces the oxygen consumption of seeds, generating a localized decrease in both ATP availability and biosynthetic activity. Increasing oxygen availability reduces endogenous NO concentrations, thereby abolishing mitochondrial and metabolic inhibition. This auto-regulatory and reversible <b>oxygen</b> <b>balancing,</b> via NO, avoids seed anoxia and suggests a key role for NO in regulating storage activity. This hypothesis is reinforced by changes in energy status (ATP:ADP ratio), steady-state metabolite concentrations and biosynthetic fluxes under NO treatment.

40|$|ObjectivesIn single-ventricle {{physiology}} with aortopulmonary connection, diastolic hypotension could alter regional myocardial {{blood flow}}. Also, afterload increases could impair myocardial blood flow by increased wall tension and relative subendocardial malperfusion. This study explores {{the effects of}} acute single-ventricle physiology on regional myocardial blood flow distribution and investigates the consequences of moderate afterload augmentation on myocardial blood flow. MethodsSingle-ventricle physiology was created in 8 piglets without using bypass, and 8 animals served as a sham control group. Aortopulmonary shunt, echo-guided atrial septostomy, tricuspid valve avulsion, and pulmonary artery occlusion allowed the left ventricle to support systemic and pulmonary circulations. Afterload augmentation was produced by aortic balloon inflation. Physiologic recordings and stable-isotope microsphere determination of myocardial {{blood flow to the}} subepicardium and subendocardium were obtained at baseline and during single-ventricle physiology (at 30 minutes, 120 minutes, and afterload increase). ResultsArterial oxygen content, diastolic pressure, and coronary perfusion pressure declined after creation of single-ventricle physiology (P <. 05). Acute single-ventricle physiology resulted in higher myocardial blood flow (P <. 05), unchanged subendocardial/subepicardial flow ratio and oxygen delivery, and lower coronary resistance (P <. 01) as compared with biventricular physiology. Afterload augmentation increased coronary perfusion pressure, causing a trend for higher myocardial blood flow and oxygen delivery (P = NS), without affecting subendocardial/subepicardial flow distribution. Myocardial <b>oxygen</b> supply/demand <b>balance</b> fell in single-ventricle physiology, remaining unchanged during afterload augmentation. ConclusionsOur study demonstrates that, in acute single-ventricle physiology with aortopulmonary shunt, myocardial blood flow is maintained by lower coronary perfusion pressure. Further, single-ventricle physiology results in less favorable myocardial <b>oxygen</b> supply/demand <b>balance,</b> although normal transmural myocardial blood flow distribution is maintained. Avoidance of diastolic runoff (ventricle-pulmonary conduit) could improve coronary reserve. In our study, moderate afterload augmentation did not induce relative subendocardial malperfusion, nor did it worsen <b>oxygen</b> supply/demand <b>balance...</b>|$|R

40|$|Here we {{investigate}} the thermodynamic states occurring in explosion fields from the detonation of condensed explosives in air. In typical applications, {{the pressure of}} expanded detonation products gases is modeled by a Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) function: P{sub JWL} = f(v,s{sub CJ}); constants in that function are fit to cylinder test data. This function provides a specification of pressure {{as a function of}} specific volume, v, along the expansion isentrope (s = constant = s{sub CJ}) starting at the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) state. However, the JWL function is not a fundamental equation of thermodynamics, and therefore gives an incomplete specification of states. For example, explosions inherently involve shock reflections from surfaces; this changes the entropy of the products, and in such situations the JWL function provides no information on the products states. In addition, most explosives are not <b>oxygen</b> <b>balanced,</b> so if hot detonation products mix with air, they after-burn, releasing the heat of reaction via a turbulent combustion process. This raises the temperature of explosion products cloud to the adiabatic flame temperature ({approx} 3, 000 K).

By using objective statistical methods, climate runs for present climate conditions were examined and evaluated using Baltic Sea modelling.

All examined scenarios indicate future acidification of the whole Baltic Sea that is insensitive to the chosen global climate model. The main factor controlling the direction and magnitude of future pH changes is atmospheric CO 2 concentration (i. e. emissions). Climate change and land-derived changes (e. g. nutrient loads) affect acidification mainly by altering the seasonal cycle and deep-water conditions. Apart from decreasing pH, we also project a decreased saturation state of calcium carbonate, decreased respiration index and increasing hypoxic area &#x 2013; all factors that will threaten the marine ecosystem.
