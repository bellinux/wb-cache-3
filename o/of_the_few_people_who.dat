5|$|When Lucas Goodwin shoots Underwood {{during a}} {{campaign}} event, Meechum trades fire with the assassin, {{and both are}} killed instantly. Meechum's death {{is one of the}} tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill she is sponsoring, and Underwood has him buried in Arlington National Cemetery, a rare privilege for a Secret Service agent, though Meechum may have been eligible, in his own right, as {{a former member of the}} US Military who served in Afghanistan. When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum's hand tracing has been painted over, he expresses grief and regret at the loss to Claire, who says that Meechum was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> truly understood them.|$|E

25|$|Achatinidae are {{a family}} of rather large land snails, and, {{in spite of their}} size, one that poses {{tremendous}} taxonomic problems, and Dolf is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> knows his way in the chaotic taxonomy of this group. He devoted various papers partly or wholly to the family and introduced six new species and subspecies. He was a friend of the recently deceased American Achatinidae specialist Albert Raymond Mead (1915–2009). They regularly exchanged opinions, but did not publish jointly.|$|E
25|$|At most times, Toad {{is portrayed}} as a rather cowardly character, {{but the fact that}} he {{actually}} knows about his cowardice makes him one of the more innocent and humbler characters in the series. Despite his fears, Toad is usually one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> tries his best to support Mario when he is on his adventures, from providing items to actually adventuring alongside the hero on his quest. Despite the fact that Toad is usually seen as a cheerful character, he can get extremely distressed when a major event occurs, such as the kidnapping of the princess.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Ó Sé's Kerry {{announced}} their arrival when they captured the National League title {{at the start}} of the year. A second Munster title soon followed after a demolition of Clare in the provincial decider. Kerry subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final, with Mayo providing the opposition. The game saw both sides share periods of dominance. Kerry's Maurice Fitzgerald scored nine of his team's points while Mayo scored 1-2 in a two-minute spell. The Connacht champions failed to score in the last twenty minutes as Kerry held on to win by 0-13 to 1-7. The win was all the more significant for Ó Sé as he became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> captained and managed his county to an All-Ireland title.|$|E

Akira confesses his love to Yukina and wants to be more than just cousins, and can't stand the sight of Shigure around her. Frequently, Yukina comes to Akira for advice. Akira, through a trial date, was chosen by Yukina to be her boyfriend but because Yukina was still confused with her feelings he felt that her love is not that love of a lover but a love like of family so he broke up with her. He is now going out with Mami.|$|E
25|$|GrandPré has {{illustrated}} {{all of the}} American {{editions of}} the Harry Potter novels. She was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were {{able to read the}} Harry Potter books before they were released to the general public. When she received each new book, she read the story through once, highlighting descriptions that she felt would do well as an illustration. She then created various sketches as ideas for the cover and chapter art, before sending her favorites to the editors to decide which should appear in the final publication. GrandPré devises her images after reading the scripts for the books, and does not collaborate with or receive input from J.K. Rowling, although the two have met. Her artwork for the final novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was created using pastels on toned printmaking paper.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, Maria's second son, George, died of {{tuberculosis}} in the Caucasus. During the funeral, {{she kept her}} composure, {{but at the end}} of the service, she ran from the church clutching her son's top hat that been atop the coffin and collapsed in her carriage sobbing. Two years later, according to her daughter, Grand Duchess Olga, she arranged Olga's disastrous marriage to Peter, Duke of Oldenburg. For years Nicholas refused to grant his unhappy sister a divorce, only relenting in 1916 in the midst of the War. When Olga attempted to contract a morganatic marriage with Nikolai Kulikovsky, Maria Feodorovna and the tsar tried to dissuade her, yet, they did not protest too vehemently. Indeed, Maria Feodorovna was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> attended the wedding in November 1916. In 1912, Maria faced trouble with her youngest son, when he secretly married his mistress, much to the outrage and scandal of both Maria Feodorovna and Nicholas.|$|E

25|$|Grant often {{displayed}} laddish, thrill-seeking behaviour; drinking, chasing women, clubbing, {{gambling and}} living {{off of his}} wits. He became restless easily and actively sought the thrill of danger in order to regain excitement in his life, which led to his participation in numerous crimes, fights and affairs. Grant showed sociopathic tendencies at times — impulsive behaviour, a disregard for social rules and an indifference to the feelings of others, particularly the women in his life. He was often portrayed as arrogant and egotistical, with an inflated opinion of his own importance. Because of this, he rarely admitted to being at fault or backed down from an argument. While the character mellowed in his later years, such behaviour was still apparent. However he is not completely without showing rare signs of compassion. An example of this {{was that he was}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> offered support to Mark Fowler when he was isolated by the rest of Albert Square (led ironically by Grant's mother, Peggy), because of his HIV illness.|$|E
25|$|Walton {{played a}} key role in Kennedy's 1960 presidential {{campaign}}. He volunteered to work on the campaign in the spring of 1960, long before most people believed Kennedy had a chance at the nomination. During the 1960 Democratic presidential primaries, he helped run the Kennedy campaign operation in West Virginia and Wisconsin. In the general election campaign, he had overall control of the Kennedy operation in New York, the most populous state, where the state Democratic Party was in disarray. Robert F. Kennedy sent Walton to New York to stabilize the campaign there. New York City reporter William Haddad had begun writing articles critical of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. that threatened to divide the New York state Democratic Party. Walton neutralized the problem by hiring Haddad as an aide to Robert Kennedy. Walton's organizational skills allowed him to rise quickly within the Kennedy organization, and he was given election assignments in Maine and California. Walton was also one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> knew that John Kennedy was in poor health during the campaign. Kennedy suffered from back problems, a deteriorating left knee, Addison's disease, and a possible addiction to amphetamines (which led to withdrawal effects). Walton witnessed Kennedy being followed throughout the campaign by an aide with a kit full of medication designed to treat Kennedy's illnesses.|$|E

500|$|At school, Ripley enjoyed drama lessons, {{spurred on by}} the {{positive}} remarks she received from her drama teacher Susan Ford.

500|$|Gotham City's {{assistant}} district attorney and Bruce's childhood friend, who is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> knows Batman's true identity. Gyllenhaal took over the role from Katie Holmes, who played the part in Batman Begins. In August 2005, Holmes was reportedly planning to reprise the role, but she eventually turned it down to film Mad Money with Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah. By March 2007, Gyllenhaal was in [...] "final talks" [...] for the part. Gyllenhaal has acknowledged her character is a damsel in distress to an extent, but says Nolan sought ways to empower her character, so [...] "Rachel's really clear about what's important to her and unwilling to compromise her morals, which made a nice change" [...] from the many conflicted characters whom she has previously portrayed.|$|E
500|$|After taking Manila, MacArthur {{installed}} {{one of his}} Filipino friends, Manuel Roxas—who {{also happened}} to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> knew about the huge sum of money Quezon had given MacArthur in 1942—into {{a position of power}} that ensured Roxas was to become the next Filipino president. Roxas had been a leading Japanese collaborator serving in the puppet government of Jose Laurel, but MacArthur claimed that Roxas had secretly been an American agent all the long. About MacArthur's claim that Roxas was really part of the resistance, the American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that [...] "...evidence to this effect has yet to surface", and that by favoring the Japanese collaborator Roxas, MacArthur ensured there was no serious effort {{to address the issue of}} Filipino collaboration with the Japanese after the war.|$|E
500|$|... "The Bourgeois Blues" [...] {{is one of}} Lead Belly's {{most famous}} songs and is remembered as his most [...] "heartfelt protest song". There is {{disagreement}} among music scholars as to its importance. Robert Springer claims that the song is [...] "peripheral" [...] to the wider study of the blues, while Lawson points {{to it as a}} watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of the United States. There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics. After its release, it became popular with left-wing political groups. Lead Belly was invited to perform at Camp Unity, the Communist Party USA's summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s. This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform. The party claims, to the contrary, that they were some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> respected him and gave him a chance to perform.|$|E
