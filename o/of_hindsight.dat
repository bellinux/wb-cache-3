5|$|On 6 August 1307, {{less than}} a month after succeeding, Edward II made Piers Gaveston Earl of Cornwall. According to {{contemporary}} narrative sources, this was a controversial decision. Gaveston came from relatively humble origins, and his rise to the highest level of the peerage was considered improper by the established nobility. Furthermore, the earldom of Cornwall had traditionally been reserved for members of the royal family, and Edward I had intended it for one of his two younger sons from his second marriage. The discontent reported by the chronicles may have been the result <b>of</b> <b>hindsight,</b> however; there is no sign that the established nobility objected to the ennoblement of Gaveston at the time. The earldom gave Gaveston substantial landholdings over great parts of England, to the value of £4,000 a year. These possessions consisted of most of Cornwall, as well as parts of Devonshire in the south-west, land in Berkshire and Oxfordshire centred on the honour of Wallingford, most of the eastern part of Lincolnshire, and the honour of Knaresborough in Yorkshire, with the territories that belonged to it. In addition to this, Edward also secured a prestigious marriage between Gaveston and Margaret de Clare, sister of the powerful Earl of Gloucester. The possessions and family connection secured Gaveston a place among the highest levels of the English nobility.|$|E

Know-Nothings, for instance, captured the mayoralty of Philadelphia with a majority of over 8,000 votes in 1854. Even after opening up immense discord with his Kansas–Nebraska Act, Senator Douglas began speaking of the Know-Nothings, rather than the Republicans, as the principal danger to the Democratic Party.|$|E

40|$|The {{hindsight}} bias is {{the tendency}} of people to falsely believe {{that they would have}} predicted the outcome of an event correctly, once the outcome is known. Several studies show that the hindsight bias is a robust phenomenon and that it has been demonstrated {{in a wide variety of}} decision problems. The present paper shows for the first time that the hindsight bias can also be found in decisions that relate to taste. All participants tasted the same wine. Some of them received fictitious information about the wine's sweetness. Participants who were told the wine was dry judged the same wine as less sweet than participants who were told the wine was sweet. We further analyzed the moderating role of meta-cognitions for the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>hindsight</b> bias. According to the biased reconstruction explanation <b>of</b> the <b>hindsight</b> bias (for an overview see Stahlberg and Maass, 1998) participants who judge themselves as wine experts should reveal a stronger hindsight bias than participants who judge themselves as novices. The results of our study do not support this assumption. There were no differences in the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>hindsight</b> bias between wine experts and novices...|$|R

25|$|The Old Testament canon {{entered into}} Christian {{use in the}} Septuagint, a Greek {{translation}} with a few books in Greek originally. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the 4th century a series of synods, most notably at the Synod of Hippo in AD 393, produced a list of texts equal to the 46 book canon of the Old Testament that Catholics use today (and the 27-book canon of the New Testament that all use). A definitive list {{did not come from}} any early Ecumenical Council. Also, c. 400, Jerome produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible, the contents of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit <b>of</b> <b>hindsight</b> {{it can be said that}} this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.|$|E

French {{literary}} journals, always published posthumously, are often extremely candid accounts, particularly of the author's sexual life. Boyd, himself a francophile, includes masturbation, prostitution and Mountstuart's three marriages. While Boyd had earlier written work in the form of memoir or biography, a journal is different: [...] "For a start, it's written without the benefit <b>of</b> <b>hindsight,</b> so there isn't the same feeling you get when you look back and add shape to a life. There are huge chunks missing." [...] The novel's grounding in everyday life and focus on characterisation place it firmly within realism.|$|E

Sixty-four younger adults and 60 healthy, community-living older adults completed a cognitive battery and a memory design hindsight bias task. Older adults showed hindsight bias more often than younger adults. Moreover, poorer long-term episodic memory and inhibition were {{associated with an increased}} probability <b>of</b> showing <b>hindsight</b> bias, after controlling for age.

500|$|There also {{continues}} to be debate {{about whether or not}} an alliance would have been a wise idea, and whether the Crusaders at that point in history were even relevant to the Persian-Mongol conflict. The 20th-century historian Glenn Burger said, [...] "The refusal of the Latin Christian states in the area to follow Hethum's example and adapt to changing conditions by allying themselves with the new Mongol empire must stand as one of the saddest of the many failures of Outremer." [...] This was similar to the view of Steven Runciman, who argued, [...] "Had the Mongol alliance been achieved and honestly implemented by the West, the existence of Outremer would almost certainly have been prolonged. The Mameluks would have been crippled if not destroyed; and the Ilkhanate of Persia would have survived as a power friendly to the Christians and the West".

500|$|In 1823, {{when he was}} 10, Verdi's parents {{arranged}} for the boy to attend school in Busseto, enrolling him in a Ginnasio—an upper school for boys—run by Don Pietro Seletti, while they continued to run their inn at Le Roncole. Verdi returned to Busseto regularly to play the organ on Sundays, covering the distance of several kilometres on foot. At age 11, Verdi received schooling in Italian, Latin, the humanities, and rhetoric. By {{the time he was}} 12, he began lessons with Ferdinando Provesi, maestro di cappella at San Bartolomeo, director of the municipal music school and co-director of the local Società Filarmonica (Philharmonic Society). Verdi later stated: [...] "From the ages of 13 to 18 I wrote a motley assortment of pieces: marches for band by the hundred, perhaps as many little sinfonie that were used in church, in the theatre and at concerts, five or six concertos and sets of variations for pianoforte, which I played myself at concerts, many serenades, cantatas (arias, duets, very many trios) and various pieces of church music, of which I remember only a Stabat Mater." [...] This information comes from the Autobiographical Sketch which Verdi dictated to the publisher Giulio Ricordi late in life, in 1879, and remains the leading source for his early life and career. Written, understandably, with the benefit <b>of</b> <b>hindsight,</b> it is not always reliable when dealing with issues more contentious than those of his childhood.|$|E
500|$|Similar fossils were {{reported}} in 1902 from nearby Mount Field, {{another part of the}} Stephen formation. These may have been why Charles Doolittle Walcott visited Mount Field in 1909. While taking photographs there Walcott found a slab of fossils that he described as [...] "Phyllopod crustaceans". From late August to early September 1909, his team, including his family, collected fossils there, and in 1910 Walcott opened a quarry that he and his colleagues re-visited in 1911, 1912, 1913, 1917 and 1924, bringing back over 60,000 specimens in total. Walcott was Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1907 to his death in 1927, and this kept him so busy that he was still trying to make time for analyzing his finds two years before his death. Although he drew attention to the exceptional detail of the specimens, which were the first known fossils of soft-bodied animals from the Cambrian period, he also had other research interests: the Early Paleozoic stratigraphy of the Canadian Rockies, which took up the great majority of his time there; and Precambrian fossils of algae and bacteria, to which he assigned as much importance as to the fossils of animals. He managed to publish four [...] "preliminary" [...] papers on the fossil animals in 1911 and 1912, and further articles in 1918, 1919 and 1920. Four years after Walcott's death his associate Charles Resser produced a package of additional descriptions from Walcott's notes. Walcott's classifications of most of the fossils are now rejected, but were supported at the time, and he accepted a change for one of the few where his conclusion was disputed. Many of the later comments were made with the benefits <b>of</b> <b>hindsight,</b> and of techniques and concepts unknown in Walcott's time.|$|E

50|$|Hindsight bias {{results in}} being {{held to a}} higher {{standard}} in court. The defense is particularly susceptible to these effects, since their actions are the ones being scrutinized by the jury. Due to the hindsight bias, defendants are judged as capable of preventing the bad outcome. Though much stronger for the defendants, hindsight bias also affects the plaintiffs. In cases where there is an assumption <b>of</b> risk, <b>hindsight</b> bias may contribute to the jurors perceiving the event as riskier due to the poor outcome. This may lead the jury to feel that the plaintiff should have exercised greater caution in the situation. Both of these effects can be minimized if attorneys put the jury in a position of foresight rather than hindsight through the use of language and timelines. Judges and juries are likely to mistakenly view negative events as being more foreseeable than what it really was in the moment, when looking at the situation after the fact in court. Encouraging people to explicitly think about the counterfactuals was an effective means <b>of</b> reducing the <b>hindsight</b> bias. In other words, people became less attached to the actual outcome and were more open to consider alternative lines of reasoning prior to the event. Judges involved in fraudulent transfer litigation cases were subject to the hindsight bias as well, resulting in an unfair advantage for the plaintiff, showing that jurors {{are not the only ones}} sensitive to the effects <b>of</b> the <b>hindsight</b> bias in the courtroom.|$|R
