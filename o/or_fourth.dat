5|$|According to {{historian}} Gyula Kristó, Stephen's third (unnamed) {{daughter was}} {{the wife of}} Despot Jacob Svetoslav. Stephen's third (<b>or</b> <b>fourth)</b> daughter, Elizabeth, {{who was born in}} about 1260, became a Dominican nun in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island. She was appointed prioress in 1277, but her brother, Ladislaus, kidnapped and married her to a Czech baron, Zavis of Falkenstein, in 1288. Stephen's youngest daughter, Anna, was born in about 1260. She married Andronikos Palaiologos, son and heir of the Byzantine Emperor, Michael VIII.|$|E
5|$|After {{competing}} for a Canadiens roster {{spot in the}} 2007 NHL pre-season, Lapierre was returned to the Bulldogs to start the 2007–08 season. On December 5, 2007, he was recalled to the Canadiens, earning a role as the club's third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> line centre. His time with the Canadiens increased as he spent 53 games in the NHL with seven goals and 18 points, while registering 14 points over 19 games in the AHL.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, the 1995 season started on April 25, and was shortened to 144 games instead of the normal 162. California took an early lead in the AL West standings and traded first place with Texas through May and June. They took the lead on July 2, and held on to that lead throughout the rest of July and all of August. Seattle, meanwhile, spent most of June through August in third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> place. They would bottom out on August 2, 13 games out of first place.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, {{it is there}} that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, with the four palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> digits, only one on the second digit and two on the third digit. These two external fingers were extremely short and immobile. Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E
5|$|Kolb {{was rated}} as the sixth-best {{quarterback in the}} 2007 NFL Draft by NFLDraftScout.com, and was {{projected}} to be drafted in the third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> round. He hired Jeff Nalley and Vann McElroy as his agents prior to the draft, and they hired former NFL quarterback Jerry Rhome to work with Kolb to get him ready for the pre-draft workouts. He worked out with Danny Arnold in Stafford, Texas in February 2007 in order {{to prepare for the}} NFL Scouting Combine. Kolb worked out for the Baltimore Ravens {{in the first week of}} April, and followed it up with a visit to the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E

5|$|Lapierre {{is known}} {{primarily}} as a checking forward, centring either the third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> line. He {{has a reputation as}} an agitator, distracting and provoking opposing players to take penalties. He plays with an aggressive edge and led all Canadiens forward in hits in his last full season with the club. Defensively responsible, he earns time on the penalty kill. In 2008–09, he ranked third on the Canadiens in average short handed time on ice per game.|$|E
5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> with 15percent or less support.|$|E
5|$|Neither team got {{a hit in}} {{the third}} <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> innings. The only runners to reach base were Whitey Kurowski and Marion, both on walks. The fifth started that the same way, with Slaughter and Moore flying out. With two outs however, the Cardinals started hitting. Musial doubled, Kurowski walked, Slaughter tripled, and Dusak singled. All but Dusak scored on the hits, {{bringing}} the score to 5–1 and ending Hatten's day. Hank Behrman came on in relief. Behrman kept any more runs from scoring, and after another inning in which the Dodgers did not record a hit, the score was 5–1 {{at the end of}} the fifth.|$|E

By the third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> day the papules filled with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles. This fluid became opaque and turbid within 24–48 hours, giving them the appearance of pustules; however, the so-called pustules were filled with tissue debris, not pus.|$|E
5|$|The game {{then became}} a pitcher's duel; Maglie and Newcombe did not allow a hit in the third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> innings. In the fifth, Billy Cox singled on a bunt, and Thomson hit a double, but the score {{remained}} 1–0 through five innings. Duke Snider singled in the sixth inning, but was caught stealing second. Neither team got another hit until the seventh inning. Rube Walker singled for the Dodgers, and Monte Irvin led off {{the bottom of the}} seventh with a double for the Giants. He reached third base after a bunt, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Thomson, tying the score at one run each.|$|E
5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler than adults, {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale eyebrow and larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.|$|E

5|$|From the 1963 season, Brabham was partnered by American driver Dan Gurney, {{the pair}} now running in Australia's racing colours {{of green and}} gold. Brabham took the team's first win at the non-championship Solitude Grand Prix in 1963. Gurney took the marque's first two wins in the world championship, at the 1964 French and Mexican Grands Prix. Brabham works and {{customer}} cars took another three non-championship wins during the 1964 season. The 1965 season was less successful, with no championship wins. Brabham finished third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> in the Constructors' Championship for three years running, but poor reliability marred promising performances on several occasions. Motor sport authors Mike Lawrence and David Hodges have said {{that a lack of}} resources may have cost the team results, a view echoed by Tauranac.|$|E
5|$|In 1469 Thomas Mathew (died 1469), {{the third}} <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> son of Sir David Mathew (died 1484) of Llandaf, {{inherited}} the land by marriage to Catherine, heiress of Radyr, and built Radyr Court, a manor {{house on the}} site of what is now the Radyr Court Inn in Danescourt. The house was used as a court. Although it was destroyed by a fire in the 19th century, the three large dungeons survived and can still be seen at the Inn. On Thomas' death, his lands passed to his eldest son David and then to his younger son William Mathew (died 1528), who was knighted by King Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Sir William accompanied Henry VIII to the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. His successor was his eldest son Sir George Mathew, who became MP for Glamorganshire and in 1545 Sheriff of Glamorgan.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's second (or third) wife, Maria of Mangup, was of {{the family}} of the princes of Theodoro. She was {{probably}} also cousins with the Muscovite Grand Princess Sophia Palaiologina, and was related to Trebizond's royal couple, Emperor David and Empress Maria. The Stephen–Maria marriage took place in September 1472, but she died in December 1477. During her brief stay in Moldavia, Maria supported the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople, contributing to the friendly contacts between Stephen and Catholic powers. Stephen's third (<b>or</b> <b>fourth)</b> wife, Maria Voichița, was the daughter of Radu the Fair, Voivode of Wallachia. She was the mother of Stephen's immediate successor, Bogdan, and a daughter named Maria Cneajna. The latter married into the House of Sanguszko. Stephen is known to have fathered two other sons who died in childhood, {{at a time when he}} was married to Maria Voichița: Bogdan died in 1479, and Peter (Petrașco) in 1480. Scholars are divided as to whether their mother was Evdochia or Maria. Archivist Aurelian Sacerdoțeanu believes that Bogdan also had a twin, Iliaș.|$|E

5|$|The broad, {{triangular}} pectoral fins originate {{below the}} third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> gill slits, and {{are no longer}} than the front margin of the first dorsal fin. The anal fin is about {{twice as long as}} the second dorsal fin and preceded by long ridges. The first dorsal fin originates over the pectoral fin free rear tips, and the much smaller second dorsal fin originates over the last third of the anal fin base. The dorsal fins do not have a ridge between them. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well-developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip. This shark is plain gray, brown-gray, or purple-gray above, and white below. The leading edge of the first dorsal fin and the trailing edge of the caudal fin may be dark, and the trailing edges of the pectoral fins may be light.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar to}} the cervical vertebrae, but have taller and more prong-like neural spines. The rest are amphiplatyan, meaning that they are flat at both ends. They also have postzygapophyses which are less elongate and more pedestal-like, in addition to taller and more rectangular neural spines. The parapophyses, which are depressions instead of projections, have moved off from the transverse processes to the neural arch, between the transverse processes and the articular processes known as the prezygapophyses {{at the front of the}} vertebrae. However, they move back onto the base of the transverse processes in the last few dorsals. In the third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> dorsal, the parapophysis is located very close to the suture between the neural spine and the centrum, which is unlike the other dorsals but similar to the first few dorsals in Edmontosaurus. Also like Edmontosaurus, the median ridge separating the prezygapophyses become more pronounced in the rear dorsals.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was free}} to play {{regularly}} for Middlesex in 1924. The team {{was involved in a}} close race for the County Championship with Yorkshire, and Allen had several successful matches. He ended the season with 568 runs at 21.84 and 50 wickets at 17.48. Playing less often in 1925, he scored 392 runs, took 39 wickets, and scored his maiden first-class century in the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval. He was also chosen {{for the first time to}} represent the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, where he scored 52, and his reputation grew steadily. By the beginning of the 1926 season, he and fellow fast bowler Harold Larwood were tipped in the press to be chosen for the England team against Australia that summer. Allen began well for Middlesex but was less successful in a trial match to help choose the England team. Larwood was chosen for the Test series; Allen was not. In county cricket, Allen scored his first century for Middlesex, and began to open the bowling occasionally, having been the third <b>or</b> <b>fourth</b> bowler in previous seasons. Overall, he scored 771 runs, the highest seasonal aggregate of his career, at an average of 29.65 and took 44 wickets at 28.27.|$|E
500|$|Homophony has {{appeared}} in several non-Western cultures, perhaps particularly in regions where communal vocal music has been cultivated. When explorer Vasco da Gama landed in West Africa in 1497, {{he referred to the}} music he heard there as being in [...] "sweet harmony". While the concept of harmony in that time was not necessarily the same as the concept of homophony as understood by modern scholars, it is generally accepted that homophonic voice harmonies were commonplace in African music for centuries before contact with Europeans and is common in African music today. Singers normally harmonize voices in homophonic parallelism moving in parallel thirds <b>or</b> <b>fourths.</b> This type of harmonic model is also, implemented in instrumental music where voices are stacked in thirds <b>or</b> <b>fourths.</b> Homophonic Parallelism is not restricted to thirds and fourths, however all harmonic material adheres to the scalar system the particular tune or song is based on. The use of harmony in sixths is common in areas where a hexatonic scale system is used [...] For instance, the Fang people of Gabon use homophony in their music.|$|R
