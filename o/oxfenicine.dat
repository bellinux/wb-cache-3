Tissue specificity of <b>oxfenicine</b> inhibition of fatty acid oxidation was due to greater <b>oxfenicine</b> transaminase activity in heart and to greater sensitivity of heart carnitine palmitoyltransferase I to inhibition by 4 -hydroxyphenylglyoxylate [I 50 (concentration giving 50 % inhibition) of 11 and 510 microM for the enzymes of heart and liver mitochondria, respectively]. Branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase (isoenzyme I, EC 2. 6. 1. 42) was responsible for the transamination of <b>oxfenicine</b> in heart. A positive correlation was found between the capacity of various tissues to transaminate <b>oxfenicine</b> and the known content of branched-chain-amino-acid aminotransferase in these tissues. Out of three observed liver <b>oxfenicine</b> aminotransferase activities, one may correspond to asparagine aminotransferase, but the major activity could not be identified by partial purification and characterization. As reported previously for malonyl-CoA inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, 4 -hydroxyphenylglyoxylate inhibition of this enzyme was found to be very pH-dependent. In striking contrast with the kinetics of malonyl-CoA inhibition, 4 -hydroxyphenylglyoxylate inhibition was not affected by oleoyl-CoA concentration, but was partially reversed by increasing carnitine concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Purpose By {{increasing}} circulating free {{fatty acids}} {{and the rate of}} fatty acid oxidation, obesity decreases glucose oxidation and myocardial tolerance to ischemia. Partial inhibition of fatty acid oxidation may improve myocardial tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in obesity. We assessed the effects of <b>oxfenicine</b> treatment on post ischemic cardiac function and myocardial infarct size in obese rats. Methods Male Wistar rats were fed a control diet or a high calorie diet which resulted in diet induced obesity (DIO) for 16 weeks. <b>Oxfenicine</b> (200 mg/kg/day) was administered to control and DIO rats for the last 8 weeks. Isolated hearts were perfused and infarct size and post ischemic cardiac function was assessed after regional or global ischemia and reperfusion. Cardiac mitochondrial function was assessed and myocardial expression and activity of CPT- 1 (carnitine palmitoyl transferase- 1) and IRS- 1 (insulin receptor substrate- 1) was assessed using Western blot analysis. Results In the DIO rats, chronic <b>oxfenicine</b> treatment improved post ischemic cardiac function and reducedmyocardial infarct size after I/R but had no effect on the cardiac mitochondrial respiration. Chronic <b>oxfenicine</b> treatment worsened post ischemic cardiac function, myocardial infarct size and basal mitochondrial respiration in control rat hearts. Basal respiratory control index (RCI) values, state 2 and state 4 respiration rates and ADP phosphorylation rates were compromised by <b>oxfenicine</b> treatment. Conclusion Chronic <b>oxfenicine</b> treatment improved myocardial tolerance to I/R in the obese rat hearts but decreased myocardial tolerance to I/R in control rat hearts. This decreased tolerance to ischemia of <b>oxfenicine</b> treated controls was associated with adverse changes in basal and reoxygenation mitochondrial function.

40|$|Perhexiline is {{a potent}} {{prophylactic}} anti-anginal agent that {{has been shown to}} inhibit myocardial utilization of long-chain fatty acids and to inhibit the mitochondrial enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) - 1. We compared the hemodynamic and biochemical effects of perhexiline (0. 5 and 2. 0 microM) and of another CPT- 1 inhibitor, <b>oxfenicine</b> (0. 5 mM), in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to 60 min of low-flow ischemia (95 % flow reduction) followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Both perhexiline (2 microM only) and <b>oxfenicine</b> attenuated (p < 0. 003, p < 0. 0002, respectively) increases in diastolic tension during ischemia, without significant effects on developed tension, or on cardiac function during reperfusion. Myocardial concentrations of long-chain acylcarnitines (LCAC), products of CPT- 1 action, were decreased (p < 0. 05) by <b>oxfenicine,</b> unaffected by 2 microM perhexiline, and increased slightly by 0. 5 microM perhexiline. Perhexiline, but not the active metabolite of <b>oxfenicine,</b> also inhibited cardiac CPT- 2 with similar IC 50 and Emax, although lower Hill slope, compared with CPT- 1. <b>Oxfenicine,</b> but not perhexiline, reduced concentrations of the endogenous CPT- 1 inhibitor, malonyl-CoA. Perhexiline, but not <b>oxfenicine,</b> inhibited myocardial release of lactate during normal flow. We conclude that (a) perhexiline protects against diastolic dysfunction during ischemia in this model, independent of major changes in LCAC accumulation and (b) this may result from simultaneous effects of perhexiline on myocardial CPT- 1 and CPT- 2...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In the {{treatment}} of patients with diabetes, one objective is an improvement of cardiac metabolism to alleviate the left ventricular (LV) function. For this study, we compared the effects of acetyl-l-carnitine (one of the carnitine derivatives) and of <b>oxfenicine</b> (a carnitine palmitoyltransferase- 1 inhibitor) on cardiac pumping mechanics in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in male Wistar rats, with a particular focus on the pressure-flow-volume relationship. METHODS: Diabetes was induced by a single tail vein injection of 55 mg kg(- 1) streptozotocin. The diabetic animals were treated {{on a daily basis}} with either acetyl-L-carnitine (1 g L(- 1) in drinking water) or <b>oxfenicine</b> (150 mg kg(- 1) by oral gavage) for 8 wk. They were also compared with untreated age-matched diabetic controls. LV pressure and ascending aortic flow signals were recorded to calculate the maximal systolic elastance (E max) and the theoretical maximum flow (Q max). Physically, E max reflects the contractility of the myocardium as an intact heart, whereas Q max has an inverse relationship with the LV internal resistance. RESULTS: When comparing the diabetic rats with their age-matched controls, the cardiodynamic condition was characterized by a decline in E max associated with the unaltered Q max. Acetyl-l-carnitine (but not <b>oxfenicine)</b> had reduced cardiac levels of malondialdehyde in these insulin-deficient animals. However, treating with acetyl-l-carnitine or <b>oxfenicine</b> resulted in an increase in E max, which suggests that these 2 drugs may protect the contractile status from deteriorating in the diabetic heart. By contrast, Q max showed a significant fall after administration of <b>oxfenicine,</b> but not with acetyl-L-carnitine. The decrease in Q max corresponded to an increase in total vascular resistance when treated with <b>oxfenicine.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Acetyl-l-carnitine, but not oxfencine, optimizes the integrative nature of cardiac pumping mechanics by preventing the diabetes-induced deterioration in myocardial intrinsic contractility associated with unaltered LV internal resistance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCardiac {{hypertrophy}} is characterised by {{an imbalance}} between lipid uptake and fatty acid β-oxidation {{leading to an}} accumulation of lipids, particularly triacylglycerol (TAG). It is unclear whether uptake mechanisms such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL) can be attenuated to diminish this uptake. Rats were cold acclimated to induce cardiac hypertrophy and increase cardiac LPL. Lipid uptake and metabolism were altered by feeding a ‘Western-style’ high fat diet (WSD) or feeding <b>oxfenicine</b> (2 g/L) in the drinking water. Diastolic stiffness (increased volume change/unit pressure change) was induced in hypertrophied hearts for rats fed WSD (P< 0. 05) or WSD+oxfenicine (P< 0. 01), although absolute performance of cardiac muscle, estimated from stress–strain calculations was unchanged. Cold acclimation increased cardiac endothelial LPL (P< 0. 05) but this was diminished following <b>oxfenicine.</b> Following WSD LPL was further decreased below WSD-fed control hearts (P< 0. 05) with no further decrease by <b>oxfenicine</b> supplementation. A negative correlation was noted between plasma TAG and endothelial LPL (correlation coefficient=− 0. 654; P< 0. 001) but not cardiac TAG concentration. Transcript levels of angiopoietin-like protein- 4 (ANGPTL 4) were increased 6 -fold by WSD (P< 0. 05) and increased 15 -fold following WSD+oxfenicine (P< 0. 001). For CA-hearts fed WSD or WSD+oxfenicine ANGPTL 4 mRNA levels were preserved at chow-fed levels. VLDLR protein levels were increased 10 -fold (P< 0. 01) by CA. ANGPTL 4 protein levels were increased 2 -fold (P< 0. 05) by WSD, but restored following <b>oxfenicine.</b> For CA-hearts WSD increased ANGPTL 4 protein levels 3 -fold (P< 0. 01) with WSD+oxfenicine increasing ANGPTL 4 protein 4 -fold (P< 0. 01). These data suggest that endothelial LPL levels in the heart are altered to maintain FA flux and may exploit ANGPTL 4...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Free {{fatty acid}} (FFA) {{oxidation}} is depressed in the postischaemic stunned myocardium and recovers {{in parallel with}} the normalization of contractile performance. Assuming a causal role for this metabolic disturbance in the pathogenesis of stunning, we questioned whether exogenous administration of high dose triglycerides during reperfusion of postischaemic myocardium, could improve its functional recovery. METHODS: Thirteen dogs were chronically instrumented to measure global and regional haemodynamics and to produce a 10 min episode of regional myocardial ischaemia. In 7 dogs, Intralipid 20 % was administered i. v. during the reperfusion phase. Contractile recovery of stunned myocardium was compared with control saline treatments. The series were repeated in another 6 animals, but <b>oxfenicine</b> (CPT I inhibitor) preceeded Intralipid during reperfusion. RESULTS: Contractile recovery of stunned myocardium was faster and more extensive when Intralipid was administered during reperfusion than with saline treatment (wall thickening fraction 86 +/- 6 % of preischaemic controls versus 52 +/- 11 % at 90 min post-reperfusion; P < 0. 05). <b>Oxfenicine</b> pretreatment completely abolished this beneficial effect. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous administration of triglycerides during reperfusion of postischaemic myocardium improves functional recovery from stunning. This beneficial effect most likely operates through enhanced FFA availability and/or oxidation since it could be abolished by selective inhibition of the carnitine palmitoyl I enzyme. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} studied {{the relation between}} long-chain fatty acid and pyruvate metabolism in reperfused myocardium and noted a rapid return of fatty acid oxidation to at least preischemic values accompanied by a marked decrease in pyruvate oxidation. The {{purpose of the present}} report is to further characterize carbohydrate metabolism during reflow by describing rates of glucose oxidation using [6 -'*C]glucose. Chddative performance was deter-mined with and without preserved fatty acid utilization; the latter condition was effected by <b>oxfenicine,</b> which inhibits palmitoylcarnitine transferase I. In the main protocol, two groups of working swine hearts (n = 18) were perfused aeroblcaUy for 30 minutes, rendered regionally ischemic (- 60 A % in anterior descending coronary flow) for 45 minutes, and reperfused at control flows for a final 50 minutes of perfusion. An emulsion of Intralipid with heparin was administered systemically throughout the studies to augment serum fatty acids (average fatty acid values, 1. 05 ± 0. 05 /u. mol/ml for both groups). Serum glucose was monitored and main-tained at or about 100 rag/dl with additional infusions of glucose as needed. <b>Oxfenicine</b> (33 mg/kg) was administered systemically by bolus injection at time 0 and 60 minutes of perfusion in nine animals.

40|$|Inhibition of {{myocardial}} {{fatty acid}} oxidation can improve left ventricular (LV) mechanical efficiency by increasing LV power {{for a given}} rate of myocardial energy expenditure. This phenomenon has not been assessed at high workloads in nonischemic myocardium; therefore, we subjected in vivo pig hearts to a high workload for 5 min and assessed whether blocking mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation with the carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I inhibitor <b>oxfenicine</b> would improve LV mechanical efficiency. In addition, the cardiac content of malonyl-CoA (an endogenous inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I) and activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (which synthesizes malonyl-CoA) were assessed. Increased workload was induced by aortic constriction and dobutamine infusion, and LV efficiency was calculated from the LV pressure-volume loop and LV energy expenditure. In untreated pigs, the increase in LV power resulted in a 2. 5 -fold increase in fatty acid oxidation and cardiac malonyl-CoA content but {{did not affect the}} activation state of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The activation state of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitory kinase AMP-activated protein kinase decreased by 40 % with increased cardiac workload. Pretreatment with <b>oxfenicine</b> inhibited fatty acid oxidation by 75 % and had no effect on cardiac energy expenditure but significantly increased LV power and LV efficiency (37 ± 5 % vs. 26 ± 5 %, P < 0. 05) at high workload. In conclusion, 1) myocardial fatty acid oxidation increases with a short-term increase in cardiac workload, despite an increase in malonyl-CoA concentration, and 2) inhibition of fatty acid oxidation improves LV mechanical efficiency by increasing LV power without affecting cardiac energy expenditure.

We tested whether the inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I (CPT-I), the enzyme regulating mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, slows left ventricular remodeling and deterioration of function in pacing-induced HF. METHODS: Normal dogs (n= 9) were compared to untreated dogs with pacing-induced HF (n= 9) and HF dogs treated with 65 mg/kg/day of <b>oxfenicine</b> (HF+Oxf, n= 9), a CPT-I inhibitor. RESULTS: HF+Oxf reached terminal failure (LV end-diastolic pressure= 25 mm Hg) 6 days later than untreated HF (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The primary {{effect of}} {{ischemia}} is reduced aerobic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation in mitochondria. This triggers accelerated glycolysis and reduced cell pH, Ca 2 + accumulation, K+ efflux, adenosine formation, and the clinical signs of ischemia: chest pain and {{a shift in}} the ST segment. Traditional therapies for angina are aimed at either decreasing the need for ATP by suppressing heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility, or at increasing oxy-gen delivery to the mitochondria, or both. An additional approach to treating angina is to sup-press myocardial fatty acid oxidation, increase pyruvate oxidation, and reduce anaerobic gly-colysis. High fatty acid levels result in oxygen wasting and inhibit the oxidation of pyruvate in the mitochondria. In experimental models, the partial inhibition of myocardial fatty acid oxidation with agents such as <b>oxfenicine,</b> ranolazine, and trimetazidine stimulates glucose oxidation and reduces lactate production during ischemia. Clinical studies demonstrate that this approach is as effective as traditional hemodynamic therapies at improving exercise tol-erance and reducing the frequency of angina. Moreover, because these agents do not suppress heart rate, blood pressure, or contractility, they are effective as add-on therapy to Ca 2 +-chan-nel and P-adrenergic receptor antagonists...|$|E
40|$|A {{high rate}} of cardiac work {{increases}} citric acid cycle (CAC) turnover and flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH); however, the mechanisms for these effects are poorly understood. We tested the hypotheses that an increase in cardiac energy expenditure: (1) activates PDH and reduces the product/substrate ratios ([NADH]/[NAD+] and [acetyl-CoA]/[CoA-SH]); and (2) increases the content of CAC intermediates. Measurements were made in anaesthetized pigs under control conditions and during 15 min of a high cardiac workload induced by dobutamine (Dob). A third group was made hyperglycaemic (14 mm) to stimulate flux through PDH during the high work state (Dob + Glu). Glucose and fatty acid oxidation were measured with 14 C-glucose and 3 H-oleate. Compared with control, the high workload groups had a similar increase in myocardial oxygen consumption (and cardiac power. Dob increased PDH activity and glucose oxidation above control, but did not reduce the [NADH]/[NAD+] and [acetyl-CoA]/[CoA-SH] ratios, {{and there were no}} differences between the Dob and Dob + Glu groups. An additional group was treated with Dob + Glu and <b>oxfenicine</b> (Oxf) to inhibit fatty acid oxidation: this increased [CoA-SH] and glucose oxidation compared with Dob; however, there was no further activation of PDH or decrease in the [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio. Content of the 4 -carbon CAC intermediates succinate, fumarate and malate increased 3 -fold with Dob, but there was no change in citrate content, and the Dob + Glu and Dob + Glu + Oxf groups were not different from Dob. In conclusion, compared with normal conditions, at high myocardial energy expenditure (1) the increase in flux through PDH is regulated by activation of the enzyme complex and continues to be partially controlled through inhibition by fatty acid oxidation, and (2) there is expansion of the CAC pool size at the level of 4 -carbon intermediates that is largely independent of myocardial fatty acid oxidation...|$|E

The role of inhibition of the CPT enzymes responsible for accumulation of long chain acylcarnitines (LCAC) during hypoxia in the proximal tubule {{has not been}} previously examined. We have characterized CPT enzyme activities in mitochondrial fractions of rabbit proximal tubules. Malonyl CoA-sensitive CPT I activity (1. 1 ± 0. 3 nmol/min/mg protein), and detergent-solubilized, malonyl CoA-insensitive CPT II activity (2. 3 ± 0. 4 nmol/min/mg protein) were readily detected in proximal tubule mitochondrial fractions. Subjecting rabbit proximal tubules to various periods of hypoxia did not significantly change mitochondrial CPT I or CPT II activities. Thirty minutes of hypoxia resulted {{in an increase in}} lysophospholipid mass from 440 ± 105 to 720 ± 93 pmol/mg protein, N = 5, LCAC mass from 79 ± 11 to 618 ± 34 pmol/mg protein, N = 5, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from 9 ± 1 % to 46 ± 3 %, N = 8. Pretreatment of proximal tubules with two different CPT inhibitors, glybenclamide (Glyb) 400 µM and <b>oxfenicine</b> (Oxfe) 1 mM, resulted in reduction in the magnitude of hypoxia-induced lysophospholipid formation 490 ± 160 (Glyb), 342 ± 150 pmol/mg protein (Oxfe), N = 4, hypoxia-induced LCAC formation 295 ± 27 (Glyb), 128 ± 16 pmol/mg protein (Oxfe), N = 5, and LDH release 25 ± 1 % (Glyb) and 19 ± 2 % (Oxfe), N = 8. The protective effect of CPT inhibition was also associated with increased production of lactate suggesting the modulation of a substrate-mediated metabolic switch. Immunoblots demonstrated that hypoxia caused a time dependent hydrolysis of fodrin-alpha subunit and that CPT inhibition protected against hypoxia-induced fodrin proteolysis. These data suggest a unifying hypothesis that links phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activation, and hypoxia-mediated fodrin proteolysis to the proximal tubule mitochondrial CPT system.
