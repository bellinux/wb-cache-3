5000|$|One of Utz’s major {{contributions}} to scholarship {{is the introduction}} of the paradigm of Literary Nominalism to the study of medieval literature, specifically the works of Geoffrey Chaucer. Grover Furr called Utz [...] "perhaps the foremost exponent of the 'paradigm' of Nominalist influence upon late Medieval English literature. His own book and the collection of essays which he edited in 1995, are among the leading causes of the revival of interest by literary scholars in the influence of Nominalism." [...] Utz's posits the possibility of correspondences between late medieval philosophy/religion and literature. More specifically, he finds in certain features of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde and Canterbury Tales echoes of late medieval nominalist mentalities, a strand of thought cultural historians such as Rosario Assunto, Friedrich Heer, Erwin Panofsky, and Hans Blumenberg count among the decisive factors ushering in the formation of modern Europe. He claims that the author's literary nominalism led him to: construct narratives that center on the ontological status of universals and particulars (with a preference for the latter); focus on the radical contingency of language; challenge allegorical (hence: Neoplatonic ‘realist’) forms <b>of</b> <b>narrative,</b> <b>character,</b> and argument; experiment with non-conclusive, contingent, indeterminate, and fragmentary poetic structures; see a relationship between the God’s absolute and ordinate powers on the one hand, and God and humanity, rulers, subjects, and authors on the other. These late medieval nominalist features, Utz proposes, may well be responsible for modern readers' pronounced preference for Chaucer over other, more typically medieval writers. Scholars beholden to more traditional readings of late medieval poetry have been critical of Utz's perhaps too broad application of the paradigm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Role-playing {{games have}} many qualities <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> (<b>character,</b> plot, setting), {{yet they have}} {{received}} virtually no attention from narratologists. This essay discusses the way that role-playing games construct narrative worlds and compares that to recent theories of fiction based on possible-world models. In both, {{emphasis is placed on}} the objects that make up this world. In role-playing games and recent theories of fictional world, this essay argues, emphasis on objects makes possible intertextual comparisons, which in turn help to define and rejuvenate the agency of readers and critics against the backdrop of challenges to that agency by market culture and structuralist literary theory. Role-playing games (RPGs) developed during the 1970 s primarily in the United States and Britain. In such games, a group of players (at least three, but possibly as many as a dozen) take on the roles of fictional characters in some alternate universe. They generate basic statistics that represent the acquired skills and physical attributes of these characters. One of these players will serve as the referee and design this universe, creating settings to explore and opponents to confront.

40|$|Music {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} forces in film, and composers’ varied use of orchestration and sound is fundamental to the impact of music in this medium. From the live accompaniments of the earliest silent film, to the lush orchestrations of the ‘golden age’, to the electronic and experimental scores of the twenty-first century, the role of orchestration, timbre and sound has been pivotal to the function of music in film and its ability to shape and inform narrative, character and theme (Gorbman, 1987). In an increasingly vast and constantly evolving body of film music, two figures stand out as proponents of contrasting compositional approaches to orchestration in film: Bernard Herrmann and John Williams (Cooke, 2004). Their work reveals orchestration and compositional considerations as powerful tools that contribute to dramatic elements <b>of</b> <b>narrative,</b> <b>character</b> and theme. To understand these approaches their influences and contexts must be discussed (Part I). Analysing the contrasting orchestral approaches of Herrmann and Williams in their respective films The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951) and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977) sheds light on the contrasting ways orchestration is approached to influence dramatic elements in film (Part II). It is important to examine the legacy of Herrmann and Williams’ contrasting approaches in more recent film music such as the representative scores of Thomas Newman (Wall-E (Stanton, 2008)) and Stephen Price (Gravity, (Cuarun, 2013)) to fully examine the role of orchestration in film today (Part III) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how {{selected}} "decadent-dandyist" {{writers of}} late 19 th century France at once exemplify and subvert the self's act of shaping and imprinting its own selfhood upon the world: {{a model in}} which an autonomous, discrete artist-self freely creates, and in which both reader/audience and artistic "subjects" are treated as raw canvas and denied agency of their own. Storytellers like Barbey D'Aurevilly, Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, J. K. Huysmans, and Remy de Gourmont create not only hyper-artificial, cloistered, "auto-telic" (to use Charles Taylor's term) textual worlds (e. g. Huysmans' theïbade raffinée) but also hyper-artificial selves : presenting themselves and their often autobiographical protagonists as dandy-artists for whom artistic creation {{is an extension of}} self-creation. 	 Central to this thesis is the 19 th century figure of the dandy â he who, to quote D'Aurevilly, "[causes] surprise in others, and [has] the proud satisfaction of never showing any oneself. " Appropriating the divine power of self-fashioning, the dandy transforms the chaos of existence into a clear narrative over which he alone exerts control, denying that he himself is subject to the control of the world. 	 In my thesis, I first explore the cultural and economic roots of this understanding of the autonomous dandyist-artist in the light of wider tensions in 19 th century Paris. I then explore selected "decadent-dandyist" texts through close reading, focusing on the theological implications of our authorsâ treatment <b>of</b> <b>narrative,</b> <b>character,</b> setting, and language: showing how our writers cast doubt on both the possibility and morality "autonomous" creation on theological grounds. Finally, I ask how constructive theologians might learn from our authorsâ condemnation of "dandyist" storytelling to create a new Christian aesthetics for the novel: proposing elements of an alternate, "kenotic" novel, in which self-projection gives way to "self-giving", a model based not on power and ego but rather on love. </p...|$|E
40|$|For {{several decades}} TV {{scholars}} {{have noted that}} genre hybridity is a characteristic of ‘quality’ television drama. Applying ‘quality’ as a categorisation or description rather than a judgement about value, Robert Thompson (1997) and subsequent scholars argue that combining genres {{is an integral part}} of what makes ‘quality’ television drama recognisable and appealing to both critics and viewers. Like many other contemporary television dramas, Pushing Daisies liberally mixes genre influences, from crime drama, to horror, to romantic comedy, transforming the conventions of each through their juxtaposition with other, apparently dissimilar, elements. This makes for a heady mix that potentially attracts viewers who might not watch a more firmly genre-based show, drawing in dark fantasy fans who may never choose romantic comedy, for instance. In some cases, such as Dexter, genre hybridity achieves a seamlessness that enables the show to transcend genre. In others, the genre influences are perceived as colliding rather than fusing, warring with each other rather than merging into a coherent whole, and leading to early cancellation. More than one academic analysis of Twin Peaks suggests that it failed because once the murder of Laura Palmer was solved viewers, seeing the show primarily as a whodunit, stopped watching. This is perhaps particularly the case with shows that mobilise genre visually, or that offer a high level of visual distinctiveness as part of their style. At one time television was, by its very nature, considered to be predictable and inoffensive. Visual distinctiveness has become another marker of ‘quality’ and an essential tool in marketing a show yet, even now, there are limits to what television will accept. The short-lived Firefly, for instance, combined iconic images from both science fiction and the western, confusing the network about how to sell it and who to sell it to, despite praise from fans. Pushing Daisies exhibits a variety of genre influences on different levels, and this paper examines how these operate in terms <b>of</b> <b>narrative,</b> <b>character,</b> theme, and visual style. On the one hand, this fuses multiple genres into an original drama that is a natural development of current trends in television. On the other, arguably, conflicting codes and conventions collide, pushing the show into excesses that cannot be sustained...|$|E

40|$|My aim, in this work, is {{to analyze}} Alasdair MacIntyre’s {{theoretical}} system. MacIntyre (1929 -) is a Scottisch born and American ‘adopted’ philosopher. Critics usually framed his moral position {{as representative of}} current normative ethics of virtue inspired from Aristotle, and his political thought as conservative, seeing as how they consider MacIntyre as neo-comunitarian thinker. But, as I have tried to show, this is a misunderstanding of his political position. Anyway critics omits methodological aspect of macintyrean thought. For this reason, re-writing the history of modernity, exposed not only in After Virtue but also in others papers, this work show the theoretical path that drove Scottish philosopher, also through comparison with the philosophy of science, {{to build a new}} method of enquiry that is opposed to the explanatory-predictive method pursued by the ‘academic orthodoxy’. Indeed, this methodology, according to MacIntyre, omits history from philosophical enquiry and so brought our contemporary culture into a state of abysmal crisis: the ‘disquieting suggestion’. Since following efforts to provide a solution for the moral disagreement have failed, it was necessary to pinpoint another philosophical outlook to solve moral disagreement. In this perspective should be read processing of his historicist method that begin by acknowledgement <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>character</b> of reality. However this approach, developed by MacIntyre to give an appropriate answer to the problems of relativism and perspectivism, has resulted criticism of inconsistency: his position would remain entangled in a vicious circle. MacIntyre’s answer to the Enlightenment project failure has been labeled itself as a form of relativism by some critics, according to which, if the MacIntyre’s aim was to find a solution to the ‘disquieting suggestion’, he would have failed. He would not reply carefully to relativism and perspectivism. He {{would not be able to}} build a convincing theory that escapes relativism and perspectivism, ‘the protagonist of post–Enlightenment’: he would be a relativist thinker. How can this mistake be avoided? Answering to this challenge, in his later writings, MacIntyre does appeal to Aristotelian-Thomism’s synthesis and improves a concept of tradition as a intellectual inquiry. This is the deep meaning of the macintyrean tradition–constituted and tradition–constitutive method of enquiry, whose application on every level of investigation (epistemological, ethical and social and anthropological) allows the full intelligibility of philosophical and ethical concepts because far away from hypostatizing those concepts it gives a rational account by inserting them in the respective contexts of reference and treating them as part of a whole. The MacIntyre’s effort is thereby to connect his historical inquiry with the Aristotelian-Thomism’s metaphysics...|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} on identification with <b>narrative</b> <b>characters</b> poses two problems. First, although identification {{is seen as}} a dynamic process of which the intensity varies during reading, it is usually measured by means of post-reading questionnaires containing self-report items. Second, it is not clear which linguistic characteristics evoke identification. The present paper proposes that an interdisciplinary framework allows for more precise manipulations and measurements of identification, which will ultimately advance our understanding of the antecedents and nature of this process. The central hypothesis of our Linguistic Cues Framework is that identification with a <b>narrative</b> <b>character</b> is a multidimensional experience for which different dimensions are evoked by different linguistic cues. The first part of the paper presents a literature review on identification, resulting in a renewed conceptualization of identification which distinguishes six dimensions: a spatiotemporal, a perceptual, a cognitive, a moral, an emotional, and an embodied dimension. The second part argues that each of these dimensions is influenced by specific linguistic cues which represent various aspects <b>of</b> the <b>narrative</b> <b>character’s</b> perspective. The proposed relations between linguistic cues and identification dimensions are specified in six propositions. The third part discusses what psychological and neurocognitive methods enable the measurement of the various identification dimensions in order to test the propositions. By establishing explicit connections between the linguistic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> and readers’ physical, psychological, and neurocognitive responses to narratives, this paper develops a research agenda for future empirical {{research on}} identification with <b>narrative</b> <b>characters...</b>|$|R
