40|$|Magneto-optical {{films were}} {{prepared}} by coating nano-size Bi-YIG particles, <b>the</b> Faraday rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films</b> were measured. <b>The</b> particle size was changed by milling with a planetary milling machine from 1 h to 100 h.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> mixed metal oxide thin films and physical characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films.</b> <b>The</b> <b>films</b> were produced by co-evaporation of titanium oxide and tungsten oxide powders.

40|$|ZnO {{films were}} {{deposited}} on glass substrates by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique at a substrate temperature of 300 ± 5 ◦C.

40|$|ZnO {{thin films}} were {{prepared}} on Si (1 11) substrates at various temperatures from 250 to 700 degrees C using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique {{in order to}} investigate the structural and optical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films.</b> <b>The</b> structural and morphological properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films</b> were investigated by XRD and SEM measurements, respectively. <b>The</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films</b> was improved with <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature. By XRD patterns <b>the</b> FWHMs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> (0 0 2) peaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ZnO <b>films</b> became narrower when the temperatures were above 500 degrees C. <b>The</b> FWHMs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peaks <b>of</b> (0 0 2) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films</b> were as narrow as about 0. 19 degrees when films were grown at 650 and 700 degrees C. This indicates <b>the</b> superior crystallinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films.</b> <b>The</b> optical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>films</b> were studied by photoluminescence spectra using a 325 nm He-Cd laser. The two strongest UV peaks were found at 377. 9 nm from ZnO films grown at 650 and 700 degrees C. This result is consistent with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> XRD investigation. Broad bands in visible region from 450 to 550 nm were also observed.
