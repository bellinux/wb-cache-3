40|$|This paper {{describes}} a prototype {{implementation of a}} Distributed File System (DFS) based on the Adaptive Information Dispersal Algorithm (AIDA). Using AIDA, a file block is encoded and dispersed into smaller blocks stored {{on a number of}} DFS nodes distributed over a network. The implementation devises file creation, read, and write operations. In particular, when reading a file, the DFS accepts an <b>optional</b> <b>timing</b> constraint, which it uses to determine the level of redundancy needed for the read operation. The tighter the timing constraint, the more nodes in the DFS are queried for encoded blocks. Write operations update all blocks in all DFS nodes [...] with future implementations possibly including the use of read and write quorums. This work was conducted under the supervision of Professor Azer Bestavros (best@cs. bu. edu) in the Computer Science Department as part of Mohammad Makarechian's Master's project...|$|E

Circadian clocks are also assumed to enhance survival and reproductive fitness in part by promoting <b>optional</b> <b>timing</b> of behaviour and physiology in relation to regular cycles in the environment. Temperature fluctuations were studied in three different vertebrate species – Sylvilagus floridanus, Rattus norvegicus and Columba livia in relation to the rhythmicity of rectal temperature. Clinical digital thermometer was used to record the core temperature by inserting it 2 – 3 cm deep from the anal sphincter before taking readings 3 minutes after. The highest recorded mean rectal temperature for R. norvegicus and S. floridanus were 38. 85 ± 0. 40 0 C and 39. 83 ± 0. 32 0 C respectively with the lowest being 36. 58 ± 0. 74 0 C and 36. 63 ± 0. 18 0 C respectively. C. livia failed to exhibit core temperature fluctuation. There were not significant differences in the mean rectal temperature for both sexes for S. floridanus in relation to time of day. Differences in the circadian temperature fluctuations were traced to variation among the animals, of preferred temperature arising from differential behavioural and physiological regulation, in relation to environmental cues. It is also possible that daily changes in illumination were secondary to C. li via. The results also suggest that circadian rhythmicity persists even in artificially imposed selective environment. Rectal temperatures are adequate for monitoring the biorhythms, with each species exhibiting endogenous peculiarities in the various circadian phases...|$|E

In addition, the songs, that are created using this system, are the user’s original mixes because this system is designed with considerations including human KANSEI (sensibility). This technique {{is made up of}} three stages. Firstly, we acquire the positions of beats that fill the role of a guide of timings for mixing songs, where the sound takes a direct part of a beat is that of a snare drum- snare sound. In brief, the positions of the beats are the sound positions of snare sounds. Secondary, we deal with Genetic Programming to limit these positions of beats that are acquired from the first stage to useful positions. Finally, it can learn human KANSEI using Interactive Evolutionary Computation. The descriptions in detail for each stage are as follows. For stage- 1, generally speaking, it is difficult for people who have never played as a DJ to tune beats. However people have to do this with all conventional systems. Hopefully our technique can overcome the inconvenience of this problem. For stage- 2, this process is needed because only half of the beats acquired with the first process can be available for the mix. For stage- 3, this process can imitate our KANSEI to select a position for mixing songs automatically after learning them sufficiently. Some songs of examples using our system are presented...|$|E
40|$|Improved clock filter {{algorithm}} reduces network jitter Operating system kernel modifications achieve {{time resolution}} of 1 ns and frequency resolution of. 001 PPM using NTP and PPS sources. With kernel modifications, residual errors are reducec {{to less than}} 2 μs RMS with PPS source and less than 20 μs over a 100 -Mb LAN. New optional interleaved on-wire protocol minimizes errors due to output queueing latencies. With this protocol and hardware timestamps in the NIC, residual errors over a LAN {{can be reduced to}} the order of PPS signal. Using external oscillator or NIC oscillator as clock source, residual errors can be reduced to the order of IEEE 1588 PTP. <b>Optional</b> precision <b>timing</b> sources using GPS, LORAN-C and cesium clocks...|$|R
