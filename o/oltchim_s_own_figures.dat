The author demonstrates the problems of acculturation, blending into and enriching another culture while retaining a sense of one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> culture, versus assimilation, abandoning one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> heritage and taking on the values of another culture.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between defensive high self-esteem and inability to recognize one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> incompetence. It is hypothesized that individuals displaying defensive high self-esteem will be most likely to show a high correlation between lack of skill and lack of awareness. Participants were assessed for defensive high self-esteem using the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The unskilled-unaware construct was identified through comparison of prediction versus actual performance on a curriculum-scheduled exam. The null was rejected at p =. 01, indicating the likelihood that defensive self-esteem can or does play a role in inability to recognize one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> incompetence...|$|R

Ellen Bayuk Rosenman {{traces the}} history of the {{criticism}} of Virglnia Woolf 2 ̆ 7 s essay, A Room of One 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Own,</b> and introduces some articles published just after Woolf 2 ̆ 7 s essay came out in print in 1929. She points out that "the influential Times Literary Supplement {{goes so far as to}} eliminate gender altogether as a primary concern of the essay. " 1) According to Rosenman, the critics of Woolfs own era found A Room of One 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Own</b> "unprepossessing entertainment rather than a deeply felt critique of social and literary values. " 2) As interest in gender or feminism gradually faded away, especially after women 2 ̆ 7 s suffrage was won in 1928, "A Room of One 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Own</b> was quickly subsumed into Woolf 2 ̆ 7 s writing as a work of secondary interest, something of a curiosity that was not directly related to her more important prqlects as an experimental writer of fiction and a bellelettristic literary critic.

First, there is 2 ̆ 2 strong {{reason to believe that the}} state of present advocacy is pretty bad, and that it has not been a lot better in the past. 2 ̆ 2 Second, the advocate has, and should have, a professional obligation, enforced by disciplinary rules and penalties, to cite authorities that have been overlooked by opposing counsel and that are harmful to one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> client.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{awareness}} and behaviour of nurses with experience of caring for bereaved families who have lost a child. Eleven nurses with experience of caring for bereaved families who have lost a child were questioned in semi-structured interviews. Data was analyzed both qualitatively and inductively. The results classified the awareness and behaviour of nurses into five categories: awareness of care for bereaved families utilizing the nurse 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> distress, grief care for bereaved families, difficulty of care for bereaved families, scarcity of care systems for bereaved families, and discovery of the value of caring for care for bereaved families. The results of this survey showed that awareness of care for bereaved families utilizing the nurse 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> distress is the basis for bereavement care. In addition, the findings indicate that bereavement care consistsnot only of care for the distress of a bereaved family but is also linked to working through the nurse 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>own</b> distress. 小児専門病院および小児病棟を有する病院計 11 施設に勤務する看護者で、子どもを亡くした遺族のケアをした経験のある 11 名を対象に、「遺族へのケアを体験した看護者の認識と行動」に関する半構成的インタビューを行い、語られた内容を質的帰納的に分析した。結果、以下の 5 カテゴリーが抽出された。 1) 看護者自身の悲嘆による遺族ケアの意識化。 2) 遺族への悲嘆ケア。 3) 遺族ケアの難しさ。 4) 遺族ケア体制の乏しさ。 5) 遺族ケアの価値の見出し。調査報告日本死の臨床研究会 奨励賞受賞平成 21 - 23 年度科学研究費補助金基盤研究(C...|$|R
