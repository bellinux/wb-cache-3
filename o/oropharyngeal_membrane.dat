25|$|The {{central part}} of {{cardiogenic}} area {{is in front of}} the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> and the neural plate. The growth of the brain and the cephalic folds push the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> forward, while the heart and the pericardial cavity move first to the cervical region and then into the chest. The curved portion of the horseshoe-shaped area expands to form the future ventricular infundibulum and the ventricular regions, as the heart tube continues to expand. The tube starts receiving venous drainage in its caudal pole and will pump blood out of the first aortic arch and into the dorsal aorta through its polar head. Initially the tube remains attached to the dorsal part of the pericardial cavity by a mesodermal tissue fold called the dorsal mesoderm. This mesoderm disappears to form the two pericardial sinuses the transverse and the oblique pericardial sinuses, which connect both sides of the pericardial cavity.|$|E
50|$|The {{region where}} the crescentic {{masses of the}} {{ectoderm}} and endoderm come into direct {{contact with each other}} constitutes a thin membrane, the buccopharyngeal membrane (or <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>membrane),</b> which forms a septum between the primitive mouth and pharynx. In front of the buccopharyngeal area, where the lateral crescents of mesoderm fuse in the middle line, the pericardium is afterward developed, and this region is therefore designated the pericardial area.|$|E
50|$|The {{embryology}} of {{the human}} digestive system and the body cavities concerns the epithelium of the digestive system and the parenchyma of its derivatives, which originate from the endoderm. Connective tissue, muscular components, and peritoneal components originate in the mesoderm. Different regions of the gut tube such as the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, etc. are specified by a retinoic acid gradient that causes transcription factors unique to each region to be expressed. Differentiation of the gut and its derivatives depends upon reciprocal interactions between the gut endoderm and its surrounding mesoderm. Hox genes in the mesoderm are induced by a Hedgehog signaling pathway secreted by gut endoderm and regulate the craniocaudal organization of the gut and its derivatives. The gut system extends from the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> to the cloacal membrane and is divided into the foregut, midgut, and hindgut.|$|E
40|$|Mucositis {{induced by}} {{irradiation}} is the reactive inflammatory-like {{process of the}} <b>oropharyngeal</b> mucous <b>membranes</b> following irradiation. Bacteria colonizing the oral tissues are thought to contribute to this inflammatory process. The eradication of Gram-negative bacilli (selective elimination of oral flora) in fifteen comparably irradiated head and neck cancer patients {{was found to be}} associated with a significant reduction in mucositis compared with two groups of 15 patients receiving either placebo or chlorhexidine rinsing. Criteria used were the extent of local mucositis signs (mucositis score), as well as generalized side-effects such as the need of nasogastric tube feedings following severe feeding problems. Mucositis signs were confined to erythema only in all selectively decontaminated patients. No pseudomembranes were observed and artificial feeding was completely prevented. These promising results need further confirmation in larger (multicenter) studies...|$|R
50|$|The parotid {{salivary glands}} appear {{early in the}} sixth week of {{prenatal}} development and are the first major salivary glands formed. The epithelial buds of these glands are located on the inner part of the cheek, near the labial commissures of the primitive mouth (from ectodermal lining near angles of the stomodeum in the 1st/2nd pharyngeal arches; the stomodeum itself is created from the rupturing of the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> at about 26 days.) These buds grow posteriorly toward the otic placodes of the ears and branch to form solid cords with rounded terminal ends near the developing facial nerve. Later, at around 10 weeks of prenatal development, these cords are canalized and form ducts, with the largest becoming the parotid duct for the parotid gland. The rounded terminal ends of the cords form the acini of the glands. Secretion by the parotid glands via the parotid duct begins at about 18 weeks of gestation. Again, the supporting connective tissue of the gland develops from the surrounding mesenchyme.|$|E
40|$|Rhinoscleroma {{is a rare}} entity {{encountered}} in anesthesia practice. We discuss the management of a patient after its recurrence, involving the upper respiratory tract i. e. nasopharynx and oropharynx, which compromised the airway. The pateint was referred for anesthesia on three different occasions with different presentations owing to the recurrence of symptoms. The presence of an <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> with a small opening made airway management a challenge. The patient was successfully managed on all three occasions. Imaging facilitated assessment and subsequent airway management...|$|E
40|$|Mouth in the {{majority}} of vertebrates develops throughout an ectodermal stomodeum which posteriorly contacts the foregut endoderm, together forming an <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>membrane.</b> This ecto-/ endodermal membrane gradually thins and become eventually perforated, which causes opening of the stomodeal cavity into the pharynx. Teeth are then understood as organs arising within the stomodeal part of the mouth, where the ectodermal epithelium produces tooth enamel and neural crest mesenchymal cells form dentine and tooth pulp. This project was meant to study the dynamics of the ectoderm and endoderm during the formation of mouth and teeth in the Mexican axolotl. By utilizing transplantations of the oral ectoderm from GFP-transgenic embryos and injections of fluorescent tracer DiI into the endoderm, it was possible to follow the fate of both germ-layers during the course of embryonic development into details. By using this approach it was demonstrated that the mouth in the axolotl develops in a different way, i. e. via the stomodeal collar. Teeth were found to arise within the stomodeal collar ectoderm {{as well as in the}} more posteriorly situated endodermal areas. Moreover, some tooth germs were generated also directly at the ecto-/ endodermal boundary. Thus, the formation of teeth does not seem to primarily [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Adult gadidae {{have the}} most {{differentiated}} digestive tract in the Teleosteii, with glands in the stomach and many pyloric caeca, but the digestive tract of fish eleutheroembryos and larvae is relatively simple. It is initially narrow and straight, {{and there are no}} glands in the stomach, so it resembles the digestive tract of stomachless teleosts. The eleutheroembryo is a free-living (eleutheros=free) embryo, which still depends mainly on its yolk-sac for food. This phase lasts from hatching, when the embryo is about 3 â€“ 5 mm long, to the start of exogenous feeding at about 5 or 6 days. No mouth is present at hatching, but the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> is perforated after 1 day, and it was found (Mangor-Jensen and Adoff, 1987) that eleutheroembryos drink to maintain their osmotic state. The mouth is fully open at 2 days, and movements of the lower jaw, which contains well developed cartilages, have been reported (Yin and Blaxter, 1987). There is active feeding at 5 days. The digestive tract shows differentiation along its length even at this early stage. There is a wide pharynx containing the gill arches, followed by a narrow oesophagus or foregut, which is surrounded by a layer of striated muscle. Initially th...|$|E
