The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.|$|E

40|$|Undesirable <b>outputs</b> <b>are</b> often {{produced}} {{together with}} desirable. This joint production {{of good and}} bad outputs bring about a difficulty for productivity measurement. Here we introduce a directional distance function {{and use it as}} a component in a new productivity index. This index, as an empirical example shows, seems to solve the problem caused by the joint production of good and bad outputs. PRODUCTIVITY AND UNDESIRABLE OUTPUTS: A DIRECTIONAL DISTANCE FUNCTION APPROACH by Yangho Chung and Rolf Färe* Undesirable <b>outputs</b> <b>are</b> often produced jointly with desirable outputs, i. e., good <b>output</b> cannot <b>be</b> produced without producing some bad output. This joint production of good and bad outputs has gained attention in the literature on efficiency and productivity. 1 One can distinguish between two lines of inquiry: (i) how to model joint production of good and bad outputs and (ii) how to account for reductions of bad outputs. The first issue is fairly well understood, but the second has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. To model joint production it is usually assumed that <b>outputs</b> <b>are</b> weakly disposable as defined by Shephard (1970). This means that if a given <b>output</b> vector <b>is</b> feasible, i. e., it can be produced using some input vector, then any proportional reduction of that <b>output</b> vector <b>is</b> also feasible. If in addition to weak disposability one assumes that the good <b>outputs</b> <b>are</b> nulljoint with the bad, 2 i. e., zero production of bad <b>outputs</b> <b>is</b> feasible only if good <b>outputs</b> <b>are</b> zero, then the joint production of good and bad <b>outputs</b> <b>are</b> quite well modelled...|$|R

5|$|A variant on {{this design}} {{is the use}} of arrays, whose tilt angle can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased <b>output</b> <b>is</b> typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design.|$|E
5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width <b>output</b> <b>is</b> constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (or current).|$|E
