5|$|With no {{government}} enforcement from the Chinese or the British {{aside from a}} few raids by the Hong Kong Police, the Walled City became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the Walled City that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By this time, however, the Walled City was virtually ruled by the <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> syndicates known as triads.|$|E
50|$|While the {{judicial}} officer could justifiably require notice to be given, {{in the ordinary}} course the provision of notice had the potential of frustrating the detection and investigation of serious, complex and <b>organised</b> <b>crimes,</b> especially where evidence was in a form in which it could easily be altered or destroyed.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the 1990s {{there was}} high demand for these new, and basic, investigative resources. The strain on central units {{lead to the}} {{creation}} of regional, and even local, level groups to help handle the load. For example, the British National Hi-Tech Crime Unit was set up in 2001 to provide a national infrastructure for computer crime; with personnel located both centrally in London and with the various regional police forces (the unit was folded into the Serious <b>Organised</b> <b>Crime</b> Agency (SOCA) in 2006).|$|E

5|$|Diệm faced {{challenges}} to his authority from four more groups. The Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài religious sects had private armies that controlled the Mekong Delta and the areas west of Saigon, respectively. The Bình Xuyên was an armed, <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> empire that controlled much of Saigon with a 40,000strong private army, while the Vietminh still controlled {{much of the}} rural area. Diệm's Vietnamese National Army (VNA) was led by General Nguyễn Văn Hinh, a French citizen who loathed and frequently disobeyed him. Bảo Đại sold the operating license of the national police to the Bình Xuyên, effectively putting administrative control of the police {{in the hands of}} a crime syndicate.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's trip {{came after}} two years of American {{attempts}} to schedule a state visit. In 1955, Washington made two attempts to organise a trip while Diệm was still prime minister, but he was too busy quelling opposition groups and his grip on power was tenuous. Diệm took care of this by crushing the Bình Xuyên <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> syndicate in the Battle for Saigon in May 1955, and then deposed Bảo Đại and proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam after his brother Ngô Đình Nhu rigged a referendum that made him head of state. Diệm was credited with 98.2% of the votes and 133% in the capital Saigon. The South Vietnamese leader's visit was organized after he indicated interest in February 1957 to US Ambassador to South Vietnam Frederick Reinhardt.|$|E

With Snowy's help, Tintin subdues his captors, but the police reject his claims, and the gangsters escape. After surviving attempts on his life, Tintin meets Capone's rival Bobby Smiles, who heads the Gangsters Syndicate of Chicago.

5|$|The Hòa Hảo formed {{their own}} army and {{administration}} during the war, {{and started a}} de facto state in their Mekong Delta stronghold. They came into conflict with the Cao Đài, another new religious movement, which also boasted a private army and controlled a nearby region of southern Vietnam around Tây Ninh. Meanwhile, in Saigon, the Bình Xuyên <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> syndicate ruled {{much of the city}} through its gangster militia. These three southern forces vied for control of southern Vietnam with the main protagonists: the French, who were attempting to re-establish colonial control across the entire nation; and the communist-dominated Việt Minh, who sought Vietnamese independence.|$|E
5|$|In Throne of Blood, a Japanese {{adaptation}} of the play, Fleance is replaced by Yoshiteru, a character played by Akira Kobu. The Macbeth and Banquo characters, Washizu and Miki, are told by an old woman spinning wool in a hut that while Washizu will rule the Forest Castle one day, Miki's son Yoshiteru will eventually inherit it for himself. Washizu takes the throne {{and at one point}} is about to make Yoshiteru his heir, but changes his mind when his wife tells him she is pregnant. Washizu instead arranges to have Yoshiteru and his father killed, but Yoshiteru escapes. Another adaptation filmed in India, Maqbool (2003), replaces Fleance with a character named Guddu. Maqbool (Macbeth) attempts to have Guddu murdered to strengthen power within the <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> circle. Guddu, however, survives and marries the daughter of the former crime lord.|$|E

In Bengal the CID was first directed by C.W.C. Plowden, beginning 1 April 1906.|$|R
5|$|The {{referendum}} was {{the last}} phase in the power struggle between Bảo Đại and his prime minister. Bảo Đại disliked Diệm and had frequently attempted to undermine him, having appointed him only {{because he was a}} conduit to American aid. At the time, the country was going through a period of insecurity, as Vietnam had been temporarily partitioned {{as a result of the}} 1954 Geneva Accords that ended the First Indochina War. The State of Vietnam controlled the southern half of the country, pending national elections that were intended to reunify the country under a common government. Still, the Vietnamese National Army was not in full control of southern Vietnam; the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects ran their own administrations in the countryside supported by private armies, while the Bình Xuyên <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> syndicate controlled the streets of Saigon. Despite interference from these groups, Bảo Đại, and even French officials, Diệm managed to subdue the private armies and consolidate government control over the country by mid-1955.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Nolan reprised {{his duties}} as director, and brought his brother, Jonathan, to co-write {{the script for}} the second installment. The Dark Knight {{featured}} Christian Bale reprising his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two-Face. Principal photography began in April 2007 in Chicago and concluded in November. Other locations included Pinewood Studios, Ministry of Sound in London and Hong Kong. On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died from a bad combination of prescription medication. Warner Bros. had created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight, developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screen shots of Ledger as the Joker, but after Ledger's death, the studio refocused its promotional campaign. The film depicts Gotham attempting to rebuild after Batman's actions have caused so much damage to its <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> families, aided by the prosecution of charismatic District Attorney Harvey Dent, but {{the involvement of the}} anarchic Joker threatens everything, as his actions lead to the death of Rachel Dawes and Harvey being scarred and transformed into Two-Face. Although Batman is able to stop the Joker from forcing two ferries- one loaded with civilians and the other with prisoners- to destroy each other, he is forced to take the blame for the murders committed by Dent to ensure that the city retains its hope for the future.|$|E
5|$|The Madchester {{scene of}} the 1980s, from which groups {{including}} New Order, The Smiths, The Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, James and The Charlatans emerged, was based on clubs such as the world-famous The Haçienda. The period {{was the subject of}} the film 24 Hour Party People. Many of the big clubs suffered problems with <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> at that time; Haslam describes one where staff were so completely intimidated that free admission and drinks were demanded (and given) and drugs were openly dealt. Following a series of drug-related violent incidents, The Hacienda closed in 1998. In 1988, Manchester was often referred to as Madchester for its rave scene. Owned by Tony Wilson's Factory Records, it was given the catalogue number FAC51 and official club name, FAC51 The Hacienda. Known for developing many talented 1980s influential acts, it also influenced the graphic design industry via Factory artists such as Peter Saville (PSA), Octavo (8vo), Central Design Station, etc. The memorabilia from this club holds a high value among collectors and fans of these artists and the club. Peter Saville was most notable for his minimalistic influence that still affects contemporary graphic design everywhere.|$|E
