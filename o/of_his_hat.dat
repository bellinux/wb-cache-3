5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} {{an homage to}} the gold body paint death scene by having a female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes, the death by full body painting, an ejector seat {{in a car and}} using a tuxedo under a drysuit.|$|E

50|$|Though Somerville had {{established}} {{his name as}} a celebrity milliner, many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hats</b> were bought or rented (Kate Middleton spent £100 hiring her Somerville creation) by non-celebrities for weddings or special events. About a third <b>of</b> <b>his</b> business centred round Royal Ascot.|$|R

25|$|Sri Lanka fast bowler, Lasith Malinga, {{who became}} the first bowler in World Cup history to take two hat-tricks, {{has said that he}} learnt to bowl his deadly yorkers by {{watching}} Pakistan's legendary pair of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. No doubt over the years several bowlers have learned and mastered the skill of reverse swing but there are still some techniques which haven't have been explored, e.g. banana swing. The title of Banana Swing Bowler was given to Waqar Younis because of his unique technique of swinging the ball in the air at very high speed before hitting the ground. In most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> tricks he has delivered banana swing balls which were unplayable.|$|E
25|$|King Taksin statue was {{unveiled}} {{in the middle}} of Wongwian Yai (the Big Traffic Circle) in Thonburi, at the intersection of Prajadhipok/Inthara Phithak/Lat Ya/Somdet Phra Chao Taksin Roads. The king is portrayed with his right hand holding a sword, measuring approximately 9 metres in height from his horse's feet to the spire <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> rests on a reinforced concrete pedestal of 8.90 × 1.80 × 3.90 metres. There are four frames of stucco relief on {{the two sides of the}} pedestal. The opening ceremony of this monument was held on April 17, 1954 and the royal homage-paying fair takes place annually on December 28. The king today officially comes to pay respect to King Taksin statue.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, Joseph Smith founded the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} {{based in part}} on what was said to be information obtained miraculously from the reflections of seer stones. Smith had at least three separate stones, including his favorite, a brown stone he found during excavation of a neighbor's well. He initially used these stones in various treasure-digging quests in the early 1820s, placing the stone in the bottom <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> and putting his face in the hat to read what he believed were the miraculous reflections from the stone. Smith also said that he had access to a separate set of spectacles composed of seer stones, which he called the Urim and Thummim. He said that, through these stones, he could translate the golden plates that are the stated source of the Book of Mormon.|$|E
50|$|In 1989 he {{took one}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hats</b> to Michael Roberts, fashion editor of Tatler magazine, and his style editor, Isabella Blow. Blow asked Treacy to make a hat for her to wear for her wedding, and invited him {{to live with her}} and her husband Detmar in their home, from which Treacy started working.|$|R
50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hats</b> - {{a scarlet}} toque - is immortalised in the Norman Parkinson fashion {{portrait}} After Van Dongen, which originally appeared in Vogue in 1959. A different frame from this shoot was then chosen by Parkinson {{for the cover}} of the publication accompanying his 1981 solo portrait exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery.|$|R
50|$|Isabella Blow {{not only}} helped Treacy to launch his {{millinery}} career, but famously wore many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hats</b> herself. One <b>of</b> Treacy's hats {{was chosen by}} Blow {{as part of her}} selection for the 1997 Dress of the Year, alongside a purple coat designed by Deborah Milner with whom Treacy shared a studio at the time.|$|R

Though Brock was noted as a handsome man who enjoyed the company of women, he never married.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Wendy tells Stan {{that she}} smelled Ms. Ellen taking a [...] "smelly dump" [...] in the {{bathroom}} {{in an attempt to}} make him less attracted to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences. At his school, the children were able to have lunch with the teacher and principal if they were awarded [...] "Student of the Week". Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience [...] "really, really creepy" [...] because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{never said}} how he {{produced}} the Book of Mormon, saying {{only that he}} translated {{by the power of}} God and implying that he had transcribed the words. The Book of Mormon itself states only that its text will [...] "come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof". As such, considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists. For {{at least some of the}} earliest dictation, Smith is said to have used the [...] "Urim and Thummim", a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates. Later, however, he is said to have used a chocolate-colored stone he had found in 1822 that he had used previously for treasure hunting. Joseph Knight said that Smith saw the words of the translation while he gazed at the stone or stones in the bottom <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> excluding all light, a process similar to divining the location of treasure. Sometimes, Smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room, while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table. [...] After completing the translation, Smith gave the brown stone to Cowdery, but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about 1833 when he said he no longer needed it.|$|E

[...] "Vladimir's pain is primarily mental anguish, which would thus account for his voluntary exchange <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> for Lucky's, thus signifying Vladimir's symbolic desire for another person's thoughts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor, {{who also}} played for Wiltshire, has three hat-tricks {{to his name}} and was listed in the 2005 C Trophy-winning Hampshire squad. He {{achieved}} one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> tricks during a Hampshire v Middlesex game and a career best of 6 for 32, {{this was the first}} hat trick at the Rose Bowl.|$|E

His most notable attack is the Hat Toss, which could be {{directed}} in Mortal Kombat II, but could not be directed since Mortal Kombat Gold, until Mortal Kombat [...] (2011). Many of his Fatalities involve the use <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> to some extent, such as slicing the body in half and decapitation.|$|E

2500|$|Hobson {{headed the}} British signatories. Hōne Heke {{was the first}} of the Māori chiefs who signed that day. As each chief signed, Hobson said [...] "He iwi tahi tātou", meaning [...] "We are [...] one people". Two chiefs, Marupō and Ruhe, protested {{strongly}} against the treaty as the signing took place but they eventually signed and after Marupō shook the Governor's hand, seized hold <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> which was on the table and gestured to put it on.|$|E
2500|$|... "He was as American as ham {{and eggs}} and as indistinguishable as {{everybody}} else. He stood {{about five feet}} nine, a trim, middle-aging man in 1934, with a plain face, masked by a quiet earnestness of expression wholly reassuring to people whom quickness of mind makes uncomfortable. Nevertheless, his mind was extremely quick....He {{might have been a}} progressive country agent or a professor of ecology at an agricultural college. And yet there was something unprofessorially jaunty about the flip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> brim and his springy stride.... It is true that he liked to drive his car at breakneck speed almost as well as to talk about soils, tenant farmers and underground organization...Harold Ware was a frustrated farmer. The soil was in his pores. Unlike most American Communists, who managed to pass from [...] one big city to another without seeing anything in the intervening spaces, Ware was absorbed in the land and its problems. He held that, with the deepening of the agricultural crisis, and with the rapid mechanization of agriculture, the time had come for revolutionary organization among farmers.|$|E
