5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E

5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues concerning this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E

5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the front}} of the house, on the ground floor, is a reconstructed medieval shop front, from where the owner would have {{conducted}} his mercantile business. Behind this is the central hall, originally designed with an open hearth in the middle, but now fitted with a 14th-century Flemish chimney, plastered so as to resemble brickwork. A hallway runs along one side of the hall; hallways were a traditional feature of the period, although the fashion was eventually abandoned because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of lighting them effectively. At the rear of the property is an inner private room, with a decorative ceiling. Beneath the house is an undercroft, or cellar, designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature; the brick floor is 18th-century in origin, however. This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns, including Winchester and London.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> {{and risk}} of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by {{fixed-wing}} aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane on a rope. This kept the bundle in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{was born}} on April 21, 1980, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, as the younger of fraternal twin girls and the second of three children. As a child, she {{originally}} dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Hoshino confessed she was not too interested in school, often making excuses to avoid taking classes. Additionally, she added that would often practise drawing {{in the middle of}} the classes which gave her doubts when she had to erase them. She drew her first manga at twenty-one. In 1998, Hoshino moved to Tokyo. She dreamed of bringing her mother to the city and was able to in 2006. After graduating from high school, Hoshino did not know what career should she follow as she was offered the work of joining video game companies. Ultimately, she decided to become a manga author despite her fears <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> it takes.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} for English fans attending the final was the acquisition of visas for entry into Russia. However, {{after a period of}} negotiations between representatives of Russia, the United Kingdom, UEFA and the two clubs, it was agreed that fans with tickets for the match would not require a visa, provided they were also able to produce a passport with at least six months before expiry and a completed immigration card on entry into Russia. The visa-free period was initially supposed to run for 72 hours between 19 May and 23 May, but this was later extended to an eight-day period lasting from 17 May to 25 May. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> and expense of acquiring a ticket and visa, fans who had not already got tickets were advised against travelling to Moscow by UEFA's William Gaillard, who also warned fans about Russia's strict laws regarding the consumption of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on white gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E
5|$|Sugar {{also led}} to some {{industrialization}} of areas where sugar cane was grown. For example, Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal establishment, persuaded the British Government that sugar cane could be cultivated in British India with many advantages and at less expense than in the West Indies; as a result, sugar factories were established in Bihar in eastern India. During the Napoleonic Wars, sugar beet production increased in continental Europe because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of importing sugar when shipping was subject to blockade. By 1880, the sugar beet was {{the main source of}} sugar in Europe. It was cultivated in Lincolnshire and other parts of England, although the United Kingdom continued to import the main part of its sugar from its colonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} also subject to criticism, however. Next Generation {{objected to the}} {{difficulty}} level, wondering if the challenge was added to prolong the gameplay. The Electric Playground pointed to the unusual control scheme and lack of configuration options.

GameSpot criticized the game's conclusion for its dramatic change in gameplay to a rail shooter-like style at the story's climax, {{as well as a}} leveling-off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Lastly, Gamecritics felt that the story was overly short and the characters were underdeveloped.|$|E

The cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body, rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> of conserving B.brownii in {{its present}} disease-exposed locations, it is an {{especially}} suitable candidate for ex situ conservation measures, such as the cold-storage of seed, and the translocation of plants to disease-free locations. Seed of B.brownii has been collected by Western Australia's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic diversity that was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic diversity that {{would otherwise have been}} lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts. A seed orchard was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 disease-free, healthy plants, some of which had grown {{more than three times the}} rate of those in the wild. A 2007 seedling flowered for the first time at Wakehurst Place in February 2011.|$|E
5|$|Constantine I (r. 306–337) {{preferred}} chariot {{racing to}} gladiatorial combat, which he considered a vestige of paganism. However, {{the end of}} gladiatorial games in the Empire {{may have been more}} the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficulty</b> and expense that came with procuring gladiators to fight in the games, than the influence of Christianity in Byzantium. The Olympic Games were eventually ended by Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) in 393, perhaps in a move to suppress paganism and promote Christianity, but chariot racing remained popular. The fact that chariot racing became linked to the imperial majesty meant that the Church did not prevent it, although gradually prominent Christian writers, such as Tertullian, began attacking the sport. Despite the influence of Christianity in the Byzantine Empire, venationes, bloody wild-beast hunts, continued as a form of popular entertainment during {{the early days of the}} Empire as part of the extra entertainment that went along with chariot racing. Eventually, Emperor Leo (r. 457–474) banned public entertainments on Sundays in 469, showing that the hunts did not have imperial support, and the venationes were banned completely by Emperor Anastasius (r. 491–518) in 498. Anastasius was praised for this action by some sources, but their concern seems to be more for the danger the hunts could put humans in rather than for objections to the brutality or moral objections. There continued to be burnings and mutilations of humans who committed crimes or were enemies of the state in the hippodrome throughout the Byzantine Empire, as well as victory celebrations and imperial coronations.|$|E
