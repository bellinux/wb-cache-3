25|$|Bryant {{moved back}} to the buses where Janet Quin lay injured from the earlier shot. Bryant shot her in the back, then left; she later died from her wounds. Bryant then went <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coaches and fired a shot at Elva Gaylard who was hiding inside, hitting her in the arm and chest and killing her. At an {{adjacent}} coach, Gordon Francis saw what happened and moved down the aisle to try to shut the door of the coach he was on. He was seen by Bryant and shot from the opposite coach. He survived, but needed four major operations.|$|E
25|$|The class {{graduates}} {{participate in}} an Ivy Day which installs a granite placard <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic or residential buildings on campus. They serve {{as a symbol of}} the class and their respective history both academically and socially. Some classes donate to the college, in the form gates, facades, and door outlines, by inscribing or creating their own version of symbolic icons of the college's seal or other prominent insignia. This usually occurs on graduation day, but may occur on later dates with alumni returning to the campus. This tradition is shared with the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University. On Ivy Day, members of Phi Beta Kappa are announced.|$|E
25|$|Erasmus {{continues}} his experiment with his ward Gilbertus Albans, whom he names his Mentat. After seventy years {{it becomes clear}} that the independent robot loves his “son” even though he has no problem brutalizing other humans. When Gilbertus sneaks <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cargo haulers of the Bridge of Hrethgir containing a Serena Butler clone that he is infatuated with, Erasmus disables the explosive trip mechanism in order to save him. In doing so, Erasmus dooms the entire machine empire. Realizing that hrethgir will rule the universe, he suggests to Gilbertus that he teach the other humans to “think efficiently.” Erasmus apparently survives the battle when Gilbertus smuggles away his memory core.|$|E

25|$|The game {{begins in}} 2020 when North Korean forces led by General Ri-Chan Kyong {{take control of}} the Lingshan Islands. A team of American {{civilian}} archaeologists, led by Dr. Rosenthal, send out a distress call indicating that they have discovered something that could change the world. Thus Raptor Team is dispatched to the islands, with the core mission of evacuating them and securing any valuable information that they have. The team consists of Nomad, Psycho, Aztec, Jester and team leader Prophet (all under code names); they are outfitted with Nanosuits, which help protect them from gunfire and explosions, as well as giving them superhuman strength and abilities. As they perform a high-altitude jump <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> islands, an unknown flying entity disrupts the jump by smashing into Nomad, and the team is separated. The crash deactivates Nomad's Nanosuit and destroys his parachute, but he is saved because he lands on water and his suit absorbs the impact of the landing. After he makes his way to shore, Prophet is able to reset Nomad's suit remotely, restoring its normal function.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo {{reproduction}} {{is similar to}} that of opossums. The egg (still contained in the shell membrane, a few micrometres thick, and with only a small quantity of yolk within it) descends from the ovary into the uterus. There it is fertilised and quickly develops into a neonate. Even in the largest kangaroo (the red kangaroo) the neonate emerges after only 33 days. Usually, only one young is born at a time. It is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long; its hindlegs are mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother's abdomen into the pouch, which takes about three to five minutes. Once in the pouch, it fastens <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four teats and starts to feed. Almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. Meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. After about 190 days, the baby (joey) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after about 235 days, it leaves the pouch for the last time. The lifespan of kangaroos averages at six years in the wild to in excess of 20 years in captivity, varying by species. Most individuals, however, do not reach maturity in the wild.|$|E

500|$|Some vocalising by Lennon is faintly audible {{at the end}} of the song, {{picked up}} as leakage <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drum {{microphones}} (close listening shows Lennon making other comments to Starr). In the [...] "Paul is Dead" [...] hoax these were taken to be Lennon saying [...] "I buried Paul." [...] In 1974, McCartney said, [...] "That wasn't 'I buried Paul' at all – that was John saying 'cranberry sauce' … That's John's humour … If you don't realise that John's apt to say cranberry sauce when he feels like it, then you start to hear a funny little word there, and you think, 'Aha!'" [...] Shortly before his death in 1980, Lennon expressed dissatisfaction with the final version of the song, saying it was [...] "badly recorded" [...] and accusing McCartney of subconsciously sabotaging the recording.|$|E
500|$|After {{completion}} of the tour, Ellison continued to play for Poneke and Wellington. While playing with his club, Ellison implemented {{the use of a}} wing-forward and seven-man scrum positional system. It is not known exactly who invented the position of wing-forward, but Ellison claimed in The Art of Rugby Football that he had developed it; historian Greg Ryan claims the position was developed in northern England, and that Ellison only refined it after discovering it during the Natives' tour. The distinctive feature of wing-forward play was their role of feeding the ball into the scrum, and subsequently holding <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hookers while the ball progressed through the scrum to the half-back. With the wing-forward bound {{to the side of the}} scrum, the opposing half-back would then have to manoeuvre past them to tackle the player with the ball; this would increase the amount of time the half-back would have in possession of the ball before their opposite could tackle them. Ellison claimed that he devised the position while playing for Poneke after he [...] "found it impossible for the smartest of referees to detect and amply penalize off-side interferences of opponents bent on spoiling my passes".|$|E

He stated, [...] "this volume provides a valuable entry point for investigating this kaleidoscope of legal and moral issues". Steven R.

2500|$|Commonly found {{sheltering}} inside {{caves and}} crevices, the Arabian carpetshark is a predator of bony fishes (including snake eels) and invertebrates (including stomatopods, shrimp, crabs, squid, gastropods, and echiuroid worms).

For conventional non-banded cigarettes, oxygen transfer through the cigarette paper occurs during puffing and smouldering mainly through the semi-charred cigarette paper (Miura 2001; Eitzinger & Giener 2008), probably because gas permeability increases exponentially when paper is subjected to thermal degradation (Baker 1976).
