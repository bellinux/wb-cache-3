5|$|In late May and June 1941, {{members of}} the Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina {{travelled}} to the <b>oblast</b> (regional) centres of Banja Luka in the Bosanska Krajina region, Mostar in Herzegovina, and Tuzla in the Birač region of eastern Bosnia to advise the <b>oblast</b> KPJ committees of {{the decisions of the}} Central Committee, and to form <b>oblast</b> military committees. This also occurred in Sarajevo, for an <b>oblast</b> military committee responsible for the Romanija region of eastern Bosnia located north of that city. Each <b>oblast</b> military committee formed district military committees, who in turn contacted KPJ members in towns and villages of their district to organise resistance. This pyramid-like structure mirrored the KPJ structure, and following the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June, the Central Committee met on 4 July and decided to initiate an armed uprising against the occupiers. This included the creation of a formal military structure, headed by the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, who was also the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the KPJ.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} {{period of the}} Ukrainian SSR, Odessa Governorate was formed out of parts of the former Kherson Governorate. This new area {{formed the basis for}} modern Odessa <b>Oblast.</b> Throughout the interwar period, Budjak was part of the Kingdom of Romania. The 1932–33 Holodomor famine had a {{profound}} demographic effect on the region. Its population declined by 15–20%. About a decade later, the Nazi occupation of Ukraine during the Second World War had a devastating impact on the region's previously large Jewish population. Also during the war, the ethnically-diverse Budjak was annexed to the Ukrainian SSR as Izmail <b>Oblast.</b> It was merged into Odessa <b>Oblast</b> in 1954.|$|E

5|$|On June2, 1924, when Kuban-Black Sea <b>Oblast</b> was abolished, the {{autonomous}} <b>oblast</b> was first subordinated to South-Eastern Krai and later, on October16, 1924, to North Caucasus Krai. No other significant changes occurred until February7, 1929, when the five districts were re-organized into three (Krasnogvardeysky, Psekupsky, and Shovgenovsky). When North Caucasus Krai was split on January10, 1934, Adyghe Autonomous <b>Oblast</b> was subordinated {{to the newly}} created Azov-Black Sea Krai. On December28, 1934, the three districts of {{the autonomous}} <b>oblast</b> were once again re-organized into five (Koshekhablsky, Krasnogvardeysky, Ponezhukaysky, Shovgenovsky, and Takhtamukaysky), due to the directive to downsize the districts in Azov-Black Sea Krai.|$|E
5|$|On September13, 1937, Azov-Black Sea Krai {{was split}} into Krasnodar Krai and Rostov <b>Oblast,</b> and Adyghe Autonomous <b>Oblast</b> was subordinated to the former.

At the same time, the administrative center of the autonomous <b>oblast</b> was moved from Krasnodar to Maykop. Tuapse, a port on the Black Sea, was considered for the role of the administrative center, but the idea was rejected as it would give the native population access to the sea.|$|E

Some <b>oblasts</b> also included autonomous entities called autonomous okrugs.
