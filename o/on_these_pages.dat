500|$|Some further {{procedural}} {{reforms were}} {{undertaken in the}} 1850s. In 1850, {{a new set of}} Chancery orders were produced by the Lord Chancellor, allowing Masters to speed up cases in whatever way they chose and allowing plaintiffs to file a claim, rather than the more expensive and long-winded bill of complaint. The Suitors in Chancery Relief Act 1852 gave all court officials salaries, abolished the need to pay them fees and made it illegal for them to receive gratuities; it also removed more sinecure positions. The Master in Chancery Abolition Act 1852 abolished the Masters in Chancery, allowing all cases to be heard directly by judges instead of bounced back-and-forth between judges and Masters. As a result of these reforms the court became far more efficient, and the backlog decreased; in the 1860s an average of 3,207 cases were submitted each year, while the Court heard and dismissed 3,833, many of them from the previous backlog. Much of this work was carried out by the growing number of clerks, however, and members of the legal profession became concerned about the [...] "famine" [...] of equity judges. Despite these reforms, it was still possible for Charles Dickens, writing in 1853 in the preface to his novel Bleak House, to bemoan the inefficiencies of the Court of Chancery. His novel revolves around a fictional long-running Chancery case, Jarndyce and Jarndyce. He observed that {{at the time he was}} writing there was a case before the Chancery court [...] "which was commenced nearly twenty years ago... and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun". He concluded that [...] "If I wanted other authorities for Jarndyce and Jarndyce, I could rain them <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>pages,</b> to the shame of a parsimonious public".|$|E

2500|$|The Authors Guild, the {{publishing}} industry and Google entered into a settlement agreement October 28, 2008, with Google agreeing to pay a total of $125million to rights-holders of books they had scanned, to cover the plaintiffs' court costs, {{and to create a}} Book Rights Registry. The settlement was set to be approved by the court sometime after October 2009. Reaction to the settlement was mixed, with Harvard Library, one of the original contributing libraries to Google Library, choosing to withdraw its partnership with Google if [...] "more reasonable terms" [...] could not be found. As part of the $125million settlement signed in October 2008, Google created a Google Book Settlement web site that went active on February 11, 2009. This site allowed authors and other rights holders of out-of-print (but copyright) books to submit a claim by June 5, 2010. In return they were to receive $60 per full book, or $5 to $15 for partial works. In return, Google was to be able to index the books and display snippets in search results, as well as up to 20% of each book in preview mode. Google was also to be able to show ads <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>pages</b> and make available for sale digital versions of each book. Authors and copyright holders were to receive 63 percent of all advertising and e-commerce revenues associated with their works. After claiming a book, rightsholders would also have the ability to alter the default display settings.|$|E
2500|$|Finkelstein {{argued in}} a letter to the Harvard Crimson {{published}} on October 3, 2003, that Dershowitz reproduced exactly two of Peters' mistakes, and made one relevant mistake of his own. In quoting Mark Twain, Finkelstein argued, [...] "Dershowitz cites two paragraphs from Twain as continuous text, just as Peters cites them as continuous text, but in Twain's book the two paragraphs are separated by 87 pages." [...] While still quoting Twain, although Dershowitz cited a different edition of Twain's Innocents Abroad than Joan Peters cites, Finkelstein continues, [...] "the relevant quotes do not appear <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>pages</b> in the edition of Twain's book that Dershowitz cites." [...] Finkelstein points out that these quotations do, however, appear on the pages that Joan Peters cites as her edition of Innocents Abroad. Finkelstein asserted: [...] "Quoting a statement depicting the miserable fate of Jews in mid-19th century Jerusalem, Peters cites a British consular letter from 'Wm. T. Young to Viscount Canning.' Dershowitz cites the same statement as Peters, reporting that Young 'attributed the plight of the Jew in Jerusalem' to pervasive anti-Semitism. Turning to the original, however, we find that the relevant statement did not come from Young but, as is unmistakably clear to anyone who actually consulted the original, from an enclosed memorandum written by an 'A. Benisch' that Young was forwarding to Canning." [...] He concluded: [...] "It would be impossible for anyone who checked the original source to make the error." ...|$|E
40|$|Page {{segmentation}} plays a {{key role}} in browsing on small screens. It breaks a large page into smaller segments according to their semantic relationships. Then, various approaches such as single column adaptation and thumbnail view with zooming links can be implemented based <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>page</b> segments. However, for current flexible web pages, segmentation remains a challenging task. This paper proposes an effective automatic segmentation method which combining pattern analysis and visual separators. The basic idea is that a page’s semantic structure is largely reflected by repeated continuous patterns and visual separators, which coincides with human’s visual perception. The proposed method works in three steps: generating a refined tag tree from the DOM tree, recognizing and merging inexact patterns recursively, and segmenting the others by visual separators. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods, especially for pages automatically generated from templates. 1...|$|R

No, for a just comparison we shall have to reach back to history and fable: David and Goliath; Theseus and the Minotaur; or, better still, Cadmus and the Dragon!

60|$|But {{as it is}} {{wholesome}} {{that the}} parsimonious public should know what has been doing, and still is doing, in this connexion, I mention here that everything set forth in these pages concerning the Court of Chancery is substantially true, and within the truth. The case of Gridley is in no essential altered from one of actual occurrence, made public by a disinterested person who was professionally acquainted with {{the whole of the}} monstrous wrong from beginning to end. At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun. There is another well-known suit in Chancery, not yet decided, which was commenced before the close of the last century and in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in costs.

60|$|But {{the kind}} of {{collector}} alluded to can best be exemplified in the individual instance of him from whom the manuscript was obtained, of which a somewhat modernized version is printed <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>pages.</b> He has been dead some years, leaving no kin; and under his will, such of his motley treasures as it cared to accept went to a local museum, while the rest and his other property were sold {{for the benefit of}} a mystical brotherhood, for the old fellow was a kind of spiritualist. Therefore, there is no harm in giving his plebeian name, which was Potts. Mr. Potts had a small draper's shop in an undistinguished and rarely visited country town in the east of England, which shop he ran {{with the help of an}} assistant almost as old and peculiar as himself. Whether he made anything out of it or whether he lived upon private means is now unknown and does not matter. Anyway, when there was something of antiquarian interest or value to be bought, generally he had the money to pay for it, though at times, in order to do so, he was forced to sell something else. Indeed these were the only occasions when it was possible to purchase anything, indifferent hosiery excepted, from Mr. Potts.|$|E
