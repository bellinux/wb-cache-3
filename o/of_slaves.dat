The principal use <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> was in agriculture, but hundreds <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> were also used in stone quarries or mines, and perhaps two per household were domestic servants. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, {{with as many as}} 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, with average of three or four slaves per household, except in poor families.|$|E

30|$|Figure  8 {{illustrates}} the average query execution times on DG-SPARQL for 20 instances {{of each of}} the identified four query types on the DBpedia real dataset. In order to evaluate the speed-up improvement of query execution time in response to increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes (partitions), we have repeated this experiment three times using 2, 4 and 6 slave nodes. The results of the experiments show that the percentage of speedup improvement varies from one query type to another. For example, for QT 1, the query plan of this type of queries is translated into a single SQL query which is centrally executed on one of the underlying RDBMS nodes. Therefore, increasing the number <b>of</b> underlying <b>slave</b> nodes does not introduce any speedup improvement for the query execution time of such type of queries. Queries of query type QT 2 achieve the highest percentage of speedup improvement by increasing the number <b>of</b> the underlying <b>slave</b> nodes due to their distributed execution plans over the underlying RDBMS nodes. In particular, increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes from 2 to 4 leads to 34  % speedup improvement while increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes from 2 to 6 leads to 59  % speedup improvement on the query execution times. Queries of query types QT 3 and QT 4 achieve comparable percentage of speedup improvement by increasing the number <b>of</b> the underlying <b>slave</b> nodes due to due to the network communication overhead and the post processing steps of their query plans. In particular, for QT 3, increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes from 2 to 4 leads to 24  % speedup improvement while increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes from 2 to 6 leads to 43  % speedup improvement on the query execution times. For QT 4, increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes from 2 to 4 leads to 25  % speedup improvement while increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes from 2 to 6 leads to 44  % speedup improvement on the query execution times. It should be noted that increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes does not necessarily lead to increasing the speedup improvement on the query execution times as the number of relational-based sub-query plans can be less than the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> machines. In this case, increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes does not lead to speedup improvement on the query execution time for this type of queries. In addition, increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes leads to an increase in the overhead of the message exchange between the cluster nodes. This overhead affects having a linear relationship between the number <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> nodes and query execution time.|$|R
5|$|To {{varying degrees}} {{throughout}} Roman history, {{the existence of}} a pool of inexpensive labor in the form <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> was an important factor in the economy. Slaves were acquired for the Roman workforce through a variety of means, including purchase from foreign merchants and the enslavement of foreign populations through military conquest. With Rome's heavy involvement in wars of conquest in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, tens if not hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> at a time were imported into the Roman economy from various European and Mediterranean acquisitions. While there was limited use for slaves as servants, craftsmen, and personal attendants, vast numbers <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> worked in mines and on the agricultural lands of Sicily and southern Italy.|$|E
5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The life expectancy <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, {{leading to a}} rapid increase in the numbers <b>of</b> <b>slaves.</b> Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice. But {{by the turn of}} the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E

5|$|In February 1836 Edwards landed 170 {{black people}} in Texas, taking {{advantage}} of the confusion surrounding the end of the Texas Revolution and the establishment of the independent Republic of Texas, which had not yet outlawed the importation <b>of</b> <b>slaves.</b> William Fisher, the customs collector on the Brazos River, wrote to the Texas Constitutional Convention that Edwards did not report the importation to the authorities, and Fisher went to Edwards' plantation to confront Edwards. Because of uncertainty about the legality of importing slaves, Fisher did not seize the slaves but referred the issue to the newly formed Texas Government after securing a monetary bond from Edwards. Although the new Texas Republic eventually outlawed the importation <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> from anywhere but the United States, Edwards' landing <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> from Cuba in early 1836 was never prosecuted. After this, Edwards also established a slave market on Galveston Bay, near present-day San Leon. In 1837, he was sued by Robert Peebles for fraud involving the sale of a slave with tuberculosis to Peebles. Peebles won the case.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} {{to determine the extent to}} which the events of this war contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided with the end of the period of the most prominent use <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> in Rome and the beginning of a new perception <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E
5|$|Slave labour was {{prevalent}} in mines and quarries, which had large slave populations, often leased out by rich private citizens. The strategos Nicias leased a thousand slaves to the silver mines of Laurium in Attica; Hipponicos, 600; and Philomidès, 300. Xenophon indicates {{that they received}} one obolus per slave per day, amounting to 60 drachmas per year. This {{was one of the}} most prized investments for Athenians. The number <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> working in the Laurium mines or in the mills processing ore has been estimated at 30,000. Xenophon suggested that the city buy a large number <b>of</b> <b>slaves,</b> up to three state slaves per citizen, so that their leasing would assure the upkeep of all the citizens.|$|E

50|$|The Fugitive Slave Laws helped {{enforce the}} {{necessity}} for slave patrols {{to abide by the}} law. Although these laws were initially created to keep tensions low between the north and the south, it caused the physical formation <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> patrols. During the Civil War, the theory of Contraband prevented the return <b>of</b> Southern <b>slaves</b> who reached Union-held territory. This helped limit the role <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> patrols/catchers and changed the war. Another form <b>of</b> help for <b>slaves</b> was the Underground Railroad, which aided slaves in their escape to Northern states. The use and physical formation <b>of</b> <b>slave</b> patrols came to its end in 1865 when the Civil War ended. This end, however, is linked to post-Civil War groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, which continued to terrorize and threaten the black community.|$|R
5|$|The {{legal status}} and rights of Roman slaves {{also began to}} change. During the time of Emperor Claudius (reigned 41–54 AD), a {{constitution}} was enacted that made the killing of an old or infirm slave an act of murder, and decreed that if such slaves were abandoned by their owners, they became freedmen. Under Antoninus Pius (reigned 138–161 AD), laws further extended the rights <b>of</b> <b>slaves,</b> holding owners responsible for the killing <b>of</b> <b>slaves,</b> forcing the sale <b>of</b> <b>slaves</b> when it could be shown {{that they were being}} mistreated, and providing a (theoretically) neutral third party to which a slave could appeal. While these legal changes occurred much too late to be direct results of the Third Servile War, they represent the legal codification of changes in the Roman attitude toward slaves that evolved over decades.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome.
