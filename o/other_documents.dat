5|$|During {{and after}} the debates over church government, the Assembly framed <b>other</b> <b>documents</b> which did not cause open rifts. The Directory for Public Worship, which was to replace the Book of Common Prayer, was swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3January 1645. The Directory, {{accepted}} by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians {{for the most part}} preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. The Directory consisted of an order for services with sample prayers. The Assembly also recommended a psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the South Korean government's Committee for the Review and Restoration of Honor for the No Gun Ri Victims, after {{a yearlong}} process of verifying claims through family registers, medical reports and <b>other</b> <b>documents</b> and testimony, {{certified}} {{the names of}} 150 No Gun Ri dead, 13 missing, and 55 wounded, including some who later died of their wounds. It said that reports were not filed on many other victims because of {{the passage of time}} and other factors. Of the certified victims, 41 percent were children under 15, and 70 percent were women, children or men over age 61.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{theories}} considered by investigators was that Flight 2511 {{was involved in a}} collision with another airliner, given the crash site's proximity to Wilmington Airport. Investigators reviewed the flight plan and <b>other</b> <b>documents</b> to determine if other aircraft were in the area. There was no record of any other aircraft, or of any military missiles having been fired. Furthermore, wreckage of Flight 2511 was confined to two general locations: the primary crash scene near Bolivia and the secondary scene in Kure Beach. All debris was accounted for as belonging to the DC-6.|$|E
5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the casket letters has {{been the source of}} much controversy among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way. The originals, written in French, were probably destroyed in 1584 by Mary's son. The surviving copies, in French or translated into English, do not form a complete set. There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s. <b>Other</b> <b>documents</b> scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon. Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to get a copy of the proceedings from the town's registers.|$|E
5|$|Union forces hastily {{attempted}} {{to destroy the}} vital salt works. They destroyed about {{one third of the}} boiling kettles and most evaporating sheds. They also damaged portions of the Virginia & Tennessee railroad. But they failed to destroy or damage the actual salt wells. General Stoneman claimed a victory and retreated out of Virginia before Confederate forces could completely surround him. Carpenter's role is strangely missing from letters and <b>other</b> <b>documents</b> that simply note that he was there. Within three months, the saltworks were back in full production. Carpenter later wrote a long letter home about this battle and how his men responded.|$|E

He used Walter the Chancellor and other now-lost works for the history of the Principality of Antioch. From the end of Fulcher's chronicle in 1127, William is the only source of information from an author living in Jerusalem. For events that happened in William's own lifetime, he interviewed older people who had witnessed the events about which he was writing, and drew on his own memory.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the <b>other</b> <b>documents</b> were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E
5|$|No East Anglian {{charters}} (and few <b>other</b> <b>documents)</b> {{have survived}} to modern times and those mediaeval chronicles that {{refer to the}} East Angles are treated with great caution by scholars. Very few records from the Kingdom of the East Angles have survived, because of the complete destruction of the kingdom's monasteries and {{the disappearance of the}} two East Anglian sees as the result of Viking raids and settlement. The principal documentary source for the early period of the kingdom's history is Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written by Bede in the eighth century. East Anglia is first mentioned as a distinct political unit in the Tribal Hidage, which is thought to have been compiled somewhere in England during the seventh century.|$|E

5|$|Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States from England in August 1941 to {{find out}} why Briggs and his {{committee}} were apparently ignoring the MAUD Report. Oliphant discovered to his dismay that the reports and <b>other</b> <b>documents</b> sent directly to Briggs had not been shared with all members of the committee; Briggs had locked them in a safe. Oliphant then met with Allison, Coolidge, Conant and Fermi to explain the urgency. In these meetings Oliphant spoke of an atomic bomb with forcefulness and certainty, and explained that Britain did not have the resources to undertake the project alone, so it was up to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Public {{condemnation}} {{of the use of}} breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal breaker, but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or <b>other</b> <b>documents</b> so their children could support the family. Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880, 18,000 working in 1900, 13,133 working in 1902, and 24,000 working in 1907. Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys, but adoption of the new technology was slow.|$|E
5|$|Raoul Wallenberg's half-brother, Guy von Dardel, a {{well-known}} physicist, retired from CERN, {{was dedicated to}} finding out his half-brother's fate. He traveled to the Soviet Union about fifty times for discussions and research, including {{an examination of the}} Vladimir prison records. Over the years, Professor von Dardel compiled a 50,000-page archive of interviews, journal articles, letters, and <b>other</b> <b>documents</b> related to his quest. In 1991, Dardel initiated a Swedish-Russian working group to search eleven separate military and government archives from the former Soviet Union for information about Wallenberg's fate, but the group was not able to find conclusive information. Many, including Professor von Dardel and his daughters Louise and Marie, do not accept the various versions of Wallenberg's death. They continue to request that the archives in Russia, Sweden, and Hungary be opened to impartial researchers.|$|E

5|$|Siwiec's timing {{has been}} {{described}} as unfortunate, as he chose to commit his act during a dance (mazurka), at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra playing. Some, like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof Kąkolewski, have speculated that if he had chosen to act moments earlier, during a speech by Polish communist leader Władysław Gomułka, first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party, the commotion he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely. Publicist Antoni Zambrowski noted that many other self-immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti-communist opposition movements and left messages and <b>other</b> <b>documents</b> which helped publicize their activities; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti-communist opposition with which he identified with was not aware of his action and the meaning behind it until much later.|$|E
5|$|The United States Code Congressional and Administrative News (U.S.C.C.A.N.) is a West Group {{publication}} that collects selected congressional and administrative materials {{for publication in}} a single resource. U.S.C.C.A.N. {{was first published in}} 1941 with the 1st Session of the 77th Congress and has been published with every session of Congress since. U.S.C.C.A.N. is published in monthly pamphlets that contain a cumulative subject index and cumulative Table of Laws Enacted in addition to the selected documents. The pamphlets are then reissued in bound volumes after each session of Congress concludes. Among <b>other</b> <b>documents,</b> U.S.C.C.A.N. publishes the full text of new federal laws, selected committee reports from the House and Senate, signing statements, presidential proclamations, executive orders, reorganization plans, President's messages, federal regulations, proposed constitutional amendments, federal court rules, and sentencing guidelines all arranged in chronological order.|$|E
5|$|While the Rooms {{were not}} open to the general public, they could be {{accessed}} by appointment, with access being restricted to small groups. Even so, by the 1970s (with responsibility for the Rooms having passed to the Department for the Environment in 1975) {{tens of thousands of}} requests to visit the Rooms were being received every year, of which only 5,000 were successful. Meanwhile, the atmospheric conditions of the site, being dry and dusty, were having a detrimental effect on the rooms' furnishings and historic maps and <b>other</b> <b>documents.</b> The prospect was raised of decanting the contents of the Rooms to an established museum, with the National Army Museum and Imperial War Museum being suggested as candidates. In the event, £7,000 was secured to conserve the material in situ.|$|E
