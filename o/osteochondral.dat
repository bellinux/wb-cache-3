5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including <b>osteochondral</b> fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and <b>osteochondral</b> fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E
5|$|The {{articular}} cartilage's {{capacity for}} repair is limited: partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the articular cartilage which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend {{to lead to}} deterioration of the articular surface. As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the <b>osteochondral</b> fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson StageII, III).|$|E
5|$|X-rays show lucency of the {{ossification}} {{front in}} juveniles. In older people, the lesion typically appears {{as an area}} of osteosclerotic bone with a radiolucent line between the <b>osteochondral</b> defect and the epiphysis. The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and {{on the amount of}} knee flexion used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute <b>osteochondral</b> fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
500|$|König {{named the}} disease [...] "osteochondritis dissecans", {{describing}} it as a subchondral inflammatory {{process of the}} knee, resulting in a loose fragment of cartilage from the femoral condyle. In 1922, Kappis described this process in the ankle joint. On review of all literature describing transchondral fractures of the talus, Berndt and Harty developed a classification system for staging of <b>osteochondral</b> lesions of the talus (OLTs). The term osteochondritis dissecans has persisted, and has since been broadened to describe a similar process occurring in many other joints, including the knee, hip, elbow, and metatarsophalangeal joints.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} {{injury to the}} lateral femoral condyle is an <b>osteochondral</b> {{fracture}} combined with a patellar dislocation. The <b>osteochondral</b> fracture occurs on the weight-bearing portion of the lateral condyle. Typically, the condyle will fracture (and the patella may dislocate) {{as a result of}} severe impaction from activities such as downhill skiing and parachuting.|$|E

50|$|For <b>Osteochondral</b> Allografts the plugs {{are taken}} from {{deceased}} donors. This has the advantage that more <b>osteochondral</b> tissue is available and larger damages can be repaired using either the plug (snowman) technique or by hand carving larger grafts. There are, however, worries on the histocompatibility, though no rejection drugs are required and infection {{has been shown to}} be lesser than that of a total knee or hip. <b>Osteochondral</b> allografting using donor cartilage has been used most historically in knees, but is also emerging in hips, ankles, shoulders and elbows. Patients are typically younger than 55, with BMI below 35, and have a desire to maintain a higher activity level that traditional joint replacements would not allow. Advances in tissue preservation and surgical technique are quickly growing this surgery in popularity.|$|E

50|$|Open {{reduction}} and internal fixation surgery is typically used to repair an <b>osteochondral</b> fracture. For a Type B1 partial articular fracture of the lateral condyle, interfragmentary lag screws {{are used to}} secure the bone back together.

50|$|There {{are three}} methods of {{grafting}} cartilage defects, including periosteal grafting, <b>osteochondral</b> grafting (mosaicplasty), and articular cartilage stem cell paste grafting. Periosteal grafts are harvested from the perichondrial tissue and grafted to the articular cartilage defect. Given low long-term success rates, perichondrial grafting alone {{has not been}} clinically accepted as a particularly excellent therapy. Mosaicplasty, a form of chondral grafting, is a therapy designed to replace cartilage {{on the surface of}} the knee joint that has been damaged by trauma or arthritis by implanting <b>osteochondral</b> plugs. The implants can be autogenic (autologous) or allogenic. Paste grafting involves replacing damaged cartilage with autologous cartilage and cancellous bone from the intercondylar notch in the center of the knee that is first morselized into a paste (typically with hydroxyapatite) to better fill the defect and more successfully promote chondrocyte activity and cartilage formation. These procedures are often performed arthroscopically.|$|E

50|$|In radiology, {{the deep}} lateral femoral notch sign is a finding on a lateral {{radiograph}} {{that is considered}} an indirect sign of a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). It appears as an abnormal deepening of the lateral condylopatellar sulcus. The deepened depression of the lateral condylopatellar sulcus is attributed to an <b>osteochondral</b> impaction fracture. A sulcus depth that is greater than 1.5 mm is considered a relatively reliable sign of a torn ACL.|$|E
50|$|Paste {{grafting}} is {{a relatively}} simple surgical procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting. It requires minimal special instrumentation. Unexpected lesions can be treated. No tissue culture or foreign matrices are required. Paste grafting has been an effective salvage procedure for failed microfracture, failed <b>Osteochondral</b> Autograph Transplant Surgery (OATS) or Mosaicplasty procedures, Carticel and TruFit procedures. Compared {{to the cost of}} other complex cartilage restoration procedures, the cost of paste grafting is minimal. Disadvantages include limited experience with patella paste grafting and it remains difficult to access the very far posterior lesions.|$|E

50|$|Ashbee was, however, cursed {{by an old}} {{injury in}} the {{subsequent}} Championship campaign, being diagnosed with an <b>osteochondral</b> defect, a degenerative bone condition in his femur. He underwent surgery that involved drilling fourteen holes in the bone to stimulate re-growth. He was warned by his doctor that this injury threatened not just his career, but his ability to even walk. Ashbee was on crutches for four months and was ruled out {{for the majority of}} the 2005-06 season, nevertheless he remained a favourite amongst many Tigers fans, receiving a standing ovation at the last game of the season against Watford despite being sidelined.|$|E

5000|$|Reis {{began his}} {{research}} into biomaterials in 1990. He studies {{the development of}} biomaterials from natural origin polymers and their possible biomedical applications, including bone replacement and fixation, drug delivery carriers, partially degradable bone cements and tissue engineering scaffolding. [...] His team works under his leadership in the tissue engineering of many different tissues, namely: bone, cartilage, <b>osteochondral,</b> skin, tendon and ligaments, meniscus, intervertebral disks, {{as well as on}} peripheral and central nervous systems regeneration, diabetes treatment and cancer 3D disease models. In 2015 Reis' research team developed a new type of catheter which is made of hydrogel.|$|E
50|$|This technique/repair {{requires}} transplant {{sections of}} bone and cartilage. First, the damaged section of bone and cartilage {{is removed from}} the joint. Then a new healthy dowel of bone with its cartilage covering is punched out of the same joint and replanted into the hole left from removing the old damaged bone and cartilage. The healthy bone and cartilage are taken from areas of low stress in the joint so as to prevent weakening the joint. Depending on the severity and overall size of the damage multiple plugs or dowels may be required to adequately repair the joint, which becomes difficult for <b>Osteochondral</b> Autografts. The clinical results may deteriorate over time.|$|E
5000|$|Chronic {{articular}} cartilage defects do not heal spontaneously. However, acute traumatic <b>osteochondral</b> lesions or surgically created lesions extending into subchondral bone, e.g. by Pridie drilling, spongialization [...] abrasion or microfracture causing {{the release of}} multipotent mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow, may heal with repair tissue consisting of fibrous tissue, fibrocartilage or hyaline-like cartilage. The quality of the repair tissue after these [...] "bone marrow stimulating techniques" [...] depends on various factors including the species and age of the individual, the size and localization of the {{articular cartilage}} defect, the surgical technique, e.g., how the subchondral bone plate is treated, and the postoperative rehabilitation protocol.|$|E
50|$|Bioactive glass offers good osteoconductivity and bioactivity, it {{can deliver}} cells and is biodegradable. This {{makes it an}} {{excellent}} candidate {{to be used in}} tissue engineering applications. Although this material is known to be brittle, it is still used extensively to enhance the growth of bone since new forms of bioactive glasses are based on borate and borosilicate compositions. Bioglass can also be doped with varying quantities of elements like Copper, Zinc, or Strontium which can allow the growth and formation of healthy bone. The formation of neocartilage can also be induced with bioactive glass by using an in vitro culture of chondrocyte-seeded hydrogels and can serve as a subchondral substrate for tissue-engineered <b>osteochondral</b> constructs.|$|E
50|$|Intravenous {{formulations}} of hyaluronic acid (HA) are available under the trade names Legend and Hyonate. In <b>osteochondral</b> fragmentation models, intravenous HA {{has been shown}} to decrease lameness, improve the synovial membrane, and lower protein and prostaglandin E2 levels within joints. Additionally, it was shown to have positive effects on racing Quarter Horses, leading to a greater number of starts, a longer career, and more money earned, but these horses were also treated with IA corticosteroids at an earlier point of their career, potentially confounding the results. Another study in Thoroughbreds found no improvement when using IV hyaluronic acid. However, there is much anecdotal support from trainers of different disciplines, and it remains a popular therapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Osteochondral</b> {{autograft}} (OATS) is {{a technique}} that requires that the surgeon transplant sections of bone and cartilage.

50|$|A 2011 study reports histologically {{confirmed}} {{hyaline cartilage}} regrowth in a 5 patient case-series, 2 with grade IV bipolar or kissing lesions in the knee. The successful protocol involves arthroscopic microdrilling/ microfracture surgery followed by postoperative injections of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells(PBPC's) and hyaluronic acid(HA). PBPC’s are a blood product containing mesenchymal stem cells and is obtained by mobilizing {{the stem cells}} into the peripheral blood. Dr. Khay Yong Saw and his team propose that the microdrilling surgery creates a blood clot scaffold on which injected PBPC’s can be recruited and enhance chondrogenesis {{at the site of}} the contained lesion. They explain that the significance of this cartilage regeneration protocol is that it is successful in patients with historically difficult-to-treat grade IV bipolar or bone-on-bone <b>osteochondral</b> lesions.|$|E
50|$|The Multi-Center Evaluation of the Responsiveness of the IKDC (MERI) Study is {{designed}} to evaluate and compare the responsiveness to change of several measures commonly used in patients undergoing knee surgery: the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, the WOMAC, the Cincinnati Knee Rating System, and the SF-36. The specific patient population targeted for this study are those individuals who receive any form of surgical articular cartilage repair procedure {{for at least one}} symptomatic full thickness (Outerbridge Grade III or IV) lesion of the femoral condyle or trochlea. These procedures can include debridement, marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture, drilling or abrasion arthroplasty, <b>osteochondral</b> autograft or allograft transplantation, mosiacplasty or autologous cartilage implantation. Any surgeon who performs at least three of these procedures a year can be involved in the project.|$|E
50|$|Inflammatory products, such as {{inflammatory}} mediators and cytokines, damage {{articular cartilage}} {{and have been}} shown to weaken intraarticular ligaments. Therefore, treatment of joint disease should not only address the primary injury producing inflammation, but also the inflammatory cycle that leads to further tissue damage. Cryotherapy, joint lavage, systemic anti-inflammatories, or intra-articular medications are used to reduce joint inflammation. In the case of severe joint pathology such as an <b>osteochondral</b> chip, intraarticular fracture, osteochondritis dissecans lesion, or ligamentous or meniscal injury, arthroscopy may be required to ensure normal function of that joint. Debris within the joint, such as from a chip fracture, can cause long term damage to the synovium and articular cartilage leading to osteoarthritis, and is therefore best removed. Following acute injury, joints often benefit from specialized physical therapy, such as swimming, to prevent the loss of range of motion associated with joint capsule fibrosis.|$|E

5000|$|Marrow {{nucleated}} {{cells are}} used {{every day in}} regenerative orthopedics. The knee microfracture surgery technique popularized by Steadman relies on the release of these cells into a cartilage lesion to initiate fibrocartilage repair in <b>osteochondral</b> defects. [...] In addition, this cell population {{has also been shown}} to assist in the repair of non-union fractures. [...] For this application, bed side centrifugation is commonly used. Again, these techniques produce a very dilute MSC population, usually a yield of 1 in 10,000-1,000,000 of the nucleated cells. [...] Despite this low number of MSC’s, isolated bone marrow nucleated cells implanted into degenerated human peripheral joints have shown some promise for joint repair. [...] As the number of MSC’s that can be isolated from bone marrow is fairly limited, most research in cartilage regeneration has focused on the use of culture expanded cells. [...] This method can expand cell numbers by 100-10,000 fold over several weeks. Once these MSCs are ready for re-implanation, they are usually transferred with growth factors to allow for continued cell growth and engraftment to the damaged tissue. At some point, a signal is introduced (either in culture or after transplant to the damaged tissue) for the cells to differentiate into the end tissue (in this discussion, cartilage).|$|E
5000|$|While {{the use of}} cultured mesenchymal {{stem cells}} has shown {{promising}} results, a more recent study using uncultured MSC’s has resulted in full thickness, histologically confirmed hyaline cartilage regrowth. Dr. Khay-Yong Saw and his team evaluated {{the quality of the}} repair knee cartilage after arthroscopic microdrilling (also microfracture) surgery followed by post-operative injections of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in combination with hyaluronic acid(HA). PBPC’s are a blood product containing MSC’s, which is obtained by mobilizing stem cells into the peripheral blood. In February 2011, the team published the results of a 5 patient case series. All five patients showed evidence of hyaline cartilage regeneration at second-look arthroscopy and subsequent biopsy, including 2 patients with full thickness bipolar or kissing lesions. The authors propose that the microdrilling surgery creates a blood clot scaffold on which injected PBPC’s can be recruited and enhance chondrogenesis {{at the site of the}} contained lesion.

40|$|Complications of patellar {{dislocation}} include <b>osteochondral</b> injury of {{the lateral}} femoral condyle and patella. Most cases of <b>osteochondral</b> injury {{occur in the}} anterior region, which is the non-weight-bearing portion of the lateral femoral condyle. We describe two patients with <b>osteochondral</b> injury of the weight-bearing surface of the lateral femoral condyle associated with lateral dislocation of the patella. The patients were 18 - and 11 -year-old females. <b>Osteochondral</b> injury occurred on the weight-bearing surface distal to the lateral femoral condyle. The presence of a free <b>osteochondral</b> fragment and <b>osteochondral</b> injury of the lateral femoral condyle was confirmed on MRI and reconstruction CT scan. Treatment consisted of <b>osteochondral</b> fragment fixation or microfracture, as well as patellar stabilization. <b>Osteochondral</b> injury was present in the weight-bearing portion of the lateral femoral condyle in both patients, suggesting that the injury was caused by friction between the patella and lateral femoral condyle when the patella was dislocated or reduced at about 90 ° flexion of the knee joint.
