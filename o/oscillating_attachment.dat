40|$|This report {{describes}} the impulsive dynamics {{of a system}} of two coupled oscillators with essential (nonlinearizable) stiffness nonlinearity. The system considered consists of a grounded weakly damped linear oscillator coupled to a lightweight weakly damped <b>oscillating</b> <b>attachment</b> with essential cubic stiffness nonlinearity arising purely from geometry and kinematics. It has been found that under specific impulse excitations the transient damped dynamics of this system tracks a high-frequency impulsive orbit manifold (IOM) in the frequency-energy plane. The IOM extends over finite frequency and energy ranges, consisting of a countable infinity of periodic orbits and an uncountable infinity of quasi-periodic orbits of the underlying Hamiltonian system and being initially at rest and subjected to an impulsive force on the linear oscillator. The damped nonresonant dynamics tracking the IOM then resembles continuous resonance scattering; in effect, quickly transitioning between multiple resonance captures over finite frequency and energy ranges. Dynamic instability arises at bifurcation points along this damped transition, causing bursts in the response of the nonlinear light oscillator, which resemble self-excited resonances. It is shown that for an appropriate parameter design the system remains in a state of sustained high-frequency dynamic instability under the action of repeated impulses. In turn, this sustained instability results in strong energy transfers from the directly excited oscillator to the lightweight nonlinear attachment; a feature that can be employed in energy harvesting applications. The theoretical predictions are confirmed by experimental results. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (Grant CMMI- 1100722...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this bachelor thesis are collecting and rating of cured meat sheep´s udder traits. Measurement on 107 sheep shows data which {{are focused on}} udder depth, udder width, teat lenght, teat position, udder attachment and udder cleft. Thereafter was assessed influence of litter chronological order on these values. Udder depth average is on level 8. 2 centimetres. Udder width average is on level 9. 1 centimetres. And teat length is in average 2. 5 centimetres. All of these dimensions are growing up to the 4 th littler. Since the 5 th littler are measured traits in lower level. For the 6 th and next litters are the explored values as same as the fifth´s litters. Point value of teat position was done on 2, 93 points. It means that this value (2, 93) is in suitable interval from 2 to 3, {{which is the best}} for lambs. Lambs can find teats without problems. Point value of teat position increases from the first litter (2, 70) to the fifth litter (3, 23) and then it continues on the same level. Udder <b>attachment</b> <b>oscillates</b> about 2, 1 points (average) and there are no changes with chronological order of litter. Udder cleft is fixed on average value 3, 84 points...|$|R
