The group normally has a leadership role in the church that is second only to the church's First Presidency. The Quorum implicitly follows the First Presidency's policies and pronouncements and its members are chosen by the First Presidency. However, when the First Presidency is dissolved—which occurs upon the death of the President of the Church—the Quorum <b>of</b> the <b>Twelve</b> Apostles becomes the church's governing body (led by the President of the Quorum <b>of</b> the <b>Twelve</b> Apostles) until they ordain a new President of the Church and he chooses counselors, which completes the reorganization of the First Presidency. [...] Membership in the Quorum <b>of</b> the <b>Twelve</b> is typically a lifetime calling.|$|R

5|$|A similar, strong {{competition}} was established very probably between Gasparo Cairano and Antonio della Porta (Tamagnino), who debuted in Brescia (in documentary terms) along with Cairano with his cycle <b>of</b> <b>twelve</b> Angels {{for the first}} dome of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, between 24 December 1489 and May 3, 1490.

He belonged to a family of sculptors, and between 1484 and 1489 was known to have worked in Milan and Pavia for the Sforza, in close contact with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. His debut as a figurative sculptor at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, however, owed to the Sanmicheli, who typically specialized in the field of decorative sculpture and lacked outside of this field.
