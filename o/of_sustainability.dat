40|$|Since {{long-term}} <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> {{outer space}} activities {{is an extension}} concept of sustainable development {{in the field of}} outer space law,there are not only some connections but also a few differences between them. According to the juridical status of the principle of sustainable development,the principle <b>of</b> long-term <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> outer space activities should be an important principle in the law of outer space,and contains the following aspects:inter-generation fair; within-generation fair; long-term sustainable use,integration between environment and activities in the outer space. In the case of the existing outer environment worsening,emphasizing and practicing principle <b>of</b> long-term <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> outer space activities has important practical significance. Now the challenges related to the long-term <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> outer space activities include the issues of space debris; the increasing decrease in geostationary orbit resources; space pollution. The international community is working on the guidelines <b>of</b> thelong-term <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> outer space activity guidelines which {{plays a key role in}} solving the above problems. More importantly,the principle <b>of</b> long-term <b>sustainability</b> <b>of</b> outer space activities should be put into the Outer Space Treaty or developed to be a generally accepted rule of customary international law so that it can play the role of legal norms. 外空活動長期可持續性是可持續發展概念在外空領域的延伸,所以它與可持續發展概念既有聯系也有區別。對比可持續發展原則,外空活動長期可持續性原則應是外空法的一項重要原則,其內涵包括代際公平、代內公平、長期可持續利用和外空環境與外空活動一體化等四個方面。在現有外層環境日益惡化的情形下,強調并踐行外空活動長期可持續性原則具有重要的現實意義。目前,外空活動長期可持續性所面臨的問題包括空間碎片問題、地球靜止軌道問題和空間環境污染問題。國際社會正在制定《外空活動長期可持續性準則》,這對解決上述問題發揮很大的作用,但更為重要的是把這一原則規定到《外空條約》中來,或有意推動使其成為一項公認的國際習慣法規則,使其發揮法律規范的作用...|$|R

5|$|The {{drive to}} capture wildlife, and {{particularly}} slow lorises, is increasingly dominated by demands from wealthy urban areas, replacing the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. In {{the case of}} long-lived primates, such as the slow lorises, populations replenish themselves slowly. Slow lorises are particularly vulnerable {{because they tend to}} freeze when spotted. Lastly, increased access to new technologies, such as improved transport, guns, wire snares, and spotlights, have facilitated hunting and pushed extraction levels beyond the point <b>of</b> <b>sustainability.</b> These new factors threaten slow loris survival.|$|E
