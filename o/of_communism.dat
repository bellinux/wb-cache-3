5|$|Like most US {{diplomatic}} {{posts in}} Africa during the Cold War, a {{primary purpose of}} the embassy was to counter Soviet influence in the region and contain the spread <b>of</b> <b>communism.</b> For a time after the Sino-Soviet split, China was also actively competing for influence in the developing world, including activities in Somalia. Beginning in the 1960s, the US engaged in development projects in Somalia to counter the influence <b>of</b> <b>communism.</b> Staff from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which carried out most of these projects, comprised a substantial number of the embassy's staff during the next three decades. Educational programs were also given emphasis by the embassy in the years after independence, and there was a sizable Peace Corps presence.|$|E
