40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the antioxidant properties of some citrus fruits. The contents of dietary fibre, total polyphenols, essential phenolics, ascorbic acid and some trace elements of lemons, <b>oranges</b> <b>and</b> grapefruits were determined and compared with their total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP). There {{were no significant differences in}} the contents of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre in the studied peeled fruits or their peels. The contents of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre in peels were significantly higher than in peeled fruits (P< 0. 05 in all cases). The peeled lemons, <b>oranges</b> <b>and</b> grape-fruits contain 16410. 3; 15410. 2 and 13510. 1 and their peels 19010. 6; 17910. 5 and 15510. 3 mg/ 100 g of total poly-phenols, respectively.

The content of total polyphenols in the peels was significantly higher than in peeled fruits (P< 0. 05 in all cases).
