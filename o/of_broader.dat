5|$|Many {{environmental}} {{scientists believe}} amphibians, including frogs, are good biological indicators <b>of</b> <b>broader</b> ecosystem health {{because of their}} intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults).

5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because <b>of</b> <b>broader</b> trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E

5|$|The WHO/EURO Multicentre Study of Suicide, {{established}} in 1989, demonstrated that, for each age group, the female rate of self-harm exceeded {{that of the}} males, with the highest rate among females in the 13–24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12–34 age group. However, this discrepancy {{has been known to}} vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria, consistent with wide-ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self-harm in general. Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context <b>of</b> <b>broader</b> psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors, directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.|$|E
5|$|Viking metal {{emerged from}} black metal {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an {{opposition}} to Christianity, but rejecting Satanism and occult themes {{in favor of the}} Vikings and paganism. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part <b>of</b> <b>broader</b> modern Pagan and neo-völkisch movements as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities.|$|E

25|$|A {{population-based}} {{study in}} Olmsted County, Minnesota county {{found that the}} cumulative incidence of autism grew eightfold from the 1980–83 period to the 1995–97 period. The increase occurred after the introduction <b>of</b> <b>broader,</b> more-precise diagnostic criteria, increased service availability, and increased awareness of autism. During the same period, the reported number of autism cases grew 22-fold in the same location, suggesting that counts reported by clinics or schools provide misleading estimates of the true incidence of autism.|$|E
25|$|Exchange-traded {{funds that}} invest in bonds are known as bond ETFs. They thrive during {{economic}} recessions because investors pull their {{money out of the}} stock market and into bonds (for example, government treasury bonds or those issued by companies regarded as financially stable). Because of this cause and effect relationship, the performance of bond ETFs may be indicative <b>of</b> <b>broader</b> economic conditions. There are several advantages to bond ETFs such as the reasonable trading commissions, but this benefit can be negatively offset by fees if bought and sold through a third party.|$|E
25|$|The {{shifting}} of natural resource management responsibilities from central {{to state and}} local governments, where this is occurring, is usually a part <b>of</b> <b>broader</b> decentralization process. According to Rondinelli and Cheema (1983), there are four distinct decentralization options: these are: (i) Privatization – the transfer of authority from the central government to non-governmental sectors otherwise known as market-based service provision, (ii) Delegation – centrally nominated local authority, (iii) Devolution – transfer of power to locally acceptable authority and (iv) Deconcentration – the redistribution of authority from the central government to field delegations of the central government.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{assessment}} center (AC) {{structure that}} models broad dimension factors, exercise factors, {{and a general}} performance factor is proposed and supported in 4 independent samples of AC ratings.

To investigate {{the construct validity of}} these empirically supported components of AC ratings, the nomologi- cal network <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> dimensions, exercises, and general performance was examined. Results supported the criterion-related validity <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> dimensions and exercises as predictors of effectiveness and success cri- teria as well as the incremental validity <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> dimensions beyond exercises and general performance. Finally, the relationships between individual differences and AC factors supported the construct validity <b>of</b> <b>broad</b> dimension factors and provide initial insight as to the meaning of exercise specific variance and general AC performance...|$|R
