50|$|The {{reason the}} two clubs still issue their own maps is to {{complement}} the range of more or less good <b>official</b> <b>maps</b> of the high mountains with special large scale maps. This {{is especially true for}} the Austrian Alpine region, which is the classical field for Alpine Club branches (sections). Here, there are no <b>official</b> <b>maps</b> at a scale of 1: 25.000, so the Alpine Club fills an important gap in the maps available.|$|R
25|$|The {{maps of the}} air zones {{published}} {{after that}} agreement (e.g. an <b>official</b> <b>map</b> published by Turkey in 1953) do indeed show a line that runs where Greece today claims the territorial boundary should be, with Imia/Kardak on the Greek side. Turkey holds that the agreement about the FIR boundaries was not concerned with determining sovereignty, and thus has no bearing on the issue.|$|E

Canterlot is {{northeast}} of Ponyville. However, in subsequent interviews, both Faust and Jayson Thiessen mentioned that the geography and continuity of the show are loosely defined and may change as necessary, and a layout artist stated on December 10, 2011 that the production team had no <b>official</b> <b>map</b> of Equestria at their disposal.|$|E
25|$|Consecutively {{in order}} of appearance: The sheets are {{numbered}} consecutively as each is published. Thus, {{it is not possible}} to determine the sheets neighbouring a particular sheet without a current sheet index. Nor is it always possible to indicate on a sheet's map surround the numbers of adjacent sheets, as the date of publication of forthcoming sheets (and therefore thei place in the numbering system) may not yet be known. This system is therefore suitable only for small maps, or those in an irregular sheet division (as in tourist maps published by the private sector), and is seldom now used for modern <b>official</b> <b>map</b> series. Example: Geological Atlas of Switzerland (1:25,000).|$|E

25|$|In 1955, George Salomon {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} the NYCTA to redesign not only the map but the entire system of nomenclature Salomon was a German émigré, and his proposed system of route names and colors mirrored that of the Berlin U-Bahn. He had also spent a year studying under Eric Gill in England and expressed admiration for the London Underground map. His map adopted the same modernist style as Henry Beck's London map, {{and was the first}} map of the New York City Subway to follow a systematic visual language in diagrammatic form. The NYCTA rejected his systematic revision of nomenclature but did use his diagram of lines as its <b>official</b> <b>map</b> from 1958 to 1967.|$|E
25|$|In early 2007 Peru accused Chile of {{unilaterally}} redefining {{their shared}} sea boundary in a law, passed by Congress, which detailed {{the borders of}} the new administrative region of Arica and Parinacota. The impasse was resolved by the Chilean Constitutional Tribunal, which declared the particular section of the law unconstitutional. In March 2007, the Chilean state-owned — but editorially independent — television channel TVN cancelled the broadcast of a documentary about the War of the Pacific after a cautionary call was made to the stations’ board of directors by Chilean Foreign Relations Minister Alejandro Foxley, apparently acting on demands made by the Peruvian ambassador to Chile; the show was finally broadcast in late May of that year. In August 2007 the Chilean government filed a formal diplomatic protest with Peru and summoned home its ambassador, after Peru published an <b>official</b> <b>map</b> claiming a part of the Pacific Ocean that Chile considers its sovereign territory. Peru said this was just another step in its plans to bring the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In January 2008 Peru asked the court to consider the dispute, prompting Bachelet to summon home the Chilean ambassador in Lima for consultations.|$|E
