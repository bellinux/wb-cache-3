5|$|In {{addition}} to Galaxy Game and Computer Space, numerous other games have been directly inspired by Spacewar. These include Orbitwar (1974, PLATO network computers), Space Wars (1977, arcade), and Space War (1978, Atari 2600). Additionally, in Asteroids (1979), designer Ed Logg used elements from Spacewar, namely the hyperspace button {{and the shape}} of the player's ship. Products as late as the 1990 computer game Star Control drew direct inspiration from Spacewar. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games without feeling restricted to using Russell's own code <b>or</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 10 October 1984, GG1001 {{crashed in}} South Korea on a {{demonstration}} flight, killing Northrop pilot Darrell Cornell. An investigation cleared the F-20 of mechanical <b>or</b> <b>design</b> faults; it concluded Cornell had blacked out due to excessive g-forces. GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at Goose Bay, Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC; Barnes had been practicing his aerobatic routine for the Paris Air Show.|$|E

Minimizing the strain energy in an oring seal {{has been identified}} as a mode of improving its useful lifetime. The intent of this research was to manipulate the strain energy content in oring seals by varying material properties and material behavior over the crosssection of the <b>oring.</b> <b>Oring</b> <b>designs</b> were developed that contained regions of modified material properties referred to as insets. These <b>oring</b> <b>designs</b> incorporating insets were evaluated numerically to determine the effects that the inset’s stiffness, size, and placement, had on the strain energy content and maximum sealing pressure of the <b>oring</b> <b>design.</b> Achievements included the development of <b>oring</b> <b>designs</b> that demonstrated lower strain energy content than a baseline design made of a single homogeneous material. Experimental orings were created using commercially available materials. Compression set and compression stress relaxation experiments were conducted. Performance of new <b>oring</b> <b>designs</b> including insets made of a softer material than the main oring was compared to baseline single material orings. Improved sealing performance was demonstrated by a decreased rate of sealing force decay over time, and by decreased compression set, for the new <b>oring</b> <b>designs</b> proposed...|$|R

5|$|A {{circumstance}} {{occurred during}} the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; <b>or</b> <b>design,</b> by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, {{in the end the}} combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen.|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games have three similar modes of gameplay: Circuit mode, Single Match, and Mission mode. Circuit mode is where players {{compete for the}} highest overall score in a pre-determined series of events <b>or</b> <b>design</b> their own circuit. In the Single Match, players can choose to compete in each event individually. Mission mode is a single-player option where each of the competitors has six character-specific missions to complete, although the characters' statistics are not as balanced as in the main game, making missions more difficult. The Wii version's Circuit and Single Match can have an additional one to three players competing simultaneously while its DS counterpart has an extra option dedicated to multiplayer called Versus Play. Versus supports up to four people to use the wireless capabilities of the Nintendo DS to play events. DS Download Play is possible for those without an individual copy of the game, however the number of sports available is limited to six events and circuit mode is not available.|$|E
