5|$|The orchestral ritornello punctuates the {{movement}} for a third and last time, the upper strings playing the semiquaver figures, with the detached quavers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> in the oboes and off the beat in the alto recorders.

With the same orchestral pairings as the fugato episode, the sopranos joyously sing out the beginning of the second fugue theme below trilling recorders before joining the polyphony of the other voices—with a last emphatic sospirans figure in the basses—for the final exultant rendition of the text.|$|E

A brass section and a chamber choir were hired as additional musicians. Drum machines and distorted guitars were used more extensively than in Bloc Party's previous works to create a sense of manipulation to the basic rock palette. Drummer Matt Tong was initially sceptical of moulding songs with programmed drums, as opposed to using his physical output, but agreed to the idea when the band recorded some of the tracks in their entirety. On some songs, the guitars were disregarded and the band focused solely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat.</b> Okereke's voice was often used as an instrument by being looped, vocoded, or run through effects pedals.|$|E

25|$|Among the Beats, Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg studied Pound {{closely and}} were heavily {{influenced}} by his interest in Chinese and Japanese poetry and the ecological concerns evident in the later Cantos.

Many of these writers found a major platform for their work in Cid Corman's Origin magazine and press. Origin also published work by Louis Zukofsky, Lorine Niedecker and Wallace Stevens, helping to revive interest in these early modernist writers. The Objectivists, especially the strict formal experimentation of Zukofsky's later works, were also formative for the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets.|$|E

500|$|Under the {{supervision}} of the management team, the Monks conducted extensive rehearsals with a focus on gritty, rhythmically oriented music. The band equipped themselves with new instruments and hardware to achieve that goal: a Maestro fuzz box (and eventually a wah-wah pedal) for Burger, a floor tom for Johnston, and a six-string banjo for Day, the latter of which offered a disorienting counter-rhythm to the bass section. Shaw explained that the group's motivation was to possess [...] "high rhythm and high energy". He elaborated further, saying [...] "The idea of it was to get as much 'beat' out of it as we could. As much 'bam-bam-bam-bam' <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> or whatever. The only time cymbals would be used would be for accent.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{focuses on}} {{development}} of control algorithms for intelligent robotic tools that assist off-pump Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery. In the robotic-assisted CABG surgery, <b>the</b> surgeon operates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> heart using intelligent robotic instruments. Robotic tools actively cancel the relative motion between the surgical instruments {{and the point}} of interest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> heart, dynamically stabilizing the heart for the operation. This algorithm is called Active Relative Motion Canceling (ARMC). Here, a model-based intelligent ARMC algorithm employing biological signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), to achieve effective motion cancelation is proposed. Finally, experimental results of <b>the</b> algorithm <b>on</b> a 3 -DOF robotic test-bed system are reported...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveDespite {{the early}} {{introduction}} of totally endoscopic {{coronary artery bypass}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> heart, {{only a limited number}} of cases have been performed. The limiting factor has been the concern about safety and graft patency of the anastomosis. This study describes our experience with totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> heart with robotic assistance and its early and midterm results. MethodsIn 365 cases of robotic cardiac operations, 162 patients underwent robotic coronary artery bypass grafting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> heart, of whom 60 patients (46 male, 14 female) underwent totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> heart. <b>The</b> patients’ mean age was 56. 97 ± 9. 7 years (33 – 77 years). Left internal thoracic artery to left anterior descending anastomosis was performed using the U-Clip device. ResultsWe completed 58 totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass procedures, in which 16 patients received hybrid procedures. Two patients had conversions to a minithoracotomy. The average left internal thoracic artery harvesting and anastomosis times were 31. 3 ± 10. 5 (18 ∼ 55) minutes and 11. 3 ± 4. 7 (5 ∼ 21) minutes, respectively. The mean operating room and operation times were 336. 1 ± 58. 5 (210 ∼ 580) minutes and 264. 8 ± 65. 6 (150 ∼ 420) minutes, respectively. The drainage was 164. 9 ± 83. 2 (70 ∼ 450) mL. Before discharge, 50 patients underwent angiography and 8 patients underwent computed tomography angiography, and the study showed that graft patency was 100 %. Unexpectedly, the left internal thoracic artery graft developed a collateral branch in 2 patients. After discharge, all patients were followed up by computed tomography angiography. The average follow-up time was 12. 67 ± 9. 43 (1 – 40) months. One patient had gastric bleeding after surgery. ConclusionsTotally endoscopic coronary artery bypass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> heart is a safe procedure in selected patients and produces excellent early and midterm patency of anastomosis...|$|R
