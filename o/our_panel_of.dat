5000|$|In 2015 Vann {{created an}} {{evaluation}} system as the 21st Century award for quality and credibility called Liquor Rank. It exists {{to provide the}} definitive last word on spirits and beverage evaluation and provide you limitless opportunities to market your brand. Each product is reviewed under ideal tasting conditions {{by a panel of}} experts of which Vann is a seat member, who know what they and ultimately consumers, are looking for. Each product submitted to Liquor Rank is evaluated and ranked in blind tastings ensuring your rank is bias free. Beer wine and spirits industry trade buyers and consumers recognize and respond to the value of Liquor Rank's accolades and scores, setting itself apart from over saturated liquor competitions that will hand over a medal to almost anyone who enters, Liquor Rank is different; it's the last word on quality. A favorable Liquor Rank is easily and immediately recognized as a symbol of achievement as it was earned via the ultimate definition of balanced spirits evaluation. Your brand truly earns its score, it doesn't just get awarded a medal for showing up. Victoria has said this about how Liquor Rank works, [...] "Literally, you take a number, and we all know numbers are useful. They help us count; our money, our time, and just where we stand in the world. In the world of selling more liquor it is your Liquor Rank that counts. You put your heart and soul into this spirit, now it's time to tell everyone just how good it is. Your Liquor Rank is based on your product and your product alone. It's not about how you stack up against the next guy, not what another category is doing in terms of increasing their sales and market penetration, but, quite simply your Liquor Rank reflects the positive qualities your liquid brings to the glass. Liquor Rank is the defining number that, at a glance, allows buyers and consumers to know just what to expect when they pick up your bottle. Like well respected wine industry ratings systems Liquor Rank is based on a 20 point scale, set from 80-100. Your product is judged on its merits; taste, texture, color, aroma, mixability, and price. All of these factors are considered by <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> experts." ...|$|E

40|$|From {{cancerous}} and non-cancerous patients, we derived stable clones of CD 4 (+) Treg, {{defined as}} clones that expressed high CD 25 at rest, were anergic in vitro, and suppressed {{the proliferation of}} co-cultured CD 4 (+) cells. A conserved region of FOXP 3 intron 1 was demethylated in all Treg clones, whereas it was methylated in non-regulatory Th and CTL clones. In <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> human clones, this stable epigenetic mark correlated better with suppressive activity than did FOXP 3 mRNA or protein expression. We used expression microarrays to compare Treg and Th clones after activation, which is required for suppressive function. The transcriptional profile that is specific of activated Treg clones includes a TGF-beta signature. Both activated Treg and Th clones produced the latent form of TGF-beta. However, SMAD 2 phosphorylation was observed after activation in the Treg {{but not in the}} Th clones, indicating that only activated Treg clones produced the bioactive form of TGF-beta. A TGF-beta signature was also displayed by a Th clone "suppressed" by a Treg clone. In conclusion, the hallmark of <b>our</b> <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> activated human Treg clones is to produce bioactive TGF-beta which has autocrine actions on Tregs and can have paracrine actions on other T cells.

40|$|The rigid {{structures}} at {{the surface}} of plant cells {{are some of the}} most structurally complex & mechanically robust sets of biomaterials in nature. Given the dominance of plants on land, these cell walls are highly abundant and are a major repository of fixed carbon and form the bulk of the Earth's biomass.   Plant cell walls and their component polymers are used extensively for food, textiles, paper, lumber and industrial polymers as well as a sustainable form of bioenergy. Our research interests are focused on plant cell walls in relation to plant cell development & growth as well as their use in applied & industrial contexts. We are specifically interested in developing tools to understand primary cell wall structures & architectures in relation to cell adhesion, cell expansion & the differentiation of plant cells. We are also interested in secondary cell wall structures and properties in growing plants as well as in relation to their use as industrial fibres. Our lab maintain, and continue to develop, a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> rat hybridoma & phage display monoclonal antibodies to plant cell wall glycans to help in our studies of cell walls and for the imaging of cell wall molecular architectures.
