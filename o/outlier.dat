5|$|Casamero Pueblo {{is located}} on McKinley County Road 19, near Tecolote Mesa, a red {{sandstone}} mesa. It was connected to its nearby <b>outlier,</b> Andrews Ranch, by a Chacoan road. Chaco Canyon, Aztec Ruins, Salmon Ruins, and Casamero Pueblo are on the Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway.|$|E
5|$|The Hebridean {{archipelago}} <b>outlier</b> of St Kilda {{is composed}} of Paleogene igneous formations of granites and gabbro, heavily weathered by the elements. These islands represent {{the remnants of a}} long extinct ring volcano rising from a seabed plateau approximately 40m (130ft) below sea level.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} streams has cut combes through the hills {{down to the}} sea, which are now wooded, {{although}} much of Exmoor is open heathland. There is an <b>outlier</b> of Exmoor at North Hill near Minehead. Iron working was formerly carried out, probably from the Roman period onward.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Ashland {{has been}} {{something}} of a political <b>outlier</b> in southwest Oregon. In the presidential election of 1860, Ashland favored Abraham Lincoln while its neighbors strongly preferred pro-slavery candidates. In the early 1900s, Ashland voters supported women's suffrage and prohibition, generally {{out of step with the}} rest of the region. In more recent elections, liberal Ashland has supported tax levies and environmental regulations opposed by voters elsewhere in Jackson and nearby counties. Critics sometimes refer to the city as the People's Republic of Ashland.|$|E
5|$|Nafaanra is {{bordered by}} Kulango {{languages}} to the west, while Deg (a Gur language) and Gonja (Kwa) {{are found to}} the north and east. The closest eastern neighbour is the Mande language Ligbi, whose speakers are also called Banda) which, like Nafaanra, is an <b>outlier</b> to its own family. Southeast and south of Nafaanra and Ligbi, the Akan language Abron (also Bron or Brong) is spoken.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Jeanne {{steadily}} intensified as {{it turned}} eastward, developing a 52mi (83km) wide eye. A motion to the southeast began on September 22, and {{around the same time}} it reached winds of 100mph (160km/h), making it a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At the same time, the National Hurricane Center forecast to turn westward and later northwestward, with its projected five-day track within 60mi (100km) of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The westernmost <b>outlier</b> during one model run was the NOGAPS model, which predicted a continued westward motion across central Florida. The official forecast changed early on September 23 to bring Jeanne across northeastern Florida, though initially the cyclone was predicted to turn northeastward and hit South Carolina as a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Demographic data is {{produced}} by the Office for National Statistics for the wards of Cranham and Upminster. All of Cranham is contained within these wards, however they also cover the connected settlement of Upminster and the rural <b>outlier</b> of North Ockendon. In 2001 the population of Upminster ward was 12,674 and Cranham ward was 12,242, giving a total population of 25,098. 80.95% in Upminster and 81.73% in Cranham report their religion as Christian, compared to 76.13% for Havering, 58.23% in London and 71.74% in England. 10.08% in Upminster and 10.46% in Cranham report having no religion, compared to 13.18% in Havering, 15.76% in London and 14.59% in England. With a black and minority ethnic population of 3% in 2001, Cranham and Upminster wards have the lowest Simpson index for ethnic diversity in London. The level of home ownership is atypically high compared {{to the rest of}} London and England, with over 90% of housing tenure under owner-occupation in both wards.|$|E
5|$|Geomorphologically, the {{mountain}} is a mesa-like <b>outlier,</b> {{that is to}} say, {{the remains of a}} plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks (the so-called Jasneuf fault) between the current summit and the Vercors high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres, leaving the peak standing on its own. This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille, including the cliffs, which are almost identical to those on {{the eastern edge of the}} Vercors Plateau such as those on the edge of the Grand Veymont, which is the highest point of the range. Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit plateau, which are similar to those to the west on the rest of the Vercors plateau.|$|E
5|$|On {{its first}} advisory, there was {{disagreement}} among forecast models regarding its eventual track, with projected tracks deviating from a Georgia landfall to a track northeastward out to sea. Alpha {{was also a}} climatological <b>outlier</b> at the time; the NHC HURRAN model, {{which was based on}} previous storms with similar characteristics, found no analogs for the storm. Subtropical Storm Alpha was initially well-defined as it moved southwestward. The very small center was located along {{the eastern edge of the}} convection, while low-level cloud bands formed east of the center. At the time, the temperature structure was more typical of a winter storm, although it was expected to become more like a subtropical storm typical during the summer months. The winds decreased steadily as it turned more westward on May 27, and the heavy rainfall persisted mostly to the north and west of the center.|$|E
5|$|The Havering {{committee}} {{area for}} Upminster {{is defined as}} the wards of Upminster and Cranham. Demographic data is produced by the Office for National Statistics for these wards. All of Upminster is contained within these wards, however they also cover the connected settlement of Cranham and the rural <b>outlier</b> of North Ockendon. In 2001 the population of Upminster ward was 12,674 and Cranham ward was 12,242, giving a total population of 25,098. 80.95% in Upminster and 81.73% in Cranham report their religion as Christian, compared to 76.13% for Havering, 58.23% in London and 71.74% in England. 10.08% in Upminster and 10.46% in Cranham report having no religion, compared to 13.18% in Havering, 15.76% in London and 14.59% in England. With a black and minority ethnic population of 3% in 2001, Cranham and Upminster wards have the lowest Simpson index for ethnic diversity in London. The level of home ownership is atypically high compared to the rest of London and England, with over 90% of housing tenure under owner-occupation in both wards. The Upminster ward has one of the lowest levels of deprivation in London.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Protocol, {{signed in}} 1987, set strict {{regulations}} on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons {{due to their}} ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant {{that they were not}} decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules. Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery. With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements, and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030–2040 by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with no chlorine and zero ODP. In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries; the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003. Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000. An <b>outlier</b> is HFO-1234yf which is a new type of refrigerant called a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current refrigerant standard HFC-134a.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this <b>outlier</b> with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E
25|$|The {{modified}} Thompson Tau test {{is used to}} {{find one}} <b>outlier</b> at a time (largest value of δ is removed if it is an <b>outlier).</b> Meaning, if a data point {{is found to be}} an <b>outlier,</b> it is removed from the data set and the test is applied again with a new average and rejection region. This process is continued until no outliers remain in a data set.|$|E
25|$|If δ > Rejection Region, {{the data}} point is an <b>outlier.</b>|$|E

25|$|The casemate line {{formed a}} barrier across the Alsace Plain between the Vosges Mountains, whose last <b>outlier</b> was at Schoenenbourg, and the Rhine River.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} {{how to deal with}} an <b>outlier</b> should depend on the cause. Some estimators are highly {{sensitive}} to outliers, notably estimation of covariance matrices.|$|E
25|$|The {{modified}} Thompson Tau test is {{a method}} used to determine if an <b>outlier</b> exists in a data set. The strength of this method {{lies in the fact}} that it takes into account a data set’s standard deviation, average and provides a statistically determined rejection zone; thus providing an objective method to determine if a data point is an <b>outlier.</b> Note: Although intuitively appealing, this method appears to be unpublished (it is not described in Thompson (1985)) and one should use it with caution.|$|E
25|$|Lingmell is a {{fell in the}} English Lake District, {{standing}} {{above the}} village of Wasdale Head. It is an <b>outlier</b> on the north-west flank of Scafell Pike, England’s highest mountain.|$|E
25|$|Deletion of <b>outlier</b> data is a {{controversial}} practice frowned upon by many scientists and science instructors; while mathematical criteria provide an objective and quantitative method for data rejection, {{they do not}} make the practice more scientifically or methodologically sound, especially in small sets or where a normal distribution cannot be assumed. Rejection of outliers is more acceptable in areas of practice where the underlying model of the process being measured and the usual distribution of measurement error are confidently known. An <b>outlier</b> resulting from an instrument reading error may be excluded but it is desirable that the reading is at least verified.|$|E
25|$|Arnison Crag is a {{fell in the}} English Lake District, an <b>outlier</b> of the Fairfield {{group in}} the Eastern Fells. It looks down on Patterdale village and the upper reach of Ullswater.|$|E

25|$|In {{the data}} mining task of anomaly detection, other {{approaches}} are distance-based and density-based such as Local <b>Outlier</b> Factor, {{and most of}} them use the distance to the k-nearest neighbors to label observations as outliers or non-outliers.|$|E
25|$|The sample {{kurtosis}} is {{a useful}} measure of {{whether there is a}} problem with outliers in a data set. Larger kurtosis indicates a more serious <b>outlier</b> problem, and may lead the researcher to choose alternative statistical methods.|$|E
25|$|The {{pattern of}} {{settlement}} that {{is believed to have}} occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from the Samoan Islands into the Tuvaluan atolls, with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to migration into the Polynesian <b>Outlier</b> communities in Melanesia and Micronesia.|$|E
25|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of Tuvalu were Polynesians.

25|$|Dicraeosaurids are {{differentiated}} {{from their}} sister group, diplodocids, and from most sauropods by their relatively small body size and short necks. Dicraeosaurids are advanced sauropods within the monophyletic clade Neosauropoda, {{which is generally}} characterized by gigantism.
