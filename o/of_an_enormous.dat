Marth leads his army to an ancient temple where Gharnef holds the ceremony. After killing Gharnef, retrieving Falchion, and rescuing the clerics, Marth confronts Medeus, who has taken the form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> dark dragon. Using the Falchion and Shield of Seals, Marth slays Medeus. With peace restored to the land, Marth and Caeda, now married, become the rulers of all Archanea.|$|E
5|$|Labyrinth is a 1986 British-American {{adventure}} musical dark fantasy film {{directed by}} Jim Henson, executive-produced by George Lucas, and based upon conceptual designs by Brian Froud. The film revolves around 15-year-old Sarah's (Jennifer Connelly) quest {{to reach the}} center <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> otherworldly maze to rescue her infant brother Toby, whom Sarah wished away to Jareth, the Goblin King (David Bowie). With the exception of Connelly and Bowie, most of the film's significant characters are played by puppets produced by Jim Henson's Creature Shop.|$|E

5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese pay too heavy a price for their effort. Corollary to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> amount of ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure {{was never going to}} be sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} {{geological}} reconnaissance of the Three Sisters region {{was published in}} 1925, its author, University of Oregon professor E. T. Hodge, suggested that the area's volcanoes comprised the remains <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> collapsed volcano active during the Miocene or early Pliocene epoch. Naming this ancient volcano Mount Multnomah, Hodge theorized that it had collapsed to form a caldera just as Mount Mazama collapsed to form Crater Lake. However, in the 1940s, University of California, Berkeley professor Howel Williams completed {{an analysis of the}} Three Sisters vicinity and concluded that Multnomah had never existed, instead showing that each volcano in the area possessed its own individual eruptive history.|$|E
5|$|This {{reliance}} on eunuchs caused some hostility in the military; resentment at Staurakios's appointment to this powerful post {{is given by}} the Byzantine chroniclers {{as the reason for}} the (initially secret) defection of the prominent Armenian strategos of the Bucellarian Theme, Tatzates, to the Arabs in 782. This was a critical blow to the Byzantines, who at that time had almost succeeded in encircling the invading army of the future Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809). On Tatzates's suggestion, Harun asked for negotiations, but when the imperial envoys, including Staurakios, arrived, they were seized and held as hostages. At this point, Tatzates and his men publicly went over to the Caliph. Staurakios and the other envoys were released only when Empress Irene accepted the Caliph's harsh terms for a three-year truce, including the annual payment <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> tribute of 70,000 or 90,000 gold dinars and the handing over of 10,000 silk garments.|$|E

Throughout the siege he utilized a carrot and stick approach with the rebels; Zanj troops that voluntarily surrendered were granted guarantees of safety and rewards, and were paraded in front of al-Mukhtarah to convince others to join them, while rebel soldiers that were killed in battle were at times decapitated and their heads were displayed in view of the defenders.|$|E

During the years 1930 to 1933 he travelled widely, particularly in Africa, in search of big-game (as the trophies that could be seen at his house at Princes Gate after the war testified) though his bags were reputedly always packed with art books. He even acquired a pilot's license in Berlin.|$|E

25|$|Teaming up with Aranea, Prompto infiltrates a {{secondary}} research facility located underground.

Verstael intends to kill the last remaining Astrals and overthrow the Empire {{so that he can}} rule Eos. Prompto and Aranea destroy the last remaining magitek prototypes, but are unable to locate Immortalis. An announcement from the system mainframe leads to Immortalis being activated, and Prompto and Aranea race back to the surface.

Immortalis heads towards Gralea as Prompto and Aranea try to destroy it with a machine gun mounted to a snowmobile. In destroying Immortalis, they successfully kill Verstael.

25|$|Pope Julius' {{scheme for}} the grandest {{building}} in Christendom {{was the subject}} of a competition for which a number of entries remain intact in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. It was the design of Donato Bramante that was selected, and for which the foundation stone was laid in 1506. This plan was in the form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> Greek Cross with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular Roman temple, the Pantheon. The main difference between Bramante's design and that of the Pantheon is that where the dome of the Pantheon is supported by a continuous wall, that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers. This feature was maintained in the ultimate design. Bramante's dome was to be surmounted by a lantern with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the Early Renaissance lantern of Florence Cathedral designed for Brunelleschi's dome by Michelozzo.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{route from}} the Central Valley to the Bay skirted the Delta by heading south out of Sacramento through Stockton and crossing the San Joaquin River at Mossdale, then {{climbed over the}} Altamont Pass and reached the East Bay through Niles Canyon. The Western Pacific was originally chartered to go to San Jose, but the Central Pacific decided to build along the East Bay instead, as going from San Jose up the Peninsula to San Francisco itself would have brought it into conflict with competing interests. The railroad entered Alameda and Oakland from the south, roughly paralleling what would later become U.S. Route 50 and later still Interstates 5, 205, and 580. A more direct route was obtained with {{the purchase of the}} California Pacific Railroad, crossing the Sacramento River and proceeding southwest through Davis to Benicia, where it crossed the Carquinez Strait by means <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> train ferry, then followed the shores of the San Pablo and San Francisco bays to Richmond and the Port of Oakland (paralleling U.S. Route 40 which ultimately became Interstate 80). In 1930, a rail bridge across the Carquinez replaced the Benicia ferries.|$|E
