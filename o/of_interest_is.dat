5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced theory <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> also presented. Cantillon {{believed that}} interest originates {{from the need}} of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts {{an insert}} {{is a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin systems {{can be used to}} {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein. Thus, cells containing the plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{counsel is}} {{retained}} or appointed, the defendant {{has a right}} to counsel without a conflict of interest. If an actual conflict <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal. The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived, but some conflicts are un-waiveable.|$|E

5|$|Another area <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> in {{assessing}} whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better}} than Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|Pottery finds showed better finish {{compared}} to the earlier Period I. The pots were of polished black ware, mostly handmade, {{in the form of}} a dish with stand, a high-necked jar, and so forth. Also found was a wheel turned red ware pot which contained 950 beads made from carnelian and agate (inferred as items for sale), which was thought to belong to the later part of this period. A very impressive painted pottery ware recovered from this period was a globular red ware pot made on a turntable; the painting on the pot was of a wild goat of black colour with long horns and hanging ears. Another pottery item which is <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> a polished black ware in globular shape jar with a long neck and flaring mouth.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow areas <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} most striking possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E

25|$|Multi-voxel {{spectroscopy}} {{provides information}} about group of voxels and {{data can be}} presented in 2D or 3D images, but it requires longer acquisition times and therefore temporal resolution is decreased.

40|$|Conflicts <b>of</b> <b>{{interests}}</b> arise due to {{the fact}} that a person’s right to demand to act in his interests imposes a duty on another person to act in such a way. Different concepts <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> used in various sectors and their problems are analyzed in the article. Whereas there is no unified concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> used in practice it is unclear which types of relations are regarded as conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> when conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> arises and what are the solutions to it. Due to these reasons universal concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> <b>is</b> constructed and elements <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> <b>are</b> analyzed in this article. The concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> <b>is</b> discussed in the context of agency theory in the broad sense, i. e. in the legal and economic sense. Theoretical model and types <b>of</b> conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> <b>are</b> particularly important while trying to solve conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> There <b>are</b> two main categories of solutions: preventive and managing measures. Preventive measures are intended to avoid conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> before it arises and managing measures are intended to manage already risen conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> and to prevent negative consequences. The article concludes with the concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> its types and solutions...|$|R
