40|$|The 1990 s have {{witnessed}} a significant growth in bank income generated through non-traditional activities especially for large EU universal institutions. Using the non-parametric Malmquist methodology this paper analyses {{the importance of}} the inclusion of off-balance sheet (<b>OBS)</b> <b>business</b> in the definition of banks output when estimating total factor productivity change indexes. The analysis is then extended to the decomposition of total factor productivity change into technical efficiency and technological change. The results reinforce the prevalent view in the recent literature, indicating that the exclusion of non-traditional activities leads to a misspecification of banks output. In particular, the inclusion of OBS items results in an increase in estimated productivity levels for all countries under study. However, the impact seems to be the biggest on technological change rather than efficiency change. Overall, results suggest that despite the uneven distribution of OBS between countries and among different institutions in the same country, these non-traditional activities are increasingly important and failure to account for them would lead to biased conclusions...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{characterisation}} of the Greek banking system’s efficiency and productivity {{under the new}} environment that the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) participation implies. We consider both cost and profit efficiency as well as productivity change of commercial banks using the non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) Malmquist Index. The period under study is 1998 - 2003 covering Greece’s entry into the euro area in 2001 and the run-up to it. Moreover, enhanced competition along with lower inflation and interest rates has further motivated financial innovation and off-balance sheet (<b>OBS)</b> <b>business.</b> We explicitly account for the possible role of OBS items in the efficiency estimation and test what input/output model best describes Greek banks ’ production process. Our findings suggest that cost efficiency has risen by 4. 3 % over the six years under study. Moreover, Greek banks seem to enjoy relatively high profit efficiency (on average 75 %) showing an increase by 93 % over 1998 - 2003. Similarly, productivity seems to have risen by 15 % and this was mainly driven by the improvements {{in the performance of}} best-practice institutions. Our results do not show an...|$|E

Finally, while the impact of profitability and size on efficiency and productivity yields mixed results, our empirical findings seem to corroborate previous studies in that controlling for risk preferences is important in determining bank efficiency. ...|$|E

40|$|Further {{reflecting}} {{on the study of}} organizational behavior (<b>OB)</b> in family <b>business</b> (FB), this rejoinder piece discusses and integrates the points raised in the three thoughtful commentaries and our original article. We start by highlighting the general agreement between us and the commentators on three points: (i) that family firms are theoretically distinct from non-family firms due to significant involvement of kinship ties in the enterprise; (ii) there is paucity of research at the interface of OB and FB; and (iii) there is an abundance of interesting research questions at this interface with the potential to benefit both domains of study. Next, we discuss and elaborate on the research possibilities on time, teams, and positive organizational study, suggested by the commentators. An illustrative list of interesting research questions at the OBFB interface that extend and enrich our agenda for future research is shared. We conclude that not only is family business a promising context for behavioral scholars to investigate, the timing is perfect for such investigation...|$|R
