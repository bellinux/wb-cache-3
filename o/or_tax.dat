5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee <b>or</b> <b>tax</b> paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E

To date, almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs <b>or</b> <b>tax</b> credits, but as levelized costs have fallen significantly in the last decade and grid parity has been reached in an increasing number of markets, it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|Critics say the MFP formula discourages {{high levels}} of local, rather than state, funding. Louisiana House Speaker Jim Tucker said in an {{interview}} with Louisiana Public Broadcasting that the MFP formula keeps districts from levying higher taxes because districts with high local taxes receive lower state funding payments. Tulane University's Cowen Institute was founded in 2007 to examine the effects of local tax initiatives on the MFP. Tara O'Neill, Cowen Institute Policy Manager, said districts receive extra incentive funding from the state when they raise high amounts of funding at the local level. O'Neill said districts get this extra money whether they tax a low tax base at a high rate <b>or</b> <b>tax</b> a healthy tax base at a low rate.|$|E

Federally, Seattle is part of Washington's 7th congressional district, represented by Democrat Pramila Jayapal, the first Indian American woman elected to Congress.

5|$|Although {{the emperor}} held supreme power, he more often sought {{the advice of}} his cabinet and other ministers before making {{decisions}} and when revoking them. He often assembled leading officials for debates or discussions on policy, known as court conferences (tingyi 廷議). Various issues were debated at these gatherings, such as installment of new emperors, enfeoffment of nobles, the establishment of new ancestral temples, reforms to the state religion, the monetary <b>or</b> <b>tax</b> systems, management of government monopolies on salt and iron (when they existed during Western Han), the introduction of new laws or the repeal of old ones, complex lawsuits, or whether or not to declare war on a foreign country or accept peaceful negotiation. Although the emperor could reject the decisions reached by his court conference, he did so at the risk of alienating his leading ministers. More often than not, he was forced to accept the majority consensus of his ministers, whose individual opinions were equally tallied regardless of their standing or salary-rank.|$|E

5|$|Hilary {{held the}} office of Sheriff of Sussex in 1155, and then again in 1160 through 1162. It was very unusual for a bishop to hold the post of sheriff, and was {{a measure of the}} trust that King Henry II had in Hilary. Hilary was the only bishop to hold {{the office of}} sheriff during Henry's reign, with the {{possible}} exception of Robert de Chesney, the Bishop of Lincoln. An English church council in 1143 had forbidden clergy to hold office as stewards <b>or</b> <b>tax</b> gatherers for non-clergy. As the office of sheriff involved the gathering of the county farm, or income from the county, and the payment of those revenues into the Exchequer, clergy holding office as sheriffs would have been acting against the decrees of the 1143 council. Hilary was well known as a canon lawyer, and was often employed by the papacy as a judge-delegate, hearing cases that had been appealed to Rome, and then sent back to the country of origin for trial. He also assisted other papal judges, including Theobald of Bec. Hilary served in England as a royal justice in 1156, and then was with the king in Normandy from late 1156 to April 1157. Hilary acted as judge-delegate for the papacy in at least 15 cases during his bishopric. He acted as a legal advisor to Henry II on a number of occasions, and Hilary's clerks occasionally drew up documents for the king.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of green charges <b>or</b> <b>taxes</b> in South Africa {{as an environmental}} management tool is currently under discussion and debate. Pressure from the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEA&T) is currently being {{brought to bear on}} Government to introduce such green charges (also referred to as the use of market-based instruments). The DEA&T started a comprehensive research project in 1993 on the use of market-based instruments in South Africa. The conclusion was drawn that market-based instruments should be implemented as soon as possible as an environmental management tool. The possible {{introduction of}} green charges <b>or</b> <b>taxes</b> in South Africa also featured in several other discussion documents, green papers and white papers on environmental issues. The above-mentioned documents consider the use of green charges <b>or</b> <b>taxes</b> and do not deal with related issues such as the income tax and value-added tax (VAT) consequcnces. This research paper attempts to address the related income tax and value-added tax issues and consequences of the use of certain market-based instruments. Market-based instruments refer to the different bases on which the green charges <b>or</b> <b>taxes</b> may be levied. It is of the utmost importance that these issues be dealt with before the introduction of green charges <b>or</b> <b>taxes,</b> as they will influence fiscal policy and planning as well as the effectiveness of the <b>tax</b> base <b>or</b> instruments used in environmental management...|$|R

Alonso de Zuazo as justicia mayor or assessor. They arrived in New Spain in 1524 and formed the Tribunal de Cuentas (tribunal of accounts).
