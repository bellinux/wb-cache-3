5|$|Boitani {{discusses}} the modern use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> Troilus in a chapter entitled Eros and Thanatos. Love and death, the latter {{either as a}} tragedy in itself or as an epic symbol of Troy's own destruction, therefore, are the two core elements of the Troilus myth for {{the editor of the}} first book-length survey of it from ancient to modern times. He sees the character as incapable of transformation on a heroic scale in the manner of Ulysses and also blocked from the possibility of development as an archetypal figure of troubled youth by Hamlet. Troilus' appeal for the 20th and 21st century is his very humanity.|$|E
5|$|Her friendships {{were limited}} to her ladies-in-waiting, and in {{particular}} Dona Josefina da Fonseca Costa. She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, kindly and an affectionate mother and grandmother. She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and {{gave the impression of}} being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E

5|$|McNamara's {{popularity}} {{continues to}} this date, as he can currently be seen in local television advertisements in Syracuse, New York, including the ad for Fernandez Automall. On August 16, 2006, The Scranton Red Barons, Triple-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies, gave the first 6,000 fans through the gates at PNC Field a Gerry McNamara bobblehead doll. The doll was featured on the Scranton-set television show The Office, placed on the desk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> Dwight Schrute.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Sharp's brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, wrote Vindication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Character</b> <b>of</b> the Late Col. Solomon P. Sharp {{to defend}} him from the charges contained in Beauchamp's confession. In Vindication, Dr. Sharp portrayed the killing as a political assassination: he named Patrick Darby, a partisan of the Anti-Relief faction, as co-conspirator with Beauchamp, an Anti-Relief stalwart. Darby threatened to sue Sharp if he published his Vindication; and Waring threatened to kill him. Heeding these threats, Sharp did not publish his work; all extant manuscripts remained in his house, where they were discovered many years later during a remodeling.|$|E
5|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> the {{buildings}} in the town derives {{from the use of}} local stone, much of it from the Town Quarry. Notable among the architects working in the 19th century was Hans Price (1835–1912). Many examples of his work are still to be seen: the Town Hall, the Mercury Office, the Constitutional Club (originally the Lodge of St Kew), villas and numerous other domestic dwellings. The Odeon Cinema by Thomas Cecil Howitt is notable for fully retaining many Art Deco features both internally and externally, and retaining its original theatre organ, a Compton from 1935. It {{is believed to be the}} only cinema organ in the West Country left working in its original location and is still in regular use. Other organs by Compton in Weston-super-Mare can be found at Victoria Methodist Church and All Saints' Church by George Bodley (modelled on that in Downside Abbey).|$|E

25|$|Suzuki {{reportedly}} {{was involved}} with some anti-war activities during World War II, but according to David Chadwick, the record is confusing and, at most, his actions were low-key.

25|$|Cleopatra, {{being the}} complex figure that she is, has faced {{a variety of}} interpretations of {{character}} throughout history. Perhaps the most famous dichotomy {{is that of the}} manipulative seductress versus the skilled leader. Examining the critical history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> Cleopatra reveals that intellectuals of the 19th century and the early 20th century viewed her as merely an object of sexuality that could be understood and diminished rather than an imposing force with great poise and capacity for leadership.|$|E
