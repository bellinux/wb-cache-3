40|$|Abstract: The {{geomagnetic}} field causes {{not only the}} East-West effect on the primary cosmic rays but also affects <b>the</b> trajectories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary charged particles in <b>the</b> <b>showers,</b> causing their lateral distribution to be stretched along certain directions. Thus both <b>the</b> density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondaries near <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> axis and <b>the</b> trigger efficiency <b>of</b> a detector array decrease. The effect depends on age and direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>showers,</b> thus introducing modulation in the measured azimuthal distribution. Here <b>the</b> non-uniformity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> azimuthal distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> with <b>the</b> core inside the ARGO-YBJ detector is investigated for different zenith angles on <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> this effect...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{potential}} {{detection technique}} of ultra-high energy cosmic rays would be <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation emitted by low-energy electrons left after <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> in <b>the</b> atmosphere. The emission mechanism is expected from quasi-elastic collisions of electrons produced in <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> by <b>the</b> ionisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecules in the atmosphere. Given <b>the</b> low energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ionisation electrons, GHz photons resulting from this emission mechanism {{are expected to}} be emitted isotropically. This would allow for mapping the ionisation content along <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> through <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microwave signals detected at ground, {{in the same way as}} done for the fluorescence technique. In this contribution, a detailed calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectral intensity <b>of</b> photons at ground level originating from the transitions between unquantised energy states of free ionisation electrons is presented.

The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E

5|$|Located {{within an}} area of {{moderate}} southwesterly wind shear, the depression was slow to organize; early on October 14, a clear center was not depicted on Infrared satellite imagery. The depression moved to the west-northwest and gradually strengthened into Tropical Storm Nicholas late on October 14 while located 1,200miles (1,930km) east of the Windward Islands. On October 15, deep convection became much better organized, though the center of Nicholas remained displaced from the deepest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> activity. Despite the shear, the storm continued to strengthen as it moved to the west-northwest, a motion caused by a mid-level ridge to its north. On October 16, Nicholas transitioned from a sheared, unorganized system to a more organized system, {{as a result of}} banding features and improvement in its convective pattern due to lesser amounts of vertical shear and a healthier anticyclone over the storm. Nicholas continued to strengthen, and attained a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October 17 while located 875miles (1,410km) east of the Leeward Islands. Dvorak estimates suggested Nicholas potentially attained hurricane status, though microwave images of the storm showed a sheared system without any evidence of an eye feature.|$|E

25|$|Psycho {{is among}} Hitchcock's most widely seen films. Produced on a {{constrained}} budget of $800,000, it {{was shot in}} black-and-white on a spare set using crew members from his television show Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The unprecedented violence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> scene, the early death of the heroine and the innocent lives extinguished by a disturbed murderer became the defining hallmarks of a new horror film genre and have been copied by many authors of subsequent films. The public loved the film, with lines stretching outside of cinemas as people {{had to wait for}} the next showing. It broke box-office records in the United Kingdom, France, South America, the United States and Canada and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period. It was the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career; Hitchcock personally earned well in excess of $15 million. He subsequently swapped his rights to Psycho and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of MCA, making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc. and his own boss at Universal, in theory at least, but that did not stop them from interfering with him. Following the first film directed by Hitchcock, Psycho has since become an American horror franchise consisting of six films loosely based on the Psycho novels by Robert Bloch, namely Psycho, Psycho II, Psycho III, Bates Motel, , the scene-by-scene colour 1998 remake of the original film, and additional merchandise spanning various media.|$|E
