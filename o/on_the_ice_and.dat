5|$|As plans {{moved forward}} the {{decision}} was made not just to play the game but make it an event celebrating New York hockey history. For the game the Crunch played their intrastate rivals the Binghamton Senators. The days before the game local youth hockey teams played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> then the day after there was a pond hockey tournament played on the rink featuring 16 local teams. The fairgrounds also featured VIP tents, fan zones, bands, and ice sculpting for the celebration, as well as appearances by former players for New York's various professional teams.|$|E
5|$|The club {{began the}} 1930s decade successfully, with Stanley Cup wins in 1930 and 1931. The Canadiens and its then-Montreal rival, the Montreal Maroons, {{declined}} both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> economically during the Great Depression. Losses grew {{to the point}} where the team owners considering selling the team to interests in Cleveland, Ohio, though local investors were ultimately found to finance the Canadiens. The Maroons still suspended operations, and several of their players moved to the Canadiens.|$|E
5|$|The media hype he has {{encountered}} has led Tavares to remain guarded when {{speaking to the}} media, while his teammates and family attempt to shield him from the spotlight where they can. However, Tavares {{is regarded as a}} natural leader <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> a player who puts his team first. The Oshawa Generals named Tavares their team captain in 2008, while he also served as the alternate captain with the Canadian junior team in 2009.|$|E

5|$|After {{buying the}} team, COMSAT {{organized}} its Denver sports franchises under a separate subsidiary, Ascent Entertainment Group Inc., which {{went public in}} 1995, with 80% of its stock bought by COMSAT and the other 20% available on NASDAQ. The Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver (where the Denver Nuggets also played) on October 6, 1995, winning 3–2 against the Detroit Red Wings. Valeri Kamensky scored the first goal as the Avalanche. Led by captain Joe Sakic, forward Peter Forsberg and defenseman Adam Foote <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> Pierre Lacroix as the general manager and Marc Crawford as the head coach, the Avalanche became stronger when All-Star Montreal Canadiens goalie Patrick Roy joined the team. Feeling humiliated for being left in the net after having let in nine goals in 26 shots during a Canadiens game against the Red Wings, Roy joined the Avalanche on December 6, 1995, together with ex-Montreal captain Mike Keane in a trade for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Ručinský and Andrei Kovalenko. Roy would prove a pivotal addition for Colorado {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{competitor}} on paper in 1988, Coates {{was supposed to}} only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race. However, the AOF officially listed Coates as {{a competitor}} {{so that he could}} train with the others <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration was only for show and that he was not to race. However, {{when it was time for}} his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates in front of the cameras, but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.|$|E
5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E

5|$|During the February 21, 2000 {{game between}} the Canucks and the Boston Bruins, Brashear was {{involved}} in a fight with Marty McSorley. Brashear handily won the fight and {{on his way to the}} penalty box taunted the Bruins bench. Later in the game, Brashear collided with Bruins goaltender Byron Dafoe, who had to be taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury. For the rest of the game, McSorley attempted to fight Brashear, who refused. With 4.6 seconds left in the game, McSorley struck Brashear with a two-handed slash to the temple with his stick; Brashear collapsed, and his helmet fell off upon impact. He suffered a seizure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> the slash resulted in a grade three concussion. Goaltender Garth Snow then tried to fight McSorley, but a pile-up occurred, and Snow couldn't get at McSorley, who was ejected with 2.8 seconds left in the game. McSorley later received an indefinite suspension from the NHL and was charged with assault with a weapon as a result of his actions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight on ice, and that their own horses had been trained to fight on ice without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and dug into the ice with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing on to their spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having slipped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally tooth and nail battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Intimidation is an {{important}} element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot more space <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> <b>and</b> was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.|$|E

5|$|Team Canada took {{a number}} of {{questionable}} early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1–0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he was called for interference, but Parise admitted later he was guilty of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over. Parise was called for a misconduct for banging his stick <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> {{when he saw the}} misconduct called, he dashed across the ice with his stick raised. Parise nearly swung his stick at Kompalla and got a match penalty. Sinden threw a chair on the ice. Some writers have commented that the incidents resulted {{in the rest of the}} game being refereed capably.|$|E
25|$|The Minnesota North Stars began play in 1967 {{as part of}} the NHL's six-team expansion. Home {{games were}} played at the newly {{constructed}} Metropolitan Sports Center ("Met Center") in Bloomington, Minnesota.

During the playoffs, they advanced to the conference finals, where they lost to the Dallas Stars in a hard-fought series, with Bourque hitting the post in the last minutes of Game Seven which would have tied the game after his team rallied from a 3–0 deficit in the third period to 3–2.|$|E
25|$|Bossy {{was known}} {{for being able to}} score goals in {{remarkable}} fashion, the most incredible, perhaps, in the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals against the Vancouver Canucks when, up-ended by a check from Tiger Williams and flying several feet in the air, parallel to the ice, Bossy nonetheless managed to hook the puck with his stick and score. Bossy was also noted for his clean play, never resorting to fighting (and being one of the first players to speak out against violence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice),</b> <b>and</b> winning the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly play three times: 1983, 1984, and 1986.|$|E
25|$|Avery {{signed a}} four-year, $15.5 million {{contract}} with the Dallas Stars on July 2, 2008. He had been a roommate of the Stars' co-general manager Brett Hull when the two played for the Red Wings. Hull thought the Stars needed more fire and emotion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> felt Avery would fit the bill. Avery scored 3 goals in 23 games before he and the team parted ways following his six-game suspension by the NHL in December 2008, due to controversial remarks made about fellow players. The Stars placed Avery on waivers on February 7, 2009.|$|E

It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach the Kola Peninsula where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel, {{and by that time}} only 12 crewmen remained.

Sources differ on whether two men died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> floe <b>and</b> three in the boats, or three <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice</b> floe <b>and</b> two in the boats.

25|$|Adult seals {{more than}} one year old must be shot in the head with {{expanding}} bullets, and cannot be clubbed to death. The hakapik shall be used to ensure the animal is dead. This is done by crushing the skull of the shot adult seal with the short end of the hakapik, before the long spike is thrust deep into the animal's brain. The seal is then bled by making an incision from its jaw to the end of its sternum. The killing and bleeding must be done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>and</b> live animals may never be brought on board the ship. Young seals may be killed using just the hakapik, but only in the aforementioned manner, i.e., they need not be shot.|$|E
