5|$|During the mid nineties, Moran co-founded {{and later}} co-chaired the New Democrat Coalition, a {{coalition}} of Democratic lawmakers who consider themselves to be moderates with regard to commerce, budgeting, and economic legislation, but vote as liberals <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues.</b> Moran was {{also a member of}} the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), the largest caucus operating within the Democratic caucus, which works to advance progressive issues and opinions. He joined the caucus prior to the 111th Congress.|$|E
5|$|Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei {{became an}} {{important}} film in Vadivelu's career. It continued a trend of films with different themes that focused <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues.</b> K. Jeshi of The Hindu placed it in a category of films that discuss social issues like Sethu... (1999), Kaadhal (2004), Veyil (2006), Mozhi (2007) and Paruthiveeran (2007). Another critic from The Hindu, Sumit Bhattacharjee, compared it with other period films like The Ten Commandements (1956) Ben-Hur (1959) Titanic (1997), Gladiator (2000), 300 (2007) and Jodhaa Akbar (2008).|$|E

He sided with conservatives in the 2005 Terri Schiavo case, voting for federal court intervention in the case. In more recent years, he has advocated for and defended funding for Planned Parenthoood. He has sided with Democratic leaders on gay rights issues, however, opposing a Federal Marriage Amendment and supporting granting medical benefits to domestic partners of federal employees. He supports same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|Romney's {{liabilities}} included having run {{for senator}} {{and serving as}} governor {{in one of the}} nation's most liberal states and having taken positions in opposition to the party's conservative base during that time. Late during his term as governor, he had shifted positions and emphases to better align with traditional conservatives <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues.</b> Skeptics, including some Republicans, charged Romney with opportunism and a lack of core principles. As a Mormon, he faced suspicion and skepticism by some in the Evangelical portion of the party.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{two state}} {{elections}} were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%. Again Playford won with a one-seat LCL majority, hanging on {{with the help of the}} malapportioned electoral system.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Kemp {{continued}} to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible {{for the implementation of}} supply-side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas. He {{has been described as a}} beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues,</b> but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's agenda {{had been}} impeded {{by the fact}} that Congress was {{controlled}} by Democrats and he hoped {{to take control of the}} Senate in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues,</b> Gillibrand is {{generally}} liberal, supporting abortion rights, legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2017, {{she came out}} in favor of single-payer healthcare, and cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which would gradually expand the existing Medicare program to cover all Americans. She is a strong advocate for government transparency, being one of a few members of Congress who release much personal and scheduling information. She is also a strong supporter of female equality and involvement, having begun the website offthesidelines.org in 2011. Although a supporter of gun rights while in the House, Gillibrand has since moved in the direction of gun control.|$|E

5|$|Paul {{has been}} {{described}} as conservative and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president, on a scale primarily measuring positions on the role of government in managing the economyâ€“ not positions <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> or foreign policy matters. Other analyses, in which key votes on domestic social issues and foreign policy factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most conservative member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Republican offer {{called for}} an {{approximately}} $35 billion budget and no tax increases, and relied on delaying the payment of some K-12 school aid and issuing bonds against future tobacco revenue to cover the remaining gap. It differed from the previous Republican proposals in several provisions, particularly increasing the K-12 per-student formula by $50 per year to cover additional borrowing costs, adding $10 million to the University of Minnesota budget to equalize Minnesota State Colleges and Universities cuts, and restoring funding to the Department of Human Rights and the Trade Office. Dayton's conditions were that measures <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues</b> such as abortion be dropped from the budget, 15percent reductions to state employees in all agencies be dropped, and a $500 million infrastructure construction bonding bill.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>issues,</b> while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E
