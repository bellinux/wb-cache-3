30|$|The {{superior}} {{performance of}} the massive MIMO systems relies on the spatial multiplexing and the minor multi-user interference. As {{is the case for}} conventional MIMO systems, this in turn requires the BS to have perfect knowledge of the downlink channel state information (CSI) [4]. In a time division duplexing (TDD) system, the channel reciprocity can be exploited to acquire the downlink CSI at the BS [5]. However, things become more challenging when the system operates in a frequency division duplexing (FDD) mode, where the channel reciprocity no longer holds. Therefore, a mobile station (MS) needs to feedback the downlink CSI through a rate-limited uplink channel. The authors in [6] drew the conclusion that the required feedback rate per user should be increased in proportion to the number of the transmit antennas for the sake of obtaining the full multiplexing gain. Therefore, feedback <b>overhead</b> <b>turns</b> into a key challenge in the massive MIMO systems.|$|R
40|$|Transputer {{hardware}} (the T 8 series) {{allows a}} process to be interrupted momentarily but not pre-empted and saved for later execution. The latter implies {{that in order to}} implement pre-emption (by software) the context of the pre-empted process must be completely extracted from the system. There is difficulty in doing so with the T 8 transputer because parts of the context of a pre-empted process are not directly accessible. This paper presents a technique, which has been successfully incorporated in several versions of a scheduler, that can circumvent the problem by forcing {{a process to}} save the context by itself before giving up the CPU. Although the technique takes five context switches, the time (referred to as the scheduler <b>overhead)</b> <b>turns</b> out to be rather small - less than 50 μs for a 25 MHz transputer. A method for adding a process control block to a transputer process is also presented, which can be used to hold the saved context of a pre-empted process. This requires solving the 'floating workspace pointer' problem. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

NASA did not activate either Edwards Air Force Base, or White Sands, as the weather looked favorable for both landing opportunities at Kennedy. The weather forecast at the Shuttle Landing Facility called for good visibility, with mostly sunny skies, although the headwinds would be evaluated, {{as they had been}} peaking at 23 kn. Due to the sleep shifting done by the crew earlier in the mission to schedule the extra mission days, the landing was done on what is called a [...] "descending" [...] node entry. Unlike ascending node entries, this entry trajectory brought the shuttle diagonally across the United States {{for the first time since}} STS-107. The shuttle passed over Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and angled down towards Florida. Once the orbiter reached Florida, Melroy performed a 195-degree right <b>overhead</b> <b>turn</b> along the heading alignment cone (HAC) in order to line up for a landing on Runway 33. The first landing opportunity began with a deorbit burn at 16:59 UTC and finished with a landing at 13:01 EST. The deorbit burns were done to slow the orbiter's speed and to drop it out of freefall orbit and on target for the designated runway.|$|R

Since TSVs occupy the device layer together with active devices, the die area increases if TSVs are utilized. This area <b>overhead,</b> which in <b>turn</b> affects the wirelength, worsens due to the large size of TSVs themselves, which is shown to be as large as logic gates themselves. Moreover, the capacitive coupling among TSVs and wires cause non-negligible amount of parasitic capacitance, which worsens power consumption.

It is also possible to allocate different fragments from non-contiguous bands if the radio interface supports it [31].

When dealing with parallel processing systems, communication delays are perhaps the greatest source of lost time. Therefore, an implementation of our tree decomposition-based algorithm is presented, one that operates with a modest amount of message passing within a network of processors.

40|$|Searching on remote {{encrypted}} data (commonly known as searchable encryption) {{is becoming an}} important technique in secure data outsourcing, since it allows users to outsource {{encrypted data}} to the third party and maintains the keyword searching on the data at the same time. It has been widely accepted in the literature that searchable encryption techniques should leak as little information {{as possible to the}} third party. An early classical method called oblivious RAM hides all information at the cost of poly-logarithmic computation and communication <b>overheads,</b> which <b>turns</b> out to be impractical in the real world applications (e. g., cloud computing). A number of efficient searchable encryption schemes have been proposed under weaker security guarantees afterwards, however, such schemes leak statistical information about the user’s search pattern. In this paper, we show that the search pattern leakage can result in non-trivial risks. As pioneer work, we present two concrete attack models exploiting user’s search pattern and some auxiliary background knowledge aiming to disclose the underlying keywords of user’s queries. To resist these attacks, we develop two new searchable encryption constructions that hide the search pattern. Our constructions are designed to be independent from the underlying searchable encryption scheme. Our experiments, which are based on the real world dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed attack models and new constructions...|$|R
