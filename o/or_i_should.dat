500|$|Epstein {{spent a year}} {{studying}} acting at RADA, but {{dropped out}} shortly after his arrest for [...] "persistent importuning" [...] outside a men's public toilet in Swiss Cottage, London; cottaging, as it was called, {{was one of the}} few public places gay and bisexual men could meet at the time, especially if they were closeted. When Epstein first saw the Beatles perform he noticed their stage attire first, saying, [...] "They were rather scruffily dressed, in the nicest possible way, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say in the most attractive way— black leather jackets, jeans, long hair of course." [...] McCartney said that when Epstein started to manage the Beatles they knew that he was homosexual but did not care, because he encouraged them professionally and offered them access to previously off-limits social circles.|$|E
500|$|Petrucci and keyboardist Jordan Rudess {{wrote the}} album's music {{independently}} {{from the rest}} of Dream Theater by getting together everyday, going over ideas in the morning, and then working through the music during the day and night. Upon finishing their initial drafts, they presented them {{to the rest of the}} band, who worked on writing parts for their own instruments. In an interview with Artisan News, drummer Mike Mangini reflected, [...] "The biggest challenge for me was interpreting the initial music that was given to me, because there were no drums. So , 'All right, I need to listen to this, really, as a whole piece to understand where I should kind of let loose <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> lay back a lot.' All that. Just to see it as a whole, 'cause I don't wanna play blindly or try to fit too much where it doesn't belong." ...|$|E
