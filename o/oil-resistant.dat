They are designed using materials and seam construction that are impact, abrasion, cut, tear and burst resistant. Tough, strong, moderately flexible boots with stiff soles provide the rider protection from a number of risks. Boots with <b>oil-resistant,</b> rubber-based composite soles give a grip on the pavement and help keep the rider's feet on the pegs. Boots may also have energy absorbers and load spreaders on the shin, inside and outside of each ankle. A stiff sole working laterally helps prevent or decrease crash injuries caused by crushing and shear strain. For boots, the European Standard is EN 13634:2002.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Concentrations of perfluorooctane {{sulfonate}} (PFOS), a metabolite of several sulfonated perfluoroorganic compounds, were measured in oysters collected from 77 {{locations in the}} Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay of the United States. PFOS was detected in oysters collected from 51 of the 77 locations at con-centrations ranging from 42 to 1, 225 ng/g on a dry weight basis. This study provides baseline data for future monitoring programs to examine long-term trends in concentrations of PFOS. Since the 1970 s, {{there has been a}} steady increase in the use of fluorinated organic compounds for a variety of industrial ap-plications (Kissa 2001). Fluorinated surfactants are an impor-tant class of organic chemicals that have been used in soil- and stain-resistant coatings for fabrics, carpets, and leather and in grease- and <b>oil-resistant</b> coatings for paper products and food containers (Key et al. 1997; US EPA 2000; Kissa 2001) ...|$|E
30|$|When {{coming into}} contact with foods, paper and {{cardboard}} packaging are protected from softening by treatment with, among other things, water- and <b>oil-resistant</b> perfluoro chemicals. Fluorotelomer alcohols [FTOH] may be present as contaminants in the coatings. About 1 % of the FTOH can be converted to PFOA in the body [31, 32]. Furthermore, PFOA is used in the production of polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] nonstick surface coatings for cooking utensils or paper coatings and may therefore be present in residual amounts [33]. A migration of < 6 μg/kg (< 1 μg/dm 2) FTOH into food has been calculated as the sum of 6 : 2 FTOH, 8 : 2 FTOH, and 10 : 2 FTOH in an acetone extract of treated paper under the assumption of complete migration [15, 33]. Powley et al. [34], using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were unable to detect a migration of PFOA from PFTE-coated cooking utensils (LOD 0.1 ng/cm 2).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report on}} the first in-situ sum {{frequency}} generation (SFG) spectroscopy characterization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) interfacial interactions with air, sapphire, water, and heptane. Using the shift in the resonance frequency of CN at various interfaces, we demonstrated that PAN interacts with the surface hydroxyl of sapphire substrate through the lone pair orbital of nitrogen in the “end-on ” configuration (σ-H bond). We also demonstrated that the CN-CN interaction {{is the main reason}} for the superior chemical resistance property of PAN. At room temperature the interaction between the polymer chains is much stronger than the interaction between the polymer and solvent molecules including water and heptane. At high temperatures, however, the interaction between the nitrile groups of the polymer weakens, making interaction possible between the nitrile groups and the surface hydroxyls of the substrate and water. These results provide an important insight as to why acrylonitrile when copolymerized with butadiene to form nitrile rubber results in one of the best known synthetic <b>oil-resistant</b> rubber. 1...|$|E
40|$|Perfluoroalkylated {{substances}} (PFAS) is {{the collective}} {{name for a}} vast group of fluorinated compounds, including oligomers and polymers, which consist of neutral and anionic surface active compounds with high thermal, chemical and biological inertness. Perfluorinated compounds are generally hydrophobic but also lipophobic and will therefore not accumulate in fatty tissues as is usually the case with other persistent halogenated compounds. An important subset is the (per) fluorinated organic surfactants, to which perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) belong. The analytical detection method of choice for PFOS and PFOA is currently liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), whereas both LC-MS/MS and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) {{can be used for}} the determination of precursors of PFOS and PFOA. There are few reports of analysis of food items using these methods. Due to the substantial lack of suitable analytical data, many assumptions have been made in order to derive exposure estimates. Therefore, figures on levels in food and exposure provided in this opinion should be taken as indicative. PFOS, PFOA and other perfluorinated organic compounds have been widely used in industrial and consumer applications including stain- and water-resistant coatings for fabrics and carpets, <b>oil-resistant</b> coatings for paper products approved for food contact, fire-fighting foams, mining and oil well surfactants, floor polishes, and insecticide formulations. A number of different perfluorinated organic compounds have been widely found in the environment...|$|E
40|$|Blending of {{polymers}} {{is rather}} {{a new technique}} to get a material with tailored properties. However, these properties depend upon various factors like polymers used and their miscibility, {{the composition of the}} material, temperature etc. Further, the techniques available for testing of miscibility are not really reliable and face a huge critic. Therefore, the main purpose of this research work was to investigate the miscibility of polymers under various conditions by using the most popular techniques and to correlate with the mechanical properties of polystyrene (PS) / poly (styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (PSAN) blend prepared by solution casting method. The product was an interesting as it would combine the superior processing characteristics of PS and the better weather UV resistant, excellent <b>oil-resistant,</b> and superior mechanical properties of PSAN. In this thesis an attempt was made to investigate thoroughly the effect of composition, temperature, and solvent on the miscibility, and hence on the morphology, thermal, and mechanical properties of the resulting blends. The miscibility of polystyrene (PS), and poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (PSAN) blend in tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethyl form amide (DMF), chloroform (CHCl 3), benzene, and acetone was investigated by viscometric, density, and refractometric methods over an extended range of concentration, composition, and temperature. The miscibility behavior of different blend systems was examined on the basis of signs of various interaction parameters proposed by Chee (? and ?B), Garcia (?[?]m), Jiang and Han (?) and Sun (?). The viscometry results were then correlated with the miscibility findings for the same blend systems by refractive index and density techniques. On the basis of solution state studies we concluded the degree of miscibility as; PS/PSAN/DMF? PS/PSAN/CHCl 3 ? PS/PS/PSAN/THF? PS/PSAN/Acetone? PS/PSAN/Benzene. Rheological measurements of PS/PSAN/THF blend system also indicated that the miscibility was dependent upon blend compositions. Various rheological parameters vs frequency plots indicated miscibility for composition, 50 / 50, and immiscibility for all other blend (30 / 70 and 70 / 30) compositions. Whereas, the plots of these rheological parameters vs weight...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{traditional}} diene-based polymers cannot {{meet the}} demand for robust elastomers in many industries. Acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) is a widely used diene-based polymer as an <b>oil-resistant</b> elastomer and is produced via copolymerization of acrylonitrile (AN or ACN) and butadiene (BD). When dealing with aggressive environments, NBR’s performance decreases rapidly due to the residual carbon-carbon double bonds in the polymer backbone. By selectively hydrogenating these unsaturated bonds to yield its more stable counterpart, hydrogenated NBR (HNBR), the mechanical, thermo-oxidative and chemical resistant properties of a material are greatly improved. The ACN content of NBR and HNBR also determines a number of properties including oil and solvent resistance, compatibility with polar solvent and abrasion resistance etc. HNBR with lower ACN content can be cured without sulfur which improves heat resistance and is much more environmentally friendly. In the present research project, a rhodium hydrido complex was screened and synthesized; a corresponding catalytic system was successfully established to produce HNBR {{with a certain amount}} of ACN. It is worthwhile to point out that this thesis is the first development in establishing a system that is able to reduce nitrile content of the macromolecular polymers (NBR and HNBR), and to achieve tandem hydrogenation of both nitrile groups and olefinic groups in the macromolecular polymer (NBR). In both HNBR and NBR systems, the nitrile content can be reduced from 40 % to less than 10 % within 5 hours at 60 oC and 500 psig H 2. The nitrile groups have been converted to primary amines without any side products such as the formation of secondary amines. A possible mechanism for nitrile reduction has been proposed for the first time. The causes for gel formation during nitrile reduction have been investigated and a possible mechanism is proposed. Several additives have been tested and some of them are found to be effective to slow down or terminate gel formation, and tryphenylphosphine (TPP) was found to be the most effective additive. In the NBR system, tandem hydrogenation of nitrile and olefinic groups has been successfully achieved. The nitrile reduction process is similar to that of the HNBR system. The olefinic groups were reduced from 100 % to lower than 5 % simultaneously under the same reaction conditions. A possible mechanism for tandem hydrogenation has also been proposed for the first time. An effective catalytic system for the hydrogenation of carbon-carbon double bonds in styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) was successfully developed using the same Rh catalyst. In the absence of any additives, the C=C bonds in SBR were hydrogenated to more than 95 % in a relatively short period of time and no cross-linking was observed. Optimization of experimental conditions has been carried out for eco-friendly and energy-saving purposes. Different experimental parameters have been studied. The properties of SBR did not change after hydrogenation of the unsaturated C=C bonds. This study provides a new route for the chemical modification of SBR by using a transition metal complex. Additionally, NBR in the form of latex has been successfully hydrogenated to high conversion by using RhCl 3 without any organic solvent. NBR latex can be hydrogenated to a degree of more than 95 % within 5 hours at 160 oC using RhCl 3 in the presence of triphenylphosphine (TPP). Various experimental parameters were investigated. Wilkinson's catalyst is synthesized in situ during the hydrogenation. TPP is the co-catalyst ligand in the latex hydrogenation using RhCl 3 and also a catalyst mass transfer promoter and reducing agent. Ethanol is a very effective co-solvent for TPP and RhCl 3 (but not for the rubber). 1 yea...|$|E
