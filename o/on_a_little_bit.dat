One day [in 1767, second year of his married life, I then fifteen, slim Daughter of a Player on the French Horn, in his Majesty's pay], the Prince happened to be very serious; and was owning to me with frankness that he had some wrongs towards my sex to reproach himself with,"--alas, yes, some few:--"and he swore that he would never forsake ME; and that if Heaven disposed of my life before his, none but he should close my eyes. He was fingering with a penknife at the time; he struck the point of it into the palm of his left hand, and wrote with his blood [the unclean creature], <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of paper, the Oath which his lips had just pronounced in so solemn a tone. Vainly should I undertake to paint my emotion on this action of his! The Prince saw what I felt; and took advantage of it to beg that I would follow his example. I hastened to satisfy him; and traced, as he had done, with my blood, the promise to remain his friend to the tomb, and never to forsake him. This Promise must have been found among his Papers after his death [still in the Archives? we will hope not!]--Both of us stood faithful to this Oath. The tie of love, it is true, we broke: but that was by mutual consent, and the better to fix ourselves in the bonds of an inviolable friendship. Other mistresses reigned over his senses; but I"--ACH GOTT, no more of that.

5000|$|Don't Forget was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote a positive review of album, calling it [...] "pure pop for tween people".

This kind of trashy fun was missing <b>on</b> <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> Longer, so it's nice to find that it surfaces proudly on Don't Forget." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that the album sounds [...] "like a female-fronted Jonas Brothers". Levine was positive regarding Lovato's vocals on the album, saying that [...] "she's certainly a stronger singer than the Jonases. In fact, her full-bodied vocal performances are consistently impressive." [...] He noted that the album's [...] "relatively risqué moments ... come on the tracks that the Jonases have nothing to do with." [...] Levine rated the album three out of five stars and wrote [...] "None of its eleven songs is terrific, but none is terrible either, and Lovato makes a good first impression, coming off like a more innocent, less try-hard Katy Perry." ...|$|E

5000|$|Pete Tamlyn {{reviewed}} Cat's Paw for Imagine magazine. He {{noted that}} he was able to use characters other than Alpha Flight: [...] "with very little modification of the plot I managed to run the scenario for the Fantastic Four instead. I missed out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of the significance of the final encounter because the enemy in question was very closely related to Alpha Flight's characters, but other than that, no problem." [...] Tamlyn continued by saying that [...] "the production is up to the usual high standard with the useful addition of little cut-out character information cards for the players. The plot is somewhat variable. There is a reasonable amount of political interest to relieve the monotony of the slugfests, and also some nice atmospheric touches, although these are somewhat spoilt by the 'read this to players' boxes which contain the sort of purple prose that will have the players cringing rather than entranced. However, there are a places where plot continuity seems to rely rather too heavily on players doing what the author expected. The ending is rather tough and needs very careful handling by the GM. All in all, slightly above average for MSH, but not their best." ...|$|E
5000|$|... nicely began {{recording}} the follow-up, [...] "Hilly Fields (1892)", in December 1980, but the recording process {{was slow and}} laborious, and nicely had to sell his personal possessions {{to pay for the}} studio time. Recording of the song took six months to complete, followed by another month of production work before nicely was happy with the results. Hearing the early demo of the song, Hansa turned down the opportunity to release it, but an A&R man at EMI was more enthusiastic and signed nicely to the label. [...] "Hilly Fields" [...] was recorded at Heath Levy's own small studio and at Alvic Studios in west London, and again featured Jeff Leach on keyboards, along with Ian Pearce on drums, Rickman Godlee on cello, and [...] "Kate" [...] on additional vocals—for many years the rumour was that [...] "Kate" [...] was actually Kate Bush, but in 2010 nicely explained that [...] "I was always tied to Kate Bush with this rumor that she was on 'Hilly Fields'... Kate Jackson did vocals on 'D.C.T. Dreams'—I didn't know that was her surname, I wasn't sure. So on 'Hilly Fields' I used the same bit of tape of her singing and I just put 'Kate' because I didn't know her name. She's in the credits. And the rumor just got out of hand and I've always denied it but it still carries <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> because Bush did live around the corner and she was on EMI." [...] The track features an obvious 1960s psychedelic influence, cello playing, the 1980s synth-pop sound, and what {{is believed to be the}} first ever example of scratching on a non-hip hop recording, although the [...] "scratching" [...] was actually created by moving two tape spools back and forth, rather than on a turntable. The song was named after Hilly Fields park in Brockley, south-east London, close to where nicely lived. [...] "Hilly Fields" [...] was released in January 1982, and is regarded by many as nicely's masterpiece. On its release it was made Single of the Week in the NME and described as [...] "the best psychedelic record made since the '60s". In spite of, or due to, its obscurity it is considered in some circles to be [...] "legendary". The B-side was originally going to be a song called [...] "6B Obergine", but three days before the single was due to be cut it was replaced by the typically 1960s-psych-inspired [...] "49 Cigars", which was recorded and mixed in just two days. Despite favourable reviews in the music press, the single was not well promoted by EMI (nicely believed that this was due in part to bad feeling between the label and his manager at the time), and as a result the song had almost no distribution or airplay, and failed to make an impression on the charts.|$|E

40|$|At {{the very}} heart of every {{political}} democracy is the right of citizens to participate in its democratic processes. The right to vote is the bedrock of a democratic polity and the essence of representative governance. No right is more precious than the right to have a voice in the election of those who make laws that govern us. All other rights, even the most basic, are illusory without a meaningful right to vote. While democracy is not synonymous with the right to vote, it is undeniable that there is little left of it when the right to vote itself is taken away.

This note is an analysis of the status of the right to vote under the Indian Constitution.

Strange as it may seem to readers from other constitutional jurisdictions, this was the first occasion that such a judicial opinion has been expressed.
