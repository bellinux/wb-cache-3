The model {{was moved to the}} Smithsonian National Museum <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> (now the Arts and Industries Building) in Washington, D.C. along with other prehistory displays, and to the current National Museum <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> building in 1911.

5|$|Fossils now {{attributed}} to Dimetrodon were first studied by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in the 1870s. Cope had obtained the fossils {{along with those}} of many other Permian tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) from several collectors who had been exploring a group of rocks in Texas called the Red Beds. Among these collectors were Swiss naturalist Jacob Boll, Texas geologist W. F. Cummins, and amateur paleontologist Charles Hazelius Sternberg. Most of Cope's specimens went to the American Museum <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> or to the University of Chicago's Walker Museum (most of the Walker fossil collection is now housed in the Field Museum <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History).</b>|$|E

The expedition, led primarily by Dean Conant Worcester and Frank Swift Bourns, collected thousands of specimens of birds and animals; some, such as the Philippine slow loris (Nycticebus menagensis) and the Sulu bleeding-heart (Gallicolumba menagei), were named in honor of Menage.

5|$|In 2001, a 50% {{complete}} {{skeleton of}} a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, by a crew from the Burpee Museum <b>of</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> of Rockford, Illinois.

It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has been examined by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of the uniqueness of her age.
