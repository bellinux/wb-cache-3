2500|$|The {{courtship}} {{starts with}} the male grasping the female's pedipalps with his own; the pair then perform a [...] "dance" [...] called the [...] "promenade à deux". In this [...] "dance", the male leads the female around searching for a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. The courtship ritual can involve several other behaviours, such as juddering and a cheliceral kiss, in which the male's chelicerae – pincers – grasp the female's in a smaller more intimate version of the male's grasping the female's pedipalps {{and in some cases}} injecting a small amount of his venom into her pedipalp or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cephalothorax, probably as a means of pacifying the female.|$|E

60|$|One {{night when}} Margaret {{had gone up}} to her room, I put on a light overcoat, {{went out into the}} night and prowled for a long time through the narrow streets, smoking and thinking.

60|$|She {{took refuge}} in beating her pillow and inventing {{insulting}} epithets for herself.

60|$|I {{went back}} to the sitting-room. She hadn't moved an inch. She was still bolt upright <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chair, {{gripping}} her umbrella like a hammer-thrower. She gave me another of those looks as I came in. There was no doubt about it; for some reason she had taken a dislike to me. I suppose because I wasn't George M. Cohan. It was a bit hard on a chap.|$|E
60|$|May did not answer. With {{her face}} hid {{in her hands}} she sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bed, weeping {{at the thought of}} her lover's fallen condition. Poor May! People said that telegraphic work was too hard for her, because her cheeks were losing the fresh bloom that she had brought from the west of Ireland, and the fingers with which she {{manipulated}} the keys so deftly were growing very thin. But sorrow {{had more to do with}} the change than the telegraph had.|$|E
60|$|Again, {{the arrival}} of the strangers made it obvious to Rachel, as the hour of dinner approached, that she must change her dress; and the ringing of the great bell found her sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> berth in such a {{position}} that the little glass above the washstand reflected her head and shoulders. In the glass she wore an expression of tense melancholy, for she had come to the depressing conclusion, since {{the arrival of}} the Dalloways, that her face was not the face she wanted, and in all probability never would be.|$|E

60|$|Instantly all the indignations {{which had}} been {{dominating}} him and the spiritual dramas through which he had struggled became pallid and absurd before the ancient and overwhelming realities, the standard and traditional realities, of sickness and menacing death, the long night, and the thousand steadfast implications of married life. He crept back to her.

60|$|Janet hurried home {{along the}} shore, where a silvery wave broke {{in a little}} lovely silvery curve on the sand.

6000|$|This remark made Katharine {{realize the}} depths of their {{intimacy}} {{better than any other}} words could have done; she was jealous for one moment; but the next she was humiliated. She had known William for years, and she had never once guessed that he loved children. She looked at the queer glow of exaltation in Cassandra's eyes, through which she was beholding the true spirit of a human being, and wished that she would go on talking about William for ever. Cassandra was not unwilling to gratify her. She talked on. The morning slipped away. Katharine scarcely changed her position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's writing-table, and Cassandra never opened the [...] "History of England." ...|$|E
