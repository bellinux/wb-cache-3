5|$|Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came {{to suspect}} that Fantasy Records had failed to pay them all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> they were owed {{from the sale of}} their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the company had been withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.|$|E
5|$|In June 1912, {{during one}} of his Friday prayer sermons, he called for volunteers to engage in a jihad against the Italians. Accepting only volunteers with prior Ottoman {{military}} training, al-Qassam enlisted dozens of volunteers and set up a fund for the expedition to Libya as well as a small pension for the families of volunteers while they were abroad. Although accounts vary, al-Qassam was accompanied by 60 to 250 volunteers known as mujahideen (those who engage in jihad) when he arrived in Alexandretta {{in the latter part of}} that year. Intending to gain sea transportation from the Ottomans, al-Qassam's request was rejected by the authorities who ordered him and his men back to Jableh. A new Ottoman government in Istanbul had gained power and shifted the state's focus to the Balkan front in October, abandoning the Libyan resistance. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was raised was then used to establish a madrasa in Jableh while the remainder was saved for future efforts.|$|E

25|$|The BSA {{requires}} {{financial institutions}} {{to engage in}} customer due diligence, or KYC, which is sometimes known in the parlance as know your customer.

Other classes of customers, such as those with private banking accounts and those of foreign government officials, are subjected to enhanced due diligence because the law deems that those types of accounts are a higher risk for money laundering. All accounts are subject to ongoing monitoring, in which internal bank software scrutinizes transactions and flags for manual inspection those that fall outside certain parameters. If a manual inspection reveals that the transaction is suspicious, the institution should file a Suspicious Activity Report.|$|E

25|$|In April 1992, Newsweek printed {{an excerpt}} from a soon-to-be {{published}} book about pork-barrel politics called Adventures in Porkland. It said of Representative McDade's leadership in securing funds for Steamtown: McDade has achieved the dream of most pork-barrel congressmen, a living memorial, indeed two: the University of Scranton's new Joseph M. McDade Center for Technology and Applied Research, and the county's McDade Park, with its Anthracite Coal Museum. But the congressman's crowning achievement is a historic theme park called Steamtown. Aside from the government spending and the tactics used to ensure the spending, the article repeated the charge that the collection was second-rate. It {{went on to say}} that at the site there was little evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> had been spent; several of the pieces were from the 1940s and 1950s, as opposed to the 19th century, which was the time period that was supposedly being preserved; that some of the better pieces of equipment were actually foreign, Canadian, to be precise; other museums, already in existence, were already fulfilling the historical mission of Steamtown; and that other NPS projects like Yosemite and Yellowstone were in desperate need of funding. Nevertheless, in 1992, the House of Representatives voted against dropping the project from the NPS and, instead voted to add an additional $14 million to its funding.|$|E

500|$|From {{his house}} on North Market Street in Canton, McKinley ran his campaign, with {{telephone}} and telegraph at his disposal.

Payne was nominally in charge of the Chicago office, but Dawes, a member of the McKinley inner circle, had more influence. Pamphlets were sent from Chicago in carload lots across the country. [...] The campaign spent almost $500,000 on printing alone, which Stanley Jones, in his account of the 1896 campaign, estimated paid for hundreds of millions of pamphlets. The campaign paid for hundreds of speakers to stump on McKinley's behalf. Efforts were made to keep expenses down; Dawes insisted on competitive bidding, and most of his top-level hires were business associates, not political operatives. Others prominent in the Chicago office included Charles Dick, the secretary of the organization and later a senator.|$|E

They then contact Cleveland and Quagmire to look after Stewie. After not receiving any calls from either of them, Lois insists that the family return home to Stewie.

Eventually, Brian is able to get the family a ride in a pickup truck bound for Quahog.|$|E
500|$|Before Kościuszko {{left for}} France, he {{collected}} his back pay, wrote a will, and entrusted it to Jefferson as executor. Kościuszko and Jefferson had become firm friends by 1797 and thereafter corresponded {{for twenty years}} {{in a spirit of}} mutual admiration. Jefferson wrote that [...] "He is as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known." [...] In the will, Kościuszko left his American estate to be sold to buy the freedom of black slaves, including Jefferson's own, and to educate them for independent life and work. Several years after Kościuszko's death, Jefferson, aged 77, pleaded inability to act as executor due to age and the numerous legal complexities of the bequest, which was tied up in the courts until 1856. Jefferson recommended his friend John Hartwell Cocke, who also opposed slavery, as executor, but Cocke likewise declined to execute the bequest. [...] The case of Kościuszko's American estate went three times to the U.S. Supreme Court. He had made four wills, three of which postdated the American one. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> Kościuszko had earmarked for the manumission and education of African Americans in the United States was ever used for that purpose. Though the American will was never carried out, its legacy went to found an educational institute for African Americans in the United States—at Newark, New Jersey, in 1826, bearing Kościuszko's name.|$|E

500|$|The {{requirements}} {{for a new}} class of dreadnoughts were in a state of flux during 1907, but Vickers Ltd submitted a design that met the latest specifications and was very nearly accepted by the Navy for a [...] ship with twelve [...] guns in triple, superimposed turrets. However rumors of a contract with Vickers raised a public outcry as they had some problems with the armored cruiser [...] then building in England. The Naval Ministry defused the situation on 30 December 1907 by announcing an international design contest with the ship built in Russia regardless of the nationality of the winning firm. By the deadline of 12 March 1908 a total of 51 designs had been submitted by 13 different shipyards. The winner of the competition was a design from the German firm of Blohm & Voss, but the French protested that {{they did not want to}} see any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> they had loaned Russia to build up its defenses in German pockets. The Russians bought the design for 250,000 rubles and shelved it to placate both sides. A design by the Baltic Works had been the runner-up and was revised for the Navy's updated requirements with a complete design to be presented by 22 March 1909. This was extended by a month to allow the Baltic Works to finalize its contract with the British firm of John Brown & Company for design assistance with the hull form and machinery.|$|E

He also narrates the following story: Shortly after Harpalus ran away from Athens, he was put to death by the servants who were attending him, though some assert that he was assassinated. The steward of his money fled to Rhodes, and was arrested by a Macedonian officer, Philoxenus. Philoxenus proceeded to examine the slave, [...] "until he learned everything about such as had allowed themselves to accept a bribe from Harpalus." [...] He then sent a dispatch to Athens, in which he gave {{a list of the}} persons who had taken a bribe from Harpalus. [...] "Demosthenes, however, he never mentioned at all, although Alexander held him in bitter hatred, and he himself had a private quarrel with him." [...] On the other hand, Plutarch believes that Harpalus sent Demosthenes a cup with twenty talents and that [...] "Demosthenes could not resist the temptation, but admitting the present, ... he surrendered himself up to the interest of Harpalus." [...] Tsatsos defends Demosthenes's innocence, but Irkos Apostolidis underlines the problematic character of the primary sources on this issue—Hypereides and Dinarchus were at the time Demosthenes's political opponents and accusers—and states that, despite the rich bibliography on Harpalus's case, modern scholarship has not yet managed to reach a safe conclusion on whether Demosthenes was bribed or not.|$|E
