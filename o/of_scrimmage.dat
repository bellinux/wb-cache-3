5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} {{on the end}} of the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E
5|$|A strong game by Doug Williams {{carried the}} Buccaneers despite an anemic rushing attack. Both teams later complained about officiating errors and the {{malfunctioning}} game clock. The Metropolitan Stadium 30-second clock failed {{for the second}} week in a row, as did both regulation clocks. The Buccaneers survived a last-minute drive by the Vikings in which quarterback Tommy Kramer was penalized for throwing a pass from beyond the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> which helped to keep the Vikings out of field goal range. Curtis Jordan sealed the victory by deflecting Kramer's last-second Hail Mary pass. Kramer later admitted to being aware of having crossed the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> but had hoped that the officials would miss it as they had missed so many other penalties in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Hoosiers' {{defense had}} some success {{stopping}} Tech behind the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> accumulating seven tackles for loss {{during the course of}} the game. Indiana cornerback Mose Richardson had nine tackles and one interception, leading the Hoosiers in tackles, and teammate Chris Dyer came in second for IU with seven.|$|E
50|$|ISAF was an {{informal}} association jointly {{run by the}} leaders of the three teams that formed the league.

50|$|Hockey {{began as}} a club sport with a {{schedule}} <b>of</b> <b>scrimmages</b> in 1966-67. In its first full schedule of games in 1968-69, the team finished with an 18-8-0 record and joined the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League (MIHL). The team posted a 27-0 regular season record during the 1973-74 season and captured the MIHL championship.|$|R
5000|$|Will allow a {{team that}} gives up a field goal the option <b>of</b> <b>scrimmaging</b> from its 35-yard line instead of {{receiving}} a kick-off. In 2009, this option was eliminated, but has been overturned as it failed to make any significant difference in entertainment value as it was intended, and was unpopular with the coaches.|$|R
5|$|The umpire is {{positioned}} in the defensive backfield, {{except in the}} NFL, where he {{is positioned}} lateral to the referee {{on the opposite side}} of the formation. He watches play along the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays. He monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.|$|E
5|$|The head {{linesman}} {{is positioned}} {{on one end}} of the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> He watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head linesman also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on his side of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} receivers are {{the wide}} receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE). Wide receivers line up {{on or near}} the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.|$|E

5|$|The {{three types}} <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points. The place kick is the {{standard}} method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{categories}} of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> and free kicks. The free kicks are the kickoff, which starts {{the first and third}} quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal, and the safety kick, which follows a safety.|$|E
5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E
50|$|Play was {{regularly}} {{slowed down}} by scrimmages which resulted from players dropping the ball when tackled, often {{in an attempt}} to win a holding-the-man free kick. Legalising the throw-pass gave players a means of disposing of the ball which was faster and required less skill to execute effectively, which largely prevented the formation <b>of</b> <b>scrimmages</b> and made the game much faster and more open.|$|R

40|$|Background: In 1998, the National Collegiate Athletic Association legislated a {{decrease}} in the number <b>of</b> <b>scrimmages</b> and full-contact practices allowed during the spring season. Hypothesis: A significantly increased risk of injury faced by the same player during the spring versus fall practice sessions does exist, but the National Collegiate Athletic Association regulations will not have the intended effect of reducing injury rates to equal or below those of the fall practice sessions. Study Design: Retrospectively analyzed, descriptive study of prospectively collected injury surveillance data followed by a prospective, controlled, repeated-measures study after the rule change...|$|R
5|$|Georgia {{began its}} first {{possession}} with a 25-yard kickoff return, {{but failed to}} earn a first down {{in the face of}} a tough Hokie defensive effort. Georgia punter Gordon Ely-Kelso kicked a 56-yard punt following the Virginia Tech defensive stop. A breakdown in special teams coverage by Georgia allowed Virginia Tech kick returner Eddie Royal to break free, returning the kick 56yards back to the original line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> As a result of the excellent field position provided by the return, Virginia Tech was able to drive the remaining 30yards to the end zone. Branden Ore earned his second touchdown of the game, making the score 14–3 with 6:13 remaining on the clock.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, Chris Turner hit Darrius Heyward-Bey {{for a short}} bubble screen pass behind the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> and Heyward-Bey ran it 63yards for the score. During the next series, the Terrapins were held three-and-out, but the punt was fumbled and {{recovered}} by Maryland on the Hokies 11-yard line. However, the Terrapins were again forced {{to settle for a}} field goal, which made it a one-possession lead for VT at 20–13with 2:29left in the third quarter. In the final quarter, the Hokies managed another field goal and held onto the lead for a final result of 23–13.|$|E
5|$|On the Hokies' second {{offensive}} possession, quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{took the}} field in place of Sean Glennon. Two successful passes and two short runs resulted in two first downs and Virginia Tech advanced the ball across the 50-yard line and into Boston College territory. As Taylor attempted to scramble for yet another short run, however, he was tackled behind the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> and fumbled the ball. The loose ball was scooped up by Boston College defender Jamie Silva, who returned it 51yards for a touchdown. The touchdown and subsequent extra point were the first points {{of the game and}} gave Boston College a 70 lead with 4minutes remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons, Jones {{developed}} into a star flanker, a position he helped invent. He was both a running threat and a receiver – his tall stature was well-suited to receiving – and helped complement a passing attack that featured the Browns' two main ends, Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Jones often went in motion behind the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> before the snap {{at a time when}} few players did so, causing confusion and mismatches on defense. He had 312 rushing yards and 241 receiving yards in 1949, when the Browns won another AAFC championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{first play}} of the {{possession}} resulted in a five-yard penalty against Tech. The second play resulted in the initial first down of the game as Brown completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Mike Adams. After the first down, Williams picked up two yards on a running play, but Texas lost that short gain when Brown fumbled the ball during the next play. Brown lost seven yards, but recovered the ball. On third down, Brown attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped short of the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b> Texas' punt was fair caught at the 29-yard line, and Virginia Tech began its second possession.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{returned}} to the Alabama 21-yard line. The first play of the half was a pass from Zow to Alexander, who gained eight yards. On second down, Alexander picked up the first down with a run to the 34-yard line. Zow completed a pass to Milons at the 38-yard line, then had a pass knocked down at the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> by the Virginia Tech defense. Zow's third-down pass was knocked down, and the Tide punted. The kick {{was returned}} to the Tech 24-yard line, and the Hokies began their first drive of the second half.|$|E

50|$|In both American and Canadian football, {{a safety}} (or safety touch) awards 2 {{points to the}} {{defending}} team if the offensive team is brought down in their end zone. In American football, the team giving up the safety must take a free kick from their own 20-yard line. In Canadian football, the team being awarded the 2 points has the option <b>of</b> <b>scrimmaging</b> from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their own 35-yard line, or having the opposing team kick off the ball from their own 35-yard line. In 2009, the CFL changed the latter option to be a kick-off from their own 25-yard line.|$|R
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to {{him to be a}} disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage</b> and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the thirty}} years from 1880 onwards, rule changes were {{incrementally}} {{introduced into the}} game, including {{the adoption of the}} line <b>of</b> <b>scrimmage,</b> scoring that began to resemble the modern version, and the down and yardage structure. Popular personalities of the era included player-coach Joe Wright Sr., one of the best all around Canadian athletes {{at the turn of the}} century. One major outstanding issue within the CRU at the time was the role of professional versus amateur players; this dispute caused the Argonauts to withdraw from the league in 1903 and eventually led to the establishment of a new league, The Big Four or Interprovincial Rugby Football League. Alongside the professionalism dispute, there was serious disagreement over the adoption of the Burnside rules, with Ontario, Quebec, and the intercollegiate league often not in alignment. Amongst other critical innovations, the Burnside rules reduced the number of men per side to 12 and introduced the ten yards in three downs structure that is central to the modern game.|$|E
5000|$|Michigan took a 16-0 lead in {{the first}} inning with four touchdowns, a field goal (kicked by J. E. Duffy), and two rouges.
