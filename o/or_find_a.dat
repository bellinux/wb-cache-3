On February 15, President Obama approved Henry's request for federal assistance in Carter, Logan and Oklahoma counties. A disaster recovery center {{was set up by}} the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on February20. Homeowners were allowed to borrow $200,000 to repair damages to their home <b>or</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> temporary or permanent shelter. They were also allowed to borrow up to $40,000 to replace lost property. Businesses were allowed to borrow up to $2million for damage repair, property loss, and economic loss. By February23, about $781,000 had been given in federal grants. On February 25, FEMA approved Governor Henry's request for public assistance in Carter, Coal and Love counties. The estimated cost to clear the 7,000 tons of debris in Lone Grove was placed at $500,000, of which $90,000 has been paid for by FEMA. The Department of Homeland Security offered to assist with the reconstruction of homes and businesses and to support those who were left homeless. President Barack Obama passed along his condolences and best wishes to the victims of the tornado.|$|E

500|$|Passing {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the tragic story of a beautiful light-skinned mulatto passing for white in high society." [...] The tragic mulatto (also [...] "mulatta" [...] when referring to a woman) is a stock character in early African-American literature. Such accounts often featured the light-skinned offspring of a white slaveholder and his black slave, whose mixed heritage in a race-based society means that she is unable to identify <b>or</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> place with either blacks or whites. The resulting feeling of exclusion was portrayed as variably manifested in self-loathing, depression, alcoholism, sexual perversion, and attempts at suicide.|$|E
500|$|The crusader army, meanwhile, {{marched on}} to Antioch, which lay about halfway between Constantinople and Jerusalem. Described by Stephen of Blois as [...] "a city great beyond belief, {{very strong and}} unassailable", {{the idea of taking}} the city by assault was a {{discouraging}} one to the crusaders. Hoping rather to force a capitulation, <b>or</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> traitor inside the city—a tactic that had previously seen Antioch change to the control of the Byzantines and then the Seljuq Turks—the crusader army set Antioch to siege on 20 October 1097. During the almost eight months of the siege, they were forced to defeat two large relief armies under the leadership of Duqaq and Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan. Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and as a result it was able to stay partially supplied. On 4 March 1098, relief arrived {{in the form of a}} Crusader fleet, the [...] "Saxon Crusade", bringing much needed supplies from the west.|$|E

500|$|The {{gray wolf}} is {{generally}} monogamous, with mated pairs usually remaining together for life. Upon {{the death of}} one mated wolf, pairs are quickly re-established. Since males often predominate in any given wolf population, unpaired females are a rarity. If a dispersing male gray wolf is unable to establish a territory <b>or</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> mate, he mates with the daughters of already established breeding pairs from other packs. Such gray wolves are termed [...] "Casanova wolves" [...] and, unlike males from established packs, they do not form pair bonds with the females they mate with. Some gray wolf packs may have multiple breeding females this way, {{as is the case in}} Yellowstone National Park. Gray wolves also practice alloparental care, in which a wolf pair may adopt the pup or pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them. In addition to heterosexual behavior, homosexual behavior has been observed in gray wolves. Male gray wolves often mount each other when the highest ranking female in the pack comes into heat.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{how most}} actors are trained, St. John {{believed}} that it was not up to the performer to interpret the character, but that a character existed regardless of how an actor played him, which he realized was [...] "an unusual way to approach acting". [...] He also thought that playing Todd was fun and [...] "never boring to watch" [...] because Todd, although popular with the audience, is an unlikable character. St. John told Branco that when people asked him if Todd was capable of harming his loved ones, like his long-time love Blair or daughter Starr, St. John would say that Todd was capable of anything, even being sexually attracted to Starr or one of her friends, because to state otherwise meant that he was [...] "limiting the character". He added, [...] "Todd is a marvelous character to play because he could commit genocide, <b>or</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> cure for AIDS. He's full of possibilities—good and bad...

Sam contacts the now-independently wealthy Sector 7 Agent Seymour Simmons, and together they realize that the Decepticons and their leader, Megatron, are murdering people connected to the American and Russian space missions to the [...] "Ark". They locate two surviving Russian cosmonauts, who reveal satellite photos of hundreds of Pillars being stockpiled on the Moon. Sam realizes that the Decepticons raided the [...] "Ark" [...] long before the Apollo 11 mission to the moon and intentionally left Sentinel and the five Pillars behind to lure the Autobots into a trap with Sentinel being the key to activating the Pillars and the Decepticons lacking the means to revive him. The Autobots rush to return Sentinel to their base for protection, but Sentinel betrays them and murders the Autobot Ironhide, revealing he had made a deal with Megatron to ensure Cybertron's survival.|$|E

Writer John Shiban felt it was natural creating an arms race-like story between the United States and Russia, being that the Cold War had ended a few years earlier. The inspiration for the oil-containing rocks was NASA's announcement of possible evidence of extraterrestrial life in the Allan Hills 84001 meteorite; while the gulag scenes were based on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's books The Gulag Archipelago and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich ...|$|E
2500|$|The name odd cycle {{transversal}} {{comes from}} the fact that a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles.

Direct competition will often lead to one species dominating another by some advantage, ultimately driving it to extinction. Niche partitioning is the other option for a species.

However, in many cases a stand-alone business facing envelopment has little choice but to sell out to the attacker or exit the field.|$|E

On May 25, 2013, Dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ICA to fulfill its obligations. The court imposed a July 31 deadline for ICS to close the sale, but it did not meet the deadline. Dynegy subsequently sought another buyer. Helios Power Capital, a private equity firm, agreed to purchase the plant for $3.5 million in cash on August 20.
