500|$|Arensberg {{notes that}} Maya's rape is {{connected}} to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape {{was the first time he}} touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, [...] "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue <b>out</b> <b>something</b> that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".|$|E

500|$|The title {{stems from}} a comment by Dave Mustaine's former Metallica bandmate Lars Ulrich, who {{suggested}} to Mustaine that he should take more [...] "risks" [...] with his music. According to Mustaine, he was also encouraged to experiment by Marty Friedman’s desire to indulge in his pop sensibilities. On the other hand, newcomer Jimmy DeGrasso {{wanted to do a}} [...] "heavy record", unlike the rest of the band who wanted to try <b>out</b> <b>something</b> different. As bassist David Ellefson recalls, the band's manager Bud Prager had told them that they needed [...] "to do something that will make all of their contemporaries knock themselves on the head and say, 'Why didn't we think of that'?". This decision resulted in mixed reviews for both the band and the album; a good portion did not favor the new sound and image, while others were more receptive to the band's attempts at experimenting with their sound and trying something different.|$|E

500|$|Sharp was a jockey from 2004 to 2005, riding {{mostly at}} Canterbury Downs in Minnesota, {{but also in}} West Virginia and Maryland. Sharp was an {{assistant}} trainer to Mike Stidham for four years, and then for three years an assistant to Mike Maker, where he ran Maker's operations in New York, Kentucky and New Orleans. Napravnik and Sharp sometimes competed against each other when a horse Sharp trained was running against one Napravnik was riding, but the two were a trainer-rider team for Ramsey's three-year-old colt, Vicar's In Trouble, who won the Louisiana Derby and contested the 2014 Kentucky Derby.

In 2017, Sharp won the Louisiana Derby with Girvin, a colt who was Sharp's first starter in the 2017 Kentucky Derby.

500|$|Writer Bob Kapur of the Canadian Online Explorer rated Turning Point a 7 out of 10, {{which was}} the same as the rating for the 2005 event. The TNA X Division Championship bout was rated an 8 out of 10. The Six Man Tag Team match between The Kings of Wrestling (Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Jeff Jarrett) and A.J. Styles, Jeff Hardy, and Randy Savage was rated a 3 out of 10, while the Six Sides of Steel cage match main event was rated a 9 out of 10. In his review, Kapur stated that he felt the Six Man Tag Team match was [...] "an overbooked train wreck whose only saving grace was Styles's performance, as he tried to wring <b>out</b> <b>something</b> decent out of the old-timers". The X Division Championship and main event bouts gained better reviews from Kapur.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he tried to figure <b>out</b> <b>something</b> Homer was really good at, and {{he came up with}} the idea of Homer being a good husband. While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E
