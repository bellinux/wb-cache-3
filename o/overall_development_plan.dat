40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{exploratory}} study that investigates human capital (HC) {{formation in the}} state of Qatar. It is carried out with the intention to provide an insight into such a process among Qataris and to ascertain how government's investment in education has been an effective influence on the formation ofHC in Qatar. The study provides new evidence about the actual process and indicators of indigenous HC over the last three decades and revealed that Qatari government has been investing well over that period and its educational indicators are accepted internationally. However, the research showed that even when backwardness occurs, this was mainly referring to the structures of the Qatari population and related labour force, quality of educational outcomes and expenditures boundaries. It is also appeared that the education system in Qatar has gained an increasingly high degree of independence from the economy since its establishment. However, the Qatari education system is not entirly to blame for such shortcomings.

40|$|This {{project is}} to {{demonstrate}} the capability to directly fabricate lightweight, high-resolution, grazing-incidence x-ray optics using a commercially available robotic polishing machine. Typical x-ray optics production at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) uses a replication process in which metal mirrors are electroformed on to figured and polished mandrels from which they are later removed. The attraction {{of this process is}} that multiple copies can be made from a single master. The drawback is that the replication process limits the angular resolution that can be attained. By directly fabricating each shell, errors inherent in the replication process are removed. The principal challenge now becomes how to support the mirror shell during all aspects of fabrication, including the necessary metrology to converge on the required mirror performance specifications. This program makes use of a Zeeko seven-axis computer-controlled polishing machine (see fig. 1) and supporting fabrication, metrology, and test equipment at MSFC. The <b>overall</b> <b>development</b> <b>plan</b> calls for proof-of-concept demonstration with relatively thick mirror shells (5 - 6 mm, fig. 2) which are straightforward to support and then a transition to much thinner shells (2 - 3 mm), which are an order of magnitude thinner than those used for Chandra. Both glass and metal substrates are being investigated. Currently, a thick glass shell is being figured. This has enabled experience to be gained with programming and operating the polishing machine without worrying about shell distortions or breakage. It has also allowed time for more complex support mechanisms for figuring/ polishing and metrology to be designed for the more challenging thinner shells. These are now in fabrication.

Governments have taken {{a keen interest in}} bidding for the hosting of mega-events, as part of their <b>overall</b> <b>development</b> <b>plan.</b> This research examines ways in which the residents of a suburb in Pretoria perceived the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. By identifying the different perceptions within the community, it was possible to improve the understanding of both the tangible, and the intangible, impacts of mega-events, and how they affected {{the quality of life of}} the local residents at the time of the study. The aim of the study was to investigate the levels of awareness, as well as the perceptions, and the attitudes, of residents living in a particular suburb that was situated within a 2 km radius of the stadium, using a stratified random sampling method. In response to the administration of a questionnaire, 326 successfully completed questionnaires were obtained. The findings revealed that the residents had high levels of awareness regarding the event. The most outstanding perceived benefits of the event were that it provided the community with entertainment, as well as increasing the spending on public facilities, boosting the sense of community pride, and showcasing the area in a positive light, whereas the most negative overall impacts appeared to be the minimal direct economic benefits of the event accruing to the community involved. The residents’ major concerns included, but were not limited to, inappropriate behaviour, and an increase in the crime rate, as well as in the amount of traffic congestion. Excessive noise was also a key concern. The study encourages the government, and the event organisers, to increase active community involvement, and participation, in the planning, and in the management, of the event, so as to address, and to help alleviate, concerns regarding the perceived negative impacts of the event, as well as of future events...|$|E

This is carried out in four stages: First, the peculiar features of the Kuwaiti oil sector are discussed {{with reference to the}} models that have been specified to study and analyse the sector together with the general features of oil models tailored to fit oil producing 'surplus' economies, such as Kuwait. Secondly, a detailed oil model for Kuwait is constructed reflecting the role of the economy's limited absorptive capacity in determining its development path. The proposed model is disaggregative, links the supply and demand for oil, and employs some oil prices as endogenous instruments for economic policy. In the third stage, the alternative options are exercised by applying the Oil Model using two frameworks; an income-expenditure framework and a production framework. In applying both frameworks, the 'Oil Income' is used as the bridge to link <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> to the oil model. Finally, analysis will be carried out to the model's possible uses.

40|$|This thesis investigates a {{contemporary}} issue {{in developing countries}} {{within the context of}} the Cameroon North-West Region. It seeks to understand how government policy and development organisations in Cameroon are empowering women and promoting their role in the community development (CD) process. It investigates and analyses the causes of gaps between policy implementation at the grassroots level which prevents women benefiting fully from the programmes initiated by government at the central level. The research is an empirical study which employs a qualitative approach with a case study design, informed by feminist paradigms and guided by the Interpretivists epistemological stand point. The case is the North-West Region of Cameroon, with particular focus on women’s development Non-Governmental Organisations and Women’s Groups. Semistructured interviews, questionnaires, focus groups and documentary analysis were the main methods of data generation. In seeking to understand why women’s role in the process of CD is still limited to basic activities at the household and local community levels it has become necessary to examine gender roles within the Cameroon socio-cultural milieu to observe how these are affecting the overall development process. The Government’s initiative to empower women all over Cameroon and promote their influence in the community is in recognition of the pivotal role they play in uplifting living standards and alleviating poverty particularly in the rural communities, which also falls within the government’s <b>overall</b> <b>development</b> <b>plan</b> for the nation. The research has found that recent efforts to promote this through policy and targeted programmes for women at the grassroots have been thwarted by a severe deficiency in financial and human resources, poor communication networks, high rates of illiteracy among women, corruption, politics of ethno-regional segregation and the lack of a mechanism for enforcing legislation. The thesis has thus, unpacked the rhetoric of government initiated programmes and the gaps between policy and implementation at the grassroots level. A new understanding or perception to the concept of empowerment which focuses on economic and welfare needs, different from the conventional meaning has been brought out through this research. This suggests that definitions of concepts such as empowerment must be brought within a specific sociocultural and political context. The thesis has made recommendations for what is required to be done if women are to be in the driving seat for rural development in Cameroon and the North-West Region in particular. The thesis concludes that Community Development and Women’s Empowerment are two complementary processes in Cameroon. While Community Development has a long history in the country and has been hailed as the total approach to development especially in the North-West Region, women’s empowerment on the other hand is generally considered a secular concept from the West which still has no place yet in any of Cameroon’s sub-cultural groups not least in the North-West Region. Local perceptions are that women should be empowered if only this means increasing their economic opportunities to earn and bring more money into the family and community and not mor...|$|E

In recent years, the relevant governments departments have driven integrate construction plans, and established some operational model. However, the conditions of aboriginal village are different; they need different consideration when planning the renewal plan. Planning should focus on a different level and different mode of thinking. The results of this study showed that the Government has implemented to improve the living environment and has the concrete benefits. However, aboriginal communities should base on "set the village-style planning” infrastructure, first through land re-zoned to develop an overall manner, while improving the overall living environment, and create the production environment.

40|$|Transformation is one {{the most}} talked about topics within the cricket circles in South Africa and will {{continue}} to remain so until all the imbalance are addressed. Even today, more than twelve years after unity there are still worrying aspects of resistance. There exists an opinion in some clubs, schools and even corridors of white opinion, a notion that there was no past culture of cricket in previously disadvantaged communities. The transformation process, devised to regulate for speedier redress and access to higher levels of participation, is often regarded as reverse discrimination and violates the rights and diminishes opportunities for selection of players from previously advantaged communities. As time goes by more questions will be asked about the successes and failures of the United Cricket Board of South Africa’s development programmes in their quest to close the gap between black and white cricket players. The main objective {{of this study is to}} establish if the transformation agenda as outlined in the National Transformation Charter and the policies designed by the United Cricket Board has made an impact with its efforts to reshape the game and build a new national cricket culture in a new democracy. Within this study the aim is to evaluate the impact transformation has made on cricket since unification in 1991. To understand why transformation is fundamentally important to cricket an outline is given on the current status of South African sport and a brief introduction is given as to the goals and objectives of the study. The literature review gives an overall view of sport under Apartheid in South Africa, and how sport in particular contributed to culture creation and nation building. The role of sponsors and their duel purpose in the promotion of sport and seeking future business is also touched on in the literature review. The literature review also reflects on the National Transformation Charter which includes the ten thrusts. The transformation challenges faced by the United Cricket Board is included in the literature review, but one must discuss transformation taking into consideration the controversial decision by the United Cricket Board to scrap the “quota” system so early into the new democracy. This is discussed at length as it had far reaching effects on the transformation policies of the United Cricket Board and all its affiliates. Chapter three focuses on the various methods applied during the study. Given the nature of the study a qualitative approach is preferred as the intentional focus is on personal perceptions, attitudes, conceptual understandings and objectives of the research participants. A brief outline is also given in this chapter on the sampling method used, gaining access and the use of a structured questionnaire during formal interviews. Mention is also made of the documentary research, observational studies and the challenges and constraints faced during the course of the study. Chapter four highlights the views of the government on cricket transformation and also explains the United Cricket Board’s transformation perspective. The <b>overall</b> <b>development</b> <b>plan</b> of the United Cricket Board is discussed. This is followed by the evaluation of the successes and failures of the various development programs within cricket. The study aims to highlight the role played by the United Cricket Board and all its administrative structures as well as contributions made by the private sector in their attempts to address the imbalances of the past. The study of the cricket development with specific reference made to certain programmes that were designed to make a significant contribution to transformation is discussed and evaluated. The question concerning transformation and nation building is questioned and answered. Practical examples are given on how players benefited and failed as a result of some the programmes that were designed to give them opportunities to succeed as cricketers. The perception of parents, teachers, players and administrators relating to transformation is highlighted in this project. A short statistical summary is given in this chapter to highlight the responses to certain questions pertaining to transformation. The concluding chapter gives an account of the contributions made by the cricket development programmes as well as the failures in trying to transform the game. It gives an account of the opinions expresses by current as well as former national players on the issues surrounding transformation and the inclusion of black player in the national team. This chapter also highlights the mentality and perceptions that still exist within certain sectors of the cricket establishments. It attempts to highlight possible reasons as to why transformation has been such a contentious issue and the reasons why it will take a while before the true impact of the National Transformation Charter can be measured. It also makes mention that development is an ongoing process and the United Cricket Board together with all its stakeholder should continue to promote and encourage cricket at all levels as it is the second most popular sport in South Africa.

40|$|This project studies {{economic}} {{dependency on}} defense spending in certain communities and formulates methods {{to help those}} localities diversify their economies. The project asks whether such communities should pursue a more varied economy and whether federal assistance should {{be made available to}} help with the effort. The focus is on creating an economic development process that will allow dependent areas to spur growth in other economic sectors, thereby broadening their respective economic bases. The process is applicable to locations near military bases and to those areas near large defense contractors. By their reliance on military spending, communities are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of defense spending. The programs that have been used in the past to assist communities have offered assistance after spending reductions had already occurred. This report proposes a proactive planning approach to mitigate the communities of their reliance on Pentagon spending by giving the localities help in broadening their economic base as a matter of course, before cuts occur, as part of the communities' <b>overall</b> <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> The idea behind the concept is that spending on defense is not an equitable or sustainable way to invest in the fiscal well-being of the country. Investments in communities tend to provide many more positive benefits to the local, state and national economies. By investing some defense funds to strengthen some communities, all concerned would be better off...|$|R

40|$|Despite their {{significant}} role in African economies, women are still the victims of poverty, illiteracy, discrimination, and powerlessness. Most African countries are classified as "low " on the Human Development Index and exhibit a relationship between per capita gross domestic product and the adult literacy rate. Rural women {{appear to be the}} most disadvantaged group and are the least represented in political decision making. Factors accounting for gender inequalities include cultural attitudes toward women, colonialism, low levels of functional literacy, discrimination in employment, and lack of training and education. Development projects focusing on women have met with little success in the past, largely due to problems with participation. Educational systems should be planned to integrate women in <b>overall</b> national <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> and strategies. Educational activities should foster emancipation an...|$|R
30|$|Mountain {{topography}} in the upstream of Amu Darya and Syr Darya is a {{good place}} for water storage and hydropower generation. It is the main water production region in the basin, but it lacks land resources and energy resources. Downstream regions are flat and are main water-consuming regions, but there are rich land resources and energy resources. Such water and energy distribution characteristics do not match water and energy demands by local economic development. Giving comprehensive considerations to the national and regional <b>overall</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> and economic layout, the former Soviet Union planned water conservancy facilities in the upstream of the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, but emphasized the role of irrigation agriculture and industry in downstream regions and providing energy resources, and industrial and agricultural products to upstream regions. This implementation realized the goal of a balanced development of the whole region (Abdolvand et al. 2015). The former Soviet Union government offered financial support for the construction and maintenance of upstream water conservancy facilities. Consequently, upstream Tajikistan controlled 8 % water volume of the Amu Darya and 9 % water volume of the Syr Darya, whereas Kyrgyzstan controlled 58 % water volume of the Syr Darya. Water conservancy facilities in Tajikistan are mainly for water storage for the purpose of large-scale farmland irrigation in the downstream Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan. Farmland irrigation in downstream countries highly depends on water reservoirs in the upstream Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Although the upstream Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have an energy shortage, they can import petroleum, natural gas, and coal for heating from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia.|$|R
