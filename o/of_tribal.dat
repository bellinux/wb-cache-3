This led to exploitation and deprivation of the age-old rights <b>of</b> <b>tribals.</b> Besides, the Company officials also interfered in the socio-cultural and religious practices <b>of</b> <b>tribals.</b> Such interventions and changes caused resentment among tribals and it took the form of revolt under the leader ship <b>of</b> Rindo Majhi. This <b>tribal</b> up rise is known as 1st Kondh Meli.|$|R

5|$|In the mid- to late-1940s, the Menominee tribe was {{considered}} {{by a government}} survey to identify tribes for termination, {{a process in which}} federal recognition of the tribe would be withdrawn and the tribe would no longer be dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to support them. The Menominee were thought to be a tribe that could be terminated because they were one of the richest tribes in the nation. The federal government thought that termination would allow the tribal members to be assimilated into mainstream American culture, becoming hard-working, tax-paying, productive citizens. In 1954, Congress terminated the federally recognized status of the tribe with the Menominee Indian Termination Act. According to the terms of the Termination Act, the federally recognized status was to end in 1958. The tribe and the state of Wisconsin successfully lobbied for a delay in the implementation of termination until 1961. The tribe was opposed to termination for a number of reasons; their concerns included the loss <b>of</b> <b>tribal</b> culture, the loss of land due to tax liens, the possibility of bankruptcy and loss of the tribal timber industry, and the lack <b>of</b> <b>tribal</b> members who were trained to run a county government. The state of Wisconsin was concerned that with no industry for the tribe to tax, the state would be responsible for the large financial outlay that would be required to maintain governmental operations for the former reservation.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{had made}} clear {{his belief that}} Kenya should become a one-party state, {{regarding}} this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system. In {{the first five years}} of independence, he consolidated his control of the central government, seeking to prevent the entrenchment <b>of</b> <b>tribal</b> power bases by removing the autonomy of the country's provinces. He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist more rapid economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations. In 1969, it passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which stopped grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.|$|E

5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination <b>of</b> <b>tribal</b> jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E

In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life.

These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims.

5|$|These crowns {{continue}} {{a history of}} monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before European colonization.

None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current European monarchies that spread their reach across the Atlantic Ocean, beginning in the mid 14th century.|$|E

On October 10, Judge Gignoux dismissed Bottomly's suit on the grounds <b>of</b> <b>tribal</b> sovereign immunity.

5|$|Parallel {{with the}} gord {{building}} activity of ca. 920-50, the Piasts undertook military expansion by crossing the Warta River and moving {{south and west}} within the Oder River basin.

The conquered population was often resettled to central Greater Poland, which resulted in partial depopulation of previously well-developed regions. At {{the end of this}} stage of the Piast state formation new Piast gords were built in the (north) Noteć River area and other outlying areas of the annexed lands, for example in Santok and Śrem around 970. During the following decade the job of unifying the core of the early Piast state was finished—besides Greater Poland with Kujawy it included also much of central Poland. Masovia and parts of Pomerania found themselves increasingly under the Piast influence, while the southbound expansion was for the time being stalled, because large portions of Lesser Poland and Silesia were controlled by the Czech state.|$|E
