5|$|During the 20th century, {{the field}} of {{professional}} astronomy split into <b>observational</b> and theoretical branches. <b>Observational</b> astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain <b>observational</b> results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.|$|E
5|$|The <b>observational</b> {{consequences}} of this effect can be derived using the equations from general relativity that describe a homogeneous and isotropic universe.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that juvenile lemon sharks can use <b>observational</b> learning in their investigation of novel objects in their environment.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other tests have probed the {{validity}} of various versions of the equivalence principle; strictly speaking, all measurements of gravitational time dilation are tests of the weak version of that principle, not of general relativity itself. So far, general relativity has passed all <b>observational</b> tests.|$|E
5|$|Also {{returned}} are {{links to}} the SIMBAD and/or NASA Extragalactic Database object name databases, via which a user can quickly find out basic <b>observational</b> data about the objects analyzed in a paper, and find further papers on those objects.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers use the WHT {{to conduct}} {{scientific}} research across most branches of <b>observational</b> astronomy, including solar system science, galactic astronomy, extragalactic astronomy and cosmology. Most {{of the instruments}} {{are designed to be}} useful for a range of different research.|$|E
5|$|Distinguishing {{between these}} two models would require more {{information}} about the planet's radius or composition. The planet does not appear to transit its star, which makes obtaining this information impossible with current <b>observational</b> capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes {{largely from the}} choice <b>observational</b> writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described.|$|E
5|$|Recognised {{assessment}} {{methods of}} attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation procedure (Mary Ainsworth), the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment ("PAA"), the <b>Observational</b> Record of the Caregiving Environment ("ORCE") and the Attachment Q-sort ("AQ-sort").|$|E
5|$|Several <b>observational</b> {{studies and}} randomized, {{controlled}} trials found metformin {{to be as}} effective and safe as insulin {{for the management of}} gestational diabetes. Nonetheless, several concerns were raised and evidence on the long-term safety of metformin for both mother and child is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare wrote {{seventeen}} comedies {{that incorporate}} many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as jokes, puns, parody, wit, <b>observational</b> humor, or the unexpected effect of irony. One-liner jokes and satire {{are also used}} to comedic effect in literature. In farce, the comedy is a primary purpose.|$|E
5|$|Theorists in {{astronomy}} endeavor to create theoretical models {{and from the}} results predict <b>observational</b> consequences of those models. The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena.|$|E
5|$|As the {{electric}} telegraph network expanded, {{allowing for the}} more rapid dissemination of warnings, a national <b>observational</b> network was developed, which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses. Instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from Kew Observatory – these cameras had been invented by Francis Ronalds in 1845 and his barograph had earlier been used by FitzRoy.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy and {{astrophysics}} {{have developed}} significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy {{is the study}} of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Astrobiology {{is the study of}} the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of <b>observational</b> astrophysical data.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in {{recorded}} history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient Indigenous Peoples of The Americas performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, <b>observational</b> astronomy and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} {{afternoon}} hours, forecasters at both the SPC and the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Norman, Oklahoma, realized that a major event was likely to take place based solely on <b>observational</b> data from radar and weather satellite imagery and balloon soundings, as the computer models remained uncooperative in helping meteorologists determine where the greatest threat of severe storms would occur.|$|E
5|$|Currie {{regarded}} {{control of}} either Hill 70 or Sallaumines Hill as tactically {{more important than}} control {{of the city of}} Lens. Merely to occupy the city while the Germans held the high ground, would place the attackers in an unfavourably lower and more exposed position than the ones they occupied. At a conference of corps commanders, Currie persuaded the First Army commander General Henry Horne to make Hill 70, not Lens, the main objective of the limited offensive. Controlling Hill 70 would provide excellent observation over the German lines, in preparation for more offensives. Currie believed the Germans would attempt to counter-attack if Hill 70 were captured, largely because of its <b>observational</b> importance. Nevertheless, Currie believed that the advantageous <b>observational</b> position of Hill 70 would permit well directed artillery to effectively deal with any counter-attacks. The plan was therefore to occupy the high ground quickly, establish defensive positions and utilize combined small arms and artillery fire to repel expected counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has emerged}} as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous <b>observational</b> and experimental tests. However, there are strong indications the theory is incomplete. The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open. <b>Observational</b> data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics. Even taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists seek {{to understand the nature of}} singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes). In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on September 14, 2015. A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is {{an emerging}} field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect <b>observational</b> data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, {{such as the}} Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole. A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.|$|E
5|$|However, one {{can combine}} the nominal solar mass {{parameter}} {{with the most}} recent (2014) CODATA estimate of the Newtonian gravitational constant G to derive the solar mass to be approximately 1.9885 × 1030 kg. Although the exact values for the luminosity, radius, mass parameter, and mass may vary slightly in the future due to <b>observational</b> uncertainties, the 2015 IAU nominal constants will remain the same SI values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Sheindlin {{created a}} game show called IWitness that debuted on July 10th and ran for 6 weeks. The game show puts the contestant's <b>observational</b> skills to the test, {{requiring}} them to view video clips and recall what they have witnessed faster than their competitors. On September 17, 2017, Sheindlin appeared on the series premiere of Fox News Channel's Objectified hosted by Harvey Levin. The program's first episode took {{an inside look at}} Sheindlin's life.|$|E
5|$|In genetics, a {{genome-wide}} association study (GWA study, or GWAS), {{also known}} as whole genome association study (WGA study, or WGAS), is an <b>observational</b> study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals {{to see if any}} variant is associated with a trait. GWASs typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other organism.|$|E
5|$|Our {{main source}} of {{information}} about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light more generally electromagnetic radiation. <b>Observational</b> astronomy may be divided according to the observed region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere. Specific information on these subfields is given below.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{astronomy}} uses radiation {{outside the}} visible range with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter. Radio astronomy {{is different from}} most other forms of <b>observational</b> astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|That {{space is}} {{undergoing}} metric expansion {{is shown by}} direct <b>observational</b> evidence of the Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.|$|E
5|$|The {{flatness}} problem (also {{known as}} the oldness problem) is an <b>observational</b> problem associated with a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW). The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial curvature depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative, if its density {{is less than the}} critical density; positive, if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be flat.|$|E
5|$|The last {{experimental}} {{flight was}} flown in 1971, {{due to a}} lack of candidate storms and a changeover in NOAA's fleet. More than a decade after the last modification experiment, Project Stormfury was officially canceled. Although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes, Project Stormfury was not without merit. The <b>observational</b> data and storm lifecycle research generated by Stormfury helped improve meteorologists' ability to forecast the movement and intensity of future hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbital motion}} of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular {{separation}} of 3arcseconds and a maximum of 11arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an <b>observational</b> challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300mm (12in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A periastron occurred in 1994 and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope.|$|E
5|$|There are no interventional {{studies that}} {{directly}} show mortality benefit of cholesterol lowering in FH. Rather, evidence of benefit {{is derived from}} a number of trials conducted in people who have polygenic hypercholesterolemia (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 <b>observational</b> study of a large British registry showed that mortality in people with FH had started to improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Looking back {{so far in}} {{the history}} of the {{universe}} presents some <b>observational</b> challenges. There are, however, a few <b>observational</b> methods for studying reionization.|$|E
25|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is {{a branch}} of <b>observational</b> astronomy that uses gravitational waves to collect <b>observational</b> data about sources of detectable gravitational waves such as binary star systems composed of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes; and events such as supernovae, {{and the formation of}} the early universe shortly after the Big Bang.|$|E
25|$|A {{ground-based}} <b>observational</b> {{campaign was}} organized {{as a possible}} test for future collision events involving also natural bodies.|$|E
25|$|Like {{theoretical}} astrophysics, theoretical X-ray astronomy uses a {{wide variety}} of tools which include analytical models to approximate the behavior of a possible X-ray source and computational numerical simulations to approximate the <b>observational</b> data. Once potential <b>observational</b> consequences are available they can be compared with experimental observations. Observers can look for data that refutes a model or helps in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.|$|E
25|$|X-ray astronomy, {{which is}} an <b>observational</b> branch of astronomy, which deals with the study of X-ray {{emission}} from celestial objects.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of eight <b>observational</b> studies published in 2001 found {{a statistically significant}} positive relationship between saturated fat and ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|The National Cholesterol Education Program revised their guidelines; however, their 2004 {{revisions}} {{have been}} criticized for use of nonrandomized, <b>observational</b> data.|$|E
