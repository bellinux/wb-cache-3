5|$|Japanese lacquerwork {{reached its}} apogee in the 17th century Edo period when lacquer {{was used for}} {{decorative}} objects as well as everyday items such as combs, tables, bottle, headrests, small boxes <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> cases. The most famous artist of this time was the lacquerer painter Ogata Kōrin. He {{was the first to}} use mother of pearl and pewter in larger quantities for decorating lacquerware.|$|E

Never again can a show get away with talking down to children <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> sloppily for them. Press Gang, possibly the best show in the world.|$|E
5|$|William Hickling Prescott (May 4, 1796– January 28, 1859) was an American {{historian}} and Hispanist, who is widely recognized by historiographers {{to have been}} the first American scientific historian. Despite suffering from serious visual impairment, which at times prevented him from reading <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> for himself, Prescott {{became one of the most}} eminent historians of 19th century America. He is also noted for his eidetic memory.|$|E

5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication {{methods used to}} supplement or replace speech <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those {{with a wide range}} of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to entertainment and artistic merit, LARP events may be designed for educational or political purposes. For example, the Danish secondary school Østerskov Efterskole uses LARP to teach {{most of its}} classes. Language classes can be taught by immersing students in a role-playing scenario {{in which they are}} forced to improvise speech <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> in the language they are learning. Politically themed LARP events may attempt to awaken or shape political thinking within a culture.|$|E
5|$|Longchamp entered {{public life}} {{at the close of}} Henry II's reign, as an {{official}} for the King's illegitimate son Geoffrey. He soon left Geoffrey's service, and served in Henry II's chancery, <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> office, before he entered service with Henry's son Richard. Richard, who was Duke of Aquitaine at the time, named Longchamp chancellor of the Duchy of Aquitaine. Longchamp first distinguished himself at the court of King Philip II of France in Paris in 1189, when he acted as Richard's envoy in a dispute with William Marshall, King Henry's envoy. By that time, Longchamp was already one of Richard's trusted advisors.|$|E

5|$|Hilary was {{probably}} born around 1110, and was likely of low birth, {{but nothing is}} known of his ancestry. His brother was a canon of Salisbury Cathedral, and they both {{may have come from}} around Salisbury. Hilary served as a clerk for Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and as Dean of the church of Christchurch in Twynham, Hampshire, probably receiving both offices through the influence of Henry of Blois. Christchurch was a collegiate church of secular clergy, or clergy who were not monks, and Hilary was dean of the church by 1139. He was educated as a canon lawyer, and was an advocate, or lawyer, in Rome in 1144. While in Rome, he also served in the papal chancery, <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> office, in 1146. Some of his coworkers in the chancery were Robert Pullen, John of Salisbury, and Nicholas Breakspear who later became pope, as Adrian IV.|$|E
5|$|Other writers {{the show}} {{employed}} throughout its run include Frank Renzulli, Todd A. Kessler (known as the co-creator of Damages), writing team Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider (worked with Chase on Northern Exposure) and Lawrence Konner, who co-created Almost Grown with Chase in 1988. In total, 20 writers <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> teams (22 people) are credited with writing episodes of The Sopranos. Of these, two (Tim Van Patten and Maria Laurino) receive a single story credit and eight are credited with writing a sole episode. The most prolific {{writers of the}} series were Chase (30 credited episodes, including story credits), Winter (25 episodes), Green and Burgess (22 episodes), Weiner (12 episodes) and Renzulli (9 episodes).|$|E
5|$|The use of props in Noh is minimalistic and stylized. The most {{commonly}} used prop in Noh is the fan, as it is carried by all performers regardless of role. Chorus singers and musicians may carry their fan in hand when entering the stage, or carry it tucked into the obi (the sash). The fan is usually placed at the performer's side {{when he or she}} takes position, and is often not taken up again until leaving the stage. During dance sequences, the fan is typically used to represent any and all hand-held props, such as a sword, wine jug, flute, <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> brush. The fan may represent various objects {{over the course of a}} single play.|$|E
50|$|These drives are not dual-mode, so they cannot read <b>or</b> <b>write</b> 5¼-inch disks {{formatted}} by lower-capacity 48-tpi models, {{such as the}} Commodore 1541 or 4040. They also cannot read <b>or</b> <b>write</b> 5¼-inch disks formatted by 96-tpi drives, such as the 640 kilobyte IBM PC disk or 880 kilobyte Commodore Amiga disk, due to {{the minor}} difference in track spacing. Lastly, they cannot read <b>or</b> <b>write</b> high-density 5¼-inch disks due to both the difference in track spacing and the difference in write head coercivity (300-oersted for double-density, 600-oersted for high-density).|$|R

5|$|Toy Storys {{script was}} {{strongly}} influenced by the ideas of screenwriter Robert McKee. The members of Pixar's story team—Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Joe Ranft—were aware {{that most of them}} were beginners at writing for feature films. None of them had any feature story <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> credits to their name besides Ranft, who had taught a story class at CalArts and did some storyboard work prior. Seeking insight, Lasseter and Docter attended a three-day seminar in Los Angeles given by McKee. His principles, grounded in Aristotle's Poetics, dictated that a character emerges most realistically and compellingly from the choices that the protagonist makes in reaction to his problems. Disney also appointed Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon found that the script wasn't working but had a great structure, and added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for Barbie. The story team continued to touch up the script as production was underway. Among the late additions was the encounter between Buzz and the alien squeaky toys at Pizza Planet, which emerged from a brainstorming session with a dozen directors, story artists, and animators from Disney.|$|E
5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} <b>or</b> <b>writing.</b> Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E

25|$|These {{included}} reading <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> single {{characters to}} the system console and reading <b>or</b> <b>writing</b> a sector of data from the disk. The BDOS handled some of the buffering of data from the diskette, but before CP/M 3.0 it assumed a disk sector size fixed at 128 bytes, as used on single-density 8-inch floppy disks. Since most 5.25-inch disk formats used larger sectors, the blocking and deblocking and the management of a disk buffer area was handled by model-specific code in the BIOS.|$|E
