40|$|A study {{employing}} twenty {{male and}} eleven female subjects {{was performed to}} determine maxi-mum hand grip torque that can be exerted during tightening or loosening <b>of</b> circular electrical <b>connectors.</b> A static, sustained three-second exertion {{was used as the}} strength criterion. Torque was applied to simulated connector rings with diameters of 0. 9, 1. 5, and 2. 0 inches and measured by means of a single-bridge torsional load cell. Other variables tested included the type of grip employed (full or fingertip), <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>connector</b> (front, right side, or rear facing behind a barrier), the use of work gloves and chemical defense gloves, the height <b>of</b> the <b>connectors</b> (60 % and 85 % of the maximum reach height) and the direction of rotation. Hand grip torque strength was found to be directly related to connector diameters, with simi-lar strength patterns exhibited for tightening and loosening. Higher torque was exerted when the connectors were on the subject's right side, and tightening and loosening effort corres-ponded to flexing and extending the wrist parallel to the forearms. The use of gloves re-sulted in higher torque in most situations. little effect on torque strength. Connector height and direction of rotation ha...|$|R

40|$|Bridge {{projects}} {{constructed in}} Texas which utilize precast bent caps typically employ grouted vertical ducts in the cap-to-column connections. This {{type of connection}} is preferred due to the simple geometry and because the volume of grout needed to complete the connections is minimized. A number of questions related to {{the sensitivity of the}} behavior of the grouted vertical-duct connectors to design parameters were identified during the design and construction of these bridges. Thirty-two, large-scale pullout tests <b>of</b> <b>connectors</b> grouted in galvanized steel and plastic ducts were conducted to investigate the response of this type <b>of</b> <b>connector.</b> The results indicate that the tensile capacity is sensitive to the type of duct, the embedded length <b>of</b> the <b>connector,</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>connectors</b> tested simultaneously in tension, and the placement <b>of</b> the <b>connector</b> within the duct. However, the results were not sensitive to epoxy coating on the connector or to the presence of spiral transverse reinforcement around the group <b>of</b> <b>connectors.</b> Design equations are proposed for the minimum embedded length <b>of</b> all <b>connectors</b> to satisfy serviceability concerns and for the development length necessary to resist the calculated tensile stresses in the connectors under the design load combinations...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{integrated}} structural and behavioral model <b>of</b> Reo <b>connectors</b> and Petri nets, allowing a direct {{comparison of the}} two concurrency models. For this purpose, we introduce a notion <b>of</b> <b>connectors</b> which consist <b>of</b> a number of interconnected, user-defined primitives with fixed behavior. While the structure <b>of</b> <b>connectors</b> resembles hypergraphs, their semantics is given in terms of so-called port automata. We define both models in a categorical setting where composition operations can be elegantly defined and integrated. Specifically, we formalize structural gluings <b>of</b> <b>connectors</b> as pushouts, and joins of port automata as pullbacks. We then define a semantical functor from the connector to the port automata category which preserves this composition. We further show how to encode Reo connectors and Petri nets into this model and indicate applications to dynamic reconfigurations modeled using double pushout graph transformation. ...|$|R
