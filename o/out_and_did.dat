5|$|Adams {{received}} {{an invitation to}} {{become a member of the}} Knickerbockers a month or so after the team's September 23, 1845, creation. He accepted and joined the club along with other men in the medical field; he later said that players from the New York Base Ball Club were behind the formation of the Knickerbockers. Records of the club's practice games indicate that he was a member of the Knickerbockers by November 18, 1845. In an inter-squad game held that day, which was the Knickerbockers' last of the year, Adams scored nine runs for his team as they defeated a side picked by William R. Wheaton, 51–42. The club organized its first game against outside opposition in 1846; at a June 5 meeting Adams was selected to a three-man committee whose aim was to set up a game against the New York Base Ball Club. The committee's efforts were successful, and a game was scheduled on June 19. Adams participated in the contest, which the Knickerbockers lost 23–1. Batting second in the Knickerbockers' lineup, he made one <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not score a run.|$|E
25|$|Cary Grant said of Stewart's acting technique:He had {{the ability}} to talk naturally. He knew that in conversations people do often {{interrupt}} one another and it's not always so easy to get a thought out. It took a little time for the sound men to get used to him, but he had an enormous impact. And then, some years later, Marlon came <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that Jimmy did it first.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Gregory Maston of Bell Labs {{filed for}} a patent {{involving}} a circuit that could switch between several audio sources based on their levels. The loudest one was latched into the mix. This system did not ramp switched signals smoothly in and <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not maintain a constant ambience. It was intended for speakerphone conferencing applications. In 1972, Keith A. T. Knox with the British Post Office Corporation developed an adaptive threshold gate circuit intended for speakerphone usage. The system used a second microphone somewhat near the first to sense ambient noise level.|$|E

25|$|The University of Illinois at Chicago was {{established}} at the Harrison/Halsted area in 1965, the location chosen by Mayor Richard J. Daley. This was unpopular with the locals, who had been promised more low-income housing by the city, and there were numerous protests, especially by the Italian-American and Mexican-American communities. The University had little interaction with the surrounding community and decided against keeping local businesses in its plans for expansion in the 1980s. The university slowly began buying land in the Maxwell area and demolishing buildings. It had been rumored that the University never officially announced its plans in the 1980s, but circulated speculation that it would exercise eminent domain, which was backed by state legislation. This strategy may have saved the school millions of dollars, not only because people slowly moved <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> {{not have to be}} compensated, but also because real estate prices continued to drop in the area through the 1980s and early 1990s, because of the rumors.|$|E
500|$|Hard as the Americans {{worked to}} {{incorporate}} {{themselves into the}} Grand Fleet, they had yet to shake a belief among the veteran British that they were amateurs merely playing at war. In writing to his American-born wife following the maneuvers, Admiral Beatty noted that, [...] "The American Squadron enjoyed themselves greatly while we were <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> well, and will do better next time. I am sending old Rodman out on an operation of his own, which pleases him and gives them an idea that they are really {{taking part in the}} war. I trust they will come to no harm." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1990 until 1993, Scott {{worked at}} WESH, an NBC {{affiliate}} in Orlando, Florida {{as a sports}} reporter and sports anchor. While at WESH, he met ESPN producer Gus Ramsey, who was beginning his own career. Ramsey said of Scott: [...] "You knew the second he {{walked in the door}} that it was a pit stop, and that he was gonna be this big star somewhere someday. He went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> a piece on the rodeo, and he nailed it just like he would nail the NBA Finals for ESPN." [...] He earned first place honors from the Central Florida Press Club for a feature on rodeo.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} run on 20 February 2010, a sled from Australia crashed <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not finish, while a sled from Great Britain was disqualified when the sled's {{brakeman}} was ejected {{during the first}} run. Liechtenstein's sled crashed out during the first run and finished, but did not start the second run. During the two-man event, runs three and four on 21 February 2010 were rescheduled to 16:00 PST (00:00 UTC on 22 February) for run three and 17:35 PST (01:35 UTC on the 22nd) for run four due to unseasonable warm weather. Temperatures reached [...] {{on the afternoon of}} the 20th and were expected to reach [...] on the afternoon of the 21st. No crashes occurred in the final two runs of the event. Germany's André Lange and Kevin Kuske won the two-man event.|$|E
500|$|This was {{followed}} by a diplomatic crisis, when a rumor began to circulate that China had dispatched a warship carrying investigators to Mexican waters. [...] The U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Henry Lane Wilson, sent a telegram to Philander C. Knox, the Secretary of State, claiming that the Chinese gunboat Korea was en route for Mexico. [...] Yuan Kwai, a Chinese diplomat in Washington, D.C., sought the support of the United States Department of State. [...] He was told that the U.S. would not approve the act, but would not make an attempt to halt it, either. [...] Failing to get support from the U.S., China announced that the rumor was false. [...] Yuan Kwai stated that the cruiser Hai Chi might dock in Mexico after attending the coronation of George V in London. [...] In the event, the Hai Chi docked in Cuba after visiting the United States and halted there while the diplomatic crisis played <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not go on to Mexico.|$|E
500|$|After two county {{matches in}} which he did little with bat or ball, Bosanquet played in the second Test. However, in his two innings, he scored only six and four not <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not bowl in the only innings. After taking 11 wickets for Middlesex against Kent in the only match he played between the Tests, in the third match of the series, Bosanquet scored 20 and 22 not out and took one wicket in the match. This was his final {{appearance}} of the series as he was dropped for the final two Tests. Wisden reported that [...] "Bosanquet was a complete disappointment". The almanack also commented in the report on the first Test: [...] "In the first flush of his triumph {{his place in the}} England team seemed secure for the whole season, but he never reproduced his form, and dropped out of the eleven after the match at Leeds." [...] This was his final Test. In seven matches for England he scored 147 runs at an average of 13.36 and took 25 wickets at 24.16.|$|E

500|$|After Myers had {{completed}} providing the {{voice for the}} character, when the film was well into production, he asked to re-record all of his lines with a Scottish accent, similar to that his mother used {{when she told him}} bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films, such as So I Married an Axe Murderer and [...] According to the DVD commentary, he had also tried using country and Canadian accents. After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, [...] "It was so good we took $4m worth of animation <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> it again." [...] A point Myers disputes, saying [...] "it didn’t cost the studio “millions of dollars,” as rumored. “What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, I went in for twenty sessions. I got paid the same.". [...] Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to come. There were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits. [...] "I got a letter from Spielberg thanking me so much for caring about the character," [...] Myers said. [...] "And he said the Scottish accent had improved the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|McKay {{stated that}} Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd [...] "great with dialogue", adding [...] "the {{two of us}} holed up in hotel rooms on {{the east and west}} coast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just {{enhanced}} some stuff." [...] Rudd elaborated, [...] "The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs." [...] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result. One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being [...] "a crucial part" [...] of the Ant-Man comics. For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story. Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.|$|E

The {{attitude}} and tactics of Drummond and Cauty's partnership matched {{that of the}} fictional cult whose name they had adopted. Throughout the partnership, these tactics were often interpreted by media commentators as [...] "Situationist pranks" [...] or [...] "publicity stunts". However, according to Drummond, [...] "That's {{just the way it}} was interpreted. We've always loathed the word scam. I know no-one's ever going to believe us, but we never felt we went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct." [...] Cauty has expressed similar feelings, saying of the KLF, [...] "I think it worked because we really meant it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Patrick Fitzgerald, {{the federal}} prosecutor, noted, [...] "Mr. Ryan steered {{contracts}} worth {{millions of dollars}} to friends and took payments and vacations in return. When he was a sitting governor, he lied to the FBI about this conduct and then he went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> it again." [...] He charged {{that one of the most}} egregious aspects of the corruption was Ryan's action after learning that bribes were being paid for licenses. Instead of ending the practice he tried to end the investigation that had uncovered it, Fitzgerald said, calling the moment [...] "a low-water mark for public service." [...] Ryan became one of four Illinois governors since 1968 to be convicted of white-collar crimes, following Otto Kerner, Jr. and Dan Walker and followed by Rod Blagojevich.|$|E

Waters described the riots as a rebellion, saying [...] "If you call it a riot {{it sounds like it}} was just a bunch of crazy people who went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> bad things for no reason. I maintain it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable." [...] In her view, the violence was “a spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice.” [...] In regards to the looting of Korean-owned stores by local black residents, she said: “There were mothers who took {{this as an opportunity to}} take some milk, to take some bread, to take some shoes... They are not crooks.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Tancredo {{said his}} falling {{out with the}} White House has lasted.

Here was a Republican Congress increasing government to an extent larger than it had been increased since Medicare had come into existence." [...] Tancredo reported that his career in Congress was threatened by the leadership because of his stances. [...] "I was called into Tom DeLay's office because I was supporting Republican challengers to Republican incumbents. I had a group called Team America that went <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> that. He called me and said to me, 'You’re jeopardizing your career in this place by doing these things.'
