There are given results of experimental researches of noise characteristics (NC) of the UKM vegetable cutter within the sound power levels (SPL) in octave frequency bands in the load-free and <b>on-load</b> <b>operation</b> with a product. There have been also determined their correlation to the rated values of noise characteristics. The study {{results show that the}} sound power level emitted by the UKM cutter according to the A characteristic exceeds the RVNC at operation of the cutter with a product. The frequency of 500 Hz usually is “dangerous ” in the octave frequency bands; excess of the RVNC is 11 dB. Operation of the cutter at a higher rotation rate worsens its noise characteristics. Gears of the drive, {{as well as of the}} changeable vegetable cutting mechanism are the source of the increased noise level...|$|E
40|$|A {{fuel cell}} {{demonstration}} {{was conducted on}} coalmine methane to demonstrate the utilization of methane emissions associated with underground coal mining operations in a carbonate Direct FuelCell{reg_sign} (DFC{reg_sign}) power plant. FuelCell Energy (FCE) conducted the demonstration {{with support from the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and in cooperation with Northwest Fuel Development, the operator of the Rose Valley test site in Hopedale, Ohio. The fuel cell power plant, a first generation sub megawatt power plant, was operated on CMM between August 1, 2003 and December 13, 2003. The direct fuel cell operated on low-Btu CMM with 42 % methane content and achieved performance levels comparable to natural gas on a Btu feed basis. During this period 1456 hours <b>on-load</b> <b>operation</b> was achieved. The total power generated using CMM was 134 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity. The power generated was connected to the American Electric Power grid by a 69 -kilovolt (kV) transformer. The maximum power level achieved was 140 kW. Efficiency of power generation was 40 % based on the lower heating value (LHV) of the CMM. Compression and drying of the CMM resulted in additional parasitic load, which reduced the overall efficiency to 36 % LHV. In future applications, on-board compression and utilization of the saturated CMM without drying will be investigated {{in order to reduce the}} auxiliary power requirements. By comparison, the internal combustion engines operating on CMM at the Hopedale site operate at an over efficiency of 20 %. The over-all efficiency for the fuel cell is therefore 80 % higher than the internal combustion engine (36 % vs. 20 %). Future operation of a 250 kW Fuel Cell Power Plant on CMM will utilize 18, 400, 000 cubic feet of methane per year. This will be equivalent to: (a) avoiding 7428 metric tons of CO{sub 2 } emissions, (b) avoiding 16. 4 million pounds of CO{sub 2 } emissions, (c) removing 1640 cars off the road for one year, (d) heating 267 households for 1 year, (e) planting 2234 acres of trees. Based on the results obtained in this demonstration it can be concluded that utilization of fuel cells to mitigate CMM emissions is an attractive option that can be utilized to generate power at high efficiencies and with very low emissions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new permanent-magnet (PM) brushless machine for wind power generation. This machine adopts an outer-rotor topology, aiming at capturing wind power directly. In {{order to achieve}} high power density, a high-speed PM brushless generator is artfully integrated with a coaxial magnetic gear. The design details, with emphasis on the special constraints of wind power generation, are elaborated. By using the time-stepping finite element method, the static characteristics as well as no-load and <b>on-load</b> <b>operations</b> are simulated. A prototype is also built for experimentation. Both simulation and experimental results are given to verify {{the validity of the}} proposed machine.

40|$|Permanent-magnet {{machines}} with fractional slot concentrated windings {{are easy to}} manufacture. Their popularity therefore is steadily increasing. Without a proper design, however, the induced eddy-current losses in the solid rotor get rather high. The modeling and the prediction of eddy-current losses for these machines are thus very important during the design process. This paper focuses on the finite-element analysis and the experimental validation of eddy-current losses {{for this kind of}} machine with a small axial length. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional transient finite-element models are developed for computing the eddy-current losses. The rotor motion is taken into account using an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation. The total iron losses are measured experimentally and a method to separate the rotor iron losses from the total iron losses is presented. The validation results show that the twodimensional finite-element model overestimates the losses due to the end-effects being neglected. The three-dimensional model agrees much better with the measurements in both no-load and <b>on-load</b> <b>operations.</b> DC systems, Energy conversion & StorageNumerical AnalysisElectrical Power Processin...|$|R
40|$|The general {{effects of}} {{implementing}} skewing techniques in electrical machines {{are well known}} and have been extensively studied over the years. An important aspect of such techniques {{is related to the}} identification of optimal methods for analyzing and modelling any skewed components. This paper presents a fast, finite-element-based method, able to accurately analyze the effects of skew on wound-field, salient-pole synchronous generators in a relatively shorter time than the more traditional methods. As vessel for studying the proposed technique, a 400 kVA alternator is considered. Analytical and theoretical considerations on the benefits of skewing the stator in the generator under analysis are preliminary carried out. A finite-element model of the machine is built and the proposed method is then implemented to investigate the effects of the skewed stator. Comparisons against more traditional techniques are presented, with focus on the analysis of the voltage total harmonic distortion and the damper bars’ currents. Finally, experimental tests are performed at no-load and <b>on-load</b> <b>operations</b> for validation purposes, with excellent results being achieved...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work performed for manufacturing and demonstrating {{the performance of}} its 250 -kW molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) stack in an integrated system at the Naval Air Station Miramar (NAS Miramar) located in San Diego, California. The stack constructed for the demonstration test at the NAS Miramar consisted of 250 cells. It was manufactured using M-C Power`s patented Internally Manifolded Heat Exchanger (IMHEX{reg_sign}) stack design. The demonstration test at NAS Miramar was designed to operate the 250 -kW MCFC stack in a cogeneration mode. This test represented the first attempt to thermally integrate an MCFC stack in a cogeneration system. The test was started on January 10, 1997, and voluntarily terminated on May 12, 1997, after 2, 350 hours of operation at temperatures above 1, 100 F and at a pressure of three atmospheres. It produced 160 MWh of d. c. power and 346, 000 lbs of 110 psig steam for export during 1, 566 hours of <b>on-load</b> <b>operations.</b> The test demonstrated a d. c. power output of 206 kW. Most of {{the balance of the}} plant (BOP) equipment operated satisfactorily. However, the off-the-shelf automotive turbocharger used for supplying air to the plant failed on numerous occasions and the hot gas blower developed seal leakage problems which impacted continuous plant operations. Overall the demonstration test at NAS Miramar was successful in demonstrating many critical features of the IMHEX technology. Lessons learned from this test will be very useful for improving designs and operations for future MCFC power plants...|$|R
40|$|Wavelet {{transformation}} {{is one of}} the most popular tools for acoustic signal analysis. It provides good resolution both in time and frequency domains as well as wide choice of mother wavelets this makes wavelet transformation a choice when flexible approach is required. However, selecting parameters of analysis can be difficult, especially regarding mother wavelet as different mother wavelets have various properties regarding number of vanishing moments and symmetry. This paper presents studies to determine the possibility of on-load tap changer wear detection by applying wavelet transformation. In research, different mother wavelets were selected and their usefulness was examined. Signals to be analyzed were obtained during <b>on-load</b> tap changer <b>operation</b> in different mechanical conditions simulating devices wear in service. All measurements were performed on model very similar to real industrial on-load tap changer. Tests were conducted in controlled laboratory environment, reducing most of the possible disruptions...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Electrical Engineering. Voltage {{control is}} an {{essential}} part of the electricity transmission and distribution network system for maintaining voltage within statutory limits at the substation bus and at the consumer's point of supply. The most popular voltage control method on the transmission and distribution network system uses the on-load tap changer (OLTC) transformer. This study proposes the use of Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) systems on the on-load tap changers when two or more mismatched transformers are connected in parallel in order to control the voltage supply to local customers. The actual voltage recordings and <b>on-load</b> tap change <b>operations</b> for each of the paralleled transformers have been analyzed and modelled on MATLAB/Simulink in order to develop an improved control algorithm using Fuzzy Logic Control. With the two-input, one-output FLC system with seven linguistic values giving 49 control rules, the number of tap change operations are minimized and the bus voltage is maintained within the statutory limits...|$|R
40|$|Voltage {{instability}} is a {{major concern}} in operation of power systems and {{it is well known that}} voltage instability and collapse have led to blackout or abnormally low voltages in a significant part of the power system. Consequently, tracking the proximity of the power system to an insecure voltage condition has become an important element of any protection and control scheme. The expected time until instability is a critical aspect. There are a few energy management systems including voltage stability analysis function in the real-time environment of control centres, these are based on assumptions (such as off-line models of the system loads) that may lead the system to an insecure operation and/or poor utilization of the resources. Voltage instability is driven by the load dynamics, and investigations have shown that load restoration due to the on-load tap changer (OLTC) action is the main cause of the voltage instability. However, the aggregate loads seen from bulk power delivery transformers are still the most uncertain power system components, due to the uncertainty of the participation of individual loads and shortcomings of the present approaches in the load modeling. In order to develop and implement a true on-line voltage stability analysis method, the on-line accurate modeling of the higher voltage (supply system) and the lower voltage level (aggregate load) based on the local measurements is required. In this research, using the changes in the load bus measured voltage and current, novel methods are developed to estimate the supply system equivalent and to identify load parameters. Random changes in the load voltage and current are processed to estimate the supply system Thevenin impedance and the composite load components are identified in a peeling process using the load bus data changes during a large disturbance in the system. The results are then used to anticipate a possible long-term voltage instability caused by the <b>on-load</b> tap changer <b>operation</b> following the disturbance. Work on the standard test system is provided to validate the proposed methods. The findings in this research are expected to provide a better understanding of the load dynamics role in the voltage stability, and improve the reliability and economy of the system operation by making it possible to decrease uncertainty in security margins and determine accurately the transfer limits...|$|R
