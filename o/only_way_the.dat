5|$|In {{line with}} this geopolitical perspective, Pablo {{argued that the}} <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Trotskyists could avoid {{isolation}} was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term entryism in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties. This tactic was known as entrism sui generis, to distinguish it from the short-term entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> war would come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E
5|$|The Colonel {{was finally}} {{discovered}} in the Dōtonbori River on March 10, 2009. Divers who recovered the statue at first thought {{it was only a}} large barrel, and shortly after a human corpse, but Hanshin fans on the scene were quick to identify it as the upper body of the long-lost Colonel. The right hand and lower body were found next day, but the statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. It is said that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> curse can be lifted is by returning his long-lost glasses and left hand.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{the extension of}} I-70; however, the route still had {{to be approved by}} the representatives of the U.S. military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network did not have a direct connection from the central U.S. to southern California; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners {{approved the}} extension, but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state. After being told this was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> military would approve the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E
5|$|While the {{wreckage}} was being examined, investigators {{found that all}} four engines were producing thrust {{at the time of}} impact. There were only two ways that the propeller could be reversed during the take-off sequence. Investigators ruled out electrical malfunction since, after detailed examination of the engine hub, there was no evidence found of this happening. Therefore, it was concluded that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> propeller could have been reversed was through an unintentional crew action. Although there was no formal evidence that a simulated engine failure was being performed, statements submitted by witnesses suggested that it was likely this was the case. United Airlines procedure calls for No. 4 engine to be shut down in a simulated engine failurethe same engine which was found at the crash site with its propellers reversed.|$|E

25|$|Camarilla {{policy is}} that vampires should try {{to fit in with}} and hide from the rest of humanity, as to easily feed on them. For this reason, they created a web of lies and misinformation, called the Masquerade, to make the public believe that supernatural beings like vampires could not {{possibly}} exist. The Camarilla also believes that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> vampire species can survive in these modern nights is if it unites—any breach of the Masquerade by any vampire risks exposing the entire race. Both viewpoints are fundamentally opposed by the Sabbat.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Dale {{discovered}} a wrecked 1960 Champion 7-GC flipped over and abandoned {{at an airport}} in northern Wisconsin. The brothers then bought the plane from its owner with the very little money they had and rebuilt it in the shed at their family farmhouse. This was their first experience tinkering with an aircraft as a self-taught restoration project, followed by {{the making of a}} Glasair 1 they saw introduced at the 1980 EAA Convention and Fly-In (now called AirVenture) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. David Gustafson of Aircraft Spruce reported that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Klapmeier brothers' parents would lend them the money to buy a Glasair was if they wrote up a business plan explaining why constructing a homebuilt would further their professional lives.|$|E
25|$|When Welsh {{returned}} to America he {{was intent on}} fighting Ritchie, having failed to meet both Nelson and Wolgast. He employed the services of Harry Pollok, one of New York's most flamboyant sports impresarios. When Welsh and Fanny arrived in New York on 29 March 1913, Pollok was there orchestrating the reporters and photographers. Even with Pollack's help Ritchie was difficult to commit. Champions tended {{to stick to the}} East Coast, fighting in six round contests where the 'no-decision' contests meant the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> title could be lost would be through a knockout. When Welsh arrived in New York, Billy Dolan, Ritchie's manager, announced that the champion would not be fighting for four months as he was touring Europe to fulfil theatrical commitments. Welsh busied himself through fights, preparing for a possible title bid.|$|E

25|$|After the {{revolution}} radicalized further and headed towards terror, Charlotte Corday began {{to sympathize with}} the Girondins. She admired their speeches and grew fond {{of many of the}} Girondist groups whom she met while living in Caen. She respected the political principles of the Girondins and came to align herself with their thinking. She regarded them as a movement that would ultimately save France. The Gironde represented a more moderate approach to {{the revolution}} and they, like Corday, were skeptical about the direction the revolution was taking. They opposed the Montagnards, who advocated a more radical approach to the revolution, which included the extreme idea that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> revolution would survive invasion and civil war was through terrorizing and executing those opposed to it. The opposition to this radical thinking, coupled with the influence of the Gironde, ultimately led Corday to carry out her plan to murder the most radical of them all, Jean-Paul Marat.|$|E
25|$|Nobb {{suggests}} the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> rebels can withstand Griffon is by rebuilding Paznos, a massive mobile fortress. Max and Monica travel to Heim Rada to begin restoring the origin {{point of the}} Gundorada Workshop. As they go about rebuilding the village, they are again attacked by the Death Ark. They confront Gaspard and he tells them he is just like them; fighting for a parent. He explains that his changeling father {{died when he was}} a child, and he and his mother (Rikako Aikawa/Samantha Newark) were run out of town. Eventually, she died, but beforehand, she told him he must find something worth protecting. Gaspard realizes he hasn't found such a thing, and now lives only for hatred. He tells them they must defeat Griffon, and asks if he can join them. However, the magic of Griffon turns him into a dragon and forces him to fight them. They reluctantly kill him. However, a child Gaspard is then shown meeting his mother in their old house, where she tells him she is proud that he found something worth protecting.|$|E
25|$|Salvage efforts began immediately, and divers {{were sent}} {{down from a}} salvage tug that arrived from Coco Solo. By 10:00am, {{they were on the}} bottom {{examining}} the wreck. To search for trapped personnel, they hammered on the hull near the aft end of the ship and worked forward. Upon reaching the torpedo room, they heard answering hammer blows from inside the boat. In 1923 the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> salvage crew could get the men out of the submarine was to lift it physically from the mud using cranes or pontoons. One of the largest crane barges in the world, Ajax, built specifically for handling the gates of the canal locks, was in the Canal Zone. However, there had been a landslide at the famous Gaillard Cut and Ajax {{was on the other side}} of the slide, assisting in clearing the Canal. The excavation shifted into high gear and by 2:00pm on the afternoon of the sinking, the crane barge Ajax squeezed through and was on its way to the O-5 site.|$|E

Ghost says that they need to speak to the Awoken, who lurk out in the Reef and refuse to take sides in the galaxy's wars. The Exo Stranger then leaves as she did not have time to explain things further. Once the Guardian arrives at the Reef, they meet the Queen of the Reef, Mara Sov, and her brother, Prince Uldren Sov, who tells the Guardian that they will help them locate the Black Garden if they bring them the head of a Vex Gate Lord. The Guardian travels back to Venus, where they uncover the Archive, which reveals secrets about the Vex, including the location of a place called the Vault of Glass, and pathways across the galaxy.
