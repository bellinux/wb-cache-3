5|$|Later in 227 BC, Cleomenes bribed the ephors {{to allow}} him to {{continue}} his campaign against the Achaeans. Having succeeded with his bribe, Cleomenes advanced into the territory of Megalopolis and captured the village of Leuctra. In response, an Achaean army arrived, relieved the city and inflicted a minor defeat on the Spartan army based nearest the city walls. Cleomenes was therefore obliged to retreat with his troops across a series of ravines. Aratus ordered the Achaeans not to pursue the Spartans across the ravine, but Lydiadas of Megalopolis disobeyed the order and charged with the cavalry in pursuit of the Spartans. Taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> terrain and the scattered cavalry, Cleomenes sent his Cretan and Tarentine soldiers against Lydiadas. They routed the cavalry, and Lydiadas was amongst the dead. The Spartans, encouraged by these events, charged against the main Achaean forces and defeated the entire army. The Achaeans were so outraged and demoralized by Aratus' failure to support Lydiadas that they made no further attacks in that year.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox was {{the first}} choice to play Marty McFly, but he was {{committed}} to the show Family Ties. Family Ties producer Gary David Goldberg felt that Fox was essential to the show's success. With co-star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, he refused to allow Fox time off {{to work on a}} film. Back to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film. Zemeckis' next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> casting process, the start date was pushed back twice.|$|E

In some cases authorities denied recognition of a change in identity unless a sex-reassignment intervention had occurred. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> legal procedure for gender recognition, it is often impossible for transgender persons to get documents reflecting their gender identity, which leads to difficulties in all services requiring identity documents (health care, transportation passes, banking services).|$|E

25|$|On 2 May, {{shortly after}} {{his return to the}} brigade, Johnston led it in {{operations}} to capture Baby 700, a hill on the slopes overlooking ANZAC Cove. Johnston did not conduct a reconnaissance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> terrain which needed to be traversed by his men prior to the commencement of the attack. As a result, many units had not reached their assigned starting positions by the designated start time of the offensive. The attack, planned by Godley and with ambitious objectives, was beaten off with heavy losses. In Godley's subsequent report on the battle, Johnston was not criticised for his handling of the brigade.|$|E
25|$|While some Austrian leaders proved irresolute, Schwarzenberg thrust boldly at Paul Grenier's {{left wing}} {{divisions}} of Louis Bastoul and Michel Ney.

The Murray Regiment carried Kronacker in an impetuous assault, lost it to Ney's counterattack, and captured it again. Later in the day, the French retook Kronacker before losing it again to a charge by the Murray Regiment. By this time, Kienmayer found out that the French had smashed Johann Kollowrat's Left Center Column and he issued orders to retreat. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult</b> tactical situation, Schwarzenberg was able to withdraw his division in good order.|$|E

This initial weakness was also reflected in political instability, endemic corruption, inefficient administration and military incompetence.

The American failure was marked by its own set of shortcomings and miscalculations, but was inextricably linked to South Vietnamese difficulties, some historians maintain.

25|$|After a rest day, {{the riders}} {{took in the}} Tour's hardest stage, and the last chance for the climbers to make the time gains they’d need before the final time trial. The race was thought to split up {{somewhat}} on the brutal Port de Larrau (14.7km climb at 8.1%), {{despite the fact that}} its summit came just 79km into the stage. The race dipped into Spain for some 50 kilometres at the summit, the fourth country visited in this year's Tour. From there, there was little reprieve for the riders, hitting the Alto Laza and the Col de la Pierre St Martin (14.2km climb at 5.2%) before descending to the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>difficult,</b> and very steep, first-category Col de Marie-Blanque (9.3km climb at 7.4%).

The routes were made subject to public service obligations with the Ministry of Transport and Communications from 1 April 1997. Widerøe won the initial tender. A proposal to make Andenes an international airport was launched in 2000, which also proposed that the airport change its name to Lofoten Airport. Unlike the two airports in Lofoten, Leknes Airport and Svolvær Airport, Helle, Andenes is able to handle jetliners. The name change was rejected by interests in Lofoten, which accused Vesterålen of stealing the more well-known Lofoten name.|$|E
