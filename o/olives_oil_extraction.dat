In order to overcome one of the main weaknesses of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>extraction</b> plants, the discontinuity of the process due to the presence of the malaxer, a batch machine placed between the crusher and the decanter, effectively continuous ultrasonic full-scale solutions for the extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> industry have been developed. Practical applications: High power ultrasound for the treatment of olive paste represents a system to replace the malaxing phase, the weakest link of the chain in the VOO extraction process. The malaxer is a batch machine, which works between two continuous devices, the fruit crusher and the decanter. It is also a bad heat exchanger due to a not favorable ratio between the big volume of olive paste that should be warmed and the small surface for the heat exchange. New devices need to be developed in order to optimize the extraction plant, reducing the time of process, the resource consumption without compromise the oil quality, in order to guarantee a right profit for the olive millers.

40|$|The more {{efficient}} continuous centrifugation-based <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>extraction</b> processes brought as drawback a significant increment of the generated effluents, highlighting olive vegetation wastewater (OVW) {{as the most}} polluted. In this work, OVW from a two-phase <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>extraction</b> process (OVW- 2) was treated by means of batch membrane operations in sequence comprising UF, NF and RO. This treatment is capable of successfully removing the organic matter and other pollutants from the wastewater, but membrane fouling can limit drastically membranes operation and longevity. Threshold flux-based methods represent a reliable tool to avoid fouling problems and were formerly applied to treat OVW streams coming from a three-phase production line (OVW- 3). Below threshold flux conditions, no relevant rates of fouling are observed, thus making the treatment process technically and economically feasible. In order to increase the threshold flux values, some pretreatment processes were conducted on the feedstock, such as pH-T flocculation and successively photocatalysis by novel lab-made titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The latter provided 22. 3 %, 17. 6 % and 20. 4 % further threshold flux increase to UF, NF and RO, respectively. At the end, a permeate with COD equal to 121 mg/L was successfully obtained, respecting both Italian and Spanish standards for discharging purified OVW- 2 in municipal sewers. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
