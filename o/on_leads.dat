The Department manages the park in association with local council and a volunteer group—The Friends of Anstey Hill. This volunteer group makes significant contributions to revegetation, weed control, ruin stabilisation and creation of walking trails. There are no visitor facilities or amenities except for walking trails, most of which follow fire access tracks; a single constructed pedestrian trail leads to Klopper’s Quarry. The park is mostly designated as a [...] "conservation zone" [...] where only passive recreation, including walking dogs <b>on</b> <b>leads,</b> is permitted. Horses and motor vehicles are not allowed and only the main tracks are maintained.|$|E

500|$|In [...]hack//Mutation, Kite and BlackRose {{encounter}} {{system administrator}} Lios, who declares Kite's bracelet {{to be an}} illegal hack. He tries to delete Kite's character data, but fails due to Kite's data being encrypted by the Book of Twilight. Helba intervenes, and convinces Lios to observe Kite for the time being. Lios directs them to an area where they find Innis, a monster with powers similar to Skeith's. Upon defeating Innis, Kite receives an e-mail from Aura, who reveals that she is an AI. They travel to an area to meet her; but Cubia attacks them, and they repel the monster with difficulty. Short <b>on</b> <b>leads,</b> they contact Wiseman, who is intrigued by Kite's bracelet. He suggests that Skeith and Innis {{are based on the}} [...] "Cursed Wave", an antagonistic force featured in the poem Epitaph of Twilight, upon which The World is based. Wiseman helps grant them access to Net Slum, a place known as a paradise for hackers and wandering AIs. Upon arrival, another Cursed Wave monster called Magus attacks them.

Now, the two are second-year high school students, but Hotaru is {{anything}} but innocent. Yuma gets her first boyfriend and is nervous about it, so a more experienced Hotaru suggests a [...] "dress rehearsal" [...] to help her out. The helping out later <b>on</b> <b>leads</b> to a deep kiss with Hotaru, who says that Yuma now knows how to kiss a guy. This leaves her thinking about how much better this kiss was than {{the one she had}} shared with her boyfriend. As time goes on, Yuma worries that her boyfriend will find out what is going on between her and Hotaru. She also cannot explain these [...] "strange" [...] feelings she has when she is with her.|$|E

2500|$|Both Mexican and U.S. {{authorities}} {{suspected that}} Kilroy's disappearance {{was some sort}} of foul play. They speculated that Kilroy could have been a victim of drug-related violence or of robbery-killing, but they were short <b>on</b> <b>leads</b> to make any firm conclusions. When Kilroy's friends reported the disappearance, Customs agents went with them to Matamoros to help retrace their steps. Texan officials contacted the U.S. consulate in Matamoros and asked investigators to carry out a search with Kilroy's description in Matamoros jails and hospitals. Investigators then hired a hypnotist {{to see if he could}} figure out some clues. Under hypnosis, Bradley stated that he saw a young Hispanic man wearing a blue plaid shirt and with a visible scar across his face talking to Kilroy before he disappeared. He recalled that the man walked up to Kilroy and told him, [...] "Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?" [...] though Bill said he was not sure if Kilroy responded back. However, none of the friends were able to precisely recall the exact moment or place where Kilroy disappeared. Investigators deduced by this story that Kilroy was kidnapped for robbery or ransom. The first option seemed the most likely because his abductors had not called for a payment. They believed that Kilroy's body was probably dumped in a remote location. Helicopters and terrain vehicles of the United States Border Patrol were called to look on the Rio Grande River, but his body was not found.|$|E
2500|$|South Park (aired on Comedy Central, {{a sister}} network to CBS at the time, and to MTV through Viacom) {{took aim at}} the {{hysteria}} in its eighth season premiere, [...] "Good Times with Weapons", on March 17 of that year when Eric Cartman sneaks across a stage in the nude and later blames the incident on a [...] "wardrobe malfunction". The townspeople are angered by Cartman's display, rather than feeling concern for a badly injured and disoriented character (Butters) who is also present on stage – {{a reference to the}} American culture's acceptance of violence while maintaining a taboo against nudity. During the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, comedian Dave Chappelle joked that his appearance on the VMAs was [...] "the biggest mistake [...] since [...] put Janet Jackson on the Super Bowl." [...] Family Guy also did an episode based around the [...] "wardrobe malfunction" [...] and the FCC's crackdown on [...] "indecent" [...] content, with one scene parodying the incident directly. The fourth season episode [...] "PTV" [...] involved actor David Hyde Pierce having a trouser malfunction at the Emmys. The FCC's sudden crackdown on indecent material on television leads an angered Peter Griffin to start his own network with looser content standards, PTV, on which later in the same episode, he presents a show called the [...] "Side Boob Hour" [...] which among other risque programs he puts <b>on</b> <b>leads</b> his objected wife Lois to call the FCC to crack down on PTV (leading to the implication of the FCC also regulating what his family says and does).|$|E
