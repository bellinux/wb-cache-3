5|$|Returning to Marseille, {{the members}} of the {{expedition}} had to spend a month in quarantine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> before being able to continue on towards Paris. The expedition led to a posthumously published extensive Monuments de l'Ã‰gypte et de la Nubie (1845).|$|E

5|$|There is {{an option}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> to include surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAM). But it is unclear as to which SAM will {{be integrated into the}} Kamorta-class corvette.

5|$|Tim Minear {{revealed}} {{the secret of}} Inara's syringe, {{as seen in the}} pilot episode; she is infected with a deadly disease. There would have been an episode where she is gang-raped by Reavers. Because she injected herself with the syringe, all of the Reavers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> die.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{functional}} conditions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> lead to <b>the</b> {{variety of}} interior design <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> having influences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> construction, functionality and aesthetical {{shape of the}} furniture. They are as follows: limited and restraint space, functional role and destination of each room; multifunctional spaces; ships movement: rolling, rocking, variation of level, rotations and vibrations; environment issues: high relative air- humidity, salt medium, random meteorological conditions; multifunctional furniture (for resting, office purpose, lunch purpose, games and fun); diversity of materials of <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> structure and of <b>the</b> furniture <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b> <b>The</b> paper presents the most important furniture structures, the adequate constructive presumed shapes (rounded corners and edge battens), materials, textures, colours, fittings and other. All these are useful for designers, engineers who build or up to date <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b> <b>The</b> paper shows {{the connection between the}} aspects related to furniture and the variation of the interior arrangements...|$|R

5|$|A Rebel ship is {{captured}} by a Star Destroyer. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> are the droids C-3PO (Quagmire), R2-D2 (Cleveland) and the rebel leader Princess Leia (Lois). While {{the ship is}} boarded by stormtroopers, Leia tries to send an MPEG to Obi-Wan Kenobi through R2, but encounters so many complications that R2 offers to deliver the message himself. Leia {{is captured}} by Darth Vader (Stewie) while R2 and 3PO flee to Tatooine in an escape pod, where they are captured by Jawas.|$|E
5|$|A {{mixture of}} 0.303-inch (7.7 mm) machine guns {{were used for}} close defence work, and could be fitted to {{pedestals}} at various points <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> primarily around the bridge and on the three searchlight platforms (one {{either side of the}} forward funnel, the third raised above the aft superstructure). At launch, Sydney carried fourteen Lewis machine guns and two Vickers machine guns, but by the start of World War II, the Lewis guns had been reduced to nine, and the Vickers guns removed completely.|$|E
5|$|A {{small fire}} {{broke out in the}} gas turbine engine room (located high <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> behind the Queen Mary 2 sign) on the evening of 5 October 2011. The fire was started in one of the ship's gas turbines. No {{injuries}} were reported, and crew on board the ship managed to safely extinguish the fire.|$|E

5|$|Alice Braga as Anna Montez: A {{survivor}} from Brazil, {{she spent}} days harbored on a Red Cross ship in Philadelphia. After {{the city was}} overrun, she stayed with Ethan and several other survivors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> but eventually, only Ethan and she survived since they were immune {{and the others were}} either infected or killed. She followed Neville's broadcasts to track him.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. It {{is possible that}} the figures concerning the number of slaves killed, the amount of water that remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> and the distance beyond Jamaica that Zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kirk, {{played by}} John Belushi, orders {{the ship to}} outrun the strange craft. Unable to do so, he orders phasers and photon torpedoes to destroy the craft. Unfortunately, all of the ship's {{equipment}} fails for no reason and the Enterprises systems break down. Suddenly, Dr. Leonard McCoy, played by Dan Aykroyd, runs onto the bridge saying that the aliens are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> He says they did not beam aboard, but merely walked {{out from behind the}} curtains.|$|E

The bees are depicted on many structures in Manchester such as lampposts and bollards.|$|R
500|$|Hiei {{was fitted}} with three [...] Krupp rifled breech-loading (RBL) guns and six RBL [...] Krupp guns. All of the 172-millimeter guns were {{positioned}} as chase guns, two forward and one aft. The 152-millimeter guns were mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> broadside. <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> also carried two short [...] guns for use ashore or mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> boats.|$|R
5|$|Conversion {{planning}} {{began in}} May 1942, {{and had the}} conversion been finished, {{she would have been}} the largest German aircraft carrier, longer even than the purpose-built s. The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious instability and structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No work was done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport following the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Dave Lister, {{played by}} Craig Charles, is a genial Liverpudlian and {{self-described}} bum. He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew members <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> before the accident. He has a long-standing desire {{to return to}} Earth and start a farm and/or diner on Fiji (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race. He likes Indian food, especially chicken vindaloo, which is a recurring theme in the series.|$|E
5|$|During the All Black tour of Australia, in {{the game}} against Metropolitan Union in Sydney on 5 August 1914, the news was posted on the {{scoreboard}} that the British Empire â€“ and therefore New Zealand and Australia â€“ had declared war. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> home, the players collectively decided to volunteer for military service. Three of them were killed, including Downing at Gallipoli, Bobby Black at the Somme and Jim McNeece at Messines.|$|E
