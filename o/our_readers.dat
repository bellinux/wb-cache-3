500|$|The [...] "Naruto Nation" [...] campaign, a plan {{to release}} three volumes each month {{in the last four}} months of 2007, was {{announced}} by Viz Media shortly before the release of the fourteenth volume. Cammie Allen, Viz Media's product manager, commented that, [...] "Our main reason [...] was to catch up to the Japanese release schedule to give <b>our</b> <b>readers</b> a similar experience to that of <b>our</b> <b>readers</b> in Japan." [...] As such, the English serialization of Part II premiered on December 4, 2007, in Shonen Jump.|$|E
500|$|In the 2000s, Blancornelas {{wanted to}} remove bylines from Zetas most {{dangerous}} stories, but was persuaded not to by reporter Francisco Ortiz, who wished his {{to continue to}} run atop his stories on organized crime. In 2005, Ortiz {{was shot to death}} in front of his children, and Blancornelas began his no-byline policy. In the days after Ortiz's death, he stated, [...] "I feel remorse for having created Zeta. After losing three colleagues, I believe the price has been too high. I would have liked to retire a long time ago ... I cannot allow drug traffickers to think {{that they were able to}} crush Zeta's spirit, and <b>our</b> <b>readers</b> to believe that we are afraid." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to serialisation, an {{announcement}} {{ran in the}} 4 January 1929 edition of , proclaiming, [...] "e are always eager to satisfy <b>our</b> <b>readers</b> and keep them {{up to date on}} foreign affairs. We have therefore sent Tintin, one of our top reporters, to Soviet Russia." [...] The illusion of Tintin as a real reporter for the paper, and not a fictional character, was emphasised by the claim that the comic strip was not a series of drawings, but composed of photographs taken of Tintin's adventure. Biographer Benoît Peeters thought this a private joke between staff at alluding to the fact that Hergé had originally been employed as a reporter-photographer, a job that he never fulfilled. Literary critic Tom McCarthy later compared this approach to that of 18th-century European literature, which often presented fictional narratives as non-fiction.|$|E
500|$|Ernest Bernhard-Kabisch {{pointed out}} that [...] "Few readers have been as {{enthusiastic}} about it as Cardinal Newman who considered it the most 'morally sublime' of English poems. But the young Shelley reckoned it his favorite poem, and both he and Keats followed its lead in some of their verse narratives." [...] An anonymous review in the September 1801 British Critic claimed, [...] "A more complete monument of vile and depraved taste no man ever raised [...] He has, therefore, given a rhapsody of Twelve Books {{in a sort of}} irregular lyric, so unlike verse or sense, that if it were worth while to present <b>our</b> <b>readers</b> with a tissue of so coarse a texture, we could fill whole pages with specimens of its absurdity. We will have mercy, and give only a single example, which may be taken at random, for no part seems to be better than the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|The paper {{maintains}} a strict profanity policy. A 2007 {{review of a}} concert by punk band Fucked Up, for example, completely avoided mention of the group's name. However, the Times has on occasion published unfiltered video content that includes profanity and slurs where it has determined that such video has news value. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the Times did print the words [...] "fuck" [...] and [...] "pussy," [...] among others, when reporting on the vulgar statements made by Donald Trump in a 2005 recording. Times politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: [...] "It's a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length," [...] ultimately deciding to publish it because of its news value and because [...] "o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given {{that we would be}} running a video that showed <b>our</b> <b>readers</b> exactly what was said." ...|$|E

Our informant does not say whether Kate Morgan and her sister Nelly supped with them--but we rather think they did.|$|R
500|$|Following {{this was}} an {{anonymous}} review for the 1796 Analytical Review that stated, [...] "we learn with astonishment, that Joan of Arc, in its first form, in twelve books, was [...] finished in six weeks [...] We thought it right to mention a fact on which the author, by detailing it {{in the beginning of}} his preface, appears to lay some stress; but we wish entirely to forget it in our examination of the poem, and request <b>our</b> <b>readers</b> to do the same. The story, upon which this poem is founded, {{is one of the most}} interesting in the history of France, and is, in several respects, happily adapted to epic representation." [...] The review concluded: [...] "The general result of the impression which the perusal of this poem has made upon our minds is this: that, although the poem has some redundancies, which the chastised taste of maturer years would have struck out; though a manifest incongruity runs through the piece, in ascribing to characters of the fifteenth century the politics and metaphysics of an enlightened philosopher of the eighteenth; and though allegorical personages [...] but ill supply the place of that grand machinery [...] which have obtained the glorious meed of immortality; we, nevertheless, admire, the noble spirit of freedom, which is evidently the poet's inspiring muse".|$|E
500|$|Later in 1802, Francis Jeffrey, {{editor of}} the Edinburgh Review, {{submitted}} a review on Thalaba. In the October 1802 edition, he claimed that Southey [...] "belongs to a sect of poets, that has established itself in this country within these ten or twelve years, and is looked upon, we believe, {{as one of its}} chief champions and apostles... As Mr Southey is the first author, of this persuasion, that has yet been brought before us for judgment, we cannot discharge our inquisitorial office conscientiously, without premising a few words upon the nature and tendency of the tenets he has helped to promulgate. The disciples of this school boast much of its originality." [...] This led to a discussion of Southey's flaws: [...] "Originality, however, we are persuaded, is rare than mere alteration... That our new poets have abandoned the old models, may certainly be admitted; but {{we have not been able}} to discover that they have yet created any model of their own." [...] He continued to discuss the flaws of the British Romantic poets before returning to Thalaba when he argued, [...] "The subject of this poem is almost as ill chosen as the diction; and the conduct of the fable as disorderly as the versification... From this little sketch of the story, <b>our</b> <b>readers</b> will easily perceive, that it consists altogether of the most wild and extravagant fictions, and openly sets nature and probability at defiance. In its action it is not an imitation of anything; and excludes all rational criticism, as to the choice and succession of its incidents." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1809, the antiquary Richard Warner was {{appointed}} rector of the parish.

We can only answer, {{that he is the}} Rector of Great Chalfield, Wilts".|$|E

2500|$|Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper wrote [...] "Wuthering Heights is {{a strange}} sort of book,—baffling all regular criticism; yet, it is {{impossible}} to begin and not finish it; and quite as impossible to lay it aside afterwards and say nothing about. In Wuthering Heights the reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love– even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself. Yet, towards the close of the story occurs the following pretty, soft picture, which comes like the rainbow after a storm... We strongly recommend all <b>our</b> <b>readers</b> who love novelty to get this story, for we can promise them that they never have read anything like it before. It is very puzzling and very interesting, and if we had space we would willingly devote a little more time to the analysis of this remarkable story, but we must leave it to <b>our</b> <b>readers</b> to decide what sort of book it is." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Times Style Guide begins, [...] "The Times {{should keep}} {{abreast of the}} trend in the UK to move {{gradually}} towards all-metric use, but given the wide age range and geographical distribution of <b>our</b> <b>readers,</b> some continuing use of imperial measurements is necessary." [...] The Times prefers metric units in most circumstances but it prefers Imperial weights and measures for personal heights and weights.

2500|$|The {{first issue}} of the Review {{appeared}} dated July 1900 and featured contributions from William Thurston Brown, English social democrat Henry Hyndman, AF of L trade union activist Max S.
