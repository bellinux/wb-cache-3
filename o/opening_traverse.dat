40|$|Competition with {{a single}} quadrotor helicopter. The vehicle has been {{designed}} to autonomously locate and enter a one square meter <b>opening,</b> <b>traverse</b> a series of obstacles in search of a control panel, and transmit live video of the target gauge to an operator control unit. To achieve the desired level of autonomy, a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithm and an Extended Kalman Filter provide a state estimate for a Fuzzy Logic flight controller. Communications between an onboard embedded computer and an operator control unit meet Level 2 JAUS compliance. ...|$|E

5000|$|A Scottish {{theatrical}} renaissance {{has been}} perceived by Ian Brown as occurring between the <b>opening</b> of the <b>Traverse</b> Theatre in Edinburgh in 1963 and {{the foundation of}} the Scottish Society of Playwrights in 1973. The Theatres Act 1968 abolished the system of censorship of the stage by the Lord Chamberlain that had existed in Great Britain since 1737. This allowed much greater artistic freedom, but local authorities in Scotland still retained the ability to prosecute [...] "obscene performances" [...] under local by-laws and statutes.|$|R
40|$|Oran {{is one of}} the Algerian cities {{marked by}} Spanish occupations where several fortifications were realized, that counted on several forts and gates, of which some could survive {{in the face of the}} change of power, and the natural events. Among them, we find the Canastel gate, {{precisely}} in SIDI EL HOUARI, which represents the city historic center, located in the north-west, between the flank of MURDJADJO, and the sea. The earthquake and the Turkish and French occupations caused destructions and transformations on these fortifications. A deep urban restructuring was carried out by integrating this gate into a residential building to mark an <b>opening</b> that <b>traverses</b> it, vulgarizing it, marking its space appropriation, and illustrating its power and autocracy. Today, the change of control is not being more beneficial to the gate. Abandoned, the heterogeneous structure (building and gate) presents important signs of degradation, and threat of demolition. In addition, it is totally unknown in society, and is completely devalued because of the socio-economic, legal, and cultural contexts that the city lives, and that materialize in the form of several aggressions leaving it fight to survive in an environment that is aimed at demolishing...|$|R
40|$|In the retinal {{binding pocket}} of rhodopsin, a Schiff base links the retinal ligand covalently to the Lys 296 side chain. Light {{transforms}} the inverse agonist 11 -cis-retinal into the agonist all-trans-retinal, {{leading to the}} active Meta II state. Crystal structures of Meta II and the active conformation of the opsin apoprotein revealed two openings of the 7 -transmembrane (TM) bundle towards the hydrophobic core of the membrane, one between TM 1 /TM 7 and one between TM 5 /TM 6, respectively. Computational analysis revealed a putative ligand channel connecting the <b>openings</b> and <b>traversing</b> the binding pocket. Identified constrictions within the channel motivated this study of 35 rhodopsin mutants in which single amino acids lining the channel were replaced. 11 -cis-retinal uptake and all-trans-retinal release were measured using UV/visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. Most mutations slow or accelerate both uptake and release, often with opposite effects. Mutations closer to the Lys 296 active site show larger effects. The nucleophile hydroxylamine accelerates retinal release 80 Â times but the action profile of the mutants remains very similar. The data show that the mutations do not probe local channel permeability but rather affect global protein dynamics, with the focal point in the ligand pocket. We propose a model for retinal/receptor interaction in which the active receptor conformation sets the open state of the channel for 11 -cis-retinal and all-trans-retinal, with positioning of the ligand at the active site as the kinetic bottleneck. Although other G protein-coupled receptors lack the covalent link to the protein, the access of ligands to their binding pocket may follow similar schemes...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the contact interface and the propagation of compression waves inside a single wave rotor passage gradually <b>opening</b> to and <b>traversing</b> an inlet port is studied numerically using an inviscid formulation of the governing equations. Insights into {{the response of the}} interface and kinematics of the flow field to various opening times are given. Since the opening time is inversely proportional to the rotational speed of the rotor, the effects of passage rotation such as centripetal and Coriolis accelerations are intrinsically coupled to the gradual opening process. Certain three-dimensional features associated with the gradual opening process as a result of centripetal and Coriolis accelerations are illustrated. For the range of opening times or rotational speeds considered, a portion of the interface behaves like a vortex sheet that can degenerate into a complex interfacial structure. The vortices produced along the interface can serve as a stirring mechanism to promote local mixing. Coriolis and centripetal accelerations can introduce three dimensional effects such as interfacial distortions in meridional planes and spanwise migration of fluid elements...|$|R
40|$|High field {{strength}} elements (HFSE) are geologically and economically important. These elements were {{once thought to}} be immobile during metasomatic processes, however, a growing body of empirical evidence indicates that HFSE can be mobilized under certain conditions. Despite this evidence, {{little is known about the}} factors controlling solubility, transport and deposition of HFSE by aqueous fluids, apart from some theoretical estimates and rare experimental studies. Therefore, the study of natural systems (e. g., HFSE ore deposits) provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate HFSE mobility by aqueous fluids. Five localities where evidence of hydrothermal transport of HFSE has been previously documented were included in this study: Gallinas Mountains, New Mexico; South Platte, Colorado; Rock Canyon Creek, British Columbia; St. Lawrence, Newfoundland; and Strange Lake, Quebec/Labrador. Minerals and, in the case of South Platte, fluid inclusions from these localities were analyzed using petrography and laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) to evaluate the source of the HFSE and the hydrothermal fluids responsible for HFSE transport, and factors controlling HFSE and gangue mineral (e. g., fluorite, quartz) precipitation. Analysis of some of the important gangue minerals, which are also the primary host of fluid inclusions in many of these deposits (e. g., fluorite), is difficult using 266 nm Nd:YAG-based LA-ICPMS. Furthermore, complex mineral intergrowths and the desire to quantify the chemical composition of unknown minerals required the development of analytical and data reduction protocols for LA-ICPMS. Methods for conducting <b>traversed</b> <b>opening</b> of fluid inclusions, removing the host mineral contribution to fluid inclusion signals by calculating count rate ratios, and quantifying the composition of minerals without using an internal standard are presented. In general, hydrothermal enrichment of HFSE in these deposits appears to have resulted from interaction of an HFSE- and F-bearing magmatic fluid with another, Ca-bearing fluid or with Ca-bearing wall rocks or preexisting minerals. In most cases, HFSE appear to be derived locally, within the associated igneous intrusion...|$|R
