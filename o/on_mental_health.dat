5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} an individual to control their consumption.

Alcoholism can have adverse effects <b>on</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide.

40|$|Objective: Though sparse in {{previous}} years, research <b>on</b> the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of Black men has recently experienced a gradual increase {{in social work}} journals. This article systematically organizes and critically examines peer-reviewed, social work evidence <b>on</b> the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of Black men. Methods: Twenty-two peer-reviewed articles from social work journals were examined based on their contribution to social work research and practice <b>on</b> the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> of Black men. Results: The social work evidence <b>on</b> Black men’s <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> can be grouped into one of four categories: psychosocial factors; <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care {{and the role of}} clinicians; fatherhood; and sexual orientation, HIV status, and sexual practices.

5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending <b>on</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E

Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of children who had been placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect; the Select Committee <b>on</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Health,</b> which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature <b>on</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
