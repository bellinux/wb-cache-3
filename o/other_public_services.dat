25|$|In 2000, the Romanian Parliament {{enacted a}} law that {{explicitly}} outlawed {{discrimination on the basis}} of sexual orientation in a variety of fields, including employment, the provision of and access to goods and services, housing, education, health care, audiovisual programming, the justice system, <b>other</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> and social security. The law, which is among the most comprehensive in the European Union, has been successfully tested by the National Council for Combating Discrimination (CNCD), Romania's equality body, which has fined a number of individuals and firms for discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. An example of this was when TAROM, the national air carrier, was fined for refusing to allow same-sex partners to take advantage of its discounts for couples on Valentine's Day 2005. Aside from imposing a fine, the CNCD obliged TAROM to rectify the situation.|$|E
25|$|During this time, the {{downtown}} district was consolidated into a commercial, financial and administrative center, {{with the establishment}} of various portals and locales around Ahumada Street and a Civic District in the immediate surroundings of the Palace of La Moneda. The latter project involved the construction of various modernist buildings for the establishment of the offices of ministries and <b>other</b> <b>public</b> <b>services,</b> as well as commencing the construction of medium-rise buildings. On the other hand, the traditional inhabitants of the center began to migrate out of the city to more rural areas like Providencia and Ñuñoa, which hosted the oligarchy and the European immigrant professionals, and San Miguel for middle-class families. Furthermore, in the periphery villas were built various partners from various organizations of the time. Modernity expanded in the city, with the appearance of the first theaters, the extension of the telephone network and the opening of the Airport Los Cerrillos in 1928, among other advances.|$|E

500|$|Supporters of Atatürk's {{reforms are}} called Kemalists, as {{distinguished}} from Islamists, representing the two diverging views regarding {{the role of}} religion in legislation, education and public life. The Kemalist view supports a form of democracy with a laicist constitution and Westernised secular lifestyle, while maintaining the necessity of state intervention in the economy, education and <b>other</b> <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> Since the 1980s, issues such as income inequality and class distinction have given rise to Islamic populism, a movement that supports a larger role for religion in government policies, and in theory supports obligation to authority, communal solidarity and social justice; though what that entails in practice is often contested. Turkey under Tayyip Erdoğan and the AKP has been described as becoming increasingly authoritarian. Prior to the constitutional referendum in 2017 the Council of Europe saw Turkey drifting towards an autocracy, warning of a [...] "dramatic regression of its democratic order".|$|E
2500|$|To save on {{the cost}} of {{installing}} sewer systems and <b>other</b> <b>public</b> <b>services,</b> the design of {{much of the rest of}} the city reverted to the grid plan after Hurricane Gilbert in 1988. [...] The newest upper-middle-class residential areas reflect the original plan, but are much less intimate. Less expensive developments are composed almost entirely of identical one- or two-story small row-houses, sometimes built around interior plazas or 4 story apartment blocks. Until recently, most mainland buildings were four stories or shorter; since 2005, there has been an influx of condominium and luxury retail and office space concentrated along Ave. Bonampak.|$|E

2500|$|The modern word [...] "immunity" [...] {{derives from}} the Latin immunis, meaning {{exemption}} from military service, tax payments or <b>other</b> <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> The first written descriptions {{of the concept of}} immunity may have been made by the Athenian Thucydides who, in 430 BC, described that when the plague hit Athens: [...] "the sick and the dying were tended by the pitying care of those who had recovered, because they knew the course of the disease and were themselves free from apprehensions. For no one was ever attacked a second time, or not with a fatal result". The term [...] "immunes", is also found in the epic poem [...] "Pharsalia" [...] written around 60 B.C. by the poet Marcus Annaeus Lucanus to describe a North African tribe's resistance to snake venom.|$|E

The German commander of Paris, Dietrich von Choltitz, ignored an order from Adolf Hitler to destroy the monuments of the city and surrendered it on 25 August. General de Gaulle arrived on 26 August and led a massive parade down the Champs Élysées, all the way to Notre-Dame for a Te Deum ceremony. On 29 August, the US Army's entire 28th Infantry Division, which had assembled in the Bois de Boulogne the previous night, paraded 24-abreast up the Avenue Hoche to the Arc de Triomphe, then down the Champs Élysées. The division, men and vehicles, marched through Paris [...] "on its way to assigned attack positions northeast of the French capital." ...|$|E

60|$|It appears a {{point of}} some mystery to the present writer that Bernard Shaw should have been so long unrecognised and almost in beggary.

Yet it is quite certain that he almost starved in London for many years, writing occasional columns for an advertisement or words for a picture. And it is equally certain (it is proved by twenty anecdotes, but no one who knows Shaw needs any anecdotes to prove it) that in those days of desperation he again and again threw up chances and flung back good bargains which did not suit his unique and erratic sense of honour.
