5|$|As {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Saint</b> Petersburg music scene, Prokofiev {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} musical rebel, while getting praise for his original compositions, which he performed himself on the piano. In 1909, he graduated from his class in composition with unimpressive marks. He continued at the Conservatory, studying piano under Anna Yesipova and continuing his conducting lessons under Tcherepnin.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{authority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> is, in a sense, presupposed by the tradition, and yet, formulating this presupposition {{proves to}} be awkward. This dissertation is an exploration into the nature, the grounding and <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> with reference to <b>the</b> theology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> in <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Hans urs von Balthasar. My argument is that, in his use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> Balthasar does not merely interpret <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> {{as a resource for}} theologians and for the Magisterium. For Balthasar, theology and the Magisterium are there to serve <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> since <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> are <b>the</b> real witnesses whose testimony requires dynamic paraphrase and vigorous rendition. My argument will be that Balthasar wants to avoid <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> multiple teaching offices, but that – while avoiding <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> multiple offices – also attributes to <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> an authority that is analogical to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magisterium. Balthasar uses <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> not only to teach other theologians but also to teach the official Magisterium, thus handling <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> as if they were themselves a Magisterium. Four dimensions – the existential, the epistemological, the pneumatological and the ecclesiological – are identified and used to elucidate the nature, the grounding and <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saints.</b> It will be argued that authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> is grounded within each one of these dimensions and that these are the dimensions within which <b>the</b> <b>saints</b> function authoritatively. I will defend my own construal of Balthasar, argue for <b>the</b> credibility <b>of</b> Balthasar’s defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> as well as, locate and criticise some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contradictions that are found in Balthasar in this regard, and identify some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> Balthasar’s position concerning <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saints,</b> for his own theology, for theology in general, and for the Church...|$|R

5|$|As {{the lines}} near Quebec City, the {{northern}} power line rejoins {{the other two}} 735kV power lines. The three lines, paralleled by another 735kV power line some distance to the north, span over the Saint Lawrence River to the South Shore region, where the lines form loops encompassing part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Saint</b> Lawrence River and the south shore. The loops are also connected to the ring of 735kV power lines around Montreal and power lines running south from James Bay.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{captured}} Acadia from France in Queen Anne's War (1702–1713), but the Treaty of Utrecht left Cape Breton Island in French hands, and did {{not clearly}} demarcate a boundary between New France and the British colonies on the Atlantic coast. To protect the crucial passageway <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Saint</b> Lawrence River {{into the heart of}} New France, France built a strong fortress at Louisbourg on the Atlantic coast of Cape Breton Island.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Saint</b> Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up teaching in the Conservatory. He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with tremendous vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having {{one of his own}} {{in the midst of the}} enemy camp.|$|E

5|$|The Dalits {{strongly}} believe in his piety and portray Brahmins as {{the root cause}} of all the misery of the Nayanar. Nandanar fits in the Dalit narrative that proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. They say that Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'.

5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir.

After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saint,</b> so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E
5|$|After the six 735kV wires {{split up}} {{into two groups}} of three power lines each, the HVDC line follows the eastern group, and the western set diverges away. The line remains {{overhead}} until it reaches the north shore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Saint</b> Lawrence River near Grondines, where the 450kV HVDC line descends into an underwater tunnel traversing the river. The power line surfaces on the south shore near Lotbinière substation. After the river crossing, the line enters into the Nicolet terminal near Sainte-Eulalie, northeast of Drummondville. South of the terminal, the line heads south and after a relatively short distance, it enters the Des Cantons close to Sherbrooke.|$|E
