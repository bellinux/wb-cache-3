The hospital ranked #1 in eight fields and #2 in three others.

5|$|Care may be {{provided}} in a patient's {{home or in}} a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding hospice, with level <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs. The four primary levels of care provided by hospice are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient, and respite care. Patients undergoing hospice treatment may be discharged {{for a number of}} reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to hospice care as their circumstances change. Providers are required by Medicare to provide to patients notice of pending discharge, which they may appeal.|$|E
5|$|This {{concentration}} is offered {{in partnership with}} Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Pastoral Care Department (RWJUH). Students in the D.Min. concentration in Pastoral Care & Counseling / Pastoral Theology will benefit from advanced theological study and professional work specifically designed for those who desire to serve as chaplains, pastoral care specialists, pastoral counselors or congregational pastors. The program emphasizes the helping relationship, theological understandings of pastoral care, the multicultural contexts of pastoral care, psychotherapeutic theories and strategies for change, and various forms of pastoral care and counseling. A race, class, and gender analysis will be appropriated to the practice <b>of</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> counseling. Questions regarding the program may be directed to Danielle Hunter, Director, D. Min. Concentration in Pastoral Care and Counseling.|$|E

The review suggests that conceptualizations <b>of</b> cultural <b>care</b> <b>and</b> cultural competence have made noted progress {{in the past few}} decades both in quantitative and qualitative terms.

30|$|To {{achieve the}} goals <b>of</b> child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> {{education}} presented in Chapter I (General Provisions), day nurseries should devise ‘child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education process’, a fundamental element for child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> detailed ‘teaching plans’. The ‘child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education process’ and ‘teaching plans (plans <b>of</b> child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education)’ should contain flexible, evolutionary, and consistent considerations for children {{so that they}} can live a stable life and conduct meaningful activities while being under the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> day nurseries. In addition, day nurseries should <b>care</b> <b>and</b> educate children based on the ‘plans <b>of</b> child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education’ and make efforts to evaluate and improve the contents <b>of</b> child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education. They should also promote quality childcare system and fulfill their social obligation (Preface of Chapter IV).|$|R
30|$|The plans, however, {{have two}} problems, {{explained}} as follows. The first problem concerns the inherent {{characteristics of the}} plans <b>of</b> child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education. They are not absolute but hypothetic plans. The plans are devised not by a specific individual but {{by a group of}} nursery teachers who are equally involved in the formation, revision, and evaluation of the plans. This process allows child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education practices to develop more creatively. On the other hand, self-evaluation is personal and subjective, and it is not powerful enough to start massive changes desired in the plans <b>of</b> child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education. Furthermore, self-evaluation stifles creativity of the practices <b>of</b> child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education by exaggerating the plans <b>of</b> child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education as faultless, and prevents the plans from becoming scientifically valid through the practices <b>of</b> child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education.|$|R
