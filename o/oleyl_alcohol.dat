5000|$|Fatty {{alcohols}} (or long-chain alcohols) {{are usually}} high-molecular-weight, straight-chain primary alcohols, {{but can also}} range from as few as 4-6 carbons {{to as many as}} 22-26, derived from natural fats and oils. The precise chain length varies with the source. Some commercially important fatty alcohols are lauryl, stearyl, and <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohols.</b> They are colourless oily liquids (for smaller carbon numbers) or waxy solids, although impure samples may appear yellow. Fatty alcohols usually have an even number of carbon atoms and a single alcohol group (-OH) attached to the terminal carbon. Some are unsaturated and some are branched. They are widely used in industry. As with fatty acids, they are often referred to generically by the number of carbon atoms in the molecule, such as [...] "a C12 alcohol", that is an alcohol having 12 carbons, for example dodecanol.|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} the inhibitory activity of long-chain alcohols on the growth of Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Peak inhibition was recorded with saturated primary alcohols (64 microM) varying in chain length from 16 to 19 carbon atoms. The unsaturated <b>alcohols</b> (<b>oleyl,</b> linoleyl, and linolenyl) and the secondary alcohol (pentadecan- 2 -ol), when employed in the same test conditions, were considerably less effective growth inhibitors than the primary saturated alcohols. Stearic and palmitic acids were also ineffective as growth inhibitors of M. pneumoniae and M. gallisepticum at a 128 microM concentration. Because these antimycoplasma agents are fatty alcohols and cholesterol {{is known to be}} required for the growth of some mycoplasmas, additional cholesterol was added in an attempt to reverse the inhibition observed with these agents. Cholesterol at a 128 microM concentration did not significantly relieve the growth inhibition observed with stearyl alcohol at a 48 microM concentration. Mammalian cell cultures were found to be significantly more resistant to the effects of these inhibitory alcohols than were the mycoplasmas. Electron micrographs showed that inclusion of stearyl alcohol in the culture medium produced changes in the cellular morphology of the treated mycoplasmas...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of the operating conditions on the selectivity and activity of Ru-Sn-B/Al 2 O 3 catalysts for the hydrogenation of oleic acid to <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was studied. It {{was found that the}} Ru-Sn-B/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is selective to <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> while Ru or Ru-B/Al 2 O 3 catalysts are not selective to produce <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The electronic and catalytic properties of Ru are modified by the strong interaction between Sn and B. The incorporation of Sn leads to catalysts capable of producing <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The experiments of oleic acid hydrogenation showed that an increase in reaction temperature leads to an increase in activity while the selectivity to <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> goes through a maximum. This is because the reactions of hydrogenation of C=C double bond have lower activation energies than hydrogenolytic reactions. The increase in operating pressure has a positive effect on conversion and a more important effect on selectivity.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of employing methylated used cooking oil (COME) as extractant to reduce end-product inhibition {{and to enhance}} solvent productivity in acetone-butanolethanol (ABE) fermentation was evaluated using <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> as the standard butanol extractant. Fermentation was carried out at an initial glucose concentration of 40 g/l using TYA medium and shochu distillery waste as fermentation substrate. In the case of TYA medium, butanol production without solvent extractant ceased after 47 h cultivation at a concentration of 9. 8 g/l. The extractant coefficient of <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> to butanol was {{more than three times}} that of COME to butanol. However, using COME as extractant, total butanol reached 12. 6 g/l. Using <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> as extractant, on the other hand, total butanol was 11. 9 g/l. In the case of shochu distillery waste, butanol production without solvent extractant ceased after 50 h cultivation at a concentration of 12. 5 g/l. The extractant coefficient of COME to butanol decreased; that of COME was 0. 8 and that of <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was 1. 0. Though butanol that extracted using COME as extractant was less than using <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> total butanol reached 16. 4 g/l and was similar to that using <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> as extractant. This fact suggests that COME as extractant is more effective for the reduction of end-product inhibition. 前報で明らかにしたようにClostridium saccharoperdutylacetonicum N 1 - 4 の発酵原料として, 焼酎蒸留廃液は使用可能であった. そこで, この培養の生産性を向上させる目的で, 発酵生産物ブタノールによる阻害を軽減するために抽出剤による抽出発酵を検討した. 家庭から排出される食用廃油をメチルエステル化（COME）して発行試験を行った. ブタノールの抽出剤としてオレイルアルコールをコントロールとした. 発酵原料として, イモ焼酎蒸留廃液を, 標準培地としてTYAを用いた. その結果, オレイルアルコールと比較して, 食用廃油メチルエステル（COME）を用いた場合, 高いブタノール生産速度, ブタノール収率を得た...|$|E

The catalyst with the highest activity and selectivity towards <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is Ru(1 %) -Sn(2 %) -B/Al 2 O 3. At a low Sn loading (0. 5 %) the catalyst has high activity for hydrogenation of the carbonyl group and the carbon-carbon double bond. As a consequence stearyl alcohol is produced with high yield. At a high Sn content (4 %) the catalyst has lower selectivity to <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> due to its low capacity for hydrogenating the carbonyl group.

40|$|Farnesol (FOH) {{inhibits}} the CDP-choline pathway for PtdCho (phosphatidylcholine) synthesis, {{an activity}} that is involved in subsequent induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, CCTα (CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α), is rapidly activated, cleaved by caspases and exported from the nucleus during FOH-induced apoptosis. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine how CCTα activity and PtdCho synthesis contributed to induction of apoptosis by FOH and <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Contrary to previous reports, we show that the initial effect of FOH and <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was a rapid (10 – 30  min) and transient activation of PtdCho synthesis. During this period, the mass of DAG (diacylglycerol) decreased by 40 %, indicating that subsequent CDP-choline accumulation and inhibition of PtdCho synthesis could be due to substrate depletion. At later time points (> 1  h), FOH and <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> promoted caspase cleavage and nuclear export of CCTα, which was prevented by treatment with oleate or DiC 8 (dioctanoylglycerol). Protection from FOH-induced apoptosis required CCTα activity and PtdCho synthesis since (i) DiC 8 and oleate restored PtdCho synthesis, but not endogenous DAG levels, and (ii) partial resistance was conferred by stable overexpression of CCTα and increased PtdCho synthesis in CCTα-deficient MT 58 cells. These results show that DAG depletion by FOH or <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> could be involved in inhibition of PtdCho synthesis. However, decreased DAG was not sufficient to induce apoptosis provided nuclear CCTα and PtdCho syntheses were sustained...|$|E

In the presence of the slick, the suppression of the Raman backscatter at 381 nm and of two spectral bands indicative of water column fluorescent organic material at 414 and 482 nm were observed. This effect is explained by two possible mechanisms giving rise to a modification of the transmission or coupling of the laser beam into the water column: (1) the damping of capillary and short gravity water waves by the <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> slick, and (2) the modification of the uppermost water layer by the <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> film.

Decanol appeared to inhibit butanol formation by C. acetobutylicum when present in a mixed extractant that also contained <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> However, maintenance of the pH at 4. 5 alleviated the inhibition of butanol production and the consumption of butyrate during solventogenesis.

It aims at uncovering some solvent-solutes interactions and providing global mechanisms to better understand and design the reactive liquid-liquid extraction of 3 -HP in a biotechnological process. Eleven solvents of similar molecular sizes and several chemical types (alcohols, esters and alkanes) were investigated to understand their role on the extraction ability.

A temperature-controllable water bath (MP- 10, Shanghai Permanent Science and Technology, Co., Shanghai, China) was used to circulate hot water into the coil pipes settled inside the fermentor to maintain broth temperature at 37 °C. The fermentation medium loading volume ranged from 1.8 to 2.5  L, and equivalent volume of <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was added to ensure a 1 : 1 oil/broth volumetric ratio. N 2 was sparged into the extractant reservoir for 10  min to remove residual oxygen. 10 % (v/v) inoculum was transferred into the fermentor and then N 2 was also sparged into broth for 10  min. The oxygen-free <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was poured into the fermentor using a peristaltic pump after inoculation. The initial pressure inside the fermentor was controlled at about 0.02  MPa (N 2) to strictly maintain the anaerobic condition. The pressure gradually increased since fermentation started and self-generated gas began to evolve. The pressure was then controlled in a range of 0.030 to 0.055  MPa throughout fermentation. Agitation was occasionally adopted for a short time (5  min, 400  rpm) to promote butanol diffusion from aqueous phase into extractant phase.|$|E
40|$|Uniform and {{extremely}} small-sized iron oxide nanoparticles (ESIONs) of < 4 nm were synthesized via the thermal decomposition of iron-oleate {{complex in the}} presence of <b>oleyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> <b>Oleyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> lowered the reaction temperature by reducing iron-oleate complex, resulting in the production of small-sized nanoparticles. XRD pattern of 3 nm-sized nanoparticles revealed maghemite crystal structure. These nanoparticles exhibited very low magnetization derived from the spin-canting effect. The hydrophobic nanoparticles can be easily transformed to water-dispersible and biocompatible nanoparticles by capping with the poly(ethylene glycol) -derivatized phosphine oxide (PO-PEG) ligands. Toxic response was not observed with Fe concentration up to 100 μg/mL in MTT cell proliferation assay of POPEG-capped 3 nm-sized iron oxide nanoparticles. The 3 nm-sized nanoparticles exhibited a high r 1 relaxivity of 4. 78 mM - 1 s - 1 and low r 2 /r 1 ratio of 6. 12, demonstrating that ESIONs can be efficient T 1 contrast agents. The high r 1 relaxivities of ESIONs {{can be attributed to the}} large number of surface Fe 3 + ions with 5 unpaired valence electrons. In the in vivo T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ESIONs showed longer circulation time than the clinically used gadolinium complex-based contrast agent, enabling high-resolution imaging. High-resolution blood pool MR imaging using ESIONs enabled clear observation of various blood vessels with sizes down to 0. 2 mm. These results demonstrate the potential of ESIONs as T 1 MRI contrast agents in clinical settings. &# 169; 2011 American Chemical Society. close 19417917...|$|E
