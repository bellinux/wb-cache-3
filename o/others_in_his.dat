5|$|As well as {{his private}} studies, Holmboe {{attended}} lectures given by Søren Rasmusen. In 1815 he {{was appointed to the}} position of scientific assistant under Christopher Hansteen, a lecturer at the university, and delivered some lectures himself. In early 1818, Holmboe became a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School, a position that had become vacant in 1817. The school principal, Jacob Rosted, had invited Holmboe's brother, Christopher Andreas, who had also studied mathematics, to take up the position, but he had decided instead to concentrate on philology; Christopher went on to research the Sanskrit language among <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> teaching, Holmboe drew inspiration from Joseph-Louis Lagrange.|$|E
5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin also {{collaborated with}} Bartholomew Iscanus on a Liber penitentialis, which is jointly {{ascribed}} {{to both of}} them in a Lambeth Palace manuscript, MS 235. Another work often attributed to Baldwin, the Ad laudem Bartholomaei Exoniensis episcopi de coloribus rhetoricis, survives in three manuscripts and a fragment of a fourth. A number of other works are known to have been authored by Baldwin, but do not survive. These include Carmen devotionis, which was seen by John Bale at Glastonbury Abbey in the 16th century. Other lost works were a commentary on the biblical books of Samuel and Kings, De sectis haereticis which existed at Christ Church Priory in the 13th century, and De orthodoxis fidei dogmatibus, which was seen by John Leland at Christ Church in the 16th century. Some of Baldwin's letters existed in manuscript form, although they appear never to have circulated as a collection, but they are no longer extant. One of his letters is mentioned in a Rievaulx Abbey catalogue, and Leland mentions <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> works.|$|E

5|$|Howard was an All-American {{center and}} an honors student at Chicago Vocational Career Academy. Michigan {{was able to}} sign him early over {{numerous}} competing offers and then convince <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> recruiting class to join him. The Fab Five, which included Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson, served as regular starters during their freshman and sophomore years for the 1991–92 and 1992–93 Wolverines. Howard was the last member of the Fab Five to remain active as a professional basketball player. Although many of the Wolverines' accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 were forfeited due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal, which involved booster payments to players to launder money from illegal gambling, Howard's 1993–94 All-American season continues to be recognized.|$|E
5|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{is one of}} {{only two}} films {{directed}} by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular, used to describe a project that is taking too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black (2005) and Saawariya (2007), said that he and <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> field look to Mughal-e-Azam as a source of inspiration for art direction. It has also been used {{as a model for the}} perfect love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing to her heart condition, and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway.|$|E
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature, calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E

25|$|In 1705 a {{fragment}} of Anglo-Saxon epic poetry discovered in Lambeth Palace by George Hickes was published. Because of the fragmentary state of the manuscript, the action starts in medias res. It describes a young prince called Hnæf spurring his 60 men into battle, besieged inside a great hall. Some of his men are then named and their actions in battle followed. Two characters from the attacking force are also named, and one of these dies along with <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> force.|$|E
25|$|Like many churches, the Old Dutch Church {{began with}} {{informal}} meetings, in its case starting around May 1658, when Kingston was still known as Wiltwyck, {{part of the}} Dutch colony of New Netherland. Jacob Stoll, a local settler, led services for 11 <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> house {{in the absence of}} an ordained minister or actual building. The following year it was formally organized, and in 1660 received its first dominie, or minister, Hermanus Blom. A parsonage was built at the order of Peter Stuyvesant in 1662. It was used as a school and court as well, and possibly an Indian trading post.|$|E

Some of the films that feature Elliott's music include Dick Tracy, Nixon, Contact, Independence Day and Wedding Crashers. He has written music for Disney's video sequels to Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, and for the television shows Northern Exposure, Ellen and Gilmore Girls.|$|E
