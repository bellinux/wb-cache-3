25|$|In August 1982, Atlanta {{police officer}} Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a {{citation}} for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle {{into the brush}} along Monroe Ave, thereby observing him violating the city’s ordinance that prohibits drinking in public. Due to a clerical error, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick's arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying the $50 fine, but Torick showed up at Hardwick's apartment three weeks later to serve the now-invalid warrant. Hardwick’s roommate was sleeping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> the living room. The roommate invited officers in and directed them {{down the hall to}} Hardwick’s room. The door was open and the officers observed Hardwick and a companion engaged in mutual, consensual oral sex.|$|E

The song served as the album's second single on July 9, 2012 through Arista Nashville. Written by Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who previously wrote Underwood's single [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] (2007), [...] "Blown Away" [...] is a country pop song with lyrics addressing the story of a daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> the path of a tornado. Producer Mark Bright drew inspiration from 1980s music.|$|E

When she wins first prize in a local art competition for a portrait of Homer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> his underwear, Mr. Burns commissions her to paint a portrait of him. Meanwhile, Homer is determined to lose weight after becoming stuck in a water slide at an amusement park.|$|E

After taking off her jacket, she sits down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> the living room. In another room, West is seen getting out of bed. Hilson leaves for the kitchen where she puts out champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries. She then gets ready in the bathroom while West waits in the bedroom. When Hilson is finished, she joins him in bed and they start cuddling and kissing. The video ends with Hilson looking into the camera over West's shoulder.|$|E

40|$|According to John Manley, Night Supervisor at the Bronx 2 Garage, {{locker rooms}} are a highly social space. Sanitation workers {{create their own}} {{environment}} in which to relax during breaks. The locker room is arranged so that the lockers form walls and rooms. Some of these rooms have couches and televisions, some have pool tables, and some have lounge chairs. The sections are generally organized by ethnicity (for example, Italian, Puerto Rican, Irish, and so forth), though {{there seems to be}} generalized camaraderie amongst all workers. The arrangement is also quite practical: during heavy snowstorms, or other times when employees work mandatory overtime for several consecutive days, many employees spend their off hours sleeping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couches</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> locker room rather than make the trek home and back. ...|$|R
500|$|Once home, Homer announces to {{his family}} that he will go on a diet and {{exercise}} more. While Homer is looking for his weights in the attic, Bart stumbles upon several old paintings of Ringo Starr that Marge made as a student in high school, {{when she had a}} crush on Starr. Marge tells Lisa that she was scolded by her art teacher for doing those paintings; she also recalls sending a painting to Starr for an [...] "honest opinion", but she never got a response. Lisa suggests that Marge take a painting class at Springfield Community College, which she does. She makes a painting of Homer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> his underwear, which her professor, Lombardo, praises. The painting wins the college art show, thus gaining her fame and the headlines of the newspapers.|$|E
500|$|... "Blown Away" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. A reviewer for Billboard thought that Mark Bright's [...] "brooding, atmospheric" [...] production and Underwood's vocal performance [...] "elevate this cinematic tune to an instant classic." [...] They further commented, [...] "When the girl shuts {{herself in the}} storm cellar, leaving her alcoholic father passed out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> {{the path of a}} twister, you can almost feel the wind." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood thought that the song confirmed the description of the album as [...] "a turn toward darkness from a singer who first topped the country chart with 'Jesus, Take the Wheel'." [...] USA Today columnist Brian Mansfield thought the song's [...] "synthesizers, strings sounds, vocal overdubs and echoing guitars" [...] combined dramatically, creating a [...] "neo-80s feel - think an Oklahoma version of the Eurythmics." [...] "Blown Away" [...] received a five-star rating from Billy Dukes of Taste of Country, who called it [...] "dangerous, but irresistible." [...] He also praised Underwood for recording darker material than her previous singles. Also giving it five stars, Bobby Peacock of Roughstock called it [...] "more grandiose" [...] than Underwood's previous efforts, also saying that it [...] "makes itself known by sounding like absolutely nothing else on radio." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post gave the song a mixed review, deeming the lyrics as [...] "gripping", but negatively comparing the instrumentation to the work of Taylor Swift.|$|E
500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{wrapped in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her fourth studio album, which was then untitled. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts (2005), worked on [...] "Blown Away" [...] initially without a specific artist in mind. At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. [...] "I think that's what kind of threw us into it. We just started writing it," [...] he said. The songwriters then {{came up with the}} first verse of the song: [...] "Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her daddy was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down." [...] Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song. As they wrote the pre-chorus line [...] "not enough rain in Oklahoma", both knew that it was a Carrie Underwood song, as the singer is from that state. [...] "We knew if we stuck with that lyric [...] it was Carrie's song or maybe no one would ever record it," [...] Kear commented. After the theme of the song had been established, the songwriters wanted to [...] "dig up as much drama as [...] could." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{tells the story of a}} daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> the path of a tornado. Underwood revealed that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was the song that defined the direction of the album, and recalled the first time she heard the demo: ...|$|E

2500|$|Justman {{registered}} immediate {{concerns over}} the potential cost of attempting to film the treatment. He had particular concerns about a time portal effect, a scene involving a mammoth {{and the number of}} exterior and night shoots that would be required. Despite this, Roddenberry asked Ellison {{to turn it into a}} shooting script and set aside a desk for him in the assistant director's room, expecting him to attend the office every day until he finished it. Ellison ended up with a smaller office of his own at his request, but disliked it sufficiently that he spent the majority of his time on set. He would play loud rock and roll music in the office, and then leave it for the set. On one occasion story editor John D. F. Black caught him on set during the filming of [...] "Mudd's Women" [...] and had him escorted back to the office. The music went on, and Black went back to tell Ellison to turn it down, but the writer had already climbed out the window and left. But on other occasions, he would work late into the night and slept <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>in</b> Justman's office. As the delays added up, the slots assigned to [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever" [...] were reallocated to other episodes. Although this period was later claimed to be of various lengths, Ellison completed the first draft teleplay in three weeks, handing it to Justman on June 7. Black later said that Ellison always had [...] "40 things going" [...] in reference to him doing multiple assignments at once. In response, Ellison said that doing multiple assignments at the same time was simply how screenwriters earned a living in the 1960s.|$|E

It is also said that Elvis had visited the motel to see a sick friend who was staying there in the early 1960s.
