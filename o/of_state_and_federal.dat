5|$|In 1868 Mitchell {{joined the}} Bureau of Engraving and Printing and for 40 years {{engraved}} stamped envelopes. Through his BEP work, Mitchell was {{also responsible for}} engraving the seal of the Secretary of the Navy and the Internal Revenue Service. He also engraved the state seals for Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. Outside <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> government engraving, Mitchell engraved the seals and coats of arms for many well-known institutions which include Harvard University, Society of the Cincinnati, and Boston Public Library. He engraved the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition award medal (1876) which was struck in the Philadelphia Mint. In 1891, Mitchell was invited by the Secretary of the Treasury to join a committee to evaluate the artistic design proposals for a new issue of U.S. coins. The two other members were Charles E. Barber, Chief Engraver of the United States Mint, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.|$|E
5|$|Since {{substitute}} {{checks are}} considered legal checks, substitute checks {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (Negotiable Instruments), and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along with a variety <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting {{the amount of the}} substitute check in the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E
5|$|Strikes and {{industrial}} unrest were frequent {{in the aftermath}} of World War I, arising from discontent over poor conditions and the rise of militant labour organizations like the Communist Party of Australia and the Industrial Workers of the World. The problems were made worse in Australia due to the overlapping system of industrial courts that had evolved since Federation. Although federal arbitration was intended for industrial disputes that impacted upon multiple states or federal employees, courts had through several judgments greatly expanded the potential jurisdiction of federal arbitration, and the system had developed into a duality with both state and federal tribunals weighing into a wide range of industrial disputes. This was exploited by both unions and employers, who pursued matters in the courts they felt most likely to be favourable and switched between different jurisdictions to arrive at the best combination <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> conditions. Protracted disputes arose as employers and employees pursued disputes in different courts or refused to recognise the rulings of one in favour of the other. Billy Hughes and several of his predecessors had sought resolution to the problem through greater Commonwealth powers, but all referendums to expand Commonwealth industrial powers had failed at the ballot box.|$|E

25|$|Discussion of {{the sources}} of Australian law is {{complicated}} by the federal structure, which creates two sources of written constitutional law: state and federaland two sources of general statute law, with the federal Constitution determining the validity <b>of</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> statutes in cases where the two jurisdictions might overlap.|$|E
25|$|Between 1995 and 1997, Patrick coordinated an {{investigation}} {{into a series of}} arsons of predominantly black churches across the South.

In the end, more than 100 arrests were made, but no evidence of national or regional conspiracy was found.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, Masters began {{producing}} hardcore {{gay male}} nude magazines. The Supreme Court had further liberalized {{the standards for}} obscenity in Redrup v. New York, 386 U.S. 767 (1967), and several lower-court rulings had significantly undercut the ability <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> authorities to seize even materials which depicted hardcore sexual activity between individuals of the same gender.

During the 2016 presidential election, the Republicans also gained significant support in the Midwest.

25|$|This {{resulted}} in precedent-setting legal cases in 19th-century Pennsylvania, {{as a federal}} judge applied the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 in a controversial way. He sentenced abolitionist Passmore Williamson to 90 days for contempt of court for failing to produce Johnson and her sons under a writ of habeas corpus, or tell their location. The jailing attracted even wider publicity, and widespread discussion of issues <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> laws related to slavery. Pennsylvania had long been a free state and held that slaveholders gave up their property right in slaves if they brought them voluntarily to the state.|$|E
25|$|The Board of Trustees executes its {{governance}} responsibilities {{through a}} chancellor, {{who serves as}} {{the chief executive officer}} of the System. A president heads each campus with responsibility for campus administration and reports directly to the Chancellor and through the Chancellor to the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees and the Chancellor delegate certain administrative functions and maintain such offices as deemed appropriate to meet the administrative needs of the System.

25|$|The Final {{report says}} that SA could profitably take nuclear waste from other {{countries}} and store it locally.

The report says that nuclear power is unlikely to be profitable in SA, as is the processing of uranium before export. The final report recommends the repeal <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> prohibitions which currently prevent further development of the nuclear industry in South Australia beyond its current role in the mining and export of uranium oxide concentrates.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, San Joaquin County {{and seven}} cities {{along the route}} formed the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission (SJRRC) to oversee the {{creation}} of the service. In May 1997, the Altamont Commuter Express Joint Powers Authority (ACE JPA) was formed by the SJRRC, Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), and Alameda Congestion Management Agency (ACMA). That agreement formalized financial support, administrative processes, and governance for the rail service. The operation is funded by a variety <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> sources, largely sales tax revenue collected by the three JPA signatories; farebox revenues account for about one-third of costs.|$|E
25|$|Souter also rebuked the {{majority}} for accepting the incorrect view that any statement {{made by a}} public employee constitutes, or should be treated as, the governmentâ€™s own speech, because such a view is valid only when a public employee is hired to promote a particular policy by communicating a particular message. He further disagreed with {{the majority}}â€™s argument for limiting the Pickering doctrine, which held that the First Amendment protections were unnecessary {{in light of the}} existence of a comprehensive set <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> statutes that protected government whistle-blowers. Souter noted that speech that addressed official wrongdoing may well be unprotected under existing statutory protections (e.g., the teacher in Givhan would not qualify as a whistle-blower).|$|E
500|$|Two years later, county {{officials}} expressed {{concerns over the}} delay <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> approval and considered building the freeway without the flood control component of the project. The county hoped to build both projects {{at the same time}} to save $4million (about $ in [...] dollars) in costs. This was since it was estimated to require three years' worth of legislation to be accomplished in a single year by the county board of supervisors in order to use the Interstate Highway System funds that were set to expire in 1972. Congress approved the project, but in late 1968, the target date for completing the system would be pushed back two years.|$|E
