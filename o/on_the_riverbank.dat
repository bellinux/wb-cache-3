5|$|On 19 July 1975, a unit {{from the}} Rhodesian Territorial Force (TF) {{contacted}} {{a group of}} guerrillas near a river in the Kandeya Tribal Trust Lands, north-east of Mount Darwin in the area covered by Operation Hurricane. After the Territorials killed two of the insurgents without loss, the cadres fell back and set up an ambush position underneath the roots of some overhanging trees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbank.</b> The TF patrol summoned a Fireforce made up of 7 and 10 Troops, 2 Commando, RLI from Mount Darwin, which arrived soon after.

5|$|Camping for {{the night}} on a riverbank, Andrei and Foma are {{collecting}} firewood for their group when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods. Going to investigate he encounters {{a large group of}} naked pagans, who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer. Andrei is intrigued and excited by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love, is tied to the crossbeam of a hut in a mockery of Jesus' crucifixion and is threatened with drowning in the morning. A woman named Marfa (Nelly Snegina), dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei. After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her coat, kisses Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away, and is lost in the dense woods, scratching his face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, including Daniil, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa. Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei’s boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was seriously}} {{weakened}} by five days hiding from NVA forces {{with little to}} eat. Following the instructions of the FAC controller overhead, he floated down the cold river and at about 2-3:00a.m., just as Norris {{was about to leave}} cover to pull Clark to shore, a six-man NVA patrol walked between them. Norris refrained from opening fire, recognizing this would compromise the covert mission and that they were outgunned. When the patrol was gone, so was Clark. Norris radioed Clark and instructed him {{to get out of the}} river on the south bank. On his own initiative, Norris left his team and on his own searched the river for Clark for several hours before finally finding Clark hiding behind a sampan <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbank.</b> Norris was able to re-link up with the rest of his team and safely deliver Clark to Anderson at the forward operating base. Clark was transported to the last outpost on the Cua Viet River at Dong Ha by an ARVN M113 armored personnel carrier and then flown to Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of shipping and the docks started to decline after 1886, {{the year in}} which the opening of the Severn Tunnel caused a severe drop in coal imports by sea. The situation worsened as the railways were extended into Somerset and beyond, and ships became too big for the port. The last commercial use of the docks was when coal imports ceased on 31 July 1971, and although they now house a marina they are currently little used. The surrounding quays have been developed for housing, although the remains of wooden quays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> can still be seen. All but a small remnant of the mump (a huge mound of spoil from the original dock excavations) was removed in the 1980s {{to make way for the}} development on the north side of the dock. Due to the port, ship building was also an important industry, and around 140 ships were built in the town during the 19th century by companies including David Williams, Joseph Gough, Watsons and William Lowther. F J Carver and Son owned a small dry dock on East Quay and constructed the last ship to be built in the town— the Irene. The former associated industry of rope making is commemorated in street furnishings and paving on East Quay and in the name of Ropewalk street.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} its {{buildings}} and other features can still be seen (in and around the Pepys Estate) all dating from the 1770-80s. These include the gateway on Grove Street, the 'Colonnade' behind it (a series of houses fronted by a colonnaded passageway), the terrace of houses on Longshore, and the two former Rum Warehouses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbank.</b> The surrounding housing estate was built after the closure if the yard in the early 1960s, and the surviving naval buildings were converted {{at the same time}} to provide housing and community facilities.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} morning {{of the first day}} of battle, small parties of Indians dashed up to the sand bar on horseback several times, but they did little damage to the scouts. The scouts killed their horses for breastworks and dug pits into the soft sand behind them. When the scouts opened fire, the Indians {{attacked}} the island on both sides. Later they crawled through the grass and shot through the grass. Several scouts who were killed or wounded were hit by the Indian snipers hidden in the grass. The Indians surrounded the island and repeatedly attacked the Scouts. Three scouts hidden in hole <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> shot several Indians from the shore.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} Britons boarded while shouting various phrases, Arab {{tacked to}} try to bring her starboard guns into battle but she was boarded before achieving this and so her commander ran her aground <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbank.</b> Racer and Lynx were quickly taken, their crews surrendered as the British climbed on deck, others jumped over the side and escaped capture. When Polkinghorne went for Dolphin, Captain Stafford put up a stubborn fight and it reportedly took fifteen minutes to secure the vessel. Five Americans were wounded before Dolphin struck her colors and ended the battle, though casualties from the other privateers amounted to six killed and five more wounded. By the time the fighting was over the remaining British boats arrived and assisted in taking over 100 prisoners.|$|E

25|$|In May 1836, Lovejoy {{decided to}} move with his family across the Mississippi River to Alton, Illinois, where he founded the Alton Observer and served as pastor at Upper Alton Presbyterian Church (now College Avenue Presbyterian Church). Before he could move the press, an angry mob broke into the Observer office and vandalized it. Only Alderman Bryan Mullanphy {{attempted}} to stop the crime, and no policemen or city officials intervened. Lovejoy packed {{what remained of the}} office for shipment to Alton. However, it sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbank,</b> unguarded, overnight and was destroyed and thrown into the Mississippi River. Although Illinois was a free state, Alton, Illinois was a center for slave catchers trying to capture escaped slaves and for pro-slavery forces. Many escaped slaves crossed the Mississippi River from Missouri, a slave state. Alton had been settled by pro-slavery southerners who thought Alton should not become a haven for escaped slaves.|$|E
25|$|With the Pearl River {{cleared of}} Chinese defenses, the British debated {{advancing}} on Canton. Though the truce had ended on 6 March, Superintendent Elliot {{believed that the}} British should negotiate with the Qing authorities from their current position of strength rather than risk a battle in Canton. The Qing army made no aggressive moves against the British and instead began to fortify the city. Chinese military engineers began to establish a number of mud earthworks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbank,</b> sank junks to create riverblocks, and started constructing fire rafts and gunboats. Chinese merchants were ordered to remove all of the silk and tea from Canton to impede trade, and the local populace was barred from selling food to the British ships on the river. On 16 March a British ship approaching a Chinese fort under a flag of truce was fired upon, leading to the British setting the fort on fire with rockets. These actions convinced Elliot that the Chinese were preparing to fight, and following {{the return of the}} ships of the Broadway expedition to the fleet, the British attacked Canton on 18 March, taking the Thirteen Factories with very few casualties and raising the Union Jack above the British factory. The city was partially occupied by the British and trade was reopened after negotiation with the Cohong merchants. After several days of further military successes, British forces commanded the high ground around Canton. Another truce was declared on 20 March. Against the advice of some of his captains, Elliot withdrew most of the Royal Navy warships downriver to the Bocca Tigris.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the reason}} for employing keelmen was the poor state of the navigation on the Tyne and Wear, which prevented ships from moving up river without danger of grounding. As time went by this situation gradually worsened. Colliers arriving at the river mouth would have a ballast of sand {{that had to be}} disposed of. The correct method of doing this was to deposit the sand on specified areas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbank</b> provided for the purpose or by depositing the sand in the sea. The Wear had ballast keels that were used to unload the ballast from colliers and take it out to sea. There were penalties for depositing ballast in the river, but this often occurred. The result was that the riverbed became silted up, causing even more navigational difficulties. Additionally, industry on the riverbanks often deposited its waste products in the river. The situation on the Tyne became so bad that in 1850 the Tyne Navigation Act was passed, which gave control of the river to the Tyne Improvement Commission. This body began an extensive program of dredging to substantially deepen the riverbed. This program was completed in 1888 so that the largest colliers could pass right up to Newcastle and beyond. This deepening of the river meant that colliers could load coal from the staithes without the need for keels to complete the work. In 1876 the existing bridge at Newcastle was replaced by the Swing Bridge, which rotated to allow ships to pass up and down river. This allowed colliers to be loaded from staithes above Newcastle and so further sealed the fate of the keelmen.|$|E

50|$|Between 1966 - 1967, the Benetke Tower {{and many}} medieval houses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbanks</b> were torn down, but the {{position}} of the Water Tower made it a better prospect for salvageability. The tower was saved by the efforts of builder Jože Požauk (1908-1995), who directed a project to raise the 1500 t mass by 2.6 metres over seven months in 1967 and 1968.|$|R
50|$|As for flora, Oaks and Cork Oaks dominate, {{with some}} {{presence}} of Portuguese Oak (Quercus faginea) in wetter areas. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>riverbanks</b> are riparian forests with elms, cottonwoods, poplars and willows. Human activity has thinned the forest, with farmland, olive orchards, pastures, and urbanized areas. Grazing of livestock has degraded oak forest to scrubland with {{plants such as}} thyme, rosemary, and esparto.|$|R
