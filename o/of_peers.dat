5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court nobility of the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House <b>of</b> <b>Peers.</b> Members of the House <b>of</b> <b>Peers</b> were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.|$|E
5|$|The Great Powers occupying Paris {{demanded that}} Louis XVIII {{implement}} a constitution. Louis responded with the Charter of 1814, which included many progressive provisions: freedom of religion, a legislature {{composed of the}} Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber <b>of</b> <b>Peers,</b> a press that would enjoy a degree of freedom, and a provision that the Biens nationaux would remain {{in the hands of}} their current owners. The constitution had 76 articles. Taxation was to be voted on by the chambers. Catholicism was to be the official religion of France. To be eligible for membership in the Chamber of Deputies, one had to pay over 1,000 francs per year in tax, and be over the age of forty. The king would appoint peers to the Chamber <b>of</b> <b>Peers</b> on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of them up for election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.|$|E
5|$|Henry had Anne {{investigated}} for high treason in April 1536.

Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} three (N= 103) peer review studies contextualized in L 2 {{composition}} classrooms and published between 1990 and 2015 were reviewed. To categorize constructs in research studies, this researcher used Lai’s (2010) three Ps dimensions (perceptions, process, and product). Perceptions are {{the beliefs and}} attitudes <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> review. Process refers to the learning process or implementation procedures <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> review. Product is the learning outcomes <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> review. A thematic analysis of the studies’ constructs showed that perception studies examined learners’ general perceptions/attitudes, Asian students’ perceptions/attitudes (cultural influences), and learner perceptions <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> feedback in comparison to self and/or computerized feedback. Process studies discussed the effects of training, checklists/rubrics, writer-reviewer relationships, the nature <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> feedback, communicative language, timing of teacher feedback on peer feedback, grouping strategies, as well as communicative medium. Product research, on the other hand, investigated peer feedback adoption rates and ratio of peer-influenced revisions, effects <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> review on writers’ revision quality, effects <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> review on reviewers’ gains, and effects <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> review on writers’ self revision. In light of this review, research gaps are identified and suggestions for future research are offered...|$|R
5|$|In the Meiji era, Tsugaru Tsuguakira, who {{had been}} the last daimyo of the main Tsugaru family, was ennobled with the title of count (hakushaku). Tsugaru Tsugumichi, the last daimyo of the Kuroishi-Tsugaru, became a viscount (shishaku). Tsuguakira later worked as a {{supervisor}} in the , and Tsugumichi {{became a member of the}} House <b>of</b> <b>Peers</b> in 1890.

5|$|In {{the same}} period, {{different}} helms {{began to be}} used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (affronté), whereas those <b>of</b> <b>peers</b> and gentlemen faced to the right (dexter). In the medieval period crests would always have faced {{the same way as the}} helm, but as a result of these rules, the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion statant, would have the lion depicted as looking over the side of the helm, rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars.|$|E
5|$|The block {{voting system}} was used, with each peer casting as many votes {{as there were}} seats to be filled. The system, however, {{permitted}} the party with the greatest number <b>of</b> <b>peers,</b> normally the Conservatives, to procure {{a disproportionate number of}} seats, with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to admit the representative peers to Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive writs of summons.|$|E

5|$|As {{demands for}} a {{parliament}} grew, Charles took {{the unusual step of}} summoning a great council <b>of</b> <b>peers.</b> By the time it met, on 24 September at York, Charles had resolved to follow the almost universal advice to call a parliament. After informing the peers that a parliament would convene in November, he asked them to consider how he could acquire funds to maintain his army against the Scots in the meantime. They recommended making peace. A cessation of arms, although not a final settlement, was negotiated in the humiliating Treaty of Ripon, signed in October 1640. The treaty stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid £850 per day until peace was restored and the English Parliament recalled, which would be required to raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces. Consequently, Charles summoned what later became known as the Long Parliament. Once again, Charles's supporters fared badly at the polls. Of the 493 members of the Commons returned in November, over 350 were opposed to the king.|$|E
5|$|The Labour Government {{expected}} {{eventually to}} present a bill for a second stage of House of Lords reform, thus removing the remaining 92 hereditary peers; the history of such attempts between 1997 and 2009 is set out in a report in The Guardian. Proposals called The House of Lords: Reform were published by order of the House on 1 January 2007, with a foreword by Jack Straw. In 2009, Labour introduced the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, which would have ended the by-elections to fill vacancies for hereditary peers, thereby removing them through attrition. However, {{in order to ensure}} the passage of the bill through Parliament before the 2010 general election, this clause was dropped from the bill entirely, along with other clauses relating to the exclusion and suspension <b>of</b> <b>peers</b> from the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|The {{privilege}} of peerage extends to all temporal peers and peeresses {{regardless of their}} position {{in relation to the}} House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege, and is held by only some peers (see History of reform of the House of Lords). Scottish peers from the Acts of Union 1707 and Irish peers from the Act of Union 1800, therefore, have the {{privilege of}} peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the United Kingdom House of Commons but they lose the privilege of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of England, Scotland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963 loses all privileges of peerage. The privilege of peerage also extends to wives and widows <b>of</b> <b>peers.</b> A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner, but a peeress suo jure does not. Individuals who hold courtesy titles, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. Lords Spiritual (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the privilege of peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.|$|E

40|$|Peer {{assessment}} in university teaching: evaluating seven course designs Abstract Peer assessment {{is understood to}} be an arrangement with students assessing {{the quality of their}} fellow students’ writings and giving feedback to each other. This multiple-case study of seven designs <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> assessment focuses on the contribution <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> assessment to the acquisition of undergraduates’ writing skills. Its aim is to arrive at an optimal design <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> assessment. Factors included in this study are: the quality <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> assessment activities, the interaction between students in oral peer feedback, students’ learning outcomes, and their evaluation <b>of</b> <b>peer</b> assessment. Most students took assessing the work of their fellow students seriously, and included the peer feedback in the revision of their work. In most conversations, students provided feedback in an evaluative manner. In others, the interaction was more exploratory. For peer assessment, we recommend a combination of written and oral peer feedback...|$|R
