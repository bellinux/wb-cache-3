5|$|By 1873, {{the college}} {{students}} playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The {{only way to}} score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify {{the first set of}} intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list <b>of</b> <b>rules,</b> based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.|$|E

5|$|The Cambridge Rules, first {{drawn up}} at Cambridge University in 1848, were {{particularly}} {{influential in the}} development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes <b>of</b> <b>rules,</b> most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E

5|$|From {{the data}} he {{collected}} and documented, Aristotle inferred {{quite a number}} <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have {{a longer period of}} gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.|$|E
40|$|After decades <b>of</b> neglect, the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is much on {{the minds}} of legal {{scholars}} today. In the United States, the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Bush v.

Transition and developing economies have increasingly come to recognize the importance <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in establishing a framework for economic growth and individual liberty. This essay provides an overview of these debates over the concept and consequences <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. Although American scholars have criticized the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore as violative <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, this criticism rests on an erroneous understanding <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. The tradition <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, as expressed by Dicey, Oakeshott, Hayek, and others, is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore. Moreover, this tradition <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is a cornerstone of a free and prosperous society, in America and abroad. ...|$|R

40|$|Formal conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law {{are popular}} among {{contemporary}} legal philosophers. Nonetheless, the coherence of accounts <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law committed to these conceptions is sometimes fractured by elements harkening back to substantive conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. I {{suggest that this}} may be because at its origins the ideal <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law was substantive through and through. I also argue that those origins are older than is generally supposed. Most authors tend to trace the ideas <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and natural law back to classical Greece, but I show that they are already recognisable and intertwined as far back as Homer. Because the founding moment of the tradition of western intellectual reflection on the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law placed concerns about substantive justice at the centre <b>of</b> the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law ideal, it may be hard for this ideal to entirely shrug off its substantive content. It may be undesirable, too, given the rhetorical power of appeals to the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. The <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law means something quite radical in Homer; this meaning may provide a source of normative inspiration for contemporary reflections about the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law...|$|R
5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language.

This set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E

El Greco was averse to the very idea <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance.|$|E
