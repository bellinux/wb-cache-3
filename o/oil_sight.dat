50|$|The {{air-cooled}} engine has a gear-driven counterbalancer {{as well as}} a proprietary cylinder wall plating similar to a Nikasil coating. The coating, marketed as Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material or SCEM, is nickel-phosphorus-silicon-carbide based, reducing weight (by eliminating a steel liner) and improving heat transfer, allowing for tighter and more efficient piston-to-cylinder clearance. Valves are adjustable via 'screw and locknut' type clearance adjusters. The engine features an <b>oil</b> sump <b>sight</b> glass, enabling visual oil checks, and uses 87 octane fuel.|$|R
50|$|The ships {{arrived at}} 19.30 and {{commenced}} their search and, just before midnight, they discovered U-853 bottomed in 108 ft of water. They made an attack, and <b>oil</b> was <b>sighted</b> just after midnight, sparking the first series of {{claims that the}} U-boat had been destroyed.The ships continued to find contacts, however, and the attacks on them also continued. Ericsson arrived during the night, and McCune resumed command. Amick was detached to make a pre-arranged rendezvous, and reinforcements arrived later, comprising the destroyers Barney, Breckinridge, and Blakeley, the frigate Newport, the corvettes Action and Restless, and the auxiliary destroyer Semmes. These took up position around the search site to guard against the U-boat slipping past the attackers.|$|R
5000|$|In early April 1942 Lancing was sailing from Curaçao to New York City, {{under the}} command of Master Bjerkholt, with a cargo of 8,900 tons of fuel <b>oil.</b> She was <b>sighted</b> off Cape Hatteras on 7 April by , under Erich Topp. Lancing was hit with a single torpedo at 10:52, killing a single crewman. The {{remainder}} of the crew abandoned ship as the Lancing sank off Buxton, Dare County, North Carolina. They were rescued by the American tanker [...]|$|R
5000|$|Olympics {{passengers}} {{barely noticed}} the collision, which First Class passenger Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland registered {{only as a}} [...] "slight jar". The changed settings of the engines were much more noticeable, sending vibrations throughout the ship as they were put into reverse and brought up to maximum revolutions. Passengers came onto the deck {{to find out what}} was going on and were met by the smell of <b>oil</b> and the <b>sight</b> of debris in the sea around Olympic.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the allied}} convoy was within 2 mi of Île d'Yeu, a {{well-defined}} <b>oil</b> slick was <b>sighted</b> between the American warship and the British steamer, off Danse′s port bow. Christabel cruised {{over to the}} slick for better observation but saw nothing to further indicate a German submarine's presence. The convoy continued {{for a little while}} when at 17:20 the wake from [...] was spotted by the officer-of-the-deck and a lookout, about 600 yd off the port quarter.|$|R
50|$|On 10 September 2010, it was {{reported}} that a new wave of oil suddenly coated 16 mi of Louisiana coastline and marshes west of the Mississippi River in Plaquemines Parish. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries confirmed the sightings. On 23 October 2010, it {{was reported}} that miles-long stretches of weathered <b>oil</b> had been <b>sighted</b> in West Bay, Texas between Southwest Pass, the main shipping channel of the Mississippi River, and Tiger Pass near Venice, Louisiana. The sightings were confirmed by Matthew Hinton of The Times-Picayune.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of February 5, {{residents}} of the entire populated zone on the coast awoke to the stink of crude <b>oil,</b> and the <b>sight</b> of blackened beaches, sprinkled with dead and dying birds. [...] The sound of the waves breaking was eerily muted by the thick layer of oil, which accumulated on shore in some places {{to a depth of}} [...] [...] Residents visited the beaches and looked on in horror.

50|$|When the U-boat disappeared, PC-565 altered {{course to}} the right to pass ahead of the swirl. At 12:43Q she dropped one depth charge set at 30 m about 100 m ahead of the {{position}} of the sinking. She then moved in to pick up the only survivor, and several large air slugs were observed. The patrol craft continued to search the area and at 13:25Q several <b>oil</b> slicks were <b>sighted.</b> One slick was dark with globules of brown oil, but it was not iridescent. Patches of vegetable fiber and splinters of freshly broken wood were observed. At 13:38Q, PC-565 picked up a large piece of human flesh. The search was abandoned at 14:30Q.|$|R
50|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 10 November, while passing between San Cristobal and Guadalcanal en route to Aola Bay, Southard {{encountered}} the Japanese submarine I 172 steaming on the surface. She immediately slowed to 10 kn and opened fire. I 172 submerged, and Southard commenced her first depth-charge attack. The destroyer minesweeper lost contact with her adversary and did not regain it again until 0607, almost three and one-half hours later. Over the next three hours Southard made five more depth-charge runs. After the last barrage, <b>oil</b> was <b>sighted</b> on the surface; and she moved in to investigate. Upon reaching the slick, Southards crew could find no further evidence of damage, and she steamed on through the slick. When she reached a point about 2,000 yards {{on the other side of}} the slick, the submarine surfaced almost vertically-exposing her whole conning tower, her hull forward of the tower, and part of her keel. Then the bow dropped about 10 degrees, and the submarine sank rapidly by the stern. Though absolute confirmation of a kill was never received, all evidence strongly indicated that the submarine had indeed been sunk.|$|R
50|$|In {{company with}} Grayback, Grampus {{departed}} Brisbane on 11 February 1943, for her sixth war patrol {{from which she}} failed to return; the manner of her loss still remains a mystery. Japanese seaplanes reported sinking a submarine on 18 February in Grampus patrol area, but Grayback reported seeing Grampus in that same area 4 March. On 5 March 1943, the Japanese destroyers Minegumo and Murasame conducted an attack preceding the Battle of Blackett Strait, near Kolombangara island. A heavy <b>oil</b> slick was <b>sighted</b> there the following day, indicating that Grampus may have been lost there in a night attack or gun battle against the destroyers. The Japanese destroyers had by then already been sunk in a night action with U.S. cruisers and destroyers.|$|R
50|$|Jie {{calls the}} hotline and leaves {{a message for}} Chyi, who is eating at a {{roadside}} restaurant and watching the cooking program that demonstrated the live carp preparation in the opening sequence of the film. It is her husband and his lover presenting it, on location at an ostrich farm. They are attempting to cook an ostrich egg omelette, but when they break the egg into the pan, a dead baby ostrich is released into the hot <b>oil.</b> At the <b>sight</b> of this gruesome image, Chyi runs to the riverside to be sick. As she recovers, she receives a text from her office saying that Jie has {{called to say that}} he plans to kill himself. He has left an address and she hurries to his apartment building.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 May, [...] — a {{modified}} Type VIIC/41 boat under O/L H Emmerich — was two days into her first operational patrol and running submerged, when she was detected by an RAF Catalina under Flt/Lt KM Murray of 210 Squadron, Coastal Command. Murray attacked immediately with a pattern of depth charges. U-320 was damaged but not destroyed; Murray <b>sighted</b> <b>oil,</b> and sonobuoys dropped by the Catalina detected hammering. Murray was unable to continue the attack and by mid-afternoon, at his Prudent Limit of Endurance (PLE), was forced to abandon the hunt. Emmerich meanwhile headed for Norway, abandoning his crippled boat the following day. Emmerich and all his crew survived. U-320 was the last U-boat to be sunk in action during the Battle of the Atlantic.|$|R
50|$|The {{one piece}} {{lubricator}} {{body is a}} gunmetal casting and incorporates the condensing chamber, the oil reservoir and the sight glasses. Passages within the body interconnect these areas. The body is fitted with a steam valve, a water valve, an <b>oil</b> control valve. <b>Sight</b> glasses are fitted at the front & back of the body {{on each of the}} feeds, these feeds are fitted with individual feed regulating valves for controlling the feed rate for each outlet. The oil control valve was used to either turn the supply off/on, or to shut off the supply to the cylinders and just supply the air compressor with oil whilst the locomotive is stationary on lubricators with a center feed. Each feed is also fitted with a drain valve for cleaning each sight glass. The body is also fitted with an oil chamber drain for draining the condensed water from the oil chamber.|$|R
5000|$|On 22 October 2010, it was {{reported}} that miles-long strings of weathered <b>oil</b> had been <b>sighted</b> moving toward marshes on the Mississippi River delta. Hundreds of thousands of migrating ducks and geese spend the winter in this delta. [...] Two years after the Deepwater explosion, migratory birds were found to have carried chemicals from the spill to Minnesota. Preliminary evidence showed {{the vast majority of the}} small sample of pelican eggs tested contained [...] "petroleum compounds and Corexit". As of 2 November 2010, 6,814 dead animals had been collected, including 6,104 birds, 609 sea turtles, 100 dolphins and other mammals, and 1 other reptile. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, cause of death had not been determined as of late June. According to NOAA, since 1 January 2011, 67 dead dolphins had been found in the area affected by the spill, with 35 of them premature or newborn calves.|$|R
40|$|Physico-chemical Characteristics and Fatty Acids Composition of Raphia sese and Raphia laurentii <b>Oils.</b> In the <b>sight</b> of the {{diversification}} of sources of lipids {{consumed by the}} congolese populations and of the valorization of the vast marshes of north of the Congo (Brazzaville), it was carried out a physico-chemical study of the oils extracted from the raphia palm trees which abundantly populate the flooded forests of the Congo basin. Two species were studied here : Raphia sese and Raphia Laurentii. The local oil process, which includes a stage of fermentation of the fruits before oil extraction leads to bad quality products than those extracted at the laboratory from fresh fruits. Raphia nut pulps are 40 - 52 % oil content (mainly : 32 - 34 %, of palmitic acid; 8 - 11 % of stearicacid; 15 - 19 % of oleic acid, 33 - 39 % of linolenic acid). The linolenic acid content is less than 2 %. These characteristics confer on raphia oils a statute of frying oil with high value of essential fatty acid content...|$|R
50|$|Richter was {{a pioneer}} in {{painting}} from nature, in both practice and theory. In 1812 he painted the <b>oil</b> Christ Giving <b>Sight</b> to the Blind, in bright sunlight {{on the roof of}} his house in Newman Street; the work was purchased by the trustees of the British Institution for 500 guineas and later presented to the New Church, Greenwich, completed in 1825, where it was installed as an altarpiece. A second version, attempting to improve on its truth to nature, was exhibited four years later. Then, in 1817, he published the pamphlet Daylight: a recent discovery in the art of painting, with hints on the philosophy of the fine arts, and on that of the human mind, as first dissected by Immanuel Kant. His more general ideas, including his approach to color and use of models of his compositions in clay or wax, influenced other painters, notably the miniature painter James Holmes. Daylight combined his artistic interests with his study of metaphysical philosophy. Richter also wrote the article 'Metaphysics' in the Encyclopaedia Londonensis and a paper, German Transcendentalism (1855).|$|R
40|$|Evaluating {{impacts of}} human {{activities}} on marine ecosystems is difficult when effects occur out of plain <b>sight.</b> <b>Oil</b> spill severity is often {{measured by the}} number of marine birds and mammals killed, but {{only a small fraction of}} carcasses are recovered. The Deepwater Horizon/BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was the largest in the U. S. history, but some reports implied modest environmental impacts, in part because of a relatively low number (101) of observed marine mammal mortalities. We estimate historical carcass-detection rates for 14 cetacean species in the northern Gulf of Mexico that have estimates of abundance, survival rates, and stranding records. This preliminary analysis suggests that carcasses are recovered, on an average, from only 2 % (range: 0 – 6. 2 %) of cetacean deaths. Thus, the true death toll could be 50 times the number of carcasses recovered, given no additional information. We discuss caveats to this estimate, but present it as a counterpoint to illustrate the magnitude of misrepresentation implicit in presenting observed carcass counts without similar qualification. We urge methodological development to develop appropriate multipliers. Analytical methods are required to account explicitly for low probability of carcass recovery from cryptic mortality events (e. g., oil spills, ship strikes, bycatch in unmonitored fisheries and acoustic trauma) ...|$|R
5000|$|Santa Barbara was {{experiencing}} a stormy winter, {{with a large}} flood event having occurred on January 25, just {{three days before the}} blowout. Enormous amounts of fresh water were still running offshore from local streams, flowing south and southwest {{in the vicinity of the}} rig. [...] Combined with the prevailing north-northwesterly winds typical of the area between storm systems, this pushed the expanding oil slick away from the shore, and it seemed for several days that the beaches of Santa Barbara would be spared. However, another huge storm system affected the region on February 4, with winds moving around the compass clockwise from southeast to west; this pushed the oil slick north into Santa Barbara harbor and onto all the beaches of southern Santa Barbara County and northwestern Ventura County. [...] Booms had been placed around the harbor and beaches, but the surf was heavy in the storm, and the oil was up to 8 in deep at the boom by late afternoon on the 4th. That evening the booms failed completely, breaking under the assault of the storm and by the morning the entire harbor, containing around 800 boats, was several inches deep in fresh crude oil, and all the boats were blackened. [...] Residents were evacuated, due to the risk of explosion from the abundant hydrocarbon vapors, and both the oil contractors and the Coast Guard began using chemical dispersants on the oil near the shore.On the morning of February 5, residents of the entire populated zone on the coast awoke to the stink of crude <b>oil,</b> and the <b>sight</b> of blackened beaches, sprinkled with dead and dying birds. [...] The sound of the waves breaking was eerily muted by the thick layer of oil, which accumulated on shore in some places to a depth of 6 in. Residents visited the beaches and looked on in horror.
