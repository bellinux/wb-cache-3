The large numbers of Pakistanis living in the Persian Gulf region and in other Middle Eastern countries has further increased the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> speak Arabic in Pakistan. Arabic is taught as a religious language in Mosques, Schools, Colleges, Universities and Madrassahs. Nearly all of Pakistan's Muslim population has had some form of education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the Arabic language.|$|E
25|$|The museum's {{popularity}} {{has led to}} some problems. Visitors stand in line in the museum foyer to take an elevator down to the underground level where the exhibits start with the Middle Passage and slavery. The hallway there {{is designed to be}} cramped and somewhat claustrophobic. The large number of visitors who stop to read the exhibit's signs has caused dangerous overcrowding. Museum officials have had to limit the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> take the elevator (and thus enter the exhibit) to mitigate this problem. This has led to still longer lines in the foyer.|$|E
25|$|As {{a growing}} urban area, Ithaca is facing steady {{increases}} {{in levels of}} vehicular traffic on the city grid and on the state highways. Outlying areas have limited bus service, and many people consider a car essential. However, many consider Ithaca a walkable and bikeable community. One positive trend {{for the health of}} downtown Ithaca is the new wave of increasing urban density in and around the Ithaca Commons. Because the downtown area is the region's central business district, dense mixed-use development that includes housing may increase the proportion <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> walk to work and recreation, and mitigate the likely increased pressure on already busy roads as Ithaca grows. The downtown area is also the area best served by frequent public transportation. Still, traffic congestion around the Commons is likely to progressively increase.|$|E

25|$|Guanajuato has {{the fourth}} lowest number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> speak an {{indigenous}} language. However, the ethnically indigenous population is about 10,347 (2005) or 2.6% {{of the population}} {{over the age of}} five. The languages spoken are Chichimeca Jonaz, Otomi and Nahuatl. The two most important indigenous groups are the Chichimeca Jonaz and the Otomi, both of which are concentrated in the Valles de Sur area. Culturally, both groups show significant Purépecha influence. Both live in arid regions, where rainfall is precious and the diet includes foods such as pitayas, Myrtillocactus geometrizans (garambullo), cactus pear, nopal and agave. Hunting was an important source of protein but the scarcity of game has all but extinguished this practice. Subsistence agriculture forms the basis of the economy and provides much of the current diet. However, these peoples are extremely poor, and many migrate to other places to find work.|$|E
25|$|Vision is {{the primary}} sense for humans, but speech {{perception}} is multimodal, which means that it involves information {{from more than one}} sensory modality, in particular, audition and vision. The McGurk effect arises during phonetic processing because the integration of audio and visual information happens early in speech perception. The McGurk effect is very robust; that is, knowledge about it seems to have little effect on one's perception of it. This is different from certain optical illusions, which break down once one 'sees through' them. Some people, including those that have been researching the phenomenon for more than twenty years, experience the effect even when they are aware that it is taking place. With the exception <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> identify most of what is being said from speech-reading alone, most people are quite limited in their ability to identify speech from visual-only signals. A more extensive phenomenon is the ability of visual speech to increase the intelligibility of heard speech in a noisy environment. Visible speech can also alter the perception of perfectly audible speech sounds when the visual speech stimuli are mismatched with the auditory speech. Normally, speech perception is thought to be an auditory process; however, our use of information is immediate, automatic, and, to a large degree, unconscious and therefore, despite what is widely accepted as true, speech is not only something we hear. Speech is perceived by all of the senses working together (seeing, touching, and listening to a face move). The brain is often unaware of the separate sensory contributions of what it perceives. Therefore, when it comes to recognizing speech the brain cannot differentiate whether it is seeing or hearing the incoming information.|$|E

2500|$|Sanregret {{continued}} the search after Pearson {{turned down the}} job, but she met with Pearson again in early May at the American Hockey Coaches Association convention in Naples, Florida, {{and this time he}} was ready to accept. Pearson signed a five-year contract and was introduced at the Grant Hockey Educational Center on Michigan Tech's campus on May10. At the press conference, Pearson posited that what separates him from the previous alumni who have returned to coach the Huskies is his 30years of experience. [...] "As you're in the game longer you get a bigger network <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> help you recruit, so I think that's the biggest difference right now", Pearson said. Bill Muckalt, a veteran of five National Hockey League (NHL) seasons who was coached by Pearson at Michigan, was hired as an assistant coach in June; Damon Whitten was retained as the other assistant coach. [...] "Our coaching staff has done a lot of winning and we want to instill the attitude that we're going to win", Whitten said. Pearson spoke of changing the team's style of play to emphasize skill, speed and offensive creativity, and said his staff's efforts would be focused on recruiting for the next few months. He brought in Steve Shields, another former NHL player who played under Pearson at Michigan, as a volunteer goaltending coach in September.|$|E
2500|$|As {{recreational}} use of {{the park}} increased during the 1950s and 60s, {{it became clear that}} a long-term plan to manage the park was required. [...] Six years of consultation with park users resulted in the 1974 publication of the Algonquin Master Plan, a management plan that sought to ensure that the park could continue indefinitely to serve all of the competing park interests. [...] Three major changes came about {{as a result of the}} plan. [...] One, the park was divided into zones with different specified purposes and uses: Nature Reserve and Historic (5.7% of land area), Wilderness (12%), Development (4.3%) and Recreation-Utilization (78%) zones. [...] Logging in the park was limited to the Recreation-Utilization zones, but was separated as much as possible from users of the park interior in order to maintain the park's natural environment. [...] Each year only a small percentage of the park is being actively logged. [...] Two, all existing timber licenses were cancelled, and all logging in the park is now done by the Algonquin Forestry Authority, which supplies timber to 10 private mills outside the park. [...] Three, rules were put in place to limit the impact of recreational {{use of the}} park. [...] Almost all cans and bottles are banned in the interior, and limits are placed on the number of people per campsite, and the number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> enter the park interior per day at each access point. [...] Also, the use of boat motors is limited, both in power and to a few of the larger and more accessible lakes. [...] The master plan has been reviewed and updated four times since 1974, with the latest version being published in 1998.|$|E
