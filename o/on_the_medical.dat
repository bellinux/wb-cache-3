5|$|Owing to a {{computer}} malfunction, the remaining soldier awakens with amnesia in a cryo-tube <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> deck of the Von Braun, being implanted with an illegal cyber-neural interface. He is immediately contacted by another survivor, Dr. Janice Polito, who guides him to safety before the cabin depressurizes. She demands that he meets her on deck 4 of the Von Braun. Along the way, the soldier battles the infected crew members. The Many also telepathically communicate with him, attempting to convince him to join them. After restarting the ship's engine core, the soldier reaches deck 4 and discovers that Polito is dead. He is then confronted by SHODAN. It is revealed she has been posing as Polito to gain the soldier's trust.|$|E
5|$|There are 89hospitals in Virginia listed {{with the}} United States Department of Health and Human Services. Notable {{examples}} include Inova Fairfax Hospital, the largest {{hospital in the}} Washington Metropolitan Area, and the VCU Medical Center, located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. The University of Virginia Medical Center, part of the University of Virginia Health System, is highly ranked in endocrinology according to U.S.News & World Report. Virginia has a ratio of 127 primary care physicians per 10,000 residents, which is the 16th highest nationally. Virginia was one of five states to receive a perfect score in disaster preparedness according to a 2008 report by the Trust for America's Health, based on criteria such as detecting pathogens and distributing vaccines and medical supplies.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} discoveries of major {{scientific}} importance. These included the snow-free Dry Valleys {{in the western}} mountains, the emperor penguin colony at Cape Crozier, scientific evidence that the Ice Barrier was a floating ice shelf, and a leaf fossil discovered by Ferrar which helped to establish Antarctica's relation to the Gondwana super-continent. Thousands of geological and biological specimens had been collected and new marine species identified. The location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated with reasonable accuracy. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> side, Wilson discovered the anti-scorbutic effects of fresh seal meat, which resolved the lethal threat of scurvy to this and subsequent expeditions.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{spent a year}} in Europe {{with his}} wife and took {{post-graduate}} education in Edinburgh and London. In 1894, along with 5 other physicians, he sent a letter to Vital-Justin Grandin to support the building of a general hospital by the Grey Nuns, which was opened on December 15 of the next year. He served <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> board, until his resignation in 1899 over a disagreement regarding patient admission. He was appointed Justice of Peace of Edmonton in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are thought}} to relate to abnormal electrical activity. Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. Seizures have {{a large number of}} causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, drug and alcohol intake, and stress. Seizures may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> history and exam findings. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures.|$|E
5|$|Although Allied {{casualties}} {{during the}} battle had been light, {{in the wake of}} the battle, Milne Bay suffered an epidemic of malaria that posed a threat to the base as great as that from the Japanese attack. Over one-sixth of Milne Force, including Clowes, came down with the disease. The incidence of malaria soared to 33 per thousand per week in September (equivalent to 1,716 per thousand per annum), and to 82 per thousand per week in December (equivalent to 4,294 per thousand per annum). At this rate, the whole force could have been incapacitated in a matter of months. It placed enormous strain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> units and the supplies of anti-malarial drugs. The Chief Pathologist of New Guinea Force, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford went to see Blamey, who was now in personal command of New Guinea Force, and told him that 1,000 men and a large quantity of anti-malarial supplies were urgently required at Milne Bay to avert a disaster. Blamey took a personal interest in the matter. He expedited supply shipments, and made the required personnel available. The arrival of quantities of the new drug atabrine allowed this more effective drug to be substituted for quinine. The incidence of malaria dropped dramatically after December, the month in which atabrine became the official Australian prophylactic drug, and by March 1943 the crisis had passed. After this, the incidence of malaria amongst the garrison at Milne Bay was similar to other bases in Papua and New Guinea.|$|E

25|$|Admission offers {{are made}} by {{individual}} medical schools, generally {{on the basis of}} a personal statement, undergraduate record (GPA), scores <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Medical</b> College Admission Test , and interviews.
