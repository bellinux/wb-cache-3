Also, we think that there lies <b>our</b> <b>village</b> of origin, before unknown reasons to the local memory made us go down.|$|E

500|$|Serbian writer Janko Veselinović {{was well}} acquainted with the {{folklore}} of Tamnava, where {{he worked as a}} teacher in a village. In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co-villager Petar, a vetrenjak: [...] "As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo. Then he has to stay in bed for a week. And do you know why he is like that? He told me. The pogibaoci [...] from surrounding villages drive the clouds toward <b>our</b> <b>village,</b> and Petar will not let hail beat us. He fights with them until he will overpower them, or they him... 'We uproot oaks, as one would pull onion bulbs from the ground, and beat each other with them.'" ...|$|E

With the {{impending}} Bosnian War, his father wanted either him or his brother to leave the country in order to preserve the family line.
