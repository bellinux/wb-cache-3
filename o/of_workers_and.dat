5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, in {{an attempt}} to fill the {{shortfall}} <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> revitalise local industries, citizens of the wider Commonwealth of Nations were encouraged to migrate to Oldham and other British towns. Many came from the Caribbean and Indian subcontinent and settled throughout the Oldham borough.|$|E
5|$|Newport News was a {{rural area}} of {{plantations}} and a small fishing village until after the American Civil War. Construction of the railroad and establishment of the great shipyard brought thousands <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> associated development. It {{was one of only}} a few cities in Virginia to be newly established without earlier incorporation as a town. (Virginia has had an independent city political subdivision since 1871.) Walter A. Post served as the city's first mayor.|$|E
5|$|P. rebeli pupae prey {{upon their}} broodmates, while {{producing}} sugar-rich secretions which worker ants imbibe. In one experiment, P. rebeli specimens which consumed ant larvae developed {{more quickly than}} those who did not. However, despite their nourishing offering to the community, they invariably imposed a net loss in the survival rates <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> broodmates, demonstrating that the species is parasitic (rather than mutualistic) at all stages in its host colony.|$|E

50|$|The {{participatory}} economy {{focuses on}} the participation of all citizens through the creation <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> councils <b>and</b> consumer councils. Hahnel emphasizes the direct participation <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> consumers, rather than appointing representatives. The councils are concerned with large-scale issues of production and consumption, and are broken into various bodies tasked with researching future development projects.|$|R
5|$|The meatpacking {{district}} was served between 1908 and 1957 {{by a short}} Chicago 'L' line with several stops, devoted primarily to the daily transport of thousands <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> even tourists to the site. The line was constructed when the City of Chicago forced the removal of surface trackage on 40th Street.|$|E
5|$|Weaver ant (Oecophylla spp.) workers build nests {{in trees}} by {{attaching}} leaves together, first pulling {{them together with}} bridges <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of Polyrhachis.|$|E
5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking {{his case to}} the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.|$|E

50|$|The 8th Party Congress, {{meeting in}} March 1919, {{endorsed}} the use <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> agriculture correspondents {{to monitor the}} bureaucracy and expose abuse of power. In 1919, Vladimir Lenin instructed the Pravda editorial board to organize a network <b>of</b> regular <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> village correspondents, and by 1926, Leon Trotsky was addressing 580 delegates representing around 500,000 rabkory and selkory at the Third All-Union Congress of Rabkory.|$|R
30|$|The {{results in}} the table show that workers who report having {{received}} some formal on-the-job training since joining the firm report higher earnings than non-trainees in both countries. However, this difference in the average wages is likely capturing the effect <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> firm characteristics that drive the selection <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> into training <b>and</b> that, simultaneously, also influence their hourly wages.|$|R
5|$|Anticipating {{the rural}} {{background}} of most men, the initial camps provided soil conservation and farming-related projects. By August 1945, 550 men worked on dairy farms and with milk testing. Labor-intensive farming operations like dairies were short <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> accepted COs to help fill the gap. Men {{assigned to the}} Bureau of Reclamation built contours to prevent soil erosion, constructed 164 reservoirs and 249 dams. A sixth of all CPS work was performed in this area.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal {{until late in the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Hoover Dam is a {{concrete}} arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, {{on the border}} between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947. Its construction {{was the result of a}} massive effort involving thousands <b>of</b> <b>workers,</b> <b>and</b> cost over one hundred lives. The dam was named after President Herbert Hoover.|$|E

30|$|In sum, {{previous}} research gives reason {{to assume that}} beyond human capital compensation and career mobility rationalities, job characteristics may help to explain mismatching and its real or apparent wage penalties. To test the validity <b>of</b> the <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> job heterogeneity assumptions as discussed herein, we empirically examine the incidence rates and wage penalties of mismatching in Germany. To this end, we differentiate between educational and skillrelated mismatching and consider several precise measures <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> job characteristics.|$|R
5|$|In July 2009, {{more than}} 40 {{people were killed}} in a fire {{accident}} in a firecracker unit. The police traced out unregistered units and irregularities that led to the accident. In a fire accident in August 2011, seven people were killed and five were seriously injured. A similar fire accident and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others. The common reasons cited for the accidents are inadequate training <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> supervisors involved in different stages of production and marketing of firecracker items. Other reasons are found to be overstocking of explosives, raw material and finished goods, and employment of workers in excess of the permitted strength.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the King or {{government}} in occupied Belgium, Mercier became the predominant figure in the country and a symbol of resilience. Because of his status, he could not be arrested without an outcry and, although lured back to the Vatican in 1915 to remove him from the country, he soon returned. His writings were banned, however, and copies of their work confiscated. In 1916, Mercier was officially prohibited from publishing pamphlets but continued to campaign against the deportation <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> various other German policies. Initially opposed by Pope Benedict XV, who was anxious to remain neutral, the Pope was supportive of the Belgian church but encouraged it to moderate its stance to avoid confrontation.|$|E
5|$|In April 1894, a Scottish {{physician}} Sir Ronald Ross visited Sir Patrick Manson at {{his house}} on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit {{was the start of}} four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius. The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.|$|E
40|$|We {{test for}} sorting <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> between <b>and</b> within {{industrial}} sectors in a directed search model with coordination frictions. We fit {{the model to}} sector-specific vacancy and output data along with publicly-available statistics that characterize the distribution <b>of</b> <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> employer wage heterogeneity across sectors. Our empirical method is general and {{can be applied to}} a broad class of assignment models. The results indicate that industries are the loci <b>of</b> sorting-more productive <b>workers</b> are employed in more productive industries. The evidence confirms assortative matching can be present even when <b>worker</b> <b>and</b> employer components <b>of</b> wage heterogeneity are weakly correlated...|$|R

5|$|In Egypt Darius built many {{temples and}} {{restored}} {{those that had}} previously been destroyed. Even though Darius was a Zoroastrian, he built temples dedicated to the Gods of the Ancient Egyptian religion. Several temples found were dedicated to Ptah and Nekhbet. Darius also created several roads and routes in Egypt. The monuments that Darius built were often inscribed in the official languages of the Persian Empire, Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian and Egyptian hieroglyphs. To construct these monuments Darius employed a large number <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> artisans of diverse nationalities. Several of these workers were deportees who had been employed specifically for these projects. These deportees enhanced the empire's economy and improved inter-cultural relations. At the time of Darius's death construction projects were still under way. Xerxes completed these works and in some cases expanded his father's projects by erecting new buildings of his own.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{complete}} control of the Firm, Morris took an increased interest {{in the process of}} textile dyeing and entered into a co-operative agreement with Thomas Wardle, a silk dyer who operated the Hencroft Works in Leek, Staffordshire. As a result, Morris would spend time with Wardle at his home on various occasions between summer 1875 and spring 1878. Deeming the colours to be of inferior quality, Morris rejected the chemical aniline dyes which were then predominant, instead emphasising the revival of organic dyes, such as indigo for blue, walnut shells and roots for brown, and cochineal, kermes, and madder for red. Living and working in this industrial environment, he gained a personal understanding of production and the lives of the proletariat, and was disgusted by the poor living conditions <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> the pollution caused by industry; these factors greatly influenced his political views. After learning the skills of dyeing, in the late 1870s Morris turned his attention to weaving, experimenting with silk weaving at Queen's Square.|$|E
5|$|This emblem was in turn {{replaced}} by a new one in 1950. The central feature of this symbol is a crossed hammer and sickle, a universal Communist symbol symbolizing the unity <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> peasants. Below this symbol, a sun is shown rising behind a globe. The insignia is framed by ears of wheat, each ear ending in flowers; clover {{on the left and}} flax on the right. A red ribbon is wrapped around the ears of wheat, reminiscent of the red flag used by the Communist movement. The base of the emblem shows the letters БССР. The ribbon features the phrase Workers of the World, Unite! The left side inscribed in Belarusian, the right side in Russian. The red star of Communism is featured above the hammer and sickle. The 1950 version was designed by Ivan Dubasov, a People's Artist of the USSR. Article 119 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR defines the design of the emblem.|$|E
