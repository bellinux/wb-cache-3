2500|$|Comingore's {{supposed}} Communist connections {{played a}} role in a legal battle for custody of her two children with Richard J. Collins. She also said that her 1953 arrest on a prostitution charge was [...] "all a part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>being</b> an 'unfriendly witness.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Autopsy" [...] is a {{magnificent}} book possessing a vibrancy and objectivity that when I first read it I found quite remarkable.

2500|$|I {{moved on}} to a {{successful}} and somewhat normal life as a gay man. [...] …But, never far in the background, has lurked the shadow of Investigator Tileston and the gnawing feeling that what I am, the very essence <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>being,</b> is somehow wrong. Bad. Sinful. Unworthy. I will probably never rid myself of those feelings. But time, and the new knowledge that others know about {{what went on in}} Florida some 40 years ago, makes those feelings a lot easier to bear.|$|E
2500|$|Zinaida {{started writing}} poetry {{at the age}} of seven. By the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a {{published}} poet. [...] "By the year 1880 I was writing verses, being a great believer in 'inspiration', and making it a point never to take my pen away from paper. People around me saw these poems as a sign <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>being</b> 'spoiled', but I never tried to conceal them and, of course, I wasn't spoiled at all, what with my religious upbringing," [...] she wrote in 1902 in a letter to Valery Bryusov. A good-looking girl, Zinaida attracted a lot of attention in Borzhomi, but Merezhkovsky, a well-educated introvert, impressed her first and foremost as a perfect kindred spirit. Once he proposed, she accepted him without hesitation, and never came to regret what might have seemed a hasty decision.|$|E
2500|$|.....by far {{the most}} Radical measure of my lifetime. I do not object to the {{principle}} of graduated taxation: for the just principle of ability to pay is not determined simply by the amount of income.... But, so far as I understand the present measure of finance from the partial reports I have received, I find it too violent. It involves a great departure from the methods of political action established in this country, where reforms, and especially financial reforms, have always been considerate and even tender.... I do not yet see the ground on which it can be justly held that any one description of property should be more heavily burdened than others, unless moral and social grounds can be shown first: but in this case the reasons drawn from those sources seem rather to verge in the opposite direction, for real property has more of presumptive connection with the discharge of duty that that which is ranked as personal...the aspect of the measure is not satisfactory to a man of my traditions (and these traditions lie near the roots <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>being)....</b> For the sudden introduction of such change there is I think no precedent {{in the history of this}} country. And the severity of the blow is greatly aggravated in moral effect by the fact that it is dealt only to a handful of individuals.|$|E

2500|$|Prayer {{seems to}} me a cry of weakness, and an attempt to avoid, by trickery, {{the rules of the game}} as laid down. I do not choose to admit weakness. I accept the {{challenge}} of responsibility. Life, as it is, does not frighten me, since I have made my peace with the universe as I find it, and bow to its laws. The ever-sleepless sea in its bed, crying out [...] "how long?" [...] to Time; million-formed and never motionless flame; the contemplation of these two aspects alone, affords me sufficient food for ten spans of my expected lifetime. It {{seems to me}} that organized creeds are collections of words around a wish. I feel no need for such. However, I would not, by word or deed, attempt to deprive another of the consolation it affords. It is simply not for me. Somebody else may have my rapturous glance at the archangels. The springing of the yellow line of morning out of the misty deep of dawn, is glory enough for me. I know that nothing is destructible; things merely change forms. When the consciousness we know as life ceases, I know that I shall still be part and parcel of the world. I was a part before the sun rolled into shape and burst forth in the glory of change. I was, when the earth was hurled out from its fiery rim. I shall return with the earth to Father Sun, and still exist in substance when the sun has lost its fire, and disintegrated into infinity to perhaps become a part of the whirling rubble of space. Why fear? The stuff <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>being</b> is matter, ever changing, ever moving, but never lost; so what need of denominations and creeds to deny myself the comfort of all my fellow men? The wide belt of the universe has no need for finger-rings. I am one with the infinite and need no other assurance.|$|E
