5|$|The {{concept of}} a Taylor series was {{formulated}} by the Scottish mathematician James Gregory and formally introduced by the English mathematician Brook Taylor in 1715.

5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>special</b> sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E
