5|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Alabama, Applewhite moved to Houston, Texas, in 1965 {{to teach at}} the University <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Thomas.</b> His {{students}} regarded him as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser. He served {{as chair of the}} music department; he also became a locally popular singer, serving as the choral director of an Episcopal church and performing with the Houston Grand Opera. In Texas, he was briefly openly gay but also pursued a relationship with a young woman, who left him under pressure from her family, greatly upsetting him. He resigned from the University <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Thomas</b> in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems. Robert Balch and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite's group, speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between Applewhite and a student. The president of the university later recalled that he was often mentally jumbled and disorganized {{near the end of his}} employment.|$|E

5|$|Portsmouth has two cathedrals: the Anglican Cathedral <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Thomas</b> in Old Portsmouth, and the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St John the Evangelist (the city {{is one of}} 34 British {{settlements}} with a Roman Catholic cathedral). The city's first chapel, {{dedicated to}} Thomas Becket, was built by Jean deGisors {{in the second half}} of the 12th century. The chapel was rebuilt and developed into the parish church and then Anglican cathedral. It was damaged during the Siege of Portsmouth in 1642, but after the restoration of the monarchy the tower and nave were rebuilt. Significant changes were made when the Diocese of Portsmouth was established in 1927. It became a cathedral in 1932, and was enlarged, although construction was halted during the Second World War. The cathedral was re-consecrated in the presence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{wrote his}} Life and Miracles <b>of</b> <b>St</b> <b>Thomas</b> of Canterbury around 1173 to 1174. Though lost, {{it is one}} of the main sources for an Icelandic saga on Becket {{entitled}} Thómas saga Erkibyskups, which survives in a copy dating from the first half of the 14th century. This saga preserves a number of otherwise unknown details about Becket's life and remains one of the main sources for Becket studies. Robert's life also was a source for the work of Benet of St Albans, another biographer of Becket. A modern historian partially reconstructed Robert's biography from these sources. A major source for Robert's work on Becket was the writings of John of Salisbury. A modern biographer of Becket, Frank Barlow, speculates that Robert's biography was lost because it favoured the king's side of the story, rather than Becket's.|$|E
