2500|$|Douglas {{stated that}} the keys to acting success are {{determination}} and application: [...] "You must know how to function and how to maintain yourself, and {{you must have a}} love <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> But an actor also needs great good luck. I have had that luck." [...] Douglas had great vitality and explained that [...] "it takes a lot out of you to work in this business.

2500|$|As Democratic debates {{took place}} during the summer, Obama {{received}} at best mixed notices for his efforts. Democratic strategist Bob Shrum said, [...] "He slips into this tendency, which he probably learned as president of the Harvard Law Review, to overstate his premises before he states his position. In politics, you do the opposite <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in the Law Review—you state your position, then say your premises—if you ever get to them." [...] Commentator Eleanor Clift said that, [...] "Obama is almost too cerebral for the sound-bite world of modern politics, but that's part of his appeal." ...|$|E

Then he suddenly put his arm round her waist, kissed her forehead, and left the room without another word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you are reasonable," [...] {{returned}} the merchant, [...] "for you talk <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> know, and you admit that {{in regard to}} God you `don't know,' but you began by stating that `there is no God.' Ah, my friend, I sympathise with you in your terrible sorrow, even as you have sympathised with me in mine, but don't let us give way to despair and cast the only Refuge that remains to us behind our backs.

5000|$|Muhammad’s companions dragged Zeynab {{back into}} his {{presence}} demanding an explanation.

There--now, come along, be a reasonable creature, and a good girl, and do not give unnecessary pain and vexation to your mother.' He gave her his arm, and led her away.|$|E
6000|$|... "My good fellow," [...] said Adrian, {{with quiet}} scorn, [...] "I wish {{that you were}} ignorant only, and I {{think it would be}} no {{difficult}} task to prove to you, that you speak <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not understand.

6000|$|... "Perhaps not, but I don't think, if {{you will}} allow me to say so, my dear colonel, that YOU have been {{treating}} the whole affair very seriously.

But that you have not been influenced in your JUDGMENT <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> know, I cannot believe?" [...] He drew nearer Pendleton, and laid his hand upon his arm. [...] "I beg you to be frank with me, {{for the sake of the}} person whose interests I see you have at heart. In what way will the discovery I have just made affect them?

The next day, Duffy told the Senate that Harper personally told Duffy to repay the money, quoting him as saying, [...] "It's not about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> It's about the perception <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> that's been created in the media.

6000|$|Ah, then it {{was that}} the cup of her conviction, full to the brim, overflowed at a touch! THERE was his idea, the {{clearness}} of which for an instant almost dazzled her. It was a blur of light, in the midst of which she saw Charlotte like some object marked, by contrast, in blackness, saw her waver in the field of vision, saw her removed, transported, doomed. And he had named Charlotte, named her again, and she had MADE him--which was all she had needed more: {{it was as if she}} had held a blank letter to the fire and the writing had come out still larger than she hoped. The recognition of it took her some seconds, but she might when she spoke have been folding up these precious lines and restoring them to her pocket.

6000|$|... "Foolish fellow!" [...] he said, turning with {{a blazing}} {{gaze to the}} {{heavy-faced}} man. [...] "You talk like a child <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not understand.

You have let it out. You know when it is gone. But you have not seen it. Then why {{do you believe in}} it? You do not see a sound, yet you believe in it. Do not lift your stupid face; I know what you would say: you hear the sound, therefore it exists. A deaf man does not hear the sound. Does it therefore not exist? That which produces the sound is there, though the deaf man neither sees nor hears, nor feels nor tastes, nor smells it. My friend, the man of God, says he thinks the cause of sound is motion in the air passing from particle to particle, till the last particle next my ear is moved, and then--I hear. Is there, then, no motion in the air to cause sound because the deaf man does not hear? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{gave her}} the Bayéte, though who she might be I did not know, since I {{did not think it}} wise to stay to ask her if it were hers of right, {{although}} I should have liked to do so. Then she said: 'The Old Man on the plain yonder and those two pale White Ones have talked to you of their love for your master, the Lord Macumazana. I tell you, little Yellow Dog, that they do not know what love can be. There is more love for him in my eyes alone than they have in all that makes them fair. Say it to the Lord Macumazana that, as I know well, he goes down to battle and that the Lady Mameena will be with him in the battle as, though he saw her not, she has been with him in other battles, and will be with him till the River of Time has run {{over the edge of the}} world and is lost beyond the sun. Let him remember this when Jana rushes on and death is very near to him to-day, and let him look--for then perchance he shall see me. Begone now, Yellow Dog, to the heels of your master, and play your part well in the battle, for <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> or leave undone you shall give account to me. Say that Mameena sends her greetings to the Lord Macumazana and that she adds this, that when the Old Man and the White ones told you that Love is the secret blood of the worlds which makes them to be they did not lie. Love reigns and I, Mameena, am its priestess, and the heart of Macumazana is my holy house.' ...|$|E
