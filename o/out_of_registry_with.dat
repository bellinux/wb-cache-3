40|$|AbstractWhen micron-scale {{compositional}} heterogeneity {{develops in}} membranes, {{the distribution of}} lipids on one face of the membrane strongly affects the distribution on the other. Specifically, when lipid membranes phase separate into coexisting liquid phases, domains in each monolayer leaflet of the membrane are colocalized with domains in the opposite leaflet. Colocalized domains have never been observed to spontaneously move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry.</b> This result indicates that the lipid compositions in one leaflet are strongly coupled to compositions in the opposing leaflet. Predictions of the interleaflet coupling parameter, Λ, vary {{by a factor of}} 50. We measure the value of Λ by applying high shear forces to supported lipid bilayers. This causes the upper leaflet to slide over the lower leaflet, moving domains <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry.</b> We find that the threshold shear stress required to deregister domains in the upper and lower leaflets increases with the inverse length of domains. We derive a simple, closed-form expression relating the threshold shear to Λ, and find Λ = 0. 016 ± 0. 004 kBT/nm 2...|$|R

40|$|Simulations {{have shown}} that as two metal {{surfaces}} approach each other, the surface layers can avalanche together when the rigid interfacial spacing falls below a critical distance.

The sparseness of energy minima and the large variations in the center-of-mass positions of these minima vs molecular size for molecules that are incommensurate with the surface suggests a strong coupling in these molecules between surface mobility and shape or size fluctuations resulting from molecular vibrations. We also find that the variation in the binding energy with respect to molecular size decreases more rapidly with molecular size for molecules with a higher degree <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> <b>with</b> the surface.

40|$|AbstractThere {{is clear}} {{evidence}} of an interleaflet coupling in model lipid/cholesterol membranes exhibiting liquid-liquid phase separation. The strength of this coupling is quantified by the mismatch free energy, γ. We calculate it using a molecular mean-field model of a phase-separated lipid/cholesterol bilayer and obtain values that increase as the concentration of saturated lipids in the coexisting phases is increased. These values lie in the range 0. 01 – 0. 03 kBT/nm 2. We clarify {{the relationship between the}} interleaflet coupling and the extent of interleaflet alignment of liquid domains by analyzing a statistical mechanical model of coupled fluctuating domain interfaces. The model is solved exactly using the correspondence between statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, yielding an expression for the characteristic size <b>of</b> fluctuations <b>out</b> <b>of</b> domain <b>registry.</b> This length scale depends only weakly on the strength of the interleaflet coupling and inevitably is only of the order of nanometers, which explains the experimental result that fluctuations <b>out</b> <b>of</b> domain <b>registry</b> have not been observed by optical microscopy...|$|R
