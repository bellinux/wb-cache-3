40|$|You {{have to feel}} it in {{your heart}} - {{a case study of}} the {{employees}} perception about Umeå university, the internal communication and how the communication contributes to this perception”. This study is based on that deficiency is common in internal communication in a authority that consists of several different units and different <b>occupational</b> <b>levels.</b> In an authority there is variety of units, employees with different <b>occupational</b> <b>levels,</b> a hierarchical structure and laws and regulations that must be followed. Because of these characteristics, a clear internal profile might be of extra importance. The internal profile will reflect the external perception, the authority’s image. This study examines how the internal communication of an authority like Umeå University works. The aim was to find out the employees perception of Umeå University and what their perceptions of the internal communication are. The method to examine this has mainly been based on group interviews conducted with focus groups representing different <b>occupational</b> <b>levels.</b> In summary the interviews indicate that there is a common perception of the university's identity among the different <b>occupational</b> <b>levels.</b> For example, words like: young, wide, open and norrländskt. These words were not based on any official core values of the university but were brought up by the participants. Umeå university have a vision which all participants had seen before and recognized, "The University of Umeå face the future with boundless knowledge". But they found it hard to grasp the vision with related goals, they felt overall and difficult to apply in their daily work. The results showed that the focus groups believe that there are many different subcultures at Umeå University. One reason for the formation of subcultures may simply be that Umeå University is an authority and there are certain factors that affect the University's properties.

However, kitchen rocks were used during the later occupations of Semi-Subterranean Structure 1. Rectangular Structures were spaced further apart than the pithouses, but were not spaced as far apart as Semi-Subterranean structures. No recognizable internal storage features were encountered in either Rectangular Structure 1 or 2. This implies that either storage was practiced in a form that did not leave a recognizable archaeological signature, or all storage was exterior. Both of the Rectangular Structures contained kitchen rocks.|$|R

However, research on the impact of influx of migrants on the labour market outcomes of a local industry post-disaster is limited internationally and locally. The main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the impact of the Canterbury earthquakes on the changes in demographic composition and occupational structure for the local and foreign workers in the Greater Christchurch construction industry. Replicating the discrete dependent variable regression methods used in the study by Sisk and Bankston III (2014), this study also aimed to compare their findings on the impact of the influx of migrants on the New Orleans construction industry with outcomes in Greater Christchurch. Customised data from New Zealand Censuses 2006 and 2013 were used to represent the pre- and post-earthquake periods. This study found that the rebuild has provided opportunities for migrant workers to enter the Greater Christchurch construction industry. The increased presence of migrant construction workers did not displace the locals. In fact, the likelihoods for both locals’ and migrants’ participation in the industry improved post-earthquakes. The earthquakes also increased overall workers’ participation at the lowest end of the occupational structure. However, the earthquakes created few significant changes to the distribution of local and migrant workers at the various <b>occupational</b> <b>levels</b> in the industry. Local workers still dominated all <b>occupational</b> <b>levels</b> post-earthquakes. The aggregated education levels of the construction workers were higher post-earthquakes, particularly among the migrant workers. Overall, migrant workers in the Greater Christchurch construction industry were more diverse, more educated and participated in higher <b>occupational</b> <b>levels</b> than migrants assisting in the New Orleans rebuild, due possibly to differences in immigration policies between New Zealand and the United States of America...|$|R

40|$|Depression may be {{complicated}} by work-related stress and, in turn, depression {{is a leading}} cause of disability in workplaces. Though available effective treatments, only one third of patients reach full remission after a first treatment trial and nearly half of the patients are non-responders. <b>Occupational</b> <b>level</b> {{has been found to be}} a reliable predictor of health outcome in the general population. In the present study we tested the potential association of <b>occupational</b> <b>level</b> of those in work with response to treatment of depression in a large multinational sample. Major depressive disorder patients (n= 654) stratified in three occupational levels (high, middle, low) were considered for the present study. Response to last treatment for current episode and treatment resistant depression, defined as non-response to 2 or more previous adequate treatment trials, were considered the outcome variables. Depressed patients from the high <b>occupational</b> <b>level</b> had a higher level of educational achievement. They showed a significantly poorer response to the last treatment with lower remission rates and more treatment resistance than the other <b>occupational</b> <b>level</b> groups. They were treated less with Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SRIs). Potential confounding factors did not influence the main effect. The present findings indicate that those working at a high <b>occupational</b> <b>level</b> may be a risk factor for poor response to medication for depression and this has potential implications for clinicians and their patients, for future research, for employers and for public policy.

A study was undertaken to identify personal characteristics which distinguished nurses who were functioning at different <b>occupational</b> <b>levels.</b> The personal characteristics selected as variables were: achievement motivation, job involvement, leadership style, sex-role identification, age, and education. The <b>occupational</b> <b>levels</b> selected were: nurses in middle management, first-line management, and non-management positions. Five hundred sixteen professional registered nurses in two community hospitals in a major metropolitan area completed a self-administered questionnaire. A discriminant analysis was used to test the hypothesis of the study and identify which variables were the best discriminators. Two significant discriminant functions were identified which explained 15 % of the variance between the groups. The results indicated that nurses who were functioning in management positions saw themselves as more structured and ascribing to characteristics which were more like those of managers and men in our society than did the nurses in a non-management position. The nurse managers also perceived themselves as lower in consideration and the characteristics that were more like those of managers and women in our society.

Data were gathered by the use of the Paragraph Completion Test (a projective measure of complexity). One hundred persons who had been assessed by the assessment center within the period 1980 - 1985 were contacted; 63 returned instruments were scored by two raters trained in the scoring protocol. Differences in rater scoring were resolved by the raters using a consensus reaching process. Analysis was a 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVA with the independent variables being gender, <b>occupational</b> <b>level,</b> and conceptual level. ^ Results of the study indicated that neither gender, <b>occupational</b> <b>level,</b> nor Conceptual Level were directly related (main effect) to assessment center performance.
