5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} left by the Germans was disposed <b>of</b> <b>as</b> scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the entrances to the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E

There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, and Detroit Tigers were looking for a manager, but nothing came of them.|$|E

5|$|An elf (plural: elves) {{is a type}} of human-shaped supernatural {{being in}} Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem {{generally}} to have been thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} seen as symbols, and used as such, though {{perceptions}} of bird species vary widely across cultures: some birds have a positive image in some regions, a negative image in others. Owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought <b>of</b> <b>as</b> thieves across much of Europe, and harbingers of war in Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|Capybaras are gregarious.

Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus. They can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.|$|E
