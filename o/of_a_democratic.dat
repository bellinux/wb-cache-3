5|$|Chandler entered {{politics}} when he {{was named}} chairman of the Woodford County Democratic Committee. In 1928, he was appointed master commissioner of the Woodford County circuit court. The following year, he was elected as a Democrat to represent the Twenty-second district in the Kentucky Senate. As {{a member of the}} Senate, he was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> coalition that passed legislation to strip Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson of many of his statutory powers.|$|E
5|$|Governor Breathitt died of {{tuberculosis}} on February 21, 1834, and Morehead {{was sworn in}} as governor the following day. The replacement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> governor with one from the rival National Republican party caused a great deal of angst among Democrats, but the ascendancy of Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead's willingness to retain Breathitt's secretary of state, Lewis Saunders, did much to allay their fears.|$|E
5|$|The country's current {{political}} structure {{dates to the}} adoption <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a unitary parliamentary republic {{with a high degree}} of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. It is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; a founding state of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE); and has taken a seat at the UN Security Council three times.|$|E

5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial in Moscow in June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Free {{from any}} {{constitutional}} duties {{during the time}} between sessions, Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor almost {{from the beginning of}} his term as lieutenant governor. Laffoon, however, had {{made it clear that he}} favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor. Rhea secured the services of rising political boss Earle C. Clements as his campaign manager. Hailing from Morganfield, only a short distance from Chandler's hometown of Corydon, Clements later said that if Chandler had asked him first, he might have managed Chandler's campaign instead of Rhea's. Instead, by virtue of managing the opposing campaign, Clements became the leader <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E

5|$|Shepard {{resigned}} from his federal post {{to run in}} the 1951 election in Philadelphia. The Democrats nominated him for the recorder of deeds post which, unlike the Washington position, was elected by the voters. He was victorious in the election, winning as a part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> wave that swept the Republican Party from power {{for the first time in}} 67 years. The job, a former county-level position, was eliminated and the department consolidated into city government in 1953. Shepard was named to the equivalent civil service position, Commissioner of Records, after the consolidation.|$|E
5|$|As the 1931 gubernatorial {{election}} approached, Chandler and Prestonsburg native Jack Howard {{were mentioned}} as candidates for lieutenant governor. Congressman Fred M. Vinson backed Howard, a fellow Eastern Kentuckian, while political bosses Billy Klair, Johnson N. Camden, Jr., and Ben Johnson supported Chandler. The support of another political boss, Mickey Brennan, gave Chandler the edge at the party's nominating convention. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ruby Laffoon also owed his selection to the machinations of the state's political bosses, notably his uncle, Congressman Polk Laffoon. Problematically, Chandler was {{an ally of}} former Governor J. C. W. Beckham, Louisville Courier-Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham, and political boss Percy Haly, which put him at odds with Laffoon, a member <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> faction headed by Russellville political boss Thomas Rhea and opposed to Beckham, Worth, and Haly. Despite disharmony within the ticket, the worsening of the Great Depression under Republican President Herbert Hoover and Governor Sampson ensured a Democratic victory. Chandler was elected over John C. Worsham {{by a vote of}} 426,247 to 353,573. In a break with precedent, Chandler set up an office on the executive floor of the state capitol and worked there full-time; previous lieutenant governors had stayed in Frankfort only during legislative sessions, when they were charged with presiding over the state senate.|$|E
5|$|In 1837, Sherman {{left school}} {{and found a}} job as a junior {{surveyor}} on construction of improvements to the Muskingum River. Because he had obtained the job through Whig Party patronage, the election <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> governor in 1838 meant that Sherman {{and the rest of his}} surveying crew were discharged from their jobs in June 1839. The following year, he moved to Mansfield to study law in the office of his older brother, Charles Taylor Sherman. He was admitted to the bar in 1844 and joined his brother's firm. Sherman quickly became successful at the practice of law, and by 1847 had accumulated property worth $10,000 and was a partner in several local businesses. By that time, Sherman and his brother Charles were able to support their mother and two unmarried sisters, who now moved to a house Sherman purchased in Mansfield. In 1848, Sherman married Margaret Cecelia Stewart, the daughter of a local judge. The couple never had any biological children, but adopted a daughter, Mary, in 1864.|$|E

5|$|Lafayette was a {{firm believer}} in a {{constitutional}} monarchy. He believed that traditional and revolutionary ideals could be melded together by having a democratic National Assembly work with a monarch, as France had always had. His close relationships to Americans such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who both happened to be Founding Fathers of the United States, gave Lafayette the ability to witness the implementation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> system in a country. His views on potential government structures for France were directly influenced by the American form of government, which was in turn influenced by the British form of government. For example, Lafayette believed in a bicameral legislature, as the United States had. The Jacobins, however, detested the idea of a monarchy in France; this led to it ultimately being voted against by the National Assembly. This idea only helped lead to his fall from favor, especially when Maximilien Robespierre took power.|$|E
5|$|To dispel {{concerns}} {{about his age}} (74), failing eyesight, and heart problems, Barkley arrived in Chicago for the 1952 Democratic National Convention and briskly walked seven blocks from the bus station to his campaign headquarters. The attempt was rendered moot on July 20 {{when a group of}} labor leaders, including United Automobile Workers President Walter Reuther, issued a statement calling Barkley too old and requesting that Democrats nominate someone younger like Stevenson. At a meeting with labor leaders the next morning, Barkley failed to persuade them to retract the statement, which caused delegations from large industrial states like Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania to waver on their commitments to Barkley. On July 21, he announced his withdrawal from the race. Invited to make a farewell address on July 22, he received a 35-minute ovation when he took the podium and 45-minute one at the speech's end. In a show of respect, a Missouri delegate nominated Barkley for president and House Majority Leader McCormack seconded it, but Stevenson was easily nominated. A month after the convention, Barkley hosted a Stevenson picnic and campaign rally at his home in Paducah and later introduced him at a rally in Louisville. Despite Barkley's predictions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> victory, Stevenson lost in overwhelming fashion to Republican Dwight Eisenhower.|$|E
