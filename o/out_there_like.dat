500|$|In one scene, Leslie {{claims she}} unsuccessfully {{tried to contact}} Oprah Winfrey, the popular billionaire {{television}} host, to seek publicity for the harvest festival. Upon failing to contact Winfrey, Leslie said, [...] "I'm putting it <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>like</b> The Secret, and hopefully she'll call me." [...] The Secret is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne that became a best-seller after it was featured on two episodes of The Oprah Winfrey Show. At one point, Tom reveals he shops for clothes at Brooks Brothers Boys, the chain of Brooks Brothers that produces clothes specifically for young boys. Several Pawnee residents in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] refer to using the search engine AltaVista, a site {{that had not been}} popular for several years, prompting Ben to ask, [...] "Why does everyone in this town use AltaVista? Is it 1997?" [...] The radio DJs Crazy Ira and The Douche play several sound effects during their show, and when Ben acts awkwardly during the interview, they play the sound effect used when Pac-Man is killed in the maze arcade games.|$|E
500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] {{was written}} by Williams, Carmen Reece, Al Sherrod Lambert and Harmony Samuels who also served as its producer. The song marked the third {{collaboration}} of the trio consisting of Williams, Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland, after their group Destiny's Child disbanded in 2006. Williams sent an advanced demo of the album Journey to Freedom to her former bandmates Beyoncé and Rowland which contained the song as a solo track titled [...] "When Jesus Says Yes". Later, Williams {{received a call from}} Rowland who said, [...] "We love 'When Jesus Says Yes'... {{there has to be a}} Destiny's Child mix of the song." [...] Both Rowland and Beyoncé recorded their respective verses in a studio afterwards. Williams stated she wanted to keep the project in secrecy [...] "until it was time" [...] to reveal it. During an interview with Rap-Up, Beyoncé spoke about her decision to be a featured artist on the song, stating, [...] "This song is so inspiring and... not enough music <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>like</b> this and I'm proud to be a part of it." [...] Williams talked about [...] "Say Yes" [...] with Fuse, saying, ...|$|E

5000|$|Danvers Fire Chief James P. Tutko {{toured the}} area by {{helicopter}} and said many residents {{would be kept}} from their homes for the foreseeable future. [...] "It looks like a war zone, that's the only thing I can say" [...] Tutko said. Fortunately, no one was killed. [...] "Somebody <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>likes</b> us", Tutko commented. Finally, he said that determining {{the cause of the}} explosion would take days.|$|R

50|$|The dining-hall set <b>out</b> <b>there</b> looked <b>like</b> a Cambridge dining-hall - and the {{establishment}} is about 100 years old founded by one Mechitar, whose picture is in the refectory.

2500|$|Her Morvern Callar {{director}} Lynne Ramsay praised Morton for {{her career}} choices, stating, [...] "I admire the choices she's made {{to work on}} independent projects with left-field directors rather than following the more conventional route of many other actresses", and also went onto say, [...] "she constantly challenges herself {{in a way that}} is rare these days", and praised Morton's lack of vanity, [...] "She is incredibly beautiful but never relies on that. There is no one else <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>like</b> her — She's a true muse and individual." [...] Her Minority Report co-star Tom Cruise said of Morton's talent that she is “lightning in a bottle”.|$|E
2500|$|With 19 Recordings {{continuing}} to manage him, DeWyze chose {{to take an}} optimistic view {{of the situation and}} saw it as an opportunity to finally make the record that he had always wanted to make. Feeling that he had been misunderstood as an artist, he returned to a folk rock sound, more comparable to what had been present on his independent albums. Many people were surprised to hear him release music in this style and drew comparisons to Mumford & Sons, but DeWyze responded, [...] "anyone can go back and listen to what I was doing when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, {{those are the kind of}} records that I was making then. I just wasn't able to put them <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>like</b> I am now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unterberger {{concluded}} that the song [...] "is about a relationship that’s troubled by matters of emotional and/or physical distance, but that the singer feels strongly enough about {{to keep it going}} just the same…until the chorus, at which point he decides that it’s not worth the trouble. No, it doesn’t make sense, but it’s still stirring, beautiful in its own weird way, and undeniably unforgettable. And frankly, we wouldn’t want it any other way." [...] Kevin Richardson, member of the band, explained in an interview that, [...] "Ultimately the song really doesn't make much sense." [...] Richardson also wrote that Max Martin, who co-wrote and co-produced the song, barely spoke English. [...] "His English has gotten much better, but at the time...," [...] said Richardson. [...] "There are a lot of songs <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>like</b> that don't make sense," [...] he continues, [...] "but make you feel good when you sing along to them, and that's one of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|From there, word-of-mouth spread. In 2003, the {{non-profit}} Foundation for US Historical Monuments {{was formed to}} help bring about the monument's creation. After their efforts faltered, an anonymous [...] group of Wall Street bankers who lost friends and co-workers in the [...] 9/11 attacks learned about his sculpture. They commissioned Blumberg to build a large-scale version for a monument near Ground Zero, paying $500,000 for the work. The Gary Sinese Foundation and the Green Beret Foundation supported the effort to build the monument. No public funds were used. Two of the individual Wall Street supporters said they were asked by families and friends {{if there was a}} place that individuals could go to remember the U.S. troops overseas who daily combat potential terrorist threats. [...] "We wanted to do something for the special operations community and all military service branches, because every day since 9/11, we've had to look at that hole in the ground," [...] one of the private backers says. [...] "What everyone needs to know is: There are people <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>like</b> this team, like the Green Berets, that are willing to sacrifice at all costs for them." [...] At its rededication, the statue's entire cost of over $750,000 was paid by hundreds of private citizens.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with the}} film, this claim is {{completely}} untrue. Showrunner Noah Hawley {{continued to use}} the Coens' device, saying it allowed him to [...] "tell a story in a new way." [...] Hawley has played with the realism of the story further; responding to queries about Charlie Gerhardt, a character from season 2, he stated [...] "If he’s <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> I’d <b>like</b> to get a letter from him someday, telling me how he turned out.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The All About Jazz {{review by}} Paul Olson states [...] "The {{greatest}} compliment {{that can be}} paid to Simulated Progress {{is that there is}} nothing else <b>out</b> <b>there</b> that sounds <b>like</b> it.

50|$|The Ptolemaic Terrascope for its {{blending}} {{of new and}} old fandom. I admired {{the early days of}} Creation, Flying Nun, and Sub Pop - before they all got corporate.

And Xpressway Records - that sort of cottage industry approach unfettered by the need for large budgets or anything other than the sheer joy of getting something I thought to be cool <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> <b>Like</b> record collecting in reverse.|$|E
