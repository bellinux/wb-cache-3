40|$|Despite well-articulated social inclusionist and anti-bias agendas {{in early}} childhood, the needs <b>of</b> <b>young</b> gifted {{children}} in prior-to-school settings {{appear to have}} been neglected. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the tensions and contradictions that seem to exist between educators working in the fields of early childhood education and gifted education. Areas in which misunderstandings may occur regarding the education <b>of</b> <b>young</b> gifted children are discussed: the identification <b>of</b> <b>young</b> gifted children, the labelling <b>of</b> <b>young</b> gifted children, the application of appropriate gifted education strategies in the early childhood context, the application of current early childhood approaches to meeting the needs <b>of</b> <b>young</b> gifted children, and the socialisation <b>of</b> <b>young</b> potentially gifted children in the educational setting. Recommendations are offered regarding ways in which educators in the two fields might collaborate more effectively to cater appropriately to the unique characteristics <b>of</b> <b>young</b> gifted children. 16 page(s...|$|R

30|$|Discussion Only a {{small number}} <b>of</b> <b>young</b> intensivists, members <b>of</b> the FICS, have {{answered}} the questionnaire, which {{represents one of the}} main limitations of this survey.

Positive points were, however, that the questionnaire was not only declarative, but that it also evaluated the actual knowledge <b>of</b> <b>young</b> intensivists. This survey therefore provides a picture <b>of</b> <b>young</b> intensivists’ knowledge, daily practices, and feelings regarding the end of life management.|$|R

5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age in that they are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber <b>of</b> <b>younger</b> and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to withstand a high intensity fire.|$|E
