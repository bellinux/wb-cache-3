40|$|This study uses a vector error {{correction}} (VEC) model to examine price-volume relation-ships between <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> and e-trading at the Chicago Board of Trade. We test whether equilibrium price corrections on one system {{are independent of}} the other, and whether this price behavior is more sensitive to changes in screen-based volume as opposed to <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> volume. Error correction terms capture an asymmetric price adjustment process led by <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> trading. <b>Open</b> <b>outcry</b> volume (market depth) also results in price discovery by dampening price volatility on both markets. These aspects of market microstructure are relevant in identifying how newly introduced e-trading systems operate in relation to established <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>systems,</b> and how e-trading systems may affect the economic performance of futures exchanges generally...|$|R
40|$|On March 18, 2004, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange {{launched}} {{trading in}} Eurodollar futures contracts {{in an attempt}} to compete with a U. S. rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange responded to the challenge by introducing several policy changes that aided the transfer of its trading volume in Eurodollar futures from <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> to the electronic trading platform, Globex, thereby retaining its market share. We compare trading volume, effective spread, and price discovery in Eurodollar futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange before and after the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange began trading the same contract. We find a general increase in trading volume on Globex beginning October 2003, way before the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange launched its contract. Globex provides greater price discovery than <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> during the entire time period under study. Our research thus supports the global trend of conversion of traditional <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>systems</b> into electronic exchanges.

50|$|These traders {{are subject}} to a {{screening}} process before {{he or she can}} trade on the exchange.

50|$|As of 2007 few exchanges {{still had}} floor trading using open outcry. The {{supporters}} of electronic trading {{claim that they}} are faster, cheaper, more efficient for users, and less prone to manipulation by market makers and broker/dealers. However, many traders advocate for the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>system</b> {{on the basis that}} the physical contact allows traders to speculate as to a buyer/seller's motives or intentions and adjust their positions accordingly. As of 2010 most stocks and futures contracts were no longer traded using open outcry due to the lower cost of the aforementioned technological advances.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{products}} traded at the exchange were futures contracts on hard red winter wheat [...] - [...] the principal ingredient of bread [...] - [...] {{as well as}} options derived from these. The hard red winter wheat contract now trades on the Chicago Board of Trade Designated Contract Market (DCM). Because of its nutritional value, the hard red winter wheat usually trades at a premium to the Chicago Board of Trade's soft red winter wheat. The exchange facilitated the transfer of ownership of the futures and options contracts through the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Although mostly {{electronic}} since 2006, the NYMEX {{maintained a}} small venue, or [...] "pit", that still practiced the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> trading <b>system,</b> in which traders employ shouting and complex hand gestures {{on the physical}} trading floor.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relative}} merits of an automated versus an <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> trading <b>system</b> for a derivatives contract which is traded simultaneously at two competing exchanges. The only characterizing difference between these exchanges is the mode of operation. The domestic exchange (listing the underlying asset) operates by automated trading, the foreign exchange uses <b>open</b> <b>outcry.</b> Investigations are made to determine whether this operational competition supports a trading system segmentation hypothesis. First, quote setting is investigated {{to determine whether or not}} it is related to the transparency of the trading system. Second, analysis is carried out to determine whether the transparency of the trading system influences the lead/lag relationship in returns and volatility between the two markets. Both hypotheses are empirically tested for the Bund futures contract as it is traded in London (LIFFE) and Frankfurt (DTB). ...|$|R

50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, {{many of the}} largest exchanges have adopted {{electronic}} 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>system.</b> Electronic trading now accounts {{for the majority of}} trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.|$|E
50|$|Operating during regular {{trading hours}} (RTH), the open outcry method {{consists}} of floor traders {{standing in a}} trading pit to call out orders, prices, and quantities of a particular commodity. Different colored jackets are worn by the traders to indicate what firm {{they are a part}} of. In addition, complex hand signals (called Arb) are used. These hand signals were first used in the 1970s. Today, however, headsets are also used by the brokers to communicate with the traders. The pits are areas of the floor that are lowered to facilitate communication, somewhat like a miniature amphitheater. The pits can be raised and lowered depending on trading volume. To an onlooker, the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>system</b> can look chaotic and confusing, but in reality the system is a tried and true method of accurate and efficient trading. An illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CME's trading pits has been compiled.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{trading floor}} {{was in the}} Trade Center on Váci Street, {{followed}} by its move in 1992 to the atmospheric old building at Deák Ferenc Street in Belváros-Lipótváros, where it continued its operations for 15 years. In March, 2007 the BSE moved to the former Herczog Palace at 93 Andrássy Avenue. The <b>Open</b> <b>outcry</b> <b>system</b> of the physical trading floor that characterized the spot market functioned with partial electronic support until 1995. From 1995 until November, 1998 securities trading took place concurrently on the trading floor and in a remote trading system, when the new MultiMarket Trading System (MMTS), based entirely on remote trading was launched. The traditional “battlefield rumble” of the physical trading floor ceased within a year by September 1999, at which time physical trading was entirely replaced by the electronic remote trading platform of the derivatives market. Derivatives market of the BSE in futures and options contracts has been available to investors since 1995. BUX contracts have been available for trading {{since the start of}} the futures market on 31 March 1995. In July, 1998 the BSE was among the first exchanges in the world to introduce contracts based on individual equities. Another series of standardised derivatives in the options market appeared in February, 2000 and on 6 September 2004 trading commenced in the exchange’s second index, the BUMIX. In January, 2010, BSE became a member of the CEE Stock Exchange Group.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{widespread}} transfer of trading to electronic platforms {{it is important}} to ask whether such trading is more efficient than traditional <b>open</b> <b>outcry.</b> To empirically assess this we examine the Crude Palm Oil market from 1995 : 06 to 2008 : 07 - a market where all trading swapped over from <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> to electronic trading at the end of 2001. Results indicate that both forms of trading are long-run efficient but that short-run inefficiencies do exist. Our main findings, derived from the application of a novel threshold autoregressive relative efficiency measure, is that market efficiency is conditional on (i) the volatility of the underlying asset (ii) the maturity of the futures contract and (iii) the market trading system. Specifically, bootstrap results from the efficiency measure suggest that the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> trading method is superior for shorter maturities when volatility is high, and indistinguishable from electronic trading when volatility is low or maturity is long. These results suggest that electronic trading should not supersede <b>open</b> <b>outcry,</b> but rather that there are clear benefits to their coexistence...|$|R
40|$|This study compares {{liquidity}} costs and other characteristics of electronic and <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> hard red winter wheat futures contracts {{traded on the}} Kansas City Board of Trade. Liquidity costs are considerably lower in the electronic market than in the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> market. A new approach is used to estimate {{liquidity costs}} which eliminates bias resulting from splitting of orders in electronic markets. The liquidity costs are still considerably lower after correcting the bias in electronic market. Liquidity costs were higher in after-hours trading as compared to regular trading hours suggesting a negative impact of volume on liquidity costs. Volatility of futures prices and volume per trade are positively related to liquidity costs, while a negative relation is found between daily volume and liquidity costs. Round-number pricing is more prevalent in the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> market. Daily volumes were found distinctively higher during the rolling period {{as a result of}} Goldman-Sachs Roll.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} design {{exploration}} for electronic futures exchange {{which is currently}} implemented a physical <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> pit. The goal structure is characterized by competition {{at the individual level}} and cooperation at the group level. Individuals compete for trades in order to earn money, but must also agree to undertake a significant number of trades which do not earn them money in order to sustain the market. This goal structure makes the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> market an example of a social dilemma. We analyze the social interaction fabric that exists in the <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> environment and identify a set of intents that characterize the system. We then discuss how the affordances of the physical environment support the satisfaction of the intents. In the design exploration we examine which of these intents are still applicable in an electronic implementation and discuss how the affordances of this medium shape possible designs...|$|R
40|$|The European {{stock and}} {{commodity}} exchanges are nearly all electronic. Electronic trading also accounts {{for most of}} the volume on the Chicago exchanges. A closer look however, shows that a market traded through numerous widely dispersed computer screens is not necessarily more efficient or more liquid, particularly in the longer-dated months, than an <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> market that requires substantial physical space, a cadre of highly skilled traders, and a large and highly skilled support staff employed by both the firms represented on the floor as well as the exchange itself. The experience at NYMEX shows that there is a place for both <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> and electronic trading.

40|$|Screen-based futures {{markets are}} gaining trading volumes {{at the expense}} of {{traditional}} <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> floor markets. In comparison with <b>open</b> <b>outcry</b> trading – used on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the world largest futures market – electronic markets offer enhanced transparency, and greater access to users, who can enter orders directly. Screen markets can also maintain strict time priorities among submitted orders, and can provide incentives for users to place competitive orders and enhance the price discovery process. We describe several new screen-based markets, and examine in detail the Cantor Financial Futures Exchange (CFFE), a recently introduced screen market for Treasury futures contracts. The CFFE trading rules and order matching algorithm are shown to provide important incentives to place competitive quotes and supply liquidity.
