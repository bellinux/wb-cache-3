40|$|Site-Specific {{nitrogen}} (N) management seemingly {{has many}} positive attributes, but is only slowly being adopted by producers.

Several commercial products and approaches are available to help producers evaluate the technologies. These include components that might be used to assess N needs, make variable-rate N recommendations, and variably apply products for entities that would like to build their own programs. <b>Others</b> include <b>commercial</b> <b>services</b> that provide a comprehensive package of activities for producers who are not prepared to handle the intimidation component of new technologies or find it more convenient and less risky to hire others to provide the services. Users of the technologies have multiple options in terms of which inputs to the N recommendation process might logically include a spatial component and which do not. These options and considerations offer modified approaches that increase fertilizer use efficiency, minimize potential environmental consequences, and enhance profitability...|$|R
