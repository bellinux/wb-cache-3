40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} the study was to report a case of live birth {{following}} donor oocyte in vitro fertilization/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) in which the oo-cyte donor herself was conceived via IVF. To our knowledge, such a case has not been previously reported. Methods Retrospective chart review; this case is reported after chart review of a successful outcome. Results A 42 year-old woman, with diminished ovarian reserve, and her husband desired to conceive. She underwent a fresh IVF/ ICSI cycle with her own oocytes, which unfortunately was not fruitful in terms of pregnancy or cryopreserved embryos. The couple was counseled regarding the option of donor oocytes, and they elected to proceed with a fresh cycle of donor oocyte IVF/ICSI. The couple selected an anonymous <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> from a donor agency who was a first-time <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> and, interest-ingly, was conceived via IVF herself. The fresh donor oocyte/ IVF/ICSI cycle did not result in pregnancy; however, two super-numerary blastocysts were cryopreserved for future cycles. The recipient’s subsequent frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) re-sulted in a singleton gestation and live birth. Conclusions An <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> who was conceived via IVF had good ovarian response to stimulation, a good number of oocytes retrieved, and the formation and cryopreservation of blastocysts which, in a subsequent FETcycle, resulted in pregnancy and live birth for a recipient couple. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported of live birth with the use of donor oocytes from an <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> who herself was conceived via IVF...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{opinions on}} the acceptable number of donation offspring in a national cohort of <b>oocyte</b> and sperm <b>donors.</b> DESIGN: A prospective follow-up study on a national cohort of gamete donors. SETTING: Sweden. METHODS: Study-specific questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Opinion on the acceptable number of offspring from one donor. RESULTS: About half of both <b>oocyte</b> and sperm <b>donors</b> expressed an opinion {{that the number of}} offspring from one donor should be limited to between one and 10, and many donors reported having no firm opinion. When controlling for age, educational level, marital status and biological children, <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> were four times more likely than sperm donors to support an upper limit of five offspring. For many sperm and <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> the number of offspring resulting from their donations was unknown (43. 2 % oocyte, 47. 1 % sperm). CONCLUSION: <b>Oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> have more restrictive opinions compared with sperm donors on the acceptable number of offspring from one donor. Donors perform a very humanitarian and societal act when donating their gametes. In the ambition to have safe and trustworthy clinics we need to have well known regulations to be able to recruit donors in the future...|$|R
40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} whether elevated serum estradiol (E 2) concentrations in <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> affect assisted reproduction outcome.

Results—Donors in group 1 produced significantly less <b>oocytes</b> than <b>donors</b> in group 2 (19. 3 ± 1. 7 vs 12. 0 ± 1. 4; P< 0. 001), and recipients of oocytes from group 1 had significantly fewer numbers of embryos available for transfer (10. 4 ± 1. 1 vs 6. 4 ± 0. 8; P= 0. 003). However, the mean number (3. 3) of embryos transferred and the pregnancy rate were the same in both groups.

Objective: To compare the age-related decline in antral follicle count (AFC), a biomarker of the ovarian reserve, in fertile and infertile women. Design: Cross-sectional {{data from a}} large prospective cohort study conducted from January 2013 to December 2014. Setting: Thirteen fertility centers across Spain. Patients or Other Participants: Consecutive women aged 18 to 45 years of age attending the fertility centers either seeking fertility treatment or as fertile women wishing to act as potential <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors.</b> Intervention(s) : Standardized AFC assessment on day 2 to 4 of the cycle. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Age-related decline of AFC for both fertile and infertile women. Results: A total of 15 500 women, of whom 5722 were potential donors and 9778 were patients seeking fertility treatment, participated in the study. Average AFC was greater in potential <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> than in infertile women (20 [interquartile range, 16 – 24] vs 10 [interquartile range, 6 – 15], respectively; P <. 001), a difference that was maintained after adjustment for age (P <. 001) in a model predicting log(AFC) from donor vs infertility, adjusting for 2 -year age bands. The age-related decline in AFC was much steeper in infertile women {{compared with that of}} potential <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors,</b> with an increased prevalence of a low ovarian reserve (AFC < 5) at all ages in infertile women.

40|$|There {{have been}} few studies on a {{possible}} maternal influ-ence on in vitro embryo production in cows. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the maternal influence on oo-cyte production and in vitro blastocyst formation rate using repeated ovum pick-up and in vitro fertilization. Six con-temporary cows raised on the same farm and with varied genetic origins were submitted to 42 weeks of ovum pick-up organized into four series. Collected oocytes were fertil-ized in vitro with spermatozoa from a different bull for each series. In total, 1933 oocytes were recovered from 3936 follicles with a recovery rate of 57. 2 % and a mean oocyte collection of 4. 6 ± 0. 2 (mean ± SEM) per animal per ses-sion. Animals were ranked according to their oocyte pro-duction. The best <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> was the same female in all four series. No relationship was identified between oocyte production and blastocyst production rate (r =− 0. 08). The mean blastocyst rate was 28. 8 % with significant variation among animals.

The results of the present study support the hypothesis that in cattle, the <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> influences the production of blastocysts.

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the ongoing}} ethical debates in {{medically}} assisted reproduction {{is whether or not}} <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> should receive financial compensations beyond their out-of-pocket expenses. In several jurisdictions, these compensations are justified with arguments of fairness and reciprocity, but concerns about a disproportionate recruitment of financially deprived women remain. Since recently, oocytes can be efficiently cryopreserved and thus oocytes are now increasingly being stored either as part of an IVF cycle or as a fertility preservation measure. Some of these oocytes will remain unused by the women from whom they were obtained. We consider whether reliance on donation of such spare oocytes may offer {{a way out of the}} debate. Materials and Methods: Literature regarding oocyte donation, financial compensation of <b>donors,</b> <b>oocyte</b> cryopreservation and donation of spare embryos was studied. Two central questions were discerned. First, does the rationale for compensating <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> also apply to <b>donors</b> of spare <b>oocytes?</b> In order to determine the relevant (dis) similarities, analogies are made with current oocyte donation practices (including egg sharing) where compensations are routinely given and with the practice of spare embryo donation, where compensations are absent. Second, is this new source of <b>donor</b> <b>oocytes</b> a valid alternative to current donor recruitment practices? If the answer to the first question is ‘no’ (<b>donors</b> of spare <b>oocytes</b> should not be compensated) and that to the second question is ‘yes’ (spare oocytes will become available), we can expect that the debate regarding financial compensations for <b>oocytes</b> <b>donors</b> will automatically come to an end in the coming years. Results: Although some of the arguments for financial compensation of <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> also apply to this specific case of spare oocyte donation, the claim that donors ought to be compensated is less strong due to the fact that there is no additional physical burden for these donors and that ‘left over’ material is concerned. Due to these two same reasons, it can also be expected that a higher percentage of women with spare oocytes in storage will consider donation than in the general population (that is, of women who do not have spare oocytes in storage) even in the absence of financial compensations. This new source of <b>donor</b> <b>oocytes</b> would not only offer a number of practical advantages, but would also avoid the implication of subjecting healthy women to a medical intervention that offers no health benefits for themselves and that may – on seldom occasions – even be harmful to them. Conclusions: An increased use of oocyte cryopreservation will lead to a stock of spare oocytes that is an ideal source of <b>donor</b> <b>oocytes.</b> Moreover, as there is no additional physical discomfort for the donors and as the oocytes are no longer of use to the donor herself, financial compensations are unwarranted in this particular case of oocyte donation. Therefore, if enough women are willing to donate their spare oocytes for reproduction by others, ethical concerns regarding financial compensation of <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> will become redundant...|$|R

40|$|SART-member {{fertility}} clinics, and all egg {{agencies that}} agreed {{to abide by}} the ASRM-SART egg donor compensation guidelines on behalf of herself and other oocyte donors [1]. The suit challenged the ASRM-SART <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> compensation guidelines, which limit payments to egg donors to $ 5, 000 ($ 10, 000 under special circumstances), as an illegal price-fixing agreement in violation of United States antitrust laws. These laws prohibit business practices that unreasonably restrict competition and result in higher consumer prices for products and services. In March 2013, the court denied the defendants ’ motion to dismiss the case, thus paving the way for the litigation to proceed [2]. Kamakahi’s suit, despite the hoopla accompanying it, is in many ways unexceptional, alleging a fairly straightforward violation of the Sherman Act’s prohibition against contracts, conspiracies, and combinations in restraint of trade [3]. But oocytes are hardly the common stuff of Sherman Act claims, and the application of federal antitrust law in such a new and unusual setting was bound to draw substantial attention [4].

40|$|Abstract Background Premature ovarian failure (POF) {{remains a}} {{clinically}} challenging entity because {{in vitro fertilisation}} (IVF) with donor oocytes is currently the only treatment known to be effective. Methods A 33 year-old nulligravid patient with a normal karyotype was diagnosed with POF; she {{had a history of}} failed fertility treatments and had an elevated serum FSH (42 mIU/ml). Oocytes donated by her dizygotic twin sister were used for IVF. The donor had already completed a successful pregnancy herself and subsequently produced a total of 10 oocytes after a combined FSH/LH superovulation regime. These eggs were fertilised with sperm from the recipient's husband via intracytoplasmic injection and two fresh embryos were transferred to the recipient on day three. Results A healthy twin pregnancy resulted from IVF; two boys were delivered by caesarean section at 39 weeks' gestation. Additionally, four embryos were cryopreserved for the recipient's future use. The sister-donor achieved another natural pregnancy six months after oocyte retrieval, resulting in a healthy singleton delivery. Conclusion POF is believed to affect approximately 1 % of reproductive age females, and POF patients with a sister who can be an <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> for IVF are rare. Most such IVF patients will conceive from treatment using oocytes from an anonymous <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor.</b> This is the first report of births following sister-donor oocyte IVF in Ireland.

Data from 1, 000 follicular aspiration sessions (OPU), including 500 in donor cows of the Holstein breed and 500 of the Gyr breed, were collected. The results were analyzed by the unpaired Student t-test and chi-square test, adopting a level of significance of 5 %. The mean number and standard deviation of recovered oocytes and oocytes suitable for culture were 15. 1 ± 13. 0 and 8. 7 ± 7. 6 for the Holstein breed and 15. 5 ± 11. 9 and 9. 1 ± 7. 9 for the Gyr breed. The rates of suitable oocytes were 57. 7 % and 58. 5 % for Holstein and Gyr breeds, respectively. A significant difference between breeds was observed for the number of oocytes suitable for culture (P 0. 05). Similarly, the breed of the <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> cow and bull influenced cleavage and blastocyst rates (PG 2, G 1 >G 3, G 1 >G 4, G 2 =G 3, G 2 >G 4, and G 3 >G 4.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{recently}} described {{two types of}} muscarinic responses in native Xenopus <b>oocytes</b> of different <b>donors</b> (common and variant) that display qualitative and quantitative differences (Lupu-Meiri et al., 1990). Here we characterized the muscarinic receptors mediating these two types. The anti-muscarinic toxins from Dentroaspis significantly inhibited responses in <b>oocytes</b> of common <b>donors,</b> but {{had little effect on}} responses in <b>oocytes</b> of variant <b>donors,</b> possibly indicating expression of different receptor subtypes. Using specific muscarinic antagonists, we found that <b>oocytes</b> of common <b>donors</b> exhibit a pattern compatible with the M 3 subtype of muscarinic receptors, while <b>oocytes</b> of variant <b>donors</b> appear to possess receptors of the M 1 subtype. To more directly determine the subtypes of muscarinic receptors in oocytes of both populations of donors, we have microinjected antisense oligonucleotides into native oocytes. Antisense oligonucleotides to unique sequences in the N-terminal and the third cytoplasmic loop of M 3 muscarinic receptors caused a significant inhibition of the response of common oocytes, but had virtually no effect on responses in <b>oocytes</b> of variant <b>donors.</b> Conversely, oligonucleotides complementary to the unique sequences of the m 1 muscarinic receptors inhibited the response in variant oocytes, but not in <b>oocytes</b> of common <b>donors.</b> We conclude that native Xenopus <b>oocytes</b> of different <b>donors</b> phenotypically express either M 3 -like (majority) or M 1 -like (minority) muscarinic receptor subtypes.

40|$|Several reports suggest {{increasing}} age in oocyte donors decreases {{the chances of}} in-vitro fertilization (IVF) success, while others describe no effect. The published data concerning gravidity and parity are similarly conflicting. To further address these questions, we retrospectively studied 445 consecutive donor IVF cycles at two large university-based IVF practices. Donor cycles were analysed {{for the number of}} oocytes retrieved, gravidity, parity, and age of the donor, and pregnancy outcome in recipients. The previous gravidity and parity of the donor were not associated with successful pregnancy in recipients. The number of oocytes retrieved was positively correlated with pregnancy. However, after adjusting for donor age, neither prior fertility nor the number of oocytes retrieved were significant predictors. In contrast, the donor's age was highly associated with recipient success. We conclude that the age of the <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> is a significant predictor of pregnancy success and should be a major factor in selecting prospective candidates.

40|$|Do the socio-demographic and fertility-related {{characteristics}} and motivations of <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> differ in European countries? The socio-demographic and fertility-related {{characteristics and}} motivations of <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> differ considerably across countries. There {{have been no}} other international studies comparing the characteristics of <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors.</b> Regarding their motivations, most studies indicate mixed motives. The proposed study was a transversal epidemiological study. Data were collected from 63 voluntarily participating assisted reproduction technology centres practising oocyte donation in 11 European countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, UK and Ukraine). The survey was conducted between September 2011 and June 2012 and ran for 16 calendar months depending {{on the number of}} cycles of oocyte donation performed at the centre. The sample size was computed in order to allow an estimate of the percentage of a relatively rare characteristic (2) with a precision (95 confidence interval) of 1. The calculation gave 1118 donors. In total, 1423 forms were obtained from <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors.</b> All consecutive donors in these centres filled out an anonymous questionnaire when they started their hormonal stimulation, asking for their socio-demographic and fertility-related characteristics, their motivations and compensation. Population characteristics were described and compared by country of donation. Motives for donation and mean amount of money were compared between countries and according to the donors characteristics. The socio-demographic and fertility-related characteristics and motivations of <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> varied enormously across European countries. The number of received forms corresponded with a participation rate of 61. 9 of the cycles performed by the participating centres. Mean age was 27. 4 years. About 49 of donors were fully employed, 16 unemployed and 15 student. The motivation in the total group of donors was 47. 8 pure altruism, 33. 9 altruism and financial, 10. 8 pure financial, 5. 9 altruism and own treatment and finally 2 own treatment only. About 15 of the donors were egg sharers (patient donors), mainly from the UK and Poland. Women were donating {{for the first time in}} 55. 4 of cases, for the second time in 20. 3 and for the third time in 12. 8. The motivation to donate was significantly related to being of foreign origin (P 0. 01), age (P 0. 001), living in couple or not (P 0. 01), level of education (P 0. 001) and number of donations (P 0. 001). The amount of compensation differed considerably between centres and/or countries. The general donor profile in this study was a well-educated, 27 -year-old woman living with her partner and child who mainly donated to help others. The selection of clinics in some countries and the limited participation rate may have led to a bias in donor characteristics. A possible effect of social desirability in the answers by the donors should be taken into account. The diversity of the donor population reflects the differences in European legislation (for example, on anonymity and payment) and economic circumstances. The differences in systems of reimbursement/payment demonstrate the need to have a thorough discussion on the specific meaning of these terms.

40|$|Reproductive technologies, such as ovum-pick-up (OPU) and {{in vitro}} embryo {{production}} (IVEP) are important tools to accelerate genetic gain associated with reproductive efficiency. The antral follicular population (AFP) can directly affect {{the success of}} OPU and {{may be used as}} a characteristic to select the <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> cows with greater reproductive potential that will be used in OPUIVEP programs. Although highly repeatable within animal, the AFP appears to be extremely variable across individuals. Thus, the investigation of consistent endocrine markers that can trustable predict AFP in cattle has been targeted in several recent studies. In this context, the plasmatic levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) have been reported to be correlated with the size of AFP and it has the potential of being an endocrine marker to help the identification of donor cows with greater number of follicles available for OPU, greater superovulation response and, consequently, increased in vivo and in vitro embryo production in cattle. This review summarizes recent information regarding AFP and its relationship with AMH, and the possibility of using AMH as a marker for the selection of donor cows that will start reproductive programs to disseminate genetics and eventually to enhance fertility in cattle...|$|E
5000|$|Avoiding OHSS {{typically}} requires interrupting the pathological sequence, such as {{avoiding the}} use of hCG. One alternative {{is to use a}} GnRH agonist instead of hCG. While this has been repeatedly shown to [...] "virtually eliminate" [...] OHSS risk, there is some controversy regarding the effect on pregnancy rates if a fresh non-donor embryo transfer is attempted, almost certainly due to a luteal phase defect. There is no dispute that the GnRH agonist trigger is effective for <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> and for embryo banking (cryopreservation) cycles.|$|R
40|$|ProblemEndometrial NK cells play a {{critical}} role in uterine vascularization producing angiogenic factors. Impact of ovarian stimulation on endometrial expression of NK cells and VEGF in normal fertile <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> and the effect of endometrial injury treatment on these parameters have been investigated. Method of studyEndometrial tissue was obtained from <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> during natural and stimulated cycles. NK cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. VEGF was determined by ELISA and flow cytometry. Endometrial angiogenic parameters were determined by ultrasound Doppler. Local injury was induced by scratching endometrial tissue previous to implantation window. ResultsOvarian stimulation decreased endometrial levels of NK cells and vascularization index but increased VEGF levels. Local injury normalized only the CD 56 + NK cell count. ConclusionHormonal therapy for ovarian stimulation may be associated with poor endometrial vascularization. Local injury before the implantation window seems not to influence endometrial angiogenic parameters altered by ovarian stimulation.

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: To review donor-egg {{assisted}} reproductive technology (ART) activity using young fertile donors (< 37 {{years of}} age) paired with multiple recipients. DESIGN: Age-matched cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary ART center at Cochin Hospital, Paris. PATIENT(S) : A total of 125 <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> and 361 age-matched control subjects. Donated oocytes {{were attributed to}} 163 different recipients undertaking 258 transfer cycles. INTERVENTION(S) : Donor-egg and regular ART. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) outcome-oocytes provided-was compared in donors and control subjects. Clinical pregnancy (cPR), ongoing pregnancy (oPR), and implantation (IR) rates per transfer in recipients were compared with age-matched controls. IRs were analyzed in the various recipients {{as a function of}} the number of oocytes harvested. RESULT(S) : COH outcome was similar in donors and control subjects. cPR (37. 5 %), oPR (28. 4 %), and IR (24. 4 %) were slightly but significantly lower in donor-egg recipients compared with control subjects (44. 9 %, 37. 4 %, and 31. 8 %, respectively). More embryos (average + 2. 06) were transferred fresh and fewer frozen. In recipients, IRs were independent from the number of oocytes received in the donor. CONCLUSION(S) : Multiplying recipients paired with <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> slightly lowered per-transfer outcome, but enabled more (average + 2. 06) embryos to be transferred fresh...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, oocyte donors donate voluntarily {{or receive}} varying amounts of oney for donation. This raises ethical {{questions}} regarding the appropriateness of financial compensation, {{and the possibility of}} undue inducement and xploitation of oocyte donors. Are these donors capable of making an independent, well-considered decision? Regarding this matter, it is important to examine aspects such as autonomy-connectedness and self-esteem. In this cross-sectional study, demographic characteristics and donation otivations were assessed in 92 women who attended the University Medical Center (UMC), Utrecht as potential oocyte donors between June 2012 and July 2016. Demographic characteristics were assessed. Motivations were recorded in semi-structured interviews (response rate 59 %). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was used to assess level of self-esteem. The Autonomy-Connectedness Scale was used to measure the level of autonomy-connectedness. The typical <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> at the UMC Utrecht is a well-educated, employed, 31 -year-old woman living with her partner in a completed family with two children, and donating on altruistic grounds. The donors showed higher autonomy-connectedness scores than the average female Dutch population and do not lack self-esteem (questionnaire response rate 66 %). Concerns regarding exploitation and attraction of women with lower socioeconomic status, with shortcomings in autonomy-connectedness and selfesteem, could not be confirmed in this group...|$|E
40|$|Much {{emphasis}} is currently {{given to the}} use of Interspecific Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (ISCNT) as a potential salvage tool for endangered animals. In this short review we present a survey on all data published so far on ISCNT, including abstract communication in international meetings. From the analysis of these data it appears that the results obtained are very preliminary and often confusing on the real stage of the embryonic development obtained. Moreover, the acronym ISCNT is improperly used because in many reports the nuclei and <b>oocyte</b> <b>donor</b> are not within the same species, but belong to different order and sometimes taxa, therefore, we classified all the ISCNT reports by allocating cell and oocyte donors to their respective order/species/class. The efficiency of cloning is low in all species owing to incomplete nuclear reprogramming of differentiated cells under the current procedures. ISCNT, however, poses additional hurdles which are rarely addressed in previously published work, and on which we focus in this review: mt/genomic DNA compatibility; embryonic genome activation of the donor nucleus by the recipient oocyte; availability of suitable foster mothers for ISCNT embryos. All these issues are discussed here, and possible solutions for the successful application of somatic cell nuclear transfer to endangered animals are also put forth. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Oocyte {{donation}} is {{a technique}} in full expansion {{in the field of}} human reproduction. The main problem with this technique is the shortage of oocytes. In our programme, prospective donors are selected from anonymous, well-informed university students over 18 years of age, who give their informed consent in writing. Before being accepted as donors, the candidates ' personal and family medical histories were taken and they were given a gynaecological examination, genital ultrasonography, and analysed for syphilis, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, hepatitis B and C, coagulation factor VIII, fetal haemoglobin and karyotype. The donors received economic compensation of about 750 euros. Over the last 6 years, 554 medical histories have been taken. Fifty-eight candidates (10. 5 %) were rejected because of previous family or personal pathologies. Only 243 out of 496 (49 %) continued the study. Sixteen candidates (7 %) were rejected as a result of gynaecological problems and ultrasonographic results; and 12 (4. 9 %) {{as a result of their}} blood test results; 215 donors were accepted (38. 8 % of the original population). Other options for recruiting oocyte donors are commented on and we argue that the methodology described here is the most suitable one.

40|$|Objective To explore oocyte and sperm donors' {{emotional}} stress, {{experiences of}} care and satisfaction after donation. Design Prospective multicenter study. Settings All fertility clinics performing gamete donation in Sweden during the period 2005 to 2008. Population Of 220 eligible <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> who were approached, 181 agreed to complete the first questionnaire and 165 completed the second questionnaire 2  months after oocyte donation. Of 156 eligible sperm donors 119 accepted to complete the first questionnaire before donation. Eighty-nine participants completed the second questionnaire 2  months after sperm donation. Methods Standardized and study-specific questionnaires. Main outcome measures Satisfaction with the donation, respondents' mental health and overall care. Results A larger percentage of sperm donors (97. 8 %) were satisfied with their overall experience of being a <b>donor</b> than <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> (85. 9 %, p =  0. 003). Some <b>oocyte</b> and sperm <b>donors</b> did not receive sufficient information about practical issues (9. 1 % and 13. 5 %, respectively) and future consequences (12. 8 % and 3. 4 %, respectively, p =  0. 014). The donors' symptoms of anxiety and depression did not show any differences in relation to negative or positive perceptions of satisfaction. The donors who did not indicate ambivalence before treatment were on average almost five times more satisfied compared with those who did indicate ambivalence (odds ratio 4. 71; 95 % CI 1. 34 – 16. 51). Conclusions Most donors were satisfied with their contribution after the donation. <b>Oocyte</b> and sperm <b>donors</b> who expressed ambivalence before donation were less satisfied after donation. In vitro fertilization staff fulfilled most of the donors' needs for information and care.

40|$|Introduction: This {{qualitative}} {{study was conducted}} to explore the motivations and experience of <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> donating to women known to them. Methods: Three women who donated oocytes to a close relative were interviewed and data were analysed using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis approach. Results: The two key elements noted were “motivations for donation” and “coping with the consequences of oocyte donation”. The motivation for donation was influenced by the familial bond that was strengthened by the donation process in some cases. The concept of altruistic oocyte donation stemmed from the narratives of giving the gift of motherhood and gaining a positive self-image and respect from others. Coping with the consequences of oocyte donation tests the donor identity, their wishes for a positive outcome, concerns regarding disclosure of biological motherhood and detachment from the egg and potential child. Discussion: Motivation is influenced by a combination of factors including the rewards of altruistic behaviour, the existence and potential strengthening of the relationship between donor and recipient, but possibly also, a sense of obligation and societal expectations. Oocyte donation can be variously viewed by donors as a unique way of reproductive empowerment or an example of acceding to subtle coercion and thus disempowerment. The study also highlights the clinical as well as ethical importance of providing support services for <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> and recipients...|$|R
40|$|Background: The study {{aim was to}} {{determine}} whether supraphysiological estradiol (E 2) levels reduce oocyte/embryo quality in oocyte donation cycles. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 330 consecutive fresh oocyte donation cycles was performed in an assisted reproductive treatment programme between January 1996 and December 2000. Throughout the study period, <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> and recipients followed a standard synchronization regimen that did not vary. A serum E 2 level (peak E 2) was obtained from all <b>oocyte</b> <b>donors</b> on the morning of HCG administration. Peak E 2 values were grouped by 33 rd percentile (group I, 3000 pg/ml). All embryo transfers were performed on day 3 after oocyte recovery. Results: Comparisons between groups revealed no significant differences in the quality of oocytes retrieved, and in fertilization rates. Higher peak E 2 levels were directly correlated with a greater number of oocytes retrieved, embryos available for transfer and cryopreservation, and higher average embryo quality scores (P < 0. 005). Compared with group I, group III had significantly higher embryo implantation rates (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Sustained supraphysiological E 2 levels do not adversely affect the quality of developing oocytes and embryos. On the contrary, elevated E 2 levels are associated with a larger number of oocytes and embryos and high-grade embryos for transfer/cryopreservation and, consequently, improved implantation rates...|$|R
