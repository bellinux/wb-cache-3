25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> is {{available}} as tablets and capsules (containing <b>omeprazole</b> or <b>omeprazole</b> magnesium) in strengths of 10, 20, 40, {{and in some}} markets 80mg; and as a powder (<b>omeprazole</b> sodium) for intravenous injection. Most oral <b>omeprazole</b> preparations are enteric-coated, due to the rapid degradation of the drug in the acidic conditions of the stomach. This is most commonly achieved by formulating enteric-coated granules within capsules, enteric-coated tablets, and the multiple-unit pellet system (MUPS). An immediate release formulation {{was approved by the}} FDA in the United States, which does not require enteric coating.|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole,</b> as well {{as other}} PPIs, are only {{effective}} on active H+/K+-ATPase pumps. These pumps are stimulated in the presence of food to aid in digestion. For this reason, patients should be advised to take <b>omeprazole</b> with a glass of water on an empty stomach. Additionally, most sources recommend that after taking <b>omeprazole,</b> at least 30 minutes should be allowed to elapse before eating (at least 60 minutes for immediate-release <b>omeprazole</b> plus sodium bicarbonate products, such as Zegerid), though some sources say that with delayed-release forms of <b>omeprazole,</b> waiting before eating after taking the medication is not necessary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> may be {{quantified}} in plasma or serum to monitor therapy or to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients. Plasma <b>omeprazole</b> concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 0.2–1.2mg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically by the oral route and 1–6mg/l in victims of acute overdose. Enantiomeric chromatographic methods are available to distinguish esomeprazole from racemic <b>omeprazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{absorption}} of <b>omeprazole</b> {{takes place in}} the small intestine and is usually completed within 3 to 6 hours. The systemic bioavailability of <b>omeprazole</b> after repeated dose is about 60%.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhibitory}} effect of <b>omeprazole</b> occurs within 1 hour after oral administration. The maximum effect occurs within 2 hours. The duration of inhibition {{is up to}} 72 hours. When <b>omeprazole</b> is stopped, baseline stomach acid secretory activity returns after 3 to 5 days. The {{inhibitory effect}} of <b>omeprazole</b> on acid secretion will plateau after 4 days of repeated daily dosing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> {{showed an}} inter-individual {{variability}} {{and therefore a}} significant number of patients with acid-related disorders required higher or multiple doses to achieve symptom relief and healing. Astra started a new research program in 1987 to identify a new analogue to <b>omeprazole</b> with less interpatient variability. Only one compound proved superior to <b>omeprazole</b> and that was the (S)-(−)-isomer, esomeprazole, which was developed as the magnesium salt. Esomeprazole magnesium (brand name Nexium) received its first approval in 2000 and provided more pronounced inhibition of acid secretion and less inter-patient variation compared to <b>omeprazole.</b> In 2004, Nexium had already been used to treat over 200 million patients.|$|E
25|$|Peptic ulcers may {{be treated}} with <b>omeprazole.</b> Treatment of H. pylori {{infection}} can be completed by taking a triple therapy combination of <b>omeprazole,</b> amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 7–14 days. Amoxicillin may be replaced with metronidazole in patients who are allergic to penicillin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> at normal doses {{is likely}} safe during breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|Long term use of proton-pump inhibitors such as <b>omeprazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> is a {{selective}} and irreversible proton pump inhibitor. It suppresses stomach acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase system {{found at the}} secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. Because this enzyme system {{is regarded as the}} acid (proton, or H+) pump within the gastric mucosa, <b>omeprazole</b> inhibits the final step of acid production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> {{is also a}} {{competitive}} inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, as are other PPIs.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{available}} for use in injectable form (IV) in Europe, {{but not in the}} U.S. The injection pack is a combination pack consisting of a vial and a separate ampule of reconstituting solution. Each 10-ml clear glass vial contains a white to off-white lyophilised powder consisting of <b>omeprazole</b> sodium 42.6mg, equivalent to 40mg of <b>omeprazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> also {{inhibits}} both basal and stimulated acid secretion {{irrespective of}} the stimulus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> {{was first}} marketed in the United States in 1989 by Astra AB, now AstraZeneca, under {{the brand name}} Losec. In 1990, {{at the request of}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the brand name Losec was changed to Prilosec to avoid {{confusion}} with the diuretic Lasix (furosemide). The new name led to confusion between <b>omeprazole</b> (Prilosec) and fluoxetine (Prozac), an antidepressant.|$|E
25|$|Proton-pump inhibitors like <b>omeprazole</b> {{have been}} found to {{increase}} the plasma concentrations of methotrexate.|$|E
25|$|AstraZeneca {{has also}} {{developed}} esomeprazole (Nexium) {{which is a}} eutomer, purely the (S)-enantiomer, rather than a racemate like <b>omeprazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> is {{available}} as enteric-coated tablets, capsules, chewable tablets, powder for oral suspensions and powder for intravenous injection.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological data do {{not show}} an {{increased}} risk of major birth defects after maternal use of <b>omeprazole</b> during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) and Gingko biloba {{significantly}} reduce plasma concentrations of <b>omeprazole</b> through induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> {{can be used}} in the {{treatment}} of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, erosive esophagitis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis.|$|E
25|$|Esomeprazole is the (S)-(−)-enantiomer of <b>omeprazole.</b> Esomeprazole is {{currently}} sold {{over the counter}} in the US, the UK and Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatments}} for GERD include lifestyle modifications, medications, and possibly surgery. Initial treatment is frequently with a proton-pump inhibitor such as <b>omeprazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{the drugs}} <b>omeprazole,</b> lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and {{rabeprazole}} share common structure and mode of action, each differs somewhat in its clinical pharmacology.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1975, {{timoprazole}} {{was found to}} inhibit acid secretion irrespective of stimulus, extracellular or intracellular. Studies on timoprazole revealed enlargement of the thyroid gland due to inhibition of iodine uptake as well as atrophy of the thymus gland. A literature search showed that some substituted mercapto-benzimidazoles {{had no effect on}} iodine uptake and introduction of such substituents into timoprazole resulted in an elimination of the toxic effects, without reducing the antisecretory effect. A derivative of timoprazole, <b>omeprazole,</b> was discovered in 1979, and was the first of a new class of drug that control acid secretion in the stomach, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Addition of 5-methoxy-substitution to the benzimidazole moiety of <b>omeprazole</b> was also made and gave the compound much more stability at neutral pH. In 1980, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application was filed and <b>omeprazole</b> was taken into Phase III human trials in 1982. A new approach for the treatment of acid-related diseases was introduced, and <b>omeprazole</b> was quickly shown to be clinically superior to the histamine H2 receptor antagonists, and was launched in 1988 as Losec in Europe, and in 1990 as Prilosec in the United States. In 1996, Losec became the world's biggest ever selling pharmaceutical, and by 2004 over 800 million patients had been treated with the drug worldwide. During the 1980s, about 40 other companies entered the PPIs area, but few achieved market success: Takeda with lansoprazole, Byk Gulden (now Nycomed) with pantoprazole, and Eisai with rabeprazole, all of which were analogues of <b>omeprazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> {{has a high}} {{plasma protein}} binding rate (95%), {{indicating}} that little amount of drug is transferred to the milk duct during breast milk formation.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, <b>omeprazole,</b> oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, probenecid, propranolol, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|Single 20– to 40-mg oral doses {{generally}} {{give rise}} to peak plasma esomeprazole concentrations of 0.5-1.0mg/l within 1–4 hours, but after several days of once-daily administration, these levels may increase by about 50%. A 30-minute intravenous infusion of a similar dose usually produces peak plasma levels {{on the order of}} 1–3mg/l. The drug is rapidly cleared from the body, largely by urinary excretion of pharmacologically inactive metabolites such as 5-hydroxymethylesomeprazole and 5-carboxyesomeprazole. Esomeprazole and its metabolites are analytically indistinguishable from <b>omeprazole</b> and the corresponding <b>omeprazole</b> metabolites unless chiral techniques are employed.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{citalopram}} with <b>Omeprazole</b> {{may cause}} higher {{blood levels of}} citalopram. This is a potentially dangerous interaction, so dosage adjustments may be needed or alternatives may be prescribed.|$|E
25|$|Inability {{to absorb}} iron: A {{common cause of}} iron {{deficiency}} is {{the widespread use of}} acid reducing medications, the strongest of which are proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as <b>omeprazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since their introduction, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs, {{especially}} <b>omeprazole)</b> {{have also}} been associated with several cases of acute interstitial nephritis, an inflammation of the kidneys that often occurs as an adverse drug reaction.|$|E
25|$|PPIs {{are among}} the most widely sold drugs in the world, and the first one, <b>omeprazole,</b> is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. The cost between {{different}} agents varies significantly.|$|E
25|$|Pharmaceuticals {{designed}} to reduce stomach acid, such as the proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), {{are among the most}} widely sold drugs in the world. One PPI, <b>omeprazole</b> (Prilosec), has been found to lower the bioavailability of vitamin C by 12% after 28 days of treatment, independent of dietary intake. The probable mechanism of vitamin C reduction, intragastric pH elevated into alkalinity, would apply to all other PPI drugs, though not necessarily to doses of PPIs low enough to keep the stomach slightly acidic. In another study, 40mg/day of <b>omeprazole</b> lowered the fasting gastric vitamin C levels from 3.8 to 0.7µg/mL.|$|E
25|$|Proton pump inhibitors (such as lansoprazole, esomeprazole, or <b>omeprazole)</b> that {{decrease}} stomach acid, are a {{risk for}} bone fractures if taken {{for two or}} more years, due to decreased absorption of calcium in the stomach.|$|E
25|$|<b>Omeprazole</b> {{needs to}} be {{administrated}} in an enteric-coated formulation due to its rapid degradation in the acidic conditions of the stomach. This suggests {{that most of the}} free molecules ingested by the infant are likely degraded before being absorbed.|$|E
25|$|Ranitidine was {{introduced}} in 1981 and was the world's biggest-selling prescription drug by 1988. The H2-receptor antagonists have since largely been superseded by the even more effective proton pump inhibitors, with <b>omeprazole</b> becoming the biggest-selling drug for many years.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal {{complaints}} {{are most often}} noted. The development of ulceration and/or bleeding requires immediate termination of treatment with diclofenac. Most patients receive a gastro-protective drug as prophylaxis during long-term treatment (misoprostol, ranitidine 150mg at bedtime or <b>omeprazole</b> 20mg at bedtime).|$|E
