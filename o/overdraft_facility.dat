County Bank, its merchant banking subsidiary formed in 1965, acquired various stockbroking and jobbing firms to create the investment banking arm County NatWest. National Westminster Home Loans was established in 1980 and other initiatives included {{the launch of the}} Piggy Account for children in 1983, the Credit Zone, a flexible <b>overdraft</b> <b>facility</b> on which customers only pay interest (now commonplace, this so-called pink debt was innovative when launched) and the development of the Mondex electronic purse (later sold to MasterCard Worldwide) in 1990. The Action Bank advertising campaign spearheaded a new marketing-led approach to business development. Under the direction of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, later Lord Kingsdown, who became chairman in 1977, the bank also expanded internationally, forming National Westminster Bancorp in the United States of America with a network of 340 branches across two states, National Westminster Bank of Canada and NatWest Australia Bank; and opening branches on the European continent and in the Far East. In 1982, the Frankfurt office of International Westminster Bank merged with Global Bank AG to form Deutsche Westminster Bank. In 1985, Banco NatWest España was formed and National Westminster Bank SA was incorporated in 1988, taking over the bank's six branches in France and Monaco. In 1989, International Westminster Bank was merged into National Westminster Bank by Act of Parliament.|$|E

500|$|The {{new system}} is not founded on free-trade (liberalisation of foreign trade) but rather on the {{regulation}} of international trade, in order to eliminate trade imbalances: the nations with a surplus would {{have an incentive to}} reduce it, and in doing so they would automatically clear other nations deficits. He proposed a global bank that would issue its own currency - the bancor - which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an <b>overdraft</b> <b>facility</b> in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union. He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a [...] "negative externality" [...] on trading partners, and posed far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity.|$|E
500|$|The {{preparations}} of Britain's {{skiers and}} snowboarders for the Games were {{hampered by the}} financial problems of the British Ski and Snowboard Federation (BSSF), operating under the name Snowsport GB, which was responsible for administering the lottery funds received through UK Sport. In August 2009 the BSFF was £300,000 in debt {{and a number of}} British skiers, including medal hope Chemmy Alcott, were forced to fund their own summer training camps in New Zealand and Chile. On 5 February 2010, just a week before the opening ceremony of the Games, it was announced that BSSF had entered administration after the Royal Bank of Scotland withdrew the organisation's <b>overdraft</b> <b>facility.</b> This put the participation of British skiers in doubt, as a governing body is a necessity for Olympic competition, [...] but the British Olympic Association (BOA) revived a subsidiary company to take over.

2500|$|The floods {{came at a}} {{time when}} the Government and the UK {{insurance}} industry are re-negotiating a deal to provide affordable insurance to flood prone homes, known as the Statement of Principles, with the current subsidy due to expire in June 2013. The favoured solution for the insurance industry is a levy on low risk homes with the government and taxpayer acting as an insurer of last resort. The Association of British Insurers stated that [...] "The Government has indicated it will not provide any temporary <b>overdraft</b> <b>facility</b> for the insurance industry's not-for-profit scheme, which makes it very difficult for it to go ahead. As a result, negotiations have hit an impasse." [...] Should the issue not be resolved this would leave an estimated 200,000 homes unable to get insurance from June 2013. An alternative being discussed in the insurance industry is the possibility that flood pools may offer a hybrid solution acceptable to both parties. Because of the flooding in 2012, insurance renewal premiums were expected to rise between 10 and 50 percent, depending on the scale of damages suffered. Even those not directly hit by the flooding were likely to see their premiums rise by 5 percent next year. Currently insurers provide flood coverage on the understanding that government invests a certain amount of funds on flood defences, however the spending on flood defences has slipped below the levels seen in 2008.|$|E
