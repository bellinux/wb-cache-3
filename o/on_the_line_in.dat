5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>In</b> 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, and although it spread to the station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire in the tunnel.|$|E

5|$|The {{first game}} was against Otago University on 10 September, which the home side won easily, 21–0. Jack Verge {{was the only}} one of the team to play well, {{preventing}} the home side scoring through his tackling. For the return match on 15 September, the younger Verge was brought in at five-eighth, which helped strengthen the team. No points were scored in the first half, although the visitors came close to getting a try but were held up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>In</b> the second half, Otago scored six points to Sydney's three, and again came away the winners. Verge missed scoring from a penalty kick, which hit the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|The {{line through}} Redland was opened in 1874 by the Great Western and Midland Railways {{as part of}} the Clifton Extension Railway. The station itself was opened in 1897 {{following}} a petition by local residents. There were two platforms, with the main station building on the Bristol-bound platform and smaller facilities on the opposite platform. No goods facilities were provided. The main station building, although no longer in railway use, is the only original station building left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>In</b> 1903 the station had 11 staff.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} opening {{took place on}} 19 November 1927 by King Haakon VII. When the line opened there were 21 manned station on the line. Up to 70 people worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>in</b> addition to station employees. In 1932, the operations were rationalized, cutting costs from NOK426,000 to NOK310,000 per year. This involved removing the station masters at fifteen stations and replacing them with a clerk.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 Averno {{formed the}} group Los Hijos del Averno ("The Sons of Hell") {{alongside}} Mephisto and Ephesto, followed by Averno and Mephisto defeating Atlantis and Último Guerrero {{to win the}} CMLL World Tag Team Championship for a second time. On September 17, 2008 Averno defeated Negro Casas to win the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, becoming a double middleweight champion as he still held the NWA World Middleweight Championship. Their reign lasted only 38 days before Místico and Héctor Garza won the championship from them. The duo became three-time tag team champions {{by the end of}} the year as Averno and Mephisto defeated Místico and Garza on December 7, 2008. The duo's third run with the CMLL World Tag Teams Championship ended on January 16, 2009 when they lost to La Sombra and Volador Jr. On July 22, Averno lost one of his middleweight championships, the CMLL World Middleweight Championship, to Hijo del Fantasma. On July 12, 2010, at the Promociones Gutiérrez 1st Anniversary Show Averno participated in a match where 10 men put their mask <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> a match that featured five pareja incredibles teams, with the losing team being forced to wrestle each other with their mask on the line. His partner in the match was Último Guerrero, facing off against the teams of Atlantis and Olímpico, Místico and El Oriental, Histeria and La Sombra, Volador, Jr. and El Alebrije. Averno and Último Guerrero was the third team to escape the match. In mid 2010 CMLL abandoned the NWA World Middleweight Championship after repeated complaints from the National Wrestling Alliance, instead they created the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship and made Averno the first champion. Averno was one of 14 men putting their masks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> a Lucha de Apuestas steel cage match, the main event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show. Averno was the first man to leave the steel cage with all three members of Los Hijos del Averno quickly leaving the cage, keeping their masks safe.|$|E
5|$|The 1866 Act {{also gave}} the Anglesey Central Railway (ACR) {{the right to}} {{authorise}} Dickson to lease or work the line, or to lease or sell the line to the LNWR. Dickson did indeed undertake to operate services. He requested permission from the LNWR to run services through to Bangor, but they refused, and passengers had to continue to change at Gaerwen. The act authorised a branch from Rhosgoch to Cemaes, {{but this was not}} built. The Fairlie engine Mountaineer was in use <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> April 1866, but by October 1867 it was in use on the Neath and Brecon Railway, of which Dickson was also the contractor and whose traffic he was working. The Neath and Brecon's 0-6-0 Miers also operated on the ACR, under the name Anglesea. Neither of those engines was considered successful.|$|E
5|$|The Jæren Line opened as {{a narrow}} gauge railway between Stavanger and Egersund on 1 March 1878. The railway was {{extended}} from Egersund to Flekkefjord on 1 November 1904 as the Flekkefjord Line. On 21 December 1924, the Jæren Line's only branch opened, the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård. On 1 March 1944, the Jæren Line {{became part of}} the Sørland Line, when the line opened between Sira and Kristiansand and the Jæren Line was converted to standard gauge. The Sørland Line from Egersund to Stavanger was opened as electric on 3 June 1956. This resulted in Class 65 and Class 67 electric multiple units being used on local trains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>In</b> 1960, the services were replaced by Class 68 units. The section from Stavanger to Sandnes became {{the first part of the}} Norwegian railway network, after the Ofoten Line, to centrally controlled. The centralized traffic control opened from Stavanger to Sandnes on 20 March 1964, and from Sandnes to Egersund on 7 July. The whole line received partial automatic train control on 31 December 1986.|$|E

5|$|The Orange Line, {{including}} the Pulaski station, was first proposed in 1980 by Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne, {{who planned to}} fund the line using money from the cancelled Crosstown Expressway project. U.S. Representative William Lipinski secured federal funding for the line in 1986 as a political favor from President Ronald Reagan, and Chicago Mayor Harold Washington signed a federal funding contract later that year. Construction began <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> 1987 and was completed in 1993; {{the total cost of}} the line was $510 million. The Pulaski station was built over an abandoned Belt Railway of Chicago line which ran from 49th Street to Midway Airport. Pulaski, {{along with the rest of}} the Orange Line, opened on October 31, 1993. The CTA only charged riders 25 cents during the station's first three days of service, which were considered a test run of the line.|$|E
5|$|Under British Rail, many {{passenger}} services on the Amlwch branch operated through to Bangor, removing {{the need to}} change trains at Gaerwen. An early three-coach British United Traction (A.E.C.) diesel multiple unit train was trialled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> May 1953. The train was economical in fuel use, and did not require a fireman, but train passengers and crew complained at the very rough ride - rattling windows a particular complaint. As part of British Rail's Modernisation Plan, Derby Lightweight DMUs were introduced three years later. A 1956 brochure advertised day return tickets from Bangor to Amlwch for 4s.4d, or Llangefni for 11d. Steam engines continued {{to be used for}} freight trains, and for extra workings such as Saturday trains. Steam returned for all passenger trains in the summers of 1963 and 1964 due to a shortage of DMUs.|$|E
5|$|With {{the change}} of ownership, NSB also decided to replace the aging El 11 with El 17. The {{locomotives}} had been delivered in 1987 and were intended for express train service, but had been plagued with technical problems and were not considered reliable enough to operate as single locomotives. The six newest trains of the class were painted in a new green livery and branded as Flåmsbana rather than NSB. Older B3 carriages were renovated, given new panorama windows and painted in the same color scheme and taken into use <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>In</b> October 2000, NSB sold its shares in Flåm Utvikling to Aurland Ressursutvikling. The line received GSM-R from 1 May 2005. The same year, Nærøyfjord, the neighboring fjord to where Flåm is located, was inscribed as a World Heritage Site.|$|E

5|$|With the {{termination}} of NSB and SJ cooperation Linx on the Oslo–Stockholm route in January 2005, Ofotbanen announced {{they would be willing}} to take over operation of the route from the summer. However, SJ and NSB held monopolies on non-subsidized passenger trains services in their respective countries, and it would not be possible for a private company to operate the route. In May 2007, the company announced its plans for the Oslo–Stockholm train, after necessary permissions had been granted from Norwegian and Swedish authorities. By then, SJ had already reopened its route <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>In</b> March 2008, plans had been launched to start operations in April, but Ofotbanen had not met the requirements to get a safety licence from the inspectorate. The company rented rolling stock from SJ, including an Rc locomotives, and newly renovated cars from the 1960s. The service was a cooperation between Ofotbanen and the Swedish company Scandinavian Railway.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>in</b> the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E
