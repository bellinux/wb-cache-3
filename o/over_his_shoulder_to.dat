5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
25|$|He is a {{right hand}} batsman known for his unorthodox {{technique}} and a right arm offspin bowler. He is credited as {{the inventor of the}} Marillier shot, in which the batsman extends the bat as a ramp {{in front of him and}} flicks the ball <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> fine leg. It is sometimes referred to as the Marillier.|$|E

But he was just unable to complete the job, and his team lost by one run. His two courageous and unorthodox boundary strokes did win him respect, with the shot becoming known as the Marillier shot.|$|E

25|$|If Campese wanted to, I am sure {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could not believe what was happening. I {{have no doubt that}} Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E
500|$|In June 1944, the {{men were}} {{transferred}} to Singapore aboard the SS Van Warwyck, renamed to the Harukiku Maru by the Japanese. Dogs were not allowed on board, but Frank Williams managed to teach Judy to lie still and silent inside a rice sack. When he boarded the ship, Judy climbed into a sack and Williams slung it <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> take on board. For three hours {{the men were}} forced to stand on deck in the searing heat, and for the entire time Judy remained still and silent in the bag on Wiliams's back. The conditions on board the ship were cramped with more than 700 prisoners. On 26 June 1944, the ship was torpedoed by HMS Truculent. Williams pushed Judy out of a porthole {{in an attempt to}} save her life, even though there was a [...] drop to the sea. He made his own escape from the ship, not knowing if Judy had survived. Over five hundred of the passengers did not survive.|$|E
500|$|As War Secretary, Benjamin was {{responsible}} for a territory stretching from Virginia to Texas. [...] It was his job, with Davis looking <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>to</b> supervise the Confederate Army and to feed, supply, and arm it—in a nascent country with almost no arms manufacturers. [...] Accordingly, Benjamin saw his job as closely tied to foreign affairs, as the Confederacy was dependent on imports to supply its troops. Davis had determined on a [...] "defensive war" [...] strategy—the Confederacy would await invasion by the North, then seek to defeat its armies until Lincoln tired of sending them. Davis and Benjamin worked together closely, and as Davis {{came to realize that}} his subordinate was loyal both to the Confederacy and to Davis personally, he returned complete trust in Benjamin. [...] Varina Davis wrote, [...] "It was to me a curious spectacle, the steady approximation to a thorough friendliness of the President and his War Minister. [...] It was a very gradual rapprochement, but all the more solid for that reason." ...|$|E

50|$|On February 3, 1968, Cassady {{attended}} a wedding party in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico. After the party, he went walking along a railroad track {{to reach the}} next town, but passed {{out in the cold}} and rainy night wearing nothing but a T-shirt and jeans. In the morning, he was found in a coma by the tracks, reportedly by Anton Black, later a professor at El Paso Community College, who carried Cassady <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>to</b> the local post office building. Cassady was then transported to the closest hospital where he died a few hours later on February 4, four days short of his 42nd birthday.|$|R

2500|$|In the video, it {{is clear}} that several Millsaps {{defenders}} stopped playing before the play was over. On the thirteenth lateral, Tomlin was taken down but tossed a no-look pitch <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> Hooten just before his knee hit the ground. Many Millsaps fans believed the play to be over and fireworks were shot off from behind the endzone in celebration. Maddux's final lateral hit the ground and bounced into Curry's hands. It appeared as though two defenders near Curry believed the play was over at that point, and Curry scampered into the endzone untouched. [...] Millsaps safety Michael Sims, the closest player to Curry when Curry caught the last lateral, later admitted that he turned around and started walking away, believing the game to be over.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shot was}} {{developed}} by Zimbabwean batsman Dougie Marillier. In a triangular tournament in Australia with Zimbabwe, Australia and West Indies, Zimbabwe played their final match with Australia and Marillier got a chance in the team. He could hardly have had a more testing experience, as a fine Zimbabwe batting performance after Australia scored 303 meant that he came in at number seven needing to score 15 to win the match in the final over, {{which was to be}} bowled by Glenn McGrath. [...] Marillier moved across to the first and third balls he received from McGrath and flicked them <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> fine leg for boundaries, reviving hopes of an incredible Zimbabwe victory. But he was just unable to complete the job, and his team lost by two runs. His two courageous and unorthodox boundary strokes made him famous, with the shot becoming known as the Marillier shot.|$|E

But his whole attire was such as people did not very often see; and as he passed along, the women and {{children}} ran to the doors and windows, wondering whither this beautiful youth was journeying, with his leopard's skin and his golden-tied sandals, and what heroic deeds he meant to perform, with a spear in his right hand and another in his left.|$|R
