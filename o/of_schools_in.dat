5|$|Black American Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV) is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL) {{used most}} {{commonly}} by deaf African Americans in the United States. The divergence from ASL was influenced {{largely by the}} segregation <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>in</b> the American South. Like other schools at the time, schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among deaf signers: White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers at Black schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{the main}} {{industries}} of employment in Didsbury were 20% property and business services, 15% education, 15% {{health and social}} work, 10% retail and wholesale, 9% manufacturing, 6% transport and communications, 5% financial services, 4% hotels and restaurants, 4% construction, 4% public administration and defence, and 8% other. These figures {{were similar to those}} from surrounding areas, but Didsbury did have a relatively larger education sector than other nearby wards, perhaps explained by the high density <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>in</b> the area. A significant number of people (12%) commute to areas outside Didsbury; at the 2001 census there were 6,555 jobs in Didsbury, compared with the 7,417 employed residents.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1820s, Heliade became {{involved}} in cultural policies. In 1827, he and Dinicu Golescu founded Soţietatea literară românească (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a college, the opening of another such institution in Craiova, and the creation <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>in</b> virtually all Wallachian localities. In addition, Soţietatea attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling {{for an end to}} the state monopoly on printing presses. The grouping, headquartered on central Bucharest's Podul Mogoşoaiei, benefited from Golescu's experience abroad, and was soon joined by two future Princes, Gheorghe Bibescu and Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei. Its character was based on Freemasonry; around that time, Heliade is known to have become a Freemason, as did a large section of his generation.|$|E
