This paper {{presents}} {{a study conducted}} on the min-imum number of <b>open</b> <b>stacks</b> problem (MOSP) which occurs in various production environments where an efficient simultane-ous utilization of resources (stacks) is needed to achieve a set of tasks. We investigate through this problem how classical look-back reasonings based on explanations {{could be used to}} prune the search space and design a new solving technique. Explana-tions have often been used to design intelligent backtracking mechanisms in Constraint Programming whereas their use in nogood recording schemes has been less investigated. In this pa-per, we introduce a generalized nogood (embedding explanation mechanisms) for the MOSP that leads to a new solving tech-nique and can provide explanations. 1 The Minimum number of <b>Open</b> <b>Stacks</b> Problem The Minimum number of <b>Open</b> <b>Stacks</b> Problem (MOSP) has been recently use...|$|R

5000|$|The most {{important}} influences that Macdonald {{has had on}} libraries have been his architectural designs advocating <b>open</b> <b>stacks</b> in the 1930s, and his company’s modular architecture in the 1950s. The Snead Company's production of public and academic libraries {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century provided the framework for <b>open</b> <b>stack</b> libraries. The company's focus on providing book stacks that could also be modified to accommodate card catalogues or reading spaces helped the expanding use of public libraries following World War II. The concept of modular libraries not only signaled the financial demise of Snead and Company, but also the birth of the modern library form. Composed of nine by nine by eight foot sections or [...] "modules", this concept, combined with the production of light-weight, adjustable shelving, revolutionized library planning. Macdonald and the company he headed were integral in the move of the American library system from one of closed, structural <b>stacks,</b> to <b>open</b> <b>stacks</b> that emphasize adjustability which are still in use today.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the utility}} of <b>open</b> <b>stack</b> systems has been widely debated, little {{empirical}} research relevant to the controversy is available. Using circula-tion, book availability, and search and library-use statistics, major elements of the direct access debate are tested in a six-year study of a library that has recently undergone the transition from closed to <b>open</b> <b>stacks.</b> Direct shelf access, it was found, contributed {{to an increase in}} library use and a decrease in c~rculation. Contrary to expectations, book availability perfor-mance also improved significantly during the study period. D IRECf COLLECTION ACCESS is a prevailing practice in American academic libraries today and enjoys considerable support among faculty members, students, and li-brarians. Despite their popularity, <b>open</b> <b>stack</b> systems have not been incontroverti-bly proven more effective than the closed or semiclosed alternatives as user access mechanisms. Nor is the ongoing debate likely to resolve the issue, since the discus-sion is largely impressionistic and specula-tive. Considerable research on patron behavior is available. However, the few quantitative studies relevant to the controversy focus on user behavior in the stacks rather than the broader issue of open access per se. Infer-ences about the validity of <b>open</b> <b>stack</b> sys-tems have been drawn from measures of pa-tron shelf failure and browsing effectiveness in these reports. The effectiveness of direct access could be established from statistical case studies comparing library performance before and after the <b>stacks</b> were <b>opened.</b> However, no such empirical impact studies were iden-tified in a search of Library Literature. The opening of the main library stacks at West Virginia University in February 1976 provided an opportunity for such a longitu-dinal analysis.
