Zagadnienie to poprzedzono charakterystyką rozmieszczenia i gęstości działek. Cel pracy stanowi identyfikacja ukształtowanego w warunkach rynkowych stopnia zróżnicowania struktury przestrzennej działek według ich wielkości i kształtu przy użyciu narzędzi GIS. Identification {{at using}} tools GIS {{of the degree}} formed in market {{conditions}} of diversifying the spatial structure <b>of</b> ground <b>plots</b> according to their size and of the shape constituted {{the purpose of this}} work. At the beginning of 2013 the area of Łódź was divided in 133 547 <b>of</b> <b>plots.</b> As results <b>of</b> conducted examinations were established that spatial schedule <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> was characterized by a great changeability. The density <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> in geodetic units is a consequence of spatial diversifying the number <b>of</b> <b>plots,</b> growing generally in centripetal direction. Average area <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> in geodetic units of Łódź, made conditional among others on location them and conditions of the parceling out, extremely strongly is diversified. A vast area of the changeability of this area is connected with it (481 ‒ 98 199 m 2). In the city a general tendency of the increase in the area <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> in centrifugal direction is seen, though the smallest plots don't focus in very central areas, only in their north and south surroundings which is rewarded {{all at the same time}} with the very large number <b>of</b> <b>plots.</b> From a point of view of organizations of the municipal space of Łódź numerous very small ground plots which it is hard rationally to develop or to sell constitute the peculiar problem. In individual spatial units also developing the biggest ground plots can be a substantial problem. Peculiarly the high level of the changeability of the area <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> characterizes the geodetic units located in the indirect zone, and to a lesser degree in the zone of peripheral Łódź. Examining the shape <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> in geodetic units was based on two rates. First from them determines diversifying of the shapes <b>of</b> <b>plots,</b> however second expresses the step, in which the real shape <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> differs from the circle. The distribution of the value of the indicator of diversifying the shape <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> in spatial units is almost perfectly symmetrical, about the average dispersion and strong kurtosis. This distribution in great measure becomes a distribution of the number <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> like and depends on the density as well as size <b>of</b> <b>plots.</b> Diversifying the shapes <b>of</b> <b>plots,</b> being ahead <b>of</b> an average level in the city, appears mainly in the geodetic units in the central and indirect zone. Peripheral agricultural areas, locate above all in the eastern part of the city are characterized by little adding variety to this shape. Second from applied indicators of the shape <b>of</b> <b>plots,</b> depicting their cohesion he doesn't show the great diversity in the municipal space and won't depend on the density and size <b>of</b> <b>plots.</b> Above all locate plots in peripheral areas demonstrate the low cohesion, but also in the city centre zone. Plots located as a rule in the indirect zone have the shape most similar to the circle. Based on values of both considered rates of the shape <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> four distinguished types of spatial units stayed...|$|R

American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse <b>of</b> <b>plotting</b> to create a New World Order through a one-world government.|$|E
