5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or {{are the result of}} divergence of the genes after a speciation event, where they are known as <b>orthologous</b> genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of <b>orthologous</b> genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are <b>orthologous.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of TBR1 {{has been studied}} in amphioxi, also known as lancelets. A T-box-containing cDNA was isolated in the lancelet Branchiostoma belcheri and found to possess a T-domain <b>orthologous</b> {{to that of the}} T-Brain subfamily of T-box genes, specifically TBR1. However, lancelets lack a true brain and no TBR1 transcripts were found in the neural tissue of the lancelet. This suggests that the neuronal role of TBR1 evolved in vertebrates after the lancelet lineage had already diverged from that of vertebrates.|$|E

25|$|In Antirrhinum, the <b>orthologous</b> gene to AP1 is SQUAMOSA (SQUA), {{which also}} has a {{particular}} impact on the floral meristem. The homologs for AP2 are LIPLESS1 (LIP1) and LIPLESS2 (LIP2), which have a redundant function and are of special interest {{in the development of}} sepals, petals and ovules.|$|E
25|$|Phylogenetic footprinting is a {{technique}} used to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) within a non-coding region of DNA of interest by comparing it to the <b>orthologous</b> sequence in different species. When this technique is used {{with a large number}} of closely related species, this is called phylogenetic shadowing.|$|E
25|$|MiR-k12-11 in Kaposi's-sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus has {{a target}} {{specificity}} region <b>orthologous</b> {{to that of}} miR-155's; mimicking the action of miR-155 and, sharing targets with it, thus it can be thought to suppress miR-155 accessibility to its targets by competition and this in effect downregulates expression of genes playing roles in cellular growth and apoptosis {{in a manner that}} defies regulations by miR-155.|$|E
25|$|The 2000s {{witnessed}} {{an explosion}} of genome sequencing and mapping in evolutionarily diverse species. While full genome sequencing of mammals is rapidly progressing, the ability to assemble and align <b>orthologous</b> whole chromosomal regions {{from more than a}} few species is not yet possible. The intense focus on the building of comparative maps for domestic (dogs and cats), laboratory (mice and rats) and agricultural (cattle) animals has traditionally been used to understand the underlying basis of disease-related and healthy phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|The Small Molecule Interaction Database is a {{database}} containing protein domain-small molecule interactions. It uses a domain-based approach to identify domain families, {{found in the}} Conserved Domain Database (CDD), which interact with a query small molecule. The CDD from NCBI amalgamates data from several different sources; Protein FAMilies (PFAM), Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART), Cluster of <b>Orthologous</b> Genes (COGs), and NCBI’s own curated sequences. The data in SMID {{is derived from the}} Protein Data Bank (PDB), {{a database}} of known protein crystal structures.|$|E
25|$|Simple {{approaches}} {{compare the}} distribution of similarity scores of particular sequences and their <b>orthologous</b> counterparts in other species; HGT are inferred from outliers. The more sophisticated DLIGHT ('Distance Likelihood-based Inference of Genes Horizontally Transferred') method considers simultaneously the effect of HGT on all sequences within groups of putative orthologs: if a likelihood-ratio test of the HGT hypothesis versus a hypothesis of no HGT is significant, a putative HGT event is inferred. In addition, the method allows inference of potential donor and recipient species and provides an estimation of the time since the HGT event.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} <b>orthologous</b> or {{homologous}} genes can be analysed {{in terms of}} {{the presence or absence of}} group members in the reference genomes; such patterns are called phylogenetic profiles. To find HGT events, phylogenetic profiles are scanned for an unusual distribution of genes. Absence of a homolog in some members of a group of closely related species is an indication that the examined gene might have arrived via an HGT event. For example, the three facultatively symbiotic Frankia sp. strains are of strikingly different sizes: 5.43 Mbp, 7.50 Mbp and 9.04 Mbp, depending on their range of hosts. Marked portions of strain-specific genes were found to have no significant hit in the reference database, and were possibly acquired by HGT transfers from other bacteria. Similarly, the three phenotypically diverse Escherichia coli strains (uropathogenic, enterohemorrhagic and benign) share about 40% of the total combined gene pool, with the other 60% being strain-specific genes and consequently HGT candidates. Further evidence for these genes resulting from HGT was their strikingly different codon usage patterns from the core genes and a lack of gene order conservation (order conservation is typical of vertically evolved genes). The presence/absence of homologs (or their effective count) can thus be used by programs to reconstruct the most likely evolutionary scenario along the species tree. Just as with reconciliation methods, this can be achieved through parsimonious or probabilistic estimation of the number of gain and loss events. Models can be complexified by adding processes, like the truncation of genes, but also by modelling the heterogeneity of rates of gain and loss across lineages and/or gene families.|$|E
25|$|Members of the MAPK {{family can}} be found in every {{eukaryotic}} organism examined so far. In particular, both classical and atypical MAP kinases {{can be traced back to}} the root of the radiation of major eukaryotic groups. Terrestrial plants contain four groups of classical MAPKs (MAPK-A, MAPK-B, MAPK-C and MAPK-D) that are involved in response to myriads of abiotic stresses. However, none of these groups can be directly equated to the clusters of classical MAPKs found in opisthokonts (fungi and animals). In the latter, the major subgroups of classical MAPKs form the ERK/Fus3-like branch (that is further sub-divided in metazoans into ERK1/2 and ERK5 subgroups), and the p38/Hog1-like kinases (that has also split into the p38 and the JNK subgroups in multicellular animals). In addition, there are several MAPKs in both fungi and animals, whose origins are less clear, either due to high divergence (e.g. NLK), or due to possibly being an early offshoot to the entire MAPK family (ERK3, ERK4, ERK7). In vertebrates, due to the twin whole genome duplications after the cephalochordate/vertebrate split, there are several paralogs in every group. Thus ERK1 and ERK2 both correspond to the Drosophila kinase rolled, JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 are all <b>orthologous</b> to the gene basket in Drosophila. Although among the p38 group, p38 alpha and beta are clearly paralogous pairs, and so are p38 gamma and delta in vertebrates, the timing of the base split is less clear, given that many metazoans already possess multiple p38 homologs (there are three p38-type kinases in Drosophila, Mpk2(p38a), p38b and p38c). The single ERK5 protein appears to fill a very specialized role (essential for vascular development in vertebrates) wherever it is present. This lineage has been deleted in protostomes, together with its upstream pathway components (MEKK2/3, MKK5), although they are clearly present in cnidarians, sponges and even in certain unicellular organisms (e.g. the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis) closely related to the origins of multicellular animals.|$|E
500|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are <b>orthologous</b> if {{they are}} descended from the same ancestral sequence separated by a speciation event: when a species diverges into two separate species, the copies of a single gene in the two resulting species {{are said to be}} <b>orthologous.</b> The term [...] "ortholog" [...] was coined in 1970 by the molecular evolutionist Walter Fitch.|$|E
500|$|H. pylori {{consists}} of a large diversity of strains, and hundreds of genomes have been completely sequenced. The genome of the strain [...] "26695" [...] {{consists of}} about 1.7 million base pairs, with some 1,576 genes. The pan-genome, that is a combined set of 30 sequenced strains, encodes 2,239 protein families (<b>orthologous</b> groups, OGs). Among them, 1248 OGs are conserved in all the 30 strains, and represent the [...] universal core. The remaining 991 OGs correspond to the accessory genome in which 277 OGs are unique (i.e., OGs present in only one strain).|$|E

2500|$|It is {{important}} when using this technique {{to decide which}} genome your sequence should be aligned to. More divergent species will have less sequence similarity between <b>orthologous</b> genes. [...] Therefore, {{the key is to}} pick species that are related enough to detect homology, but divergent enough to maximize non-alignment [...] "noise".|$|E
2500|$|The {{molecular}} clock hypothesis posits that homologous genes evolve at an approximately constant rate across different species. If one only considers homologous genes related through speciation events (referred to as “orthologous" [...] genes), their underlying tree should by definition {{correspond to the}} species tree. Therefore, assuming a {{molecular clock}}, the evolutionary distance between <b>orthologous</b> genes should be approximately proportional to the evolutionary distances between their respective species. If a putative group of orthologs contains xenologs (pairs of genes related through an HGT), the proportionality of evolutionary distances may only hold among the orthologs, not the xenologs.|$|E
2500|$|Reconstructions of {{the words}} and phenomes of ancient proto-languages such as Proto-Indo-European have been {{performed}} based on the observed analogues in present-day languages. Typically, these analyses are carried out manually using the [...] "comparative method". First, words from different languages with a common etymology (cognates) are identified in the contemporary languages under study, analogous to the identification of <b>orthologous</b> biological sequences. Second, correspondences between individual sounds in the cognates are identified, a step similar to biological sequence alignment, although performed manually. Finally, likely ancestral sounds are hypothesised by manual inspection and various heuristics (such {{as the fact that}} most languages have both nasal and non-nasal vowels).|$|E
2500|$|Coiled-coil domain {{containing}} 130 is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the CCDC130 gene. [...] It {{is part of}} the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP in the U5 portion. This tri-snRNP comes together with other proteins to form complex B of the mature spliceosome. The mature protein is approximately 45 kilodaltons (kDa) and is extremely hydrophilic due to the abnormally high number of charged and polar amino acids. [...] CCDC130 is a highly conserved protein, it has <b>orthologous</b> genes in some yeasts and plants that were found using nucleotide and protein versions of the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. [...] GEO profiles for CCDC130 have shown that this protein is ubiquitously expressed, but the highest levels of expression are found in T-lymphocytes.|$|E
2500|$|The entire genome of the {{domestic}} fowl (Gallus gallus) was sequenced in 2004 and was followed in 2008 by the genome of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). [...] Such whole genome sequencing projects allow for studies on evolutionary processes involved in speciation. Associations between the expression of genes and behaviour may be studied using candidate genes. Variations in the exploratory behaviour of great tits (Parus major) {{have been found to}} be linked with a gene <b>orthologous</b> to the human gene DRD4 (Dopamine receptor D4) which is known to be associated with novelty-seeking behaviour. The role of gene expression in developmental differences and morphological variations have been studied in Darwin's finches. The difference in the expression of Bmp4 have been shown to be associated with changes in the growth and shape of the beak.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthologous</b> {{sequences}} {{are related}} sequences in different species: a gene {{exists in the}} original species, the species divided into two species, so genes in new species are <b>orthologous</b> to the sequence in the original species. Paralogous sequences are separated by gene cloning (gene duplication): if a particular gene in the genome is copied, then the copy of the two sequences is paralogous to the original gene. A pair of <b>orthologous</b> sequences is called <b>orthologous</b> pairs (orthologs), a pair of paralogous sequence is called collateral pairs (paralogs). <b>Orthologous</b> pairs usually have the same or similar function, which {{is not necessarily the}} case for collateral pairs. In collateral pairs, the sequences tend to evolve into having different functions.|$|E

The date of divergence for the <b>orthologous</b> sequences highly correlates with the sequences similarity in that the percent identity decreases as you go back in time.

The pattern of genetic divergence can be used to trace the relatedness of organisms. Two organisms that are very closely related are likely to display very similar DNA sequences between two orthologs.

50|$|Exon {{shuffling}} is {{the combination}} of exons from different proteins by recombination events occurring at introns. <b>Orthologous</b> exon shuffling involves combining exons from <b>orthologous</b> genes from different species. <b>Orthologous</b> domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from <b>orthologous</b> genes from different species. Paralogous exon shuffling involves shuffling of exon from different genes from the same species. Paralogous domain shuffling involves shuffling of entire protein domains from paralogous proteins from the same species. Functional homolog shuffling involves shuffling of non-homologous domains which are functional related. All of these processes being with amplification of the desired exons from different genes using chimeric synthetic oligonucleotides.
