5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is preventable. This includes {{by individual}} efforts such as removing lead-containing {{items from the}} home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> lead {{and the use of}} medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45µg/dl. Medications used include dimercaprol, edetate calcium disodium, and succimer.|$|E

5|$|The VC was {{introduced}} on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour acts of valour during the Crimean War. Since then, the medal {{has been awarded}} 1,358 times to 1,355 individual recipients. Only 15 medals, 11 {{to members of the}} British Army, and four to the Australian Army, have been awarded since the Second World War. The traditional explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the metal from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian cannon captured at the Siege of Sevastopol. Some research has suggested a variety of origins for the material. Research has established that the metal for most of the medals made since December 1914 came from two Chinese cannons that were captured from the Russians in 1855.|$|E
5|$|The first {{director}} of the observatory was George W. Myers. Myers was an Champaign county native who graduated from the university in 1888. He remained as a mathematics instructor also teaching the spring Descriptive Astronomy course. In preparation for the directorship he {{spent two years in}} Munich earning his Ph.D in astronomy. In his first year as director, G.W. Myers announced the discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the variability in the star Beta Lyrae at the opening conference for Yerkes Observatory. He served as director from 1897 until 1900 when he left for the University of Chicago. W.C. Brenke, an astronomy instructor, served as acting director until a new director was hired in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} March 1801, Jean-François left Figeac for Grenoble, {{which he}} reached on the 27th of March, and where Jacques-Joseph lived in a two-room flat on the rue Neuve. Jacques-Joseph was then working as an {{assistant}} in the import-export company Chatel, Champollion and Rif, yet taught his brother to read, and supported his education. His brother also may have been part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Champollion's interest in Egypt, since {{as a young man}} he wanted to join Napoleon's Egyptian expedition, and often regretted not being able to go. Often known as the younger brother of better known Jacques-Joseph, Jean-François was often called Champollion le Jeune (the young). Later when his brother became the more famous of the two, Jacques added the town of his birth as a second surname and hence {{is often referred to as}} Champollion-Figeac, in contrast to his brother Champollion. Although studious and largely self-educated, Jacques did not have Jean-François' genius for language; however, he was talented at earning a living, and supported Jean-François for most of his life.|$|E

5|$|Understanding {{of how the}} Sun is {{expected}} to continue to evolve required an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars. Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{telephones}} Scully {{and tries}} to explain that he's the real Mulder. Scully does not believe him and asks Fletcher—in Mulder's body—to pick up {{and listen to the}} conversation. Fletcher decides they should immediately report this incident, which further confuses Scully. She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is very strange and his lack of concern for the X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives through the desert towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO and the resultant problems that night, but Fletcher, having eavesdropped on the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher. Military police arrive at the appointed hour, and Mulder is dragged away, kicking and screaming, desperately trying to convince Scully. Mulder asks if he would turn in an informant to the authorities in this manner as he is carried away, and Scully begins to realize that Mulder may be telling the truth.|$|E

25|$|Producing {{deuterium}} by fission is also difficult. The {{problem here}} again is that deuterium is very unlikely due to nuclear processes, and that collisions between atomic nuclei are likely to result either in the fusion of the nuclei, or in the release of free neutrons or alpha particles. During the 1970s, cosmic ray spallation was proposed {{as a source of}} deuterium.

25|$|There are {{situations}} in which a nationwide time is in effect. In the case of business activities, a national time can be used.

Similarly, tenders for their sale of stock usually set out the time at a given location by which they must be received to be considered.
