5|$|Much {{commentary}} {{has focused}} on the novel's depiction of njais, a subject common in contemporary Chinese Malay literature. Sumardjo describes the novel as an <b>ode</b> <b>to</b> njais, citing Marsiti's loyalty to Aij Tjeng and her pureness of purpose; Marsiti is ultimately recognised for her devotion when her grave in Cikembang is moved to Batavia, with empty spaces on either side for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Sumardjo finds subtle criticism of the Dutch and Chinese men who kept njais, showing the women as often becoming victims of their lovers. He suggests that this was manifested in the character of Keng Djim's unnamed njai (Marsiti's mother), who is banished after rumours spread that she has been unfaithful. Sutedja-Liem likewise emphasises the role of the njai within the story, considering the novel to be an <b>ode</b> <b>to</b> the love and loyalty of the concubines.|$|E

5|$|The {{deadline}} for the final cut, including the visual effects was April 30. All elements of the episode had been completed {{with the exception of}} the soundtrack, the recording for which began on May 5. The recording was light-hearted, with McCarthy working some jokes into the titles of the musical pieces, such as The War of the Buttons and a reference to the end of the season, with a piece entitled An <b>Ode</b> <b>to</b> Summer. In two of the pieces, McCarthy worked in Jerry Goldsmith's Voyager theme, both at the end of the episode and several bars of it as the ship engages the Dauntless in the slipstream.|$|E
5|$|The same {{cauldron}} {{was used}} as in the 1932 Summer Games. The orchestra played The Olympian composed and conducted by Philip Glass. The torch enters the stadium carried by Rafer Johnson, he completes a lap as mechanical steps rise {{from the center of}} the peristalses. He climbs the stairs and stands and faces the crowd as The Olympian is still being played. After a minute, he lights the gas powered Olympic rings that connect with the Olympic cauldron. The flame is lit to the cheers from the crowd. The athlete and judges oaths are taken and a children's chorus appears. They perform <b>ode</b> <b>to</b> joy.|$|E
5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years of engagement, they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her father did not approve of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph did not approve of his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family for months or even years at a time, while traveling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an <b>ode</b> <b>to</b> Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E

5|$|Conquering {{the peoples}} of the Alps in 16BC was another {{important}} victory for Rome, since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north. Horace dedicated an <b>ode</b> <b>to</b> the victory, while the monument Trophy of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion. The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum, and his brother Nero Claudius Drusus moved against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland. Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus' forces reached the Elbe River by 9BC—though he died shortly after by falling off his horse. It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brother's body {{all the way back to}} Rome.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} promote Rock 'n' Roll Circus, Hamasaki {{conducted}} several commercial endorsement opportunities and expanded several other ventures. Hamasaki opened two special websites to document her preparation for the Rock 'n' Roll Circus concert tour, and additional promotional activity. On {{the day of the}} album's release, Hamasaki was interviewed by Yahoo! Music Japan and Myspace to talk about the album's material and further promotional activity. Hamasaki also received exclusive deals to promote Rock 'n' Roll Circus through mobile phones, including the Japanese services SNS and Utapiku. One day after the album's domestic release, Hamasaki began expanding her online presence by setting up accounts on MySpace, Ustream, and Twitter to promote the album and interact with her fan base. Hamasaki renewed her contract with British cosmetics line Rimmel as an <b>ode</b> <b>to</b> her image from the album; she was part of several campaigns through 2010.|$|E
5|$|The IOC {{does not}} track medalists in Olympic art {{competitions}} in its database {{and thus the}} prize winners are only officially recorded in the original Olympic reports. Judges {{were not required to}} distribute first, second, and third place awards for every category, and thus certain events lack medalists in these placements. Since participants were allowed multiple submissions, it was also possible for artists to win more than one in a single event, as Alex Diggelmann of Switzerland did in the graphic arts category of the 1948 edition. Diggelmann is tied with Denmark's Josef Petersen, who won second prize three times in literature, for the amount of medals captured in the art competitions. Luxembourg's Jean Jacoby is the only individual to win two gold medals, doing so in painting in 1924 and 1928. Of the 146 medalists, 11 were women and only Finnish author Aale Tynni was awarded gold. Germany was the most successful nation, with eight gold, seven silver, and nine bronze medals, although one was won by Coubertin himself, a Frenchman. He submitted his poem <b>Ode</b> <b>to</b> Sport under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach, {{as if it were a}} joint-entry, and won first prize in the 1912 literature category. The original report credits this medal to Germany. Two individuals, Walter W. Winans and Alfréd Hajós, won medals in both athletic and art competitions.|$|E

5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an <b>Ode</b> <b>to</b> the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E
