5|$|Mara soon {{realized}} that his purchase of the team did not yield any players, coaches, equipment, or a home field. March helped him establish the team by taking a job as the team's secretary and handling the personnel decisions, and Gibson served as the team's president. Mara's friends were wary <b>of</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> the team, but he convinced Matty Frank, a real estate investor, {{and a few other}} people to invest. Mara rented the Polo Grounds as the team's stadium, and March developed a strategy that hinged on acquiring stars such as running back Jim Thorpe. At 37years old, Thorpe was a shadow of his former self, and his contract required that he only play parts of games during the early parts of the season, until he got into shape. He played only the first regular season game however, before ending his Giants career due to injury. His absence would severely hurt the team's monetary outlook for the season.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between company-related shocks and the Nordic private equity and venture capital industry. We investigate the consequences from Ericsson and Nokia’s major layoffs in 2002 and 2012 and present some extraordinary and very interesting results. Several different analyses have been conducted, both at an aggregated level and at deeper levels. This includes a thorough investigation <b>of</b> the amounts <b>invested</b> and number <b>of</b> companies <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> after the shocks. We use Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway as the targeted countries of interest, giving the analysis credibility in respect of a shock’s impact in the Nordics. Among other findings, we present results that indicate that the number <b>of</b> companies <b>invested</b> <b>in,</b> in the hightech sector, increased in both Sweden and Finland, compared to Denmark after such a shock. They also suggest {{that the increase in}} the number <b>of</b> companies <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> was larger in the high-tech sector compared to other sectors. This also indicates that a major layoff in a specific industry will boost the start-up activity within the same industry. In addition, there appears to be an unchanged risk aversion among investors, as the invested amount appearsto be unaffected after a major layoff. These results can give an interpretation that the number <b>of</b> companies <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> could increase in Norway after the nation’s current difficulties. With the results presented, we expect that the number <b>of</b> companies <b>invested</b> <b>in,</b> in energy-related industries, will be greater in Norway compared to other Nordic countries. nhhma...|$|R

25|$|The Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 {{authorized}} {{a three-year}} {{program aimed at}} retraining workers displaced by new technology. The bill did not exclude employed workers from benefiting and it authorized a training allowance for unemployed participants. Even though 200,000 people were recruited, there was minimal impact, comparatively. The Area Redevelopment Act, a $394million spending package passed in 1961, followed a strategy <b>of</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> {{the private sector to}} stimulate new job creation. It specifically targeted businesses in urban and rural depressed areas and authorized $4.5million annually over four years for vocational training programs.|$|E

Alongside the White Paper the Government published a consultation document, The Future of Nuclear Power together with a number of supporting documents.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that Northern Ireland suffers from underinvestment and {{a consideration of}} the figures relating to the amount <b>of</b> capital <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> companies both public and private in Northern Ireland and Great Britain shows that Northern Ireland is by comparison short of capital. Its population is roughly 2. 5 per cent of the population in Great Britain but the amount <b>of</b> capital <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> companies registered in Northern Ireland (over # 79, 000, 000) is only 1. 15 per cent, <b>of</b> that <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> a similar manner in Great Britain (over # 6, 000, 000, 000) that is to say there is less than half the amount <b>of</b> capital so <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> this country per head of the population compared with that so <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> Great Britain.

As the policy would change the central bank's focus on stabilising prices, however, {{it has been argued}} it would increase the perceived risk <b>of</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> the UK and raise the prospect of increased inflation. It might also clash with Article 123 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty which prevents central banks from printing money to finance government spending and could cause a legal battle with the European Court of Justice, although {{it has been argued that}} money wouldn't be printed and would be issued in the form of bonds.|$|E
25|$|Frondizi had begun, {{during his}} 1958–62 presidency, {{a policy of}} oil {{exploration}} based on concessions of oil wells to foreign private corporations, leaving the state oil company Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) the sole responsibility of exploration and buying oil from private extractors. Arguing that such contracts were negative for the Argentine state and its people (YPF had to assume all the risks <b>of</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> exploration of new wells, {{the price of oil}} had risen steadily since the contracts were negotiated, etc.), Illia denounced the Frondizi policy as negative for national Argentine interests, and promised to render the contracts of concession void, renegotiating them.|$|E
25|$|In Haycraft's {{history of}} the {{construction}} equipment business (2000), he expressed the view that Allis-Chalmers relied too heavily for too long on partnering with auxiliary equipment suppliers, and acquiring them, instead <b>of</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> in-house product development. In his view, this strategy limited the company's success in this business, and it eventually had to spend the development dollars anyway. Buescher's comments about the Buda acquisition {{and the need for}} subsequent improvement of its designs seem to corroborate this view. However, the topic is multivariate and complex; elsewhere in his memoir, Buescher presents a viewpoint in which investing in research and product development is an expensive move that often doesn't pay off for the innovator and mostly benefits competitor clones.|$|E

25|$|A {{commodity}} {{market is a}} market that trades in primary economic sector rather than manufactured products. Soft commodities are agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa, fruit and sugar. Hard commodities are mined, such as gold and oil.

Futures contracts are the oldest way <b>of</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries for price risk management.|$|E

An offer was made by McGinn to Hansen to obtain ownership of KeyArena for little to no money to aid in his efforts. As KeyArena was deemed unacceptable by the NBA and barely breaking even in operation, the facility would likely have needed to be leveled and a new one built on the site. Determining there were transportation concerns in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood around the Seattle Center, Hansen declined in favor of building a new arena at another location.|$|E
25|$|With {{the first}} {{provision}} (the fundamental law) signed by Muzzafir al-Din {{just days before}} his death, Iran saw legislative reform vital to their goal of independence from British and Russian imperialism. The three main groups of the coalition seeking a constitution were the bazaar merchants, ulama, and a small faction of radical reformers. These groups shared the goal of ending royal corruption and stopping the dominance of foreign powers. Revolutionaries argued that role of the shah was once again being used to keep the Shah, Qajar, and the other aristocrats wealthy {{at the expense of}} surrendering the country's resources and economy. They argued that whilst Iran's oil industry was sold to the British, tax advantages on import/export and manufactured textiles destroyed Iran's economy formerly supported by bazaar merchants. Muzzafir al-Din accumulated a fortune in foreign debt while selling off assets to repay the interest, instead <b>of</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> Iran. This rift founded Iran's constitutional revolt. The fundamental law gave the elected legislature a final approval over all loans, concession, and budget. Further power was diverted from the shah with the supplementary fundamental law passed a few days later giving power over appointing ministers, and later a committee of mujtahids was introduced to confirm new laws abide by the shari'ah. Despite the ulama's best efforts towards independence from external dominance, in 1907 Britain and Russia capitalized on Iran's weak government and signed the entente which divided Iran among the two leaving a neutral zone {{in the center of the}} country. The end of this constitutional period came when members of the Majlis in the remaining neutral zone of Tehran dissolved under the issue of equal rights for non-Muslims, Russia then invaded Tehran and captured the city. While Iran did gain a constitution, the goal of Iranian independence was not achieved by the revolts.|$|E

Dwight puts the {{conversation}} on speaker phone, allowing him to hear Wallace first tell Jim his salary {{is going to be}} cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoot down the idea <b>of</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> Athlead. Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim. Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they [...] "haze the new guy", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap. It is also hinted that Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the boom mike operator for the documentary crew, has developed a crush on Pam.|$|E
