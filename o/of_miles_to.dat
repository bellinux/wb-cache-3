5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the Arctic tern, insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E
5|$|Henry McNish (11 September 187424 September 1930), often {{referred}} to as Harry McNeish or by the nickname Chippy, was the carpenter on Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. He was responsible for much of the work that ensured the crew's survival after their ship, the Endurance, was destroyed when it became trapped in pack ice in the Weddell Sea. He modified the small boat, James Caird, that allowed Shackleton and five men (including McNish) to make a voyage of hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> fetch help {{for the rest of the}} crew.|$|E
5|$|A young {{officer in}} the 4th Dragoons, Lieutenant William Light who later served on Graham's staff and was a great admirer of the general, {{subsequently}} became the Surveyor General of South Australia in the 1830s. Light decided to name one of the valleys in the new colony Barossa Valley (now a famous wine making region) {{in memory of the}} victory, albeit misspelled due to a clerical error. It is often incorrectly stated that Light fought at the Battle of Barrosa but he was actually hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> the north, his diary of 6 March 1811 recording he was with Wellington's cavalry travelling through Santarem to Pernes.|$|E

5|$|The British had {{travelled}} thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> {{arrive in}} India. They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages {{to deal with}} the Indians. At the time, they were technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally. Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted, they would have won the war because of the discipline and organization in their ranks. After the First Anglo-Maratha war, Warren Hastings declared in 1783 that the peace established with the Marathas was on such a firm ground that it {{was not going to be}} shaken for years to come.|$|E
5|$|The Latino {{community}} was deeply {{affected by the}} news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> visit her home, boutiques, and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations of Latinos held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular programming to break the news. The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy. Some Americans who were unaware of the singer and her popularity criticized the attention she and her murder received from both {{the media and the}} Latino community. Radio personality Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and her mourners and criticized her music, playing her songs with gunshots in the background, causing an uproar among the Latino population. On April 12, 1995—two weeks after her death—then-Texas governor George W. Bush declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Some Americans were offended because Selena Day that year coincided with Easter.|$|E
5|$|The news of Selena's death deeply {{affected}} the Latino community; many people traveled thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene. By mid-afternoon, police {{were asked to}} form a detour as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' house. On the street where Selena had lived, gang graffiti and cacti distinguished the blue-collar community from other subdivisions across America. A chain-link fence in front of Selena's house became a shrine festooned with mementos as fans from across America left messages to Selena and the Quintanilla family. Most car drivers in Corpus Christi, and those driving cars on Interstate 37 from Mexico, turned their headlights on in her memory. Fans scribbled notes and messages, and placed them {{on the door and}} doorstep of the room in which Selena had been shot.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the attackers}} {{seem to have}} wanted to force the Jews to convert, {{although}} they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, {{did their best to}} protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home. The attacks on the Jews were witnessed by Ekkehard of Aura and Albert of Aix; among the Jewish communities, the main contemporary witnesses were the Mainz Anonymous, Eliezer ben Nathan, and Solomon bar Simson.|$|E
25|$|The {{religious}} {{attributes of}} Polynesians were common {{over the whole}} Pacific region.

25|$|In {{the months}} through August, Arab tribes that had worked {{together}} in the Janjaweed militia began falling out among themselves, and further splintered. Thousands of Terjem and Mahria gunmen traveled hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> fight in the strategic Bulbul river valley. Farther south, Habanniya and Salamat tribes clashed. The fighting {{did not result in}} as much killing as in 2003 and 2004. United Nations officials said the groups might be trying to seize land before peacekeepers arrived.|$|E

Its main purpose was to serve agriculture in mid-Suffolk.|$|R
25|$|These {{sometimes}} immense gatherings {{fuel the}} ocean food web. Most forage fish are pelagic fish, {{which means they}} form their schools in open water, and not {{on or near the}} bottom (demersal fish). Forage fish are short-lived, and go mostly unnoticed by humans. The predators are keenly focused on the shoals, acutely aware of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations themselves, often in schools of their own, that can span thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> connect with, or stay connected with them.|$|E
25|$|Forage fish {{compensate}} for their small size by forming schools. Some swim in synchronised grids with their mouths open {{so they can}} efficiently filter plankton. These schools can become immense shoals which move along coastlines and migrate across open oceans. The shoals are concentrated fuel resources for the great marine predators. The predators are keenly focused on the shoals, acutely aware of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations themselves that can span thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> connect, or stay connected, with them.|$|E

25|$|Oregon's beaches {{are popular}} {{destinations}} for visitors. Horse riding, clam digging, and surfing are popular activities. Certain beaches are host to {{events such as}} Seaside's Beach Run and Prom Walk or Lincoln City's glass float hunt. Because of many headlands along the Oregon Coast, beaches vary in length from dozens <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> {{less than a quarter}} of a mile. Though less common, surf fishing also occurs along sections of the beach. However, not all Oregon beaches are sand beaches. Large surf-smoothed stones are common and several stone beaches exist. Some beaches are also shrinking, due partially to human interactions and partly to invasive species of plant such as European Beachgrass.|$|E
25|$|By 1838, U.S. General Thomas Sydney Jesup {{tried to}} divide the black and Seminole warriors by {{offering}} freedom to the blacks if they surrendered and agreed to removal to Indian Territory. John Horse was among the black warriors who surrendered under this condition. Due to Seminole opposition, however, the Army did not fully follow through on its offer. After 1838, more than 500 Black Seminoles traveled with the Seminoles thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> the Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma; some traveled by ship across the Gulf of Mexico and up the Mississippi River. Because of harsh conditions, many of both peoples died along this trail from Florida to Oklahoma, also known as The Trail of Tears.|$|E
25|$|Forage fish {{compensate}} for their small size by forming schools. These sometimes immense gatherings fuel the ocean food web. Most forage fish are pelagic fish, {{which means they}} form their schools in open water, {{and not on the}} bottom (benthic fish) or near the bottom (benthopelagic fish). They are short-lived, and go mostly unnoticed by humans, apart from an occasional support role in a documentary about a great ocean predator. While we may not pay them much attention, the great marine predators are keenly focused on them, acutely aware of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations that can span thousands <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> connect with them. After all, forage fish are their food.|$|E

25|$|The first {{building}} {{placed at}} Dinas Brân {{was not the}} castle which now stands in ruins {{on top of the}} mountain but an Iron Age hillfort built around 600 BC. An earthen rampart was constructed probably topped by a wooden palisade and this was further protected by a deep ditch on the shallower southern slope. The walls of the hillfort encircled a village of roundhouses. Dinas Brân is one of many hillforts in this part of Wales; Moel y Gaer is just a couple <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> the north-west near the Horseshoe Pass, and another is close by at Y Gardden in Ruabon to the east. There are many others on the Clwydian Hills further to the north and in the Marches to the south.|$|E
25|$|The {{pillars of}} Ashoka are {{a series of}} columns {{dispersed}} throughout the northern Indian subcontinent, and erected by Ashoka during his reign in the 3rd century BCE. Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles,</b> <b>to</b> where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi. The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the swastika stands for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil.|$|E
25|$|A ki' pohaku ({{petroglyph}}) of {{a turtle}} (or honu) {{can be found}} on The Big Island of Hawaii in the Pu'u Loa lava fields. The green sea turtle (called Honu) has always held a special meaning for Hawaiians and this petroglyph shows its importance dating to possibly when the islands first became populated. The turtle symbolizes a navigator that can find his way home time after time. This symbol mirrors the real life of the green Hawaiian turtle as it will swim hundreds <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>to</b> lay its eggs at its own place of birth. Though there are other myths as well, some Hawaiian legends say the honu were the first to guide the Polynesians to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiians revere the turtle and the legend of Kailua, a turtle who could {{take the form of a}} girl at will. In human form, she looked after the children playing on Punalu'u beach.|$|E
