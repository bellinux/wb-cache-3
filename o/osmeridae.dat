The genus has been subject to many revisions since it was first classified by Gill in 1863. The first major revision occurred in 1963, when the <b>Osmeridae</b> family was reexamined by Canadian ichthyologist Donald Evan McAllister. Expanding on Japanese researcher Hamada's earlier determination that H. olidus was not a monolithic widespread species, but rather one of three distinct species of Hypomesus, McAllister assigned them new names, and further delineated what he believed were four subspecies. This was the first description of H. transpacificus; named for its supposed occurrence on both sides of the Pacific, and also [...] "to the friendship of Japanese and Canadian ichthyologists." [...] He separated these geographically isolated populations into separate subspecies: H. t. transpacificus and H. t. nipponensis.|$|E

50|$|The {{rainbow smelt}} (Osmerus mordax) is {{a species of}} fish of the family <b>Osmeridae.</b> Its {{distribution}} is circumpolar, {{and it has been}} introduced to the Great Lakes, and from there has made its way to various other places. Walleye, trout, and other larger fish prey on these smelt. The rainbow smelt prefer juvenile ciscoes, zooplankton such as calanoid copepods (Leptodiaptomus ashlandi, L. minutus, L. sicilis), and other small organisms, but are aggressive and will eat almost any fish they find. They are anadromous spring spawners and prefer clean streams with light flow and light siltation. The rainbow smelt face several barriers. They are weak swimmers and cannot overcome most fish ladders. This prevents them from making it past the dams to the headwater streams where they spawn. The rise in erosion and dams helped to decimate the smelt population in the 1980s. There are currently plans to try to reduce damming and to help control erosion. With current efforts to reduce the human impact on this and many other affected species the population is back on the rise.|$|E
40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} among seven species of four {{families of the}} suborder Salmonoidea were investigated by allozyme analysis. The seven species examined here were the followings: Hypomesus trarspacificus nipponensis, Sprinchus lanceolatus, Mallotus villosus, Osmerus eperlanus mordax of the family Osmeridae; Salangichthys microdon of the family Salangidae; Onchorhynchus masou masou of the family Salmonidae and Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis (Ayu). From allozyme analysis of 15 different enzymes, total 26 enzyme genetic loci were detected. Based on allele frequencies data at 11 common genetic loci, the genetic distances (D) between seven species were calculated by the method of Nei (1972), and the molecular phylogenetic tree for seven species of four taxonomic groups was constructed from the UPGMA clustering method. The molecular phylogenetic tree indicated that seven species of the suborder Salmonoidea were divided into three large clusters: (1) The first cluster is the family Salmonidae; (2) The second cluster consists of the family Plecoglossidae (Ayu) and the family Salangidae. (3) The third cluster is the family <b>Osmeridae.</b> Among these three clusters, the family Salmonidae diverged at first time {{and it may be}} ancestor type, the cluster of Plecoglossidae (Ayu) and Salangidae diverged at next time, and lastly the family <b>Osmeridae</b> diverged at recent time. The molecular phylogenetic tree indicated that Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) is not included into the family <b>Osmeridae,</b> and that Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) composes the family Plecoglocidae.

40|$|The capelin, Mallotus villosus (Osmeriformes, <b>Osmeridae),</b> is an {{ecological}} and commercial {{key component of}} the sub-arctic ichthyofauna. Here, we provide the first cytogenetic information on the species based on both conventional karyotyping and chromosomal mapping of 45 S and 5 S ribosomal genes through {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). The capelin genome displayed a diploid number of 54 with the karyotypic formula 26 m/sm+ 28 st/a and a fundamental number (FN) = 80. Both classes of ribosomal genes appeared to be spread out to multiple chromosomal locations, i. e. the 45 S and 5 S rDNA clusters were detected on six and seven chromosome pairs, respectively. A linked chromosomal organization of the major and minor ribosomal genes classes has been visualized in most of the rDNAs chromosomal locations.

40|$|Autumn ichthyoplankton {{assemblage}} {{structure in}} the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) region has not previously been characterized. Ichthyoplankton data from September 2000 and 2001 survey collections were analyzed to describe assemblages in the western GOA, to examine interannual variation in assemblages, and to relate observations to oceanographic conditions. Taxa with the highest frequency of occurrence (2000 / 2001) included <b>Osmeridae</b> (94 / 87 %), Hexagrammos lagocephalus (57 / 45 %), Sebastes spp. (35 / 47 %) and Bathymaster spp. (27 / 57 %). Through the use of clustering techniques and ordination, three identifiable larval assemblages common to both years were identified. Slope assemblages appeared well defined in both years, while nearshore and mid-shelf assemblages {{tended to be more}} loosely associated and variable between years. Analyses of environmental variables (temperature, salinity, water depth, distance from shore, and water transport) suggest ichthyoplankton assemblage structure is affected primarily by bathymetry and circulation. We demonstrate that early autumn ichthyoplankton assemblage {{structure in the}} GOA is fundamentally linked to variations in macro- (slope vs. shelf) and meso-scale topography (on-shelf proximity to land masses), and suggest that these intrinsic associations may be modified by spatial and temporal variations in local hydrographic conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{collated}} {{information on}} population size, diet composition, energy requirements, energy densities of prey species, and assimilation efficiency {{from the literature}} to estimate annual prey consumption by Common Murres (Uria aalge) between Cape Blanco, Oregon and Point Conception, California in 2004. We estimated that the population consumed approximately 242, 250 metric tons of prey, including 70, 500 metric tons consumed by breeding adults, 51, 920 metric tons consumed by nonbreeding adults and subadults during the breeding season (March-August), 119, 620 metric tons consumed by all birds during the wintering period (September âFebruary), and 214 metric tons consumed by dependent chicks prior to leaving breeding colonies. Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) and market squid (Loligo opalescens) each made up over 20 % of annual prey consumption. Other species making up at least 10 % of annual consumption included shiner surfperch (Cymatogaster aggregata), northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), and rockfish (Sebastes spp.). Chick diet was dominated by anchovy/sardine (Sardinops sagax; 63 %), rockfish (21 %), and smelt (<b>Osmeridae</b> spp.; 7 %).

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{trends in}} abundance and distribution for osmerid species {{collected in the}} San Francisco Estuary. For each species, abundance and distribution information is discussed {{in the context of}} life history. Analyses of larval abundance and distribution are presented for species with identifiable larvae collected in sufficient numbers. Six species of <b>Osmeridae,</b> or true smelts, were collected from the San Francisco Estuary between 1980 and 1995 (Table 1) : longfin smelt, Spirinchus thaleichthys; night smelt, S. starksi; delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus; wakasagi, H. nipponensis; surf smelt, H. pretiosus; and whitebait smelt, Allosmerus elongatus (Robins and others 1991, Stanley and others 1995). Night smelt, surf smelt, and whitebait smelt are marine species. The longfin smelt and delta smelt are euryhaline species, spending the early portions of their lives in freshwater and entering brackish water as late stage larvae or juveniles. Some longfin smelt migrate to marine waters during the middle of their lives. The wakasagi is the only non-native osmerid and has 2 life-history types in its native Japan, a completely freshwater type and an anadromous type (Hamada 1961, as cited in McAllister 1963). Wakasagi eggs from a reservoir in lapan were originally introduced into 6 California freshwater impoundments in 1959 (Wales 1962).

40|$|Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) are an {{anadromous}} species {{from the family}} <b>Osmeridae</b> that inhabit inshore waters along the North American Atlantic coastline. During the winter, waters {{in this area are}} frequently ice covered and can reach temperatures as low as â 1. 9 Â°C. Rainbow smelt remain in these waters during the winter; therefore they must employ a biochemical means of freeze resistance. Previous studies have shown smelt to produce low levels of type II antifreeze protein (AFP). However, their main method of freeze resistance appears to come from the production and accumulation of high levels of glycerol (200 - 400 mM), which lowers the freezing point of the blood via normal colligative means (Ewart & Fletcher, 1990; Raymond, 1992). The production of glycerol in the smelt occurs in the liver through the breakdown of amino acids via gluconeogenesis (Raymond & Driedzic, 1997). The main objective {{of this study was to}} perform a long term acclimation study in order to determine the seasonal pattern of the antifreeze response in smelt and to examine key liver enzymes responsible for amino acid breakdown, gluconeogenesis and glycerol production as potential regulating loci for increased glycerol production. Wild caught smelt were maintained in a laboratory setting from October 2000 to June 2001, at two different temperature regimes, one which tracked ambient seawater temperature (11 Â°C to â 1. 5 Â°C) and 31 the other which was maintained at 8 - 10 Â°C throughout the study.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2009 I {{compared}} prey use {{and reproduction}} of common murres (Uria aalge) at two spatially disjunct colonies during 2006 and 2007 to examine if prey use of murres differed between locations and investigate how foraging ecology affects murre productivity. Prey items brought to colonies were identified utilizing remote control video systems at Devil???s Slide Rock in central California (2006 - 2007) and Castle Rock National Wildlife Refuge located in northern California (2007). Prey use differed significantly between colonies and between years at Devil???s Slide Rock. Northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and clupeid species comprised {{the majority of}} prey items identified at Devil???s Slide in 2006 (85 % of prey) and 2007 (65 % of prey). At Castle Rock in 2007 smelt species (<b>Osmeridae)</b> comprised 53 % of prey identifications. Prey size was significantly larger at Devil???s Slide than Castle Rock, but did not differ between years at Devil???s Slide. Differences in prey composition between colonies were accompanied by a large difference in energetic content of predominate prey types, with Castle Rock murres obtaining less energy rich prey. Lacking independent information on prey availability, I inferred that prey composition reflected differences in distribution and abundance of fish between years and near each colony based on current literature. In 2006, common murres at Devil???s Slide bred later, had lower fledging and lower breeding success than in 2007 in response to delayed coastal upwelling that reduced overall ocean productivity. In 2007, mean date that eggs were laid occurred one week earlier at Castle Rock than Devil???s Slide. Castle Rock murres spent less time in co-attendance (< 2 % of the sampling period) than murres at Devil???s Slide (10 - 15 % of the sampling period). Lower energetic content of prey items and distance of prey from the Castle Rock colony {{may have contributed to}} the observed difference in murre foraging effort between colonies. Fledging success was lower at Castle Rock than at Devil???s Slide in 2007, but provisioning rates and breeding success were similar between colonies. My results support findings of others that co-attendance is a sensitive parameter to changes in the marine environment and that murres will adjust the amount of time spent at the nest site in order to maintain feeding rates. Comparing the biological response of murres between years and colonies with varied prey use may assist in identifying the causes to the observed differences in co-attendance and reproductive success...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Variable ocean {{conditions}} can greatly impact lower trophic level prey assemblages in marine ecosystems, with effects propagating up to higher trophic levels. Our {{goal was to}} better understand how varying ocean conditions influence diets and niche overlap among a suite of low- to mid trophic level predators. We studied the diets of common murres (Uria aalge) over 10 contrasting years between 1998 and 2011, {{a period in which}} the Northern California Current experienced dramatic interannual variability in ocean conditions. Likewise, murre diets off Oregon varied considerably. Interannual variation in murre chick diets appears to be influenced by environmental drivers occurring before and during the breeding season, at both basin and local spatial scales. While clupeids were an important diet component throughout the study period, in some years murre diets were dominated by Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and other years by osmerids (likely Allosmerus elongatus and Hypomesus pretiosus). Years in which the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and local sea surface temperatures were above average during summer months also showed elevated levels of clupeids in murre diets, while years with higher winter ichthyoplankton biomass and summer northern copepod biomass anomalies had fewer clupeids and more sand lance and smelts. Years with higher Northern Oscillation Index values during summer months also showed more smelts in the murre diets. Nesting phenology and reproductive success were correlated with diet as well, reflecting demographic consequences of environmental variability mediated through bottom-up food web dynamics. To examine niche overlap between murres and other marine predators we employed collaborative fisheries research with synoptic observations of a major seabird colony to determine the diets of four predator species on the central Oregon coast during two years of contrasting El NiÃ±o (2010) vs. La NiÃ±a (2011) conditions. The greatest degree of dietary overlap was observed between Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and common murres, with both smelts (<b>Osmeridae)</b> and clupeids (primarily Clupea pallasii) observed as the dominant prey types. Diets differed between El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a conditions for two predators, murres and black rockfish (Sebastes melanops). During La NiÃ±a, smelts decreased, while sand lance increased in common murre diets. Black rockfish had fewer larval Dungeness crabs (Cancer magister) and a greater proportion of crab species associated with the later spring transition. Chinook salmon and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) diets were similar during El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a conditions. These findings underscore that the diets of common murres during chick rearing reflect local- and basin-scale biophysical processes in the Northern California Current, and are valuable for understanding the response of upper trophic level organisms to changing oceanographic conditions. Additionally, using multiple predators across several diverse taxa to track changes in prey communities provided a way to detect seemingly subtle changes in prey communities and contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of food web dynamics and ecosystem indicators...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 During 1969 - 1971 I studied {{patterns}} of resource allocation and behavioral interaction among Brandt's Cormorants, Pelagic Cormorants, Common Murres and Pigeon Guillemots {{in the area}} of a breeding colony on Yaquina Head on the central Oregon coast. Extensive studies of the breeding colony were combined with detailed observations of the distribution, abundance and behavior of these birds at sea. The nesting areas differed considerably among the four species. Brandt's Cormorants and Common Murres were the most similar, both nesting in colonies on flat or gently sloping, unvegetated surfaces of the same offshore rock. In contrast, Pelagic Cormorants nested on the face of precipitous cliffs on the mainland and offshore rocks, singly or in loose aggregations; Pigeon Guillemots also nested singly or in loose aggregations in nooks, crevices and sometimes burrows on mainland and offshore cliffs. Breeding phenologies overlapped almost completely, with egg laying beginning in late May and the first young fledging in mid-July. Murres initiated egg laying as early as May 6 and had an abbreviated nestling period. At an age of 2 - 3 weeks, chicks left the breeding rock, and were accompanied at sea by the adult male. Dispersal from the breeding colony was primarily longshore rather than offshore. The energetic and competitive advantages of this type of parental care pattern in murres and other alcids are discussed. I suggest that precociality has evolved in some alcids {{as the result of a}} gain in subaqueous flight capabilities at the expense of aerial flight. The greater underwater maneuverability permits those species with precocial young to exploit highly mobile midwater fish populations at great distances from the breeding colony. However, their decreased ability to ferry food from the offshore feeding areas to the breeding colony has resulted in selection for early abandonment of the colony by adult and chick. The four species differed in the average length and range of dive times. The ratio of dive time/rest time, however, was very similar when all dive times or a specific dive time were considered. Pelagic Cormorants had the lowest average dive time, while Brandt's Cormorants, Pigeon Guillemots and Common Murres took increasingly longer dives. The same ranking of species was observed for offshore distribution, with Pelagic Cormorants foraging closest to the beach and Brandt's Cormorants slightly further offshore, followed by Pigeon Guillemots with Common Murres being the most pelagic in their foraging distribution. Pigeon Guillemots fed exclusively on bottom-dwelling species while Common Murres took primarily midwater fish. The cormorants fed upon prey occurring in both areas. In addition, both species of cormorants and the murres as well as Western Gulls fed together in mixed-species feeding flocks. These flocks foraged primarily upon schooling fish of the families Engraulidae and <b>Osmeridae,</b> which represent a patchily distributed but locally abundant food source. The three diving species which participate in mixed species flocks thus differed in their offshore distribution and took slightly different prey items, although overlapping extensively in their utilization of the more abundant species, such as anchovies and juvenile rockfish. This zonation results in less predation pressure per unit area on the less common and more predictably distributed prey species, but allows the entire offshore area to be searched effectively for abundant but patchily distributed fish schools. The behavioral interactions between members of the mixed species flocks allow rapid communication of prey school locations and permit each species to maintain contact with the school for a much longer time. The temporal and spatial overlap in the occurrence of breeding activities may contribute to a more effective coverage of the area surrounding the colony during the time of year at which food supplies are abundant...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Presentation date: 1980 - 02 - 25 Results of a {{study of}} spatial and {{temporal}} utilization of a tidal river estuary by hatchery and wild juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp. and Salmo spp,), of overlap in food habits of hatchery and wild juvenile salmonids, and of size and relative abundance of associated fish species are reported in this thesis. The investigation was conducted in Yaquina Bay, Oregon in 1977 and 1978 to provide information for evaluation of concerns over the biological impact of large releases of hatchery salmon on wild fish in the estuary. A 100 - X 3 -m beach seine was used to sample four beach study areas from July 1977 through December 1978, and a 222 -m lampara net was used to sample two channel study areas from March 1978 through October 1978. Approximately 2. 2 million hatchery salmon were released into Yaquina Bay in 1977, and 9. 6 million were released in 1978. Tags, fin clips, dye marks, scales, species, release date, external parasites, visceral fat, size, and fin erosion {{were used to determine}} hatchery or wild origin of individual salmonids in the catch. Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), chum (0. keta), and coho (0. kisutch) salmon, in decreasing order, were the most abundant wild salmonid species, and coho salmon were the most abundant hatchery species. In 1978 wild populations of chum and coho salmon were present in the estuary for 2 - 3 mo (March-June), and wild Chinook were present during 9 mo (January, April-November). Increase in mean length of wild chum and Chinook, and decrease in mean length of wild coho, indicated that wild chum and Chinook utilized the estuary as a rearing area, and wild coho did not. Lack of overlap in peak migration periods of wild chum (early April), coho (mid May), and chinook (late July-early August) suggests the need to minimize overlap in utilization of the estuary by hatchery and wild juvenile salmonids. The length of residence of hatchery coho in Yaquina Bay was described by the equation: N=N 0 e-kt. The "residency half-life" (EÂ® 2) ranged from 1. 7 to 9. 0 days for different No release groups of hatchery coho in 1977 and 1978. Juvenile hatchery coho that remained for an extended period (1 - 3 mo) in Yaquina Bay during 1977 increased in mean length from 11. 5 cm FL in mid July to 21. 0 cm FL in October. Some individuals within summer release groups of hatchery chinook also remained in the estuary for extended periods (> 2 mo) a Groups of juvenile hatchery coho and chinook released into Yaquina Bay earlier in the year (June-August) remained in the estuary for longer periods than groups released later in the year (September-October), Overlap in food habits of hatchery and wild juvenile salmonids in the estuary was C ften high, although overlap was found to vary with species, time, habitat, space, length of estuarine residence, and prey abundance. In terms of biomass, larval and juvenile fish (Clupeidae, Engraulidae, and <b>Osmeridae)</b> were the most important prey organisms of hatchery and wild coho and chinook salmon in Yaquina Bay. Approximately 58 fish species were captured at the study areas in 1977 and 1978, and 17 were identified in the stomach contents of hatchery and wild salmonids. Overlap in spatial and temporal utilization and in food habits of hatchery and wild juvenile salmon in the estuary indicates that the potential for competition between these groups does exist, should space or food resources become a limiting factor. To reduce overlap in spatial and temporal utilization, consideration should be given to not releasing hatchery salmon during peak migration periods of wild chum, coho, and chinook salmon. To reduce length of residence of hatchery coho and chinook released after May, mid to late summer releases should be considered...|$|E
