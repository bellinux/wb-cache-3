25|$|<b>Over-spending</b> by Kublai and his {{successor}} caused them to resort to high taxes and extensive state monopolization of major {{sectors of the economy}} to fund their extravagant spending and military campaigns, which became a major burden on the Chinese economy. State monopolies were instituted in salt, iron, sugar, porcelain, tea, vinegar, alcohol and other industries. The most controversial of Kublai's policies, however, was opening the tombs of the Song emperors to gain treasure for the treasury, and issuing large amounts of notes which caused hyperinflation. These policies greatly conflicted with Confucian ideals of frugal government and light taxation. As a result of Kublai's policies, and the discrimination of the Mongols towards the Chinese, South China was beset by violent insurrections against Mongol rule. Many Chinese refused to serve or associate themselves with the Yuan administration, who they viewed as barbarian despots.|$|E

5000|$|Although details vary across regimes, {{the most}} common {{approach}} to creating incentives to reduce expenditure {{is to use a}} regulatory period consisting of many years. The allowed revenue is set once {{at the beginning of the}} regulatory period and there is no clawback of <b>over-spend</b> or under-spend at the end of the regulatory period - thereby allowing the regulated firm to keep some or all of the cost savings it makes during the regulatory period. The operating expenditure input to the building block model is usually based closely on the observed operating expenditure at the end of the previous regulatory period. This approach ensures reasonably strong incentives to reduce operating expenditure in the early years of a regulatory period but can, in principle, lead to weak incentives to reduce operating expenditure in the later years of a regulatory period. One way to solve this problem is to base the operating expenditure not just on a single [...] "test year" [...] of the previous regulatory period but on the average of the previous years. In practice this problem is, instead, often addressed with some form of [...] "efficiency carry-over" [...] or [...] "efficiency benefit sharing" [...] scheme.|$|R
40|$|In the {{construction}} industry, research is {{being carried out}} to look for feasible methods and technologies to cut down project costs and waste. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is certainly currently a promising technology/method that can achieve this. The output of {{the construction}} industry has a considerable scale; however, the concentration of the industry {{and the level of}} informatization are still not high. There is still a large gap in terms of productivity between the construction industry and other industries. Due to the lack of first-hand data regarding how much of an effect can be genuinely had by BIM in real cases, it is unrealistic for construction stakeholders to take the risk of widely adopting BIM. This paper focuses on the methodological quantification (through a case study approach) of BIM’s benefits in building construction resource management and real-time costs control, in contrast to traditional non-BIM technologies. Through the use of BIM technology for the dynamic querying and statistical analysis of construction schedules, engineering, resources and costs, the three implementations considered demonstrate how BIM can facilitate the comprehensive grasp of a project’s implementation and progress, identify and solve the contradictions and conflicts between construction resources and costs controls, reduce project <b>over-spends</b> and protect the supply of resources...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{proposed}} research programme is to investigate underlying psychological factors that lead consumers to <b>over-spend</b> and, consequently, to personal over-indebtedness.

This research programme, however, aims to discover the psychological process {{that is at the}} root of the race for material possessions, luxury and the associated "good life" so dominant in Icelandic society.

5000|$|Historically much {{interest}} has focussed on the incentives on the regulated firm to enhance efficiency - that is, incentives {{to reduce its}} expenditure while maintaining a given {{quantity and quality of}} output. In principle, the building block model can be designed so as to yield either very low-powered incentives to minimise expenditure (which is sometimes known as cost-of-service or rate-of-return regulation) or very high-powered incentives. The building block model can be implemented {{in such a way as}} to yield very high-powered incentives to reduce expenditure by (a) setting the operating and capital expenditure inputs in the building block model on the basis of forecasts which are independent of the regulated firm's own actions, and (b) not [...] "clawing back" [...] any <b>over-spend</b> or under-spend at the end of the regulatory period. However, very high-powered incentives create their own problems - they create strong incentives on the firm to cut expenditure or defer capital expenditure - even at the expense of reducing service quality. In addition, high powered incentives expose the regulated firm to higher levels of risk and give rise to strong incentives to lobby the regulator for a higher target level of revenue. Economic theory does not support the use of very high-powered incentives and, in practice, almost all practical regulatory regimes tend to involve medium-powered incentives.|$|R
40|$|Why do {{politicians}} distort public investments? And {{given that}} public investments are poor because presumably {{that is what}} is politically rational, what types of reforms are likely to be both efficiency improving and compatible with the interests of politicians? This paper explores these two questions in the context of Mongolia. It argues that Mongolian members of parliament have an incentive to <b>over-spend</b> on smaller projects that bring benefits to specific geographical localities and to under-spend on large infrastructure that would bring economic benefits to Mongolia on the whole. The incentive for the former is that members of parliament internalize the political benefits from the provision of particular, targeted benefits to specific communities. The disincentive for the latter is that large infrastructure carries a political risk because the political faction in control of that particular ministry would have access to huge rents and become politically too powerful. The identity of these"winners"is uncertain ex ante, given the relatively egalitarian and ethnically homogenous nature of Mongolia's society and polity. Anticipating this risk, members of parliament are reluctant to fund these projects. Since these large infrastructure projects are crucial for national growth, neglecting them hurts all members of parliament. Members of parliament will therefore support reforms that collectively tie their hands by safeguarding large, strategic investment projects from political interference thereby ensuring that no political faction becomes too powerful. This protection of mega-projects would need {{to be part of a}} bargain that also allows geographical targeting of some percentage of the capital budget.

50|$|In {{the wider}} {{context of the}} {{controversy}} over Railtrack's failure to upgrade the West Coast Main Line, this led to criticism of the SRA for failing to ensure the Cross Country and West Coast franchises transitioned from subsidised to premium paying franchises. This had been anticipated in the initial 15 year franchise agreements (1997 to 2012), but depended on Railtrack delivering the upgrade on time. Instead, the delays meant the contracts had to be renegotiated early as management contracts, and continued to be subsidised for several years until they could be re-let, which {{was seen as a}} cost to the public purse, adding millions to the billions run up in <b>over-spend</b> on the upgrade itself. The initial management contracts came into effect on 22 July 2002, and would see the West Coast franchise supported by the SRA until March 2003, and if agreement on a new franchise terms was not reached by then, it would continue as a management contract, in return for a fee of 2% of revenue. Similarly, Cross Country would be supported until March 2004, and then by a 1% fee if not renegotiated, but with the option of the SRA putting it out to tender. Unhappy with Virgin's proposal for terms of the remainder of the original 15 year Cross Country franchise, the SRA terminated negotiations on 6 August 2004. The temporary arrangements continued until the franchise was re-let in a revised form, announced in October 2005. Although Virgin was shortlisted as a bidder for this revised franchise, it lost out to Arriva, who took over as the new franchisee from 11 November 2007.|$|R
40|$| FY 03 (GOT and basket) {{and only}} 86 % of the GOT share of this. In terms of {{absorption}} capacity (expenditure as % of release), MOH performance also improved, from 97. 9 % (GOT and basket) to 99. 5 % in FY 04. Data {{on the first}} half year performance for FY 05 indicate that over 50 % over budgeted funds had been released {{by the end of}} December 2004 (50. 6 % of GOT funds and 62 % of basket funds). Absorption of these funds was at 75 % overall by end December 2004. At Regional level, expenditure as a percentage of approved estimates was 98. 7 % for FY 04, with both Curative and Preventive sub-votes performing well. Personal Emoluments (PEs) performed slightly better than Other Charges (OCs). For the large hospitals, IFMS data indicate a 98 % release of funding for FY 04, with 100 % expenditure of released funds. MOH HQ spending on drugs and supplies, a key input in the sector, has risen from an actual level of TSh 29. 2 bn in FY 04 to a budgeted figure of TSh 50. 2 bn for FY 05 (which excludes a further TSh 3. 5 bn for anti-retroviral drugs). The health basket is expected to contribute roughly 24 % of this figure. Drugs and medical supplies are expected to account for 42 % of MOH OCs in FY 05, up from 36. 5 % in FY 04 (actual), while the per capita US dollar figure rises from US$ 0. 76 in FY 04 to a projected US$ 1. 37, of which only a small proportion is currently due to anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs). More work is required in this area to ascertain total figures from all sources of funding as the PER analysis concentrates on GOT and basket funding. Budgeted allocations to councils rose for FY 05 to TSh 63. 6 bn, a 37 % increase on releases during FY 04. In real terms, this represents year-on-year growth of 31 % in the LGA allocation. This was largely driven by an increase in the OC allocation, in contrast to the previous year where PEs accounted for the whole of the 14 % increase over FY 03. The nominal value of the LGA health budget (PE and OC) converts to an approximate US dollar value of $ 1. 62 per capita. Although data for individual councils was incomplete, summary data indicate that budgeted Health sub-votes account for 17. 6 % of LGA allocations on average for FY 05. This represents a 1 % increase on FY 04 which is encouraging, but also indicates that the sector has failed to attain its baseline share of 18 %. Given a 14. 2 % reduction from original to net approved estimates for LGA OCs during FY 04, it is also likely that the final share of actual expenditure could be quite different, but unfortunately data were not available to compare actual as opposed to budgeted proportions. Budget performance appeared to be satisfactory at LGA level, with PER data indicating releases of 101 % of the final budget. This was driven by releases for PEs exceeding budget by 5. 1 % (slightly higher for urban than for district councils) which masked an 8 % shortfall in the OC release (broadly similar by council type). Financial years for central and local government were harmonised from the start of FY 05. In addition, the geographical allocation formula employed for the health basket was also applied to the block grant (although it remains unclear whether this was for both OC and PE components). These moves are both expected to facilitate future analysis of sectoral funding, and the LGA component thereof, and are welcomed. Although the quarterly health sector physical and financial implementation reports produced by each council are a potentially valuable source of information on the intra-district allocation of funding and on actual expenditures, for many councils they remain weak in terms of data quality and comprehensiveness. Opportunities for central level comparative analysis of LGA finances are therefore not exploited. Further efforts to improve the quality and consistency of such reports (and analysis thereof) would be worthwhile, particularly in the continued absence of IFMS data at the LGA level. As a priority sector, Health showed a slight gain in its share of overall GOT spending (as noted above) compared with FY 04, but has not yet regained the level attained in the earlier years of PRSP 1. The available data suggest that spending on priority items within the sector has fallen for the second year running as a share of sector spending (GOT on-budget). The figures for FY 04 are likely to have been affected by the substantial <b>over-spend</b> on NHIF under Vote 23, while incomplete data on spending on drugs and medical supplies for district health services may also have contributed to this picture. This should be explored in more detail in the next update. In terms of sectoral performance indicators, the substantial increases in the overall resource envelope are reflected in positive movement of the central and local government values of indicator 1 which monitor the per capita GOT allocation to health at each level. There has been a slight fall in the budget for the regional level for FY 05. Indicator 2 measures the total per capita resource envelope for the sector, and has also seen a 52 % increase in the year on year budget in FY 05. However, in terms of the breakdown between levels of the health system, as far as the PER data were able to show, there has been a continued poor showing in terms of the allocation between central and local government shares, despite a stated commitment in the Health Sector Strategic Plan to decentralisation and to improving the performance of district health services in particular. Early agreement is required both on the terms of reference for any subsequent health sector PER update to feed into internal sectoral review and discussions, but also on the nature of any cross-sectoral PER exercise which might seek to reflect the cluster approach of the MKUKUTA. Timing will need to be arranged in order to prevent duplication of these two potentially parallel processes. The PER Working Group should be approached to help facilitate the timely and simple transfer of the necessary information for the PER update from MOF, Treasury and PORALG, among others.
