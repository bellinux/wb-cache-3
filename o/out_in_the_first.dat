5|$|For the four-man event's {{first two}} runs on 26 February, {{defending}} world champion Holcomb recorded the fastest track times in both runs while defending Olympic champion Lange had the fastest start times. Russia-2 driven by Alexandr Zubkov, the defending four-man silver medalist and bronze medalist in the two-man event at these Games, crashed <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> run {{when one of}} his steering ropes broke. Austria-1 and Slovakia-1 also crashed <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> run, and neither sled started the second run with Russia-2. Second run crashes involved USA-2, Great Britain-1, and Japan-1. USA-2 did not start the third run. There were no crashes in the final two runs of the event. America's team of Holcomb, Steve Mesler, Curtis Tomasevicz, and Justin Olsen won the event.|$|E

5|$|Hamasaki was {{initially}} a good student, earning good grades {{in junior high}} school. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she {{spent much of her}} time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.|$|E
5|$|In June, Maté won {{the final}} stage at the Route du Sud, coming best in a five-man {{breakaway}} sprint. Keukeleire, a prolific winner in his neo-pro season of 2010 but shut <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> several months of 2011, took his first win {{of the year in}} July at the Tour of Austria. He won a selective sprint at the end of stage 3, finishing {{at the head of a}} 23-rider group that included the race's top riders. It was also in that stage that Edet took the lead in the mountains classification. He went on to win it at the end of the race, holding off 's Alexandre Geniez by a single point.|$|E

5|$|In {{qualifying}} Hamilton {{took his}} first pole position {{as part of a}} McLaren one-two. Heidfeld improved on his practice performance to take third position, in front of the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa. Massa shared the third row with Mark Webber, who {{did not seem to be}} suffering the same braking problem that almost put teammate David Coulthard <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> session of qualifying, he had only one attempt at a lap in the second session as a result. Nico Rosberg, Robert Kubica, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli completed the top ten.|$|E
5|$|In the 1947–48 season, the England cricket team {{toured the}} West Indies. When the team played in Trinidad, Ganteaume scored 101 and 47 not <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> match but journalists criticised him for scoring slowly in easy batting conditions. In a second match against the touring side, he scored 5 and 90 {{but was not}} {{selected}} in the team for the Test match which followed—Ganteaume later suggested his non-selection {{was a result of}} his underprivileged background. However, an injury to Jeff Stollmeyer, one of the West Indies' opening batsmen, before the game meant that Ganteaume was called up into the side.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two years of Johnson's stint, the Suns were fairly successful, {{reaching}} the Western Conference Semifinals both seasons. The Suns bowed <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round in Johnson's last year. Johnson's situation deteriorated towards the end of his career at Phoenix. Like in Seattle, he often clashed with his coach, John MacLeod, and finally was traded by general manager, Jerry Colangelo, to the Boston Celtics for Rick Robey and draft picks. Like Seattle after Johnson's departure, the Suns finished 12 games worse in the next season despite the addition of Robey.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} Dubai Open Chess Championship, held 18–28 April, Carlsen {{obtained}} his {{third and final}} GM norm. This achievement made him the world's youngest GM at the time, {{as well as the}} second-youngest GM in history at the time (after Sergey Karjakin, who earned the title at the age of 12 years and 7 months). Carlsen played in the FIDE World Chess Championship, thus becoming the youngest player ever to participate in one, but was knocked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round by Levon Aronian.|$|E
5|$|McCall {{represented}} Scotland at the European Championships in 1992, {{when they}} again failed {{to go beyond}} the group stage after defeats to Netherlands and Germany, and in 1996 when they were edged <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round by Netherlands. Scotland failed to qualify for the World Cup in 1994. McCall played just two qualifying games for the 1998 World Cup and his last cap came in a friendly against Denmark on 25 March 1998, as he was overlooked for the final squad for the finals in France along with team-mate Ally McCoist. He was capped a total of 40 times for Scotland, scoring one goal. McCall's caps included 11 while at Everton and 29 during his career with Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Pathan {{was then}} demoted from the {{position}} of an opening bowler in ODIs during the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy; he took four wickets at 24.00 at an economy rate of 4.80, and scored only 29 runs at 9.66, as India were knocked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round. Pathan was then limited to sporadic ODI appearances on the late-2006 tour to South Africa. Playing {{in three of the}} five matches, he took a solitary wicket at 136.00, conceding 7.15 runs per over, the only bright spot being an unbeaten 47 as India were skittled for 163 in one match; they were whitewashed by the hosts.|$|E
50|$|Bonser {{started out}} the {{year on the}} DL, and was not {{activated}} until June 8. He made two appearances for the Red Sox, giving up two walks, six hits, and four earned runs in two innings pitched. He recorded 0 <b>outs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> appearance, accumulating an ERA of 18.00 in his two appearances. The Red Sox designated him for assignment on June 18, but he elected to become {{a free agent after}} refusing minor league assignment on June 28. He signed a minor league contract with Oakland and spent July at Triple-A Sacramento. On July 31, he was called up.|$|R
50|$|His biggest victory up to {{that time}} would come over the 2009 Rookie Tournament runner-up, Yuta Nezu. Horiguchi's {{knockout}} power was on display early, knocking <b>out</b> Nezu <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round. His nickname is The Typhoon.|$|R
50|$|At {{his fourth}} attempt at the Lakeside De Graaf was knocked <b>out</b> again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round, losing 3-2 against compatriot Richard Veenstra. A few days later, De Graaf {{announced}} his {{move from the}} BDO to the PDC.|$|R
5|$|Spirometry {{measures}} {{the amount of}} airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after {{the use of a}} bronchodilator, a medication to open up the airways. Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> second of a breath, and the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath. Normally, 75–80% of the FVC comes <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> second and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as having the disease. Based on these measurements, spirometry would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted. People with COPD also exhibit a decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to decreased surface area in the alveoli, as well as damage to the capillary bed.|$|E
5|$|The League Cup {{campaign}} {{was a brief}} one. Rovers were knocked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round by Luton Town on penalty kicks after drawing the match 1–1. The FA Cup was more successful, with the team reaching the fourth round where they were beaten 1–0 by Derby County. The best cup run of the season was in the Football League Trophy, where they reached the final after beating rivals Bristol City 1–0 in the southern area final. The game was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, but resulted in a 3–2 defeat after extra time, the score being 2–2 after 90 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Yarmouth Castle {{continued}} {{to be an important}} military fortification, used both as a fortress but also as a transport hub and a stores depot. The repairs recommended in 1599 were carried <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> years of the 17th century and a further £300 was invested in Yarmouth Castle and nearby Sandown Castle in 1609, including adding two angular buttresses along the walls facing the sea.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of Martin Foyle's second {{start to}} a season as York manager, six signings were {{made before the}} summer {{transfer}} window closed. With York 15th in the table 10 matches into the season Foyle resigned, and was succeeded by Tamworth's Gary Mills in October 2010. Under his guidance, York enjoyed an unbeaten run {{at home in the}} league that lasted until April 2011, when they were beaten by Mills' former team. York's push for a play-off place was ended late in the season and they finished eighth in the table. They reached the third round of the 2010–11 FA Cup, being beaten 2–0 away by Bolton Wanderers, and were knocked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round of the 2010–11 FA Trophy after losing 1–0 at home to Boston United.|$|E
5|$|Buttler's {{first taste}} of {{international}} cricket came in July 2008, when he represented England Under-17s in two warm-up matches against New Zealand Under-19s. Batting at number five, he scored a rapid 77 not out in the 50-over contest, hitting 11 fours and 2 sixes during the 49 deliveries he faced. He also played in the two-day match between the two teams, scoring 45 in the first-innings as the match was drawn. In 2009, Buttler played four matches for England Under-18s, two each against Scotland A and Scotland Development XI. He scored 103 not <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of these matches, and made starts {{in each of the}} following matches, reaching double figures on each occasion, but not scoring higher than 28. Two months later, Buttler made his England Under-19 debut, appearing in the first Twenty20 against Bangladesh Under-19s. Playing as a specialist batsman, he scored 33 runs off 17 balls as England won by five wickets.|$|E
5|$|Calgary rebounded to {{make the}} playoffs for the next four seasons, {{including}} two consecutive division titles. However, they were knocked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round of the playoffs each time. The 1994 and 1995 Division titles led to Game 7 overtime home defeats in the opening round to the Canucks and San Jose Sharks respectively. In the 1995–96 season, Nieuwendyk was traded to the Dallas Stars in a deal that acquired Jarome Iginla. Iginla would make his Flames debut in the 1996 postseason during which the Flames again lost in the first round, a four-game sweep by the Blackhawks. In 1997, only two years after winning their second consecutive division title, the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years. The low point came in the 1997–98 season, in which the Flames finished with only 67 points, the second-lowest point total in franchise history (behind only the 1972-73 Atlanta Flames).|$|E
