25|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} I {{was part of}} what is now known as the {{emerging}} church and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like Brian McLaren and Doug Pagitt began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and knowledge of the future, denial of the substitutionary atonement at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mistake.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} release of the White Album, Cuomo {{discussed}} plans for Weezer's next album, provisionally titled the Black Album: [...] "It’s going to maybe be like Beach Boys gone bad [...] I’m thinking of swearing, which is something I’ve never done in songs.” Cuomo also said the album would tackle “more mature topics” and be “less summer day and more winter night”. He suggested the band could return to the recording studio as soon as October 2016. Weezer delayed recording after Cuomo felt his new material was more [...] "like reveries from a beach {{at the end of the}} world [...] the Beach Boys and the Clash fell in love by the ocean and had <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> amazing baby".|$|R
2500|$|In a mixed review, Rolling Stones Christian Hoard stated: [...] "The tunes don't always hold up. But {{the best}} ones are {{impossible}} to dislike." [...] Robert Christgau gave it an [...] "honorable mention" [...] in his consumer guide for MSN Music, citing [...] "You Know I'm No Good" [...] and [...] "Rehab" [...] as highlights and writing, [...] "Pray her marriage lasts—she's observant, and it would broaden her perspective". Pitchfork critic Joshua Klein criticised Winehouse's [...] "defensive", subjective lyrics concerning relationships, but added that [...] "Winehouse has been blessed by a brassy voice that can transform even mundane sentiments into powerful statements". Douglas Wolk, writing for Blender, said that the album [...] "sounds fantastic—partly because the production nails sample-ready '60s soul {{right down to the}} drum sound; and partly because Winehouse is <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impressive singer, especially when she's not copping other people's phrasing". In a retrospective review for Rolling Stone in 2010, Wolk gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars and referred to it as [...] "an unlikely marvel, a desperately sad and stirring record whose hooks and production (by Remi and Mark Ronson) are worthy of the soul hall-of-famers she namedrops—'Tears Dry On Their Own' is basically 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' recast as self-recrimination".|$|R
500|$|Other reviews echoed {{many of the}} {{positive}} aspects of the game. GamePro stated that [...] "Gearbox has done <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> job in creating not just an add-on for Half-Life, but a continuation of a masterpiece", praising both level design and story elements, but noted that it was a little too short. However, some critics dissented on the idea that Opposing Force was as influential as other reviewers made out.|$|E
500|$|Low's {{plan was}} to fly the mission in December, which left little time for the flight {{operations}} division to train and prepare.

500|$|Many {{resistance}} {{people in}} Norway had been shocked {{when they found}} out that Andersen had been allowed to serve in NOR.I.C.1. Leading saboteur Max Manus wrote shortly after the war in his book Det vil helst gå godt: [...] "It was <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> risk to send a man with Gulosten's reputation and history out on secret military missions. It would have been a great embarrassment if Fritt Folk had been able to publish that Gulosten made a career in King Håkon's armed forces".

500|$|... "Beat Goes On" [...] was {{performed}} during the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008–09) {{as the second}} song of the opening segment, [...] "Pimp". After descending the throne during the first song, [...] "Candy Shop", Madonna and her dancers are featured on a 1935 Auburn Speedster {{to the performance of}} the song. Both Williams and West appeared in the videos being displayed on the backdrops. Sarah Liss of CBC News called the performance [...] "pulsating," [...] noting that [...] "her studio collaborators—Pharrell Williams and Kanye West—present in spirit and countenance (their virtual likenesses grimaced from those massive screens) if not in body." [...] Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound praised the performance, writing that [...] "by the second song, 'Beat Goes On', it was clear {{that this was going to}} be <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> innovative show." [...] Roffman also pointed out that [...] "a digital Kanye West joined Madonna on stage, rapping along as the singer flipped and bounced on the floor." [...] During a Chicago concert, Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "a song about the freedom to dance ("Beat Goes On") becomes an anthem for political frustration, and it's the only moment that's generated any real controversy, but she doesn't say anything about either the Republican or the Democratic candidate that she hasn't said before. The power of any great Madonna song is implicit: 'Say what you like/Do what you feel/You know exactly who you are'." [...] The live performance of the song at River Plate Stadium of Buenos Aires, Argentina, was recorded and released on the live CD-DVD album, Sticky & Sweet Tour (2010).|$|R
2500|$|Two {{years after}} first seeing There Will Be Blood, I am {{convinced}} that Paul Thomas Anderson's profound portrait <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American primitive—take that, Citizen Kane—deserves pride of place among the decade's finest. Daniel Day-Lewis gave the best and ballsiest performance of the past 10 years. As Daniel Plainview, a prospector who loots the land of its natural resources in silver and oil to fill his pockets and gargantuan ego, he showed us a man draining his humanity for power. And Anderson, having extended Plainview's rage from Earth to heaven in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corrupt preacher (Paul Dano), managed to [...] "drink the milkshake" [...] of other risk-taking directors. If I had to stake the future of film {{in the next decade}} on one filmmaker, I'd go with PTA. Even more than Boogie Nights and Magnolia—his rebel cries from the 1990s—Blood let Anderson put technology at the service of character. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood was a sonic explosion that reinvented what film music could be. And the images captured by Robert Elswit, <b>a</b> genius <b>of</b> camera and lighting, made visual poetry out <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oil well consumed by flame. For the final word on Blood, I'll quote Plainview: [...] "It was <b>one</b> goddamn <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> show." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Savior" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Hanson and Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic both praised the song; Hanson {{described it as}} [...] "one of the most inspired songs [...] have written to date", while Boy wrote that [...] "'Savior' sees absolutely everything come together perfectly to make for <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> song". Burgess felt that [...] "Savior" [...] {{was one of three}} Appeal to Reason tracks that would [...] "satisfy anyone still uneasy about Rise Against's radio aspirations". Bob Hoose of Plugged In complimented the positive and hopeful lyrics.|$|E
500|$|On 21 February 2013, it was {{revealed}} that Cooper had quit the show and her final scenes would air in April. Cooper said that she had the [...] "most incredible and unforgettable" [...] time and Jacqui had been a [...] "fascinating part to play". She also wanted to explore new roles and concluded that [...] "it's been <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ride for Miss McQueen and an inspirational one for me." [...] A spokesperson added that Jacqui's departure will occur after her involvement with Trudy Ryan (Danniella Westbrook). Cooper filmed her final scenes on 26 February 2013.|$|E
500|$|The creators {{used the}} {{ambiguity}} of [...] "coming out of the closet", having Tom Cruise literally refusing {{to come out of}} Stan's closet, in a parody of rumors involving Cruise's sexuality. Cruise has a documented history of litigation against others involving rumors as to his sexuality, and some speculated whether Cruise could sue South Park. Entertainment Weekly asked in December 2005 whether South Park was [...] "cruisin' for a bruisin'" [...] and wondered [...] "how that sort of Cruise-bashing is going to go over with Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's new bosses: Paramount Pictures just inked the dudes to a three-year deal. Other people with Paramount deals? Oh, just, you know, Tom Cruise. Should be <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> studio Christmas party".|$|E

500|$|In January 2008, Glen Drover quit Megadeth, {{stating that}} {{he was tired of}} the {{frequent}} touring and wanted {{to spend more time with}} his family. He also cited personal issues with other band members. Drover was replaced by Chris Broderick, formerly of Nevermore and Jag Panzer. Broderick was initially asked by Mustaine's management company at the end of 2007 if he would be interested in auditioning for Megadeth. After an informal meeting at Mustaine's house, Broderick was introduced as the band's new guitarist. Mustaine complimented Broderick's playing skills and called him [...] "the best guitarist Megadeth has ever had". Broderick's former Nevermore bandmate, Van Williams, congratulated Megadeth on [...] "getting <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good player, more importantly they're getting a great guy to hang out with and a true friend".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his team's success on the gridiron, Tatum caused controversy. Buddy Burris, the first three-time All-American at Oklahoma, said, [...] "Jim Tatum was a con-man, a dictator, a tyrant, and <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> football coach." [...] Tatum greatly surpassed his allocated budget and linked players with sponsors who sometimes paid or bought clothes for their sponsored players. After a 34–13 Gator Bowl victory over N.C. State, University of Oklahoma president George Cross discovered that Tatum had paid the fifty Sooners players $120 each ($, adjusted for inflation). Cross had explicitly warned Tatum not to do so, {{as it was a}} violation of conference rules. With further investigation, it was discovered that $60,000 ($ in inflation-adjusted terms) was unaccounted for in the athletic department budget, which resulted in the relief of athletic director Jap Haskell.|$|E
500|$|By 5 June, {{recording}} for Enter the Grave {{had been}} completed, and Rasmussen had begun mixing the album. Video footage shot during recording sessions was uploaded to Earache Records' official YouTube account on 4 July, providing an exclusive glimpse behind the scenes. In reviewing Enter the Grave, some journalists commented on Rasmussen's role as producer. Chris Kee of Zero Tolerance Magazine said that [...] "getting Flemming Rasmussen to produce [...] {{is a major}} coup and as you'd expect he's done a sterling job, these fine songs all being blessed with a clean, crisp, uncluttered sound", whereas Ian Webster of Terrorizer felt that [...] "booking a band into Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen to record their debut with legendary Metallica producer Flemming Rasmussen is <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> statement of intent from Earache." [...] Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic also commented on Rasmussen's involvement, declaring that his production [...] "is surely one large reason why the album {{is characterized by a}} distinctively crunchy, rhythmically airtight attack." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{had limited}} {{commercial}} success, reaching a peak position of No. 111 during a seven-week {{run on the}} US Billboard 200 album chart. Assessments of the album often weigh the poor sound quality against the historic importance and insight provided into The Beatles' early stage act. Rolling Stone reviewer John Swenson called the album [...] "poorly recorded but fascinating" [...] and commented that it showed The Beatles as [...] "raw but extremely powerful." [...] Allmusic, commenting on a reissue, wrote: [...] "The results were very low-fidelity, and despite The Beatles' enormous success, it took Taylor fifteen years to find someone greedy and shameless enough to release them as a record". Q Magazine described the recordings as having [...] "certain historical interest" [...] and remarked: [...] "The show seems like a riot but the sound itself is terrible– like <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great party going on next door." [...] George Harrison gave the assessment: [...] "The Star-Club recording was the crummiest recording ever made in our name!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video game}} version of Mona Sax was {{critically}} acclaimed for {{being one of}} [...] "relatively complex, non-stereotypical female game characters". She was included on the 2007 list of 50 greatest female characters in video game history by Tom's Games, where she was described as [...] "a stone-cold killer who's incredibly tempting but not entirely trustworthy" [...] and [...] "the perfect female accomplice to Max Payne." [...] In 2008, PC Games Hardware also listed her {{as one of the}} most important female characters in video games. In 2012, David Sanchez of GameZone proposed that Mona appear in her own spin-off game, calling her [...] "one of the sexiest femme fatales in all of gaming", and added, [...] "The fact of the matter is that Mona Sax is <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> character — one that hasn't starred in her very own game, but one that could very well do so and deliver an unforgettable experience." [...] That same year, Austin Yorski of Blistered Thumbs listed Mona among his personal favorites while discussing the portrayals of video game female characters. In 2013, Complex ranked her as the 20th-best supporting character in video games.|$|E
500|$|While critics praised Morgan for his {{performance}} in the role, their reaction to the character has generally been mixed. Don Williams of BuddyTV felt that John is a [...] "rather divisive character", with some fans not understanding John's motivation for keeping his sons in the dark. However, Williams himself found the character to be [...] "completely fascinating". He chose [...] "In My Time of Dying" [...] as the second best episode of the series, mainly because of John's contributions, stating, [...] "Even if you're not {{a huge fan of}} Poppa Winchester, I think it's impossible not to be moved by the final ten minutes of this episode... John's final speech to Dean, where he finally tells his son that he's proud of him, is <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tear-jerker, and both Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jensen Ackles knock that scene out of the park." [...] Williams praised Matt Cohen's performance of a younger version of the character in the time-travel episode [...] "In the Beginning", believing that he [...] "did an excellent job at portraying a more innocent John Winchester than we've ever seen before".|$|E

500|$|On {{his list}} of the ten best albums of 2013, Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly placed Bangerz third, complimenting Cyrus' ability for [...] "cutting-edge rap , a soulful voice capable of showstoppers , and an underappreciated {{emotional}} directness". The Guardian ranked Bangerz thirty-fourth on their list of the forty best albums, commenting that it [...] " [...] people up for commercial, rather than transgressive, ends" [...] despite initially opining that [...] "the attention-seeking begins to grate". Rolling Stone placed Bangerz at number twenty-seven on their list of the fifty best albums, writing that Cyrus [...] " [...] depth and vulnerability to <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> party [...] amid all the foam-finger hub-hub". Ann Powers from NPR ranked the record tenth on her list of ten records, suggesting that it [...] "should earn her entry into every celebration of pop this year", while the Associated Press ranked it ninth for being [...] "banging". Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle listed Bangerz as the fourth-best record of the year, calling it a [...] "fun, feisty pop album that produced two of the year's biggest, best singles" [...] and summarizing that [...] "with one flick of her tongue, Cyrus easily outdoes recent fare from Gaga, Katy and Britney." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrom is a midfielder, {{and is more}} {{comfortable}} in the centre of midfield. He is left-footed, although the left side is not his natural position, and he is rarely deployed as a winger. In 2007, Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said that Byrom has [...] "tremendous skill and potential", adding [...] "Joel is a quality player. He can do things with the ball that players on the television can't. In May 2009, Stevenage manager Graham Westley believed that the acquisition of Byrom would [...] "give the squad more balance", and has also described him as having a [...] "cultured left-foot" [...] that enables him to open up opposition defences. On securing the signature of Byrom, Westley said, [...] "Joel is very creative going forward {{and is going to}} be <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> player. I was delighted to secure his signature as he is a real talent". Dino Maamria has called Byrom a [...] "creative midfielder", as well as being able to unlock defences. Byrom has called himself [...] "a good passer of the ball", as well as being able to [...] "chip in with a few goals and generally get the team ticking over". In March 2010, following Stevenage's 3–0 win against Crawley Town, a game in which Byrom scored a goal from just inside Crawley's half, Westley said that Byrom has the [...] "ability to score spectacular goals".|$|E
500|$|Like part one, {{the second}} part premiered to {{critical}} acclaim. IGN's Ramsey Isler wrote that it [...] "changed the whole landscape of the show's main plot arc. Although there were some rough spots in the execution of this story, overall it's <b>one</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> way to end the season." [...] He rated the episode 8.6/10. While praising Noble's performance, Isler criticized some plot aspects. He was [...] "kind of torn" [...] on the Peter-Olivia kiss, wished Peter and the doomsday device {{had been set up}} more for the third season, and believed the Olivia-Fauxlivia interaction to be [...] "a little strange," [...] as the two went from discussing their respective families to [...] "ass kicking". Isler did praise the fight itself. Ken Tucker praised the acting and the writers, noting [...] "The fact that the series can accommodate a fan like me only confirms what a well-wrought piece of pop culture Fringe has become." [...] Tucker included {{the second part}} of the season in his mid-year [...] "Top 10" [...] list for 2010, partly attributing this ranking to Fringe [...] "offer the season's best cliffhanger", alongside Breaking Bad. Noel Murray declared that he enjoyed part two slightly more, grading it an A.
