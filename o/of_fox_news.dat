40|$|Too often critics treat <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist {{brand and}} voice, {{its claim to}} stick up for the little guy as a gimmicky type of charlatanism {{that is used to}} convey simple and {{misleading}} news stories. However, in this dissertation, I demonstrate how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist journalistic style is in fact a sophisticated and complex form of political communication, one that requires great performative skill to embody, a deep knowledge of traditional political discourses, and an astute awareness of the key social and cultural cleavages active in a given historical moment. To capture the complexity <b>of</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist mode <b>of</b> address, in this study, I conduct a critical-textual analysis <b>of</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top three programs during the late- 2000 s Recession : Glenn Beck, Hannity, and The O'Reilly Factor. This involves a close reading of the "imagined community" <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> style is designed to address and how its style is crafted to create a political identity for viewers. While partisan identification with the Republican Party and political conservatism defines the broadest parameters <b>of</b> <b>Fox's</b> imagined community, the real power and ideological utility <b>of</b> <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> mode <b>of</b> address, I argue, derive from its cultural referents, particularly, how it aligns deep moral values and social archetypes from the American populist rhetorical tradition with the political right, marking populism as conservative. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for interpreting <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> unique populist address, which includes an analysis <b>of</b> how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs attempt to draw symbolic linkages between political conservatism and the white working- class. In the second half of the dissertation, I demonstrate the power of this rhetorical approach by showing how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs framed news about the late- 2000 s Recession to fashion a conservative economic agend...|$|R
