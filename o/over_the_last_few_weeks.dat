Sepinwall said Jones was particularly funny during the fake date, {{as well as the}} [...] "constant one-upsmanship" [...] between Ron and Tom. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had a [...] "winning formula". He particularly praised Jones during the practice date, as well as Jerry's role during the contest, which Fowler said was a good way to allow the supporting cast to work together. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said it seemed like the episode [...] "took everything they were warming up to <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> and hit them hard". Heisler particularly praised Poehler's performance, as well as the interactions between Ron and Tom. In contrast, however, A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said [...] "Practice Date" [...] "was the first time all year I felt like P wasn't firing on all cylinders".|$|E

5000|$|Star Jones did {{not help}} her case when she insisted that Meat Loaf had made a sexist insult when he called her [...] "sweetie" [...] in the boardroom.

5000|$|The A.V.

I've mentioned quite {{a few times in}} these reviews that the series needs to spend more time fleshing out the history of its characters, and this week's episode takes a break from the overarching mob war storyline to focus on Bullock's character and how he's changed from his early days on the GCPD. The result is a considerable improvement <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> although this episode still has its fair share of problems." ...|$|E

5000|$|On June 6, 2004, Muqtada al-Sadr {{issued an}} {{announcement}} directing the Mahdi Army {{to cease operations}} in Najaf and Kufa. Remnants of the militia soon ceased bearing arms and halted the attacks on U.S forces. Gradually, militiamen left the area or {{went back to their}} homes. On the same day, Brigadier General Mark Hertling, a top US commander in charge of Najaf, Iraq, stated [...] "The Muqtada militia is militarily defeated. We have killed scores of them <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> and that is in Najaf alone. ... The militia have been defeated, or have left."

Kelly stated that he thought Griffin was lucky in his fight with Pointon and that [...] "The Real Deal" [...] would win that match-up 9 times out of ten. Griffin felt disrespected and fired back with some insults of his own, which including jabs at Kelly being dropped by the UFC. Both men then called for a fight in the cage to settle the matter, in which Dave O’Donnell decided to approach both men to arrange the fight.|$|E
5000|$|... "One Angry Fuchsbau" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Les Chappell {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] grade and wrote, [...] "'One Angry Fuchsbau' doesn't quite recapture the same energy that 'Season of the Hexenbiest' promised, but it's a definite step up <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> for many reasons. There {{are a lot}} of things happening in this episode — almost too many to make it feel structurally sound — and the majority of what's happening are events that need to happen if we want to move onto something stronger. And more importantly, after three bleak and violent episodes that fixated on serial killer Wesen, this is probably the most fun an episode of Grimms ever been, one that takes the show's stronger elements and sets them loose in a good old fashioned caper." ...|$|E

[...] However Isabel Hardman, assistant editor of The Spectator, speaking on This Week cast doubt on this interpretation, giving credence to a view that it was other people who claim to be close to Corbyn who were briefing journalists. While Dugher was sacked by Corbyn from his post as shadow culture secretary, Benn survived as shadow foreign secretary.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, the {{fighting}} {{continued in the}} Shiite south. Over the next three months, over 1,500 Mahdi Army militiamen, several hundred civilians, and dozens of coalition soldiers were killed as the U.S. gradually took back the southern cities. On June 6, a truce was reached, temporarily ending {{the fighting}}. Sadr entered into negotiations with the provisional government to lay down arms and enter the political process, while the U.S. declared that the Mahdi Army had been militarily defeated when Brigadier General Mark Hertling, a top U.S. commander in charge of Najaf, Iraq, stated [...] "The Moqtada militia is militarily defeated.
