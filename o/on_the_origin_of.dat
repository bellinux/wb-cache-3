5|$|Several writers {{anticipated}} evolutionary {{aspects of}} Darwin's theory, {{and in the}} third edition of <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species published in 1861 Darwin named those he knew about in an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species, which he expanded in later editions.|$|E
5|$|Between 1835 and 1837, the {{zoologist}} Edward Blyth {{worked on}} the area of variation, artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature. Darwin acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on variation of <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species.|$|E

5|$|He also {{continued}} his critical {{work and in}} 1860 reviewed <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species by Charles Darwin. He {{was one of the}} few contemporary critics to be sympathetic to Darwin, although he was reluctant to show he was convinced of the theories.|$|E
5|$|When Darwin {{received}} Alfred Russel Wallace's {{paper that}} described natural selection, Hooker and Charles Lyell {{arranged for a}} joint reading of papers by Darwin and Wallace to the Linnean Society on July1, 1858. Since Darwin had nothing prepared, the reading included excerpts from his 1844 Essay and from a letter he had sent to Asa Gray in July 1857 outlining his theory <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> species. By that time, Darwin had begun writing his book <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species. The correspondence with Gray was thus a key piece of evidence in establishing Darwin's intellectual priority {{with respect to the}} theory of evolution by natural selection. Neither Darwin nor Wallace attended the meeting. The papers were published by the society as On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. By summer 1859 it was obvious to Gray and others working with Darwin that <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species would be a ground-breaking book.|$|E
5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 article <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the Magnificat, and {{for some}} authors still after that, it was {{generally}} assumed that Bach had composed his Magnificat in the quiet time of Advent 1723 for a first performance at the Christmas vespers. For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise partly in German, partly in Latin to be inserted at certain points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{work has}} {{continued}} to be celebrated by numerous publications and events. The Linnean Society of London has commemorated Darwin's achievements by the award of the Darwin–Wallace Medal since 1908. Darwin Day has become an annual celebration, and in 2009 worldwide events were arranged for the bicentenary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species.|$|E

5|$|Falafel are fried balls or patties of spiced, mashed chickpeas or {{fava beans}} {{and are a}} common Middle Eastern street food that have become {{identified}} with Israeli cuisine. Falafel is most often served in a pita, with pickles, tahina, hummus, cut vegetable salad and often, harif, a hot sauce, the type used depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the falafel maker. Variations include green falafel, which include parsley and coriander, red falafel made with filfel chuma, yellow falafel made with turmeric, and falafel coated with sesame seeds.|$|E
5|$|I {{might have}} adduced for this same purpose the {{differences}} between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.|$|E

Kinberg said {{that it will take}} place in 1983 and will complete a trilogy that began with X-Men: First Class. Principal photography began in April 2015 in Montreal, Canada, and ended in August. The film was released on May 27, 2016, in North America.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, {{particularly}} {{after the publication}} of <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists. However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some theists.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} me {{sufficient}} to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} eleven fossils include {{impressions}} of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form (flight feathers), these fossils are {{evidence that the}} evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic. The type specimen of Archaeopteryx was discovered just two years after Charles Darwin published <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species. Archaeopteryx seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of evolution.|$|E

5|$|WHEN {{on board}} HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain {{facts in the}} {{distribution}} of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent.

5|$|Whereas Linnaeus {{classified}} {{for ease}} of identification, {{the idea of the}} Linnaean taxonomy as translating into a sort of dendrogram of the Animal- and Plant Kingdoms was formulated {{toward the end of the}} 18th century, well before <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species was published. Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species were Erasmus Darwin's 1796 Zoönomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique of 1809. The idea was popularised in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{promoted}} {{many public}} educational institutions. Chiefly at meetings {{in connection with}} these {{he spoke of the}} need for better schooling. A collection of his speeches was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, he was invited to speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when it met at Aberdeen in 1859. His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood for Charles Darwin, after the publication of <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> Species, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.|$|E
