50|$|According to its {{reorganization}} papers filed {{as part of}} its bankruptcy plan on May 21, 2007, about 95% of the company's sales {{come from}} <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> trains. The plan estimated that about US$70 million worth of <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> trains are sold each year, and that Lionel accounts for about 60% of that market, making it the largest manufacturer of <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> trains.|$|R
5000|$|Their UK <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> range {{currently}} {{consists of}} British Rail Class 20s, 26s, 33s, 35s, 37s, 47s, and a Class 55 [...] "Deltic". The <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> range also includes British Railways Mark 1 carriages {{in a number}} of liveries. <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> models are typically supplied un-numbered and with separate detailing parts, allowing the purchaser to finish the model to their own preference.|$|R
25|$|Although toy trains were {{historically}} produced to this scale, <b>O</b> <b>gauge's</b> popularity {{across the}} whole of Europe reduced after World War II, and the standard is rarer than in the United States. Modelling in <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> in fact almost died out in Britain but enjoyed a resurgence in the 1990s as modellers developed a new appreciation for the level of accurate detailing possible in this scale. Some ready to run models are produced in this scale but most are available only as kits for assembly by the modeller or a professional model-builder. <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> is considered an expensive scale to model in although the necessarily smaller scope of a larger-scaled layout mitigates this to some extent. The two dominant British manufacturers, Bassett-Lowke and Hornby, ceased production of <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> trains in 1965 and 1969, respectively. However, ACE Trains {{and for a while}} a revived Bassett-Lowke are once again producing tinplate <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> sets, many of them reproductions of classic Hornby and Bassett-Lowke designs, and Heljan also recently joined the market producing <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> Diesel locomotives.|$|R
25|$|As <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> regained {{popularity}} in the 1990s it also started to regain manufacturers, and as of late 2003, no fewer than six companies market <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> locomotives and/or cars, all theoretically interoperable with one another.|$|R
25|$|While 1:48 {{is a very}} {{convenient}} {{scale for}} modeling using the Imperial system (a quarter-inch equals one scale foot), the discrepancy between <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> in the United States and <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> in Europe is attributed to Lionel misreading the original Märklin specifications.|$|R
2500|$|The {{differences}} in the various <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> and <b>O</b> scale standards can be confusing. <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> model railroad tracks typically have their rails spaced [...] inches or 32mm apart with the United States National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) standard allowing spacings between 31.75mm and 32.64mm.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, {{manufacturers}} {{such as the}} Ives Manufacturing Company, American Flyer, and Lionel Corporation used <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> {{for their}} budget line, marketing either Gauge 1 or 'Wide gauge' (also known as 'standard gauge') as their premium trains. One of the Lionel Corporation's most popular trains, the 203 Armoured Locomotive, was <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> and ran on tracks with rails spaced 1.25 inches apart. The Great Depression wiped out demand for the expensive larger trains, and by 1932, <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> was the standard, almost by default.|$|R
50|$|A pre-war <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> {{model of}} this {{locomotive}} {{was produced by}} Marklin for Bassett-Lowke models in 1937; this continued in UK production by Winteringham until 1957. This model has been reproduced in <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> by ACE Trains in 2009; both LMS and BR black versions have been manufactured.|$|R

2500|$|In the United States, <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> {{is defined}} as 1:48 (0.25inches to the foot, [...] "quarter inch scale" [...] 1/4inch equals one foot). This is also a common dollhouse scale, giving more options for buildings, figures, and accessories. Many <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> layouts are also accessorized with 1:43.5 scale model cars.|$|R

50|$|Most {{of these}} {{standards}} never really caught on, {{due to their}} large size, which made them impractical to use indoors, {{as well as the}} high price of manufacturing.

Of these, <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> is the most popular.|$|R

In <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> and Gauge 1 Bachmann Brassworks produce an example. In <b>O</b> <b>gauge,</b> Connoisseur Models produces an etched brass kit.

5000|$|Although {{the words}} [...] "scale" [...] and [...] "gauge" [...] {{are often used}} interchangeably, many toy train {{manufacturers}} historically had little concern with depicting accurate scale. American Flyer tended to boast its closer accuracy compared to other manufacturers. The terms [...] "O scale" [...] and [...] "S scale" [...] tend to imply serious scale modeling, while the terms [...] "O gauge" [...] and [...] "S gauge" [...] tend to imply toy trains manufactured by Lionel and American Flyer, respectively. While S gauge is fairly consistent at 1:64 scale, <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> trains represent a variety of sizes. <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> track happens to be 1/45 the size of real-world standard gauge track, so manufacturers in Continental Europe have traditionally used 1:45 for <b>O</b> <b>gauge</b> trains. British manufacturers rounded this up to 1:43, which is seven millimeters to the foot. U.S. manufacturers rounded it down to 1:48, which is a quarter-inch to the foot. However, most engaged in a practice of selective compression {{in order to make}} the trains fit in a smaller space, causing the actual scale to vary, and numerous manufacturers produced 1:64 scale trains—the proper size for S gauge—in <b>O</b> <b>gauge,</b> especially for cost-conscious lines.|$|R
