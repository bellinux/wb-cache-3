While {{lieutenant}} colonels wore two stars on their collars, majors wore <b>one</b> <b>star,</b> which was placed {{in the middle of the}} collar. Captains had three gold horizontal bars, first lieutenants wore two bars, and second lieutenants wore one bar. However, the Confederate Congress often created new commissions, and did not always standardize rank insignia immediately.|$|E

5|$|In Chinese astronomy, most of {{the stars}} of Serpens {{represented}} part of a wall surrounding a marketplace, known as Tianshi, which was in Ophiuchus and part of Hercules. Serpens also contains a few Chinese constellations. Two stars in the tail represented part of Shilou, the tower with the market office. Another star in the tail represented Liesi, jewel shops. <b>One</b> <b>star</b> in the head (Mu Serpentis) marked Tianru, the crown prince's wet nurse, or sometimes rain.|$|E
5|$|The German {{cartographer}} Johann Bayer {{used the}} Greek letters Alpha through Eta to label {{the most prominent}} stars in the constellation. John Flamsteed gave nine stars Flamsteed designations, while <b>one</b> <b>star</b> he designated in the neighbouring constellation Crater—31 Crateris—lay within Corvus once the constellation boundaries were established in 1930. Within the constellation's borders, there are 29 stars brighter {{than or equal to}} apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system, changing in brightness as <b>one</b> <b>star</b> passes {{in front of the}} other. Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{stars are}} {{inducted}} in an annual group ceremony; while the Hollywood Walk of Fame rarely inducts {{more than two}} major stars at a time. Celebrities can have more than <b>one</b> <b>star</b> on the Hollywood Walk, the same celebrity can receive {{as many as five}} stars under the various categories. This does not happen with Canada's Walk of Fame, although some may have an individual star but are also included {{as part of a larger}} group, such as John Candy, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who have their own star but also were in Second City Television.|$|E
5|$|Eclipsing {{variables}} are star systems that vary in brightness because of <b>one</b> <b>star</b> passing {{in front of}} the other rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity. W Ursae Minoris is one such system, its magnitude ranging from 8.51 to 9.59 over 1.7 days. The combined spectrum of the system is A2V, but the masses of the two component stars are unknown. A slight change in the orbital period in 1973 suggests there is a third component of the multiple star system—most likely a red dwarf—with an orbital period of 62.2±3.9 years. RU Ursae Minoris is another example, ranging from 10 to 10.66 over 0.52days. It is a semidetached system, as the secondary star is filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the primary.|$|E
5|$|In Mission Mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} missions, each with objectives {{that range from}} collecting coins to attacking enemies. In each mission, the player controls a pre-specified character. There are seven levels with eight missions in each. After completing each mission, the player's performance is given a grade of stars (three, two, or one) or letters (A, B, C, D, or E). After all eight missions in a level are complete, the player must complete a boss mission {{to advance to the}} next level. Once the first six levels are complete, and the rank of at least <b>one</b> <b>star</b> has been obtained on every mission, the seventh level is unlocked.|$|E

5|$|In an {{animated}} segment of this episode, Tyson discusses {{the life and}} vision of the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) {{as the person who}} championed a much more expansive understanding of the Earth's place in the universe, with the Sun being just <b>one</b> <b>star</b> among all the others. Later, he presents the history of the Universe on Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar. The episode ends with Tyson's brief speech about Carl Sagan's life and career, and how Sagan inspired him to become an astrophysicist.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} mode pits {{two players}} {{against each other}} as they play as Mario and Luigi in one of five stages, trying {{to be the first to}} obtain a preset number of stars. Both players can attack each other in attempts to steal the other player's stars. Jumping on the opponent's character will make them lose <b>one</b> <b>star,</b> while performing a ground pound will lose them three. In addition, some minigames previously available in Super Mario 64 DS have returned and now offer multiplayer options for added replay value. The minigames are divided into the categories Action, Puzzle, Table and Variety. New Super Mario Bros. contains eighteen minigames for single players and ten minigames for multiple players.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} named after Spica, a binary star system in the {{constellation}} Virgo {{and one of the}} brightest stars in the nighttime sky. It appears as <b>one</b> <b>star</b> because of the relatively low center-to-center distance between the two component stars, estimated at an average of 11 million miles (17.7 million km). Astronomical observations also suggest that there may be additional stars in the Spica system. In the story, Asumi mentions Spica's distance to Earth as 350 light-years. This figure is also cited by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; however, other sources indicate a distance of approximately 260 light-years.|$|E

5|$|There {{are only}} three stars in the {{constellation}} brighter than magnitude 4.5, and 37stars with a magnitude brighter than 6.5. Leo Minor {{does not have a}} star designated Alpha because Baily erred and allocated a Greek letter to only <b>one</b> <b>star,</b> Beta. It is unclear whether he intended to give 46Leonis Minoris a Bayer designation, as he recognized Beta and 46Leonis Minoris as of the appropriate brightness in his catalogue. He died before revising his proofs, which might explain this star's omission.|$|E
5|$|When Chicago {{became one}} of three American Michelin Guide star-rated cities in November 2010, Sixteen was one of 23 {{restaurants}} to receive at least <b>one</b> <b>star</b> for 2011. However, the following year, it lost its rating during its chef transition. Sixteen regained its one-star rating for the 2013 edition under first year executive chef Thomas Lents. The restaurant was promoted to two-star rating by Michelin for 2014 and retained that rating in 2015. It was one of 5 Chicago restaurants to achieve at least a two-star Michelin rating in both years. In 2016 & 2017, it again retained its two-star rating as one of five restaurants in the city with such a rating.|$|E
5|$|Circinus is a faint constellation, {{with only}} <b>one</b> <b>star</b> {{brighter}} than fourth magnitude. Alpha Circini, a white main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 3.19, is 54light-years away and 4° south of Alpha Centauri. Not only {{the brightest star}} in the constellation, it is also the brightest example of a rapidly oscillating Ap (RoAp) star in the night sky. It has the unusual spectral type A7Vp SrCrE, showing increased emissions of strontium, chromium and europium. Stars of this type have oddly localised magnetic fields and are slightly variable. Alpha Circini forms a binary star system with an orange dwarf companion of spectral type K5 and magnitude 8.5, which with a separation of 5.7arcseconds is only discernible with a telescope. The distance between the two stars is 260AU and they take 2600years to rotate around a common centre of gravity. The second brightest star is Beta Circini, a white main sequence star of spectral type A3Va and a magnitude of 4.07, about 100light-years away. It has around 1.8times the diameter of the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{fall-out}} between Ramsay and A-Z Restaurants over Wareing's contract at L'Oranger, {{which saw}} Ramsay quit Aubergine to open Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, Wareing followed suit by leaving L'Oranger, forcing the restaurant into temporary closure. A-Z Restaurants commenced legal proceedings against the pair, and reopened L’Oranger with Wareing's former sous chef, Kamel Benamar, {{as the new}} head chef. The legal case ended in Ramsay and Wareing paying an out-of-court settlement to the Restaurant group. Ramsay and Wareing worked together to open Pétrus in 1999, with Wareing becoming head chef and operating the restaurant on behalf of Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH), at 33 St James's Street, London. The name came from the French wine Pétrus, which was Ramsay's and Wareing's favourite. Wareing promptly regained the Michelin star he had previously held, with Pétrus being named as a <b>one</b> <b>star</b> restaurant seven months after opening.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{stars on the}} flag is fixed at 12, and {{is not related to}} the number of member states of the EU (although the EU did have 12 member states at the time of Maastricht Treaty). This is because it {{originally}} was the flag of the Council of Europe. In 1953, the Council of Europe had 15 members; it was proposed that the future flag should have <b>one</b> <b>star</b> for each member, and would not change based on future members. West Germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of Saarland, and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region. Twelve was eventually adopted as a number with no political connotations and as a symbol of unity. While 12 is the correct number of stars, sometimes flags or emblems can be found that incorrectly show 15 (as of the rejected proposal) or 25 (as suggested by some after the expansion of the EU to 25 member states in 2004). However, the flag also remains that of the Council of Europe, which now has 47 member states.|$|E
