40|$|Shopping centers {{is vital}} {{in our daily}} life. In this paper, the {{importance}} <b>of</b> provision <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> will be analyzed in details {{and this would be}} useful for owners or management companies of shopping malls if they are planning for renovations or implementing new shopping malls. Six research questions are analyzed in this paper through conducting surveys through questionnaires, and they will be categorized into two categories, which is to determine the impact <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> {{to the success of the}} shopping malls and to determine the impact of the various means <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> to the success of the shopping malls. Convenience sampling is adopted for the data collection of questionnaires and two sets of questionnaires will be distributed only to people who lives or works in Tsuen Wan and have ever visited all of the shopping malls used for case study, that is CityWalk, Tsuen Wan Plaza and Emperor Plaza. After performing the detailed data analysis, it is found out that most people think that provision <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> is an important factor that affects people’s decision to visit and shop in the shopping centers, but this factor is not as crucial as factors like location, variety of shops and provision of open spaces. Also, this factor is important to both the newly-built shopping centers and renovated old shopping centers. Also, it is found out that differences in age groups and genders may have variations in determining the importance <b>of</b> provision <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> in general for the individual’s shopping preference. Young people relatively regarded provision <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> as more important factor that affect people’s decision, when compared to older people. Male also regard provision <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> as more important than female. Differences in age groups and genders may also show different priorities for the importance of each means <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> in shopping centers. Hence, we have to know the target group of the customers and to invest suitable means <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> or otherwise, the shopping centers cannot sustain with a high profit. For example, since there are more old people than the young people in Tsuen Wan, it is not practicable to invest a large sum of money on provision <b>of</b> means <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> which cater for the young and male more, such as the video game counters. However, it is always recommended to include the means <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> like the cinemas, fitness and spa centers and toy shops as investments from the owners or the management companies of the shopping centers towards these means <b>of</b> <b>entertainments</b> is relatively small, when comparing to other means <b>of</b> <b>entertainments.</b> published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster <b>of</b> Housing Managemen...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} aspect <b>of</b> <b>entertainment</b> is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience {{may have a}} passive role, {{as in the case}} of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, {{as in the case of}} games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms <b>of</b> <b>entertainment</b> have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music.
