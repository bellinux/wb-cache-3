5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy <b>of</b> <b>consideration.</b> In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E

On May8, Allen officially pulled his name out <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> for the draft. He did so on the final day allowed by the NCAA to ensure collegiate eligibility.|$|E

5|$|To numerically add {{physical}} quantities with units, {{they must}} be expressed with common units. For example, adding 50milliliters to 150milliliters gives 200milliliters. However, if a measure of 5feet is extended by 2inches, the sum is 62inches, since 60inches is synonymous with 5feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3meters and 4square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> is fundamental in dimensional analysis.|$|E
5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat.

When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E

5|$|Brodie was {{a native}} of Chicago, the son of Latvian Jewish {{immigrants}} who was alienated from both his family and his family's religion. A bright, emotional graduate student in international relations, Brodie eventually became a noted expert in military strategy during the Cold War era. The McKays were horrified at their daughter's impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family's strong objections.

5|$|Coke became {{involved}} in the now classic Shelley's Case in 1581, which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today; the case also established Coke's reputation as an attorney and case reporter. His next famous case was Chudleigh's Case, a dispute over the interpretation of the Statute of Uses, followed by Slade's Case, a dispute between the Common Pleas and King's Bench over assumpsit now regarded as a classic example of the friction between the two courts and the forward movement of contract law; Coke's argument in Slade's Case formed the first definition <b>of</b> <b>consideration.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Barra estates of MacNeil (including all the Barra Isles) {{were sold}} to Colonel John Gordon of Cluny Aberdeenshire in 1840 whose lack <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> for his tenants during the potato famines was matched by his zeal for evictions to create sheep farms. However, the Highland Clearances {{seemed to have the}} effect of {{increasing}} Mingulay’s population as families evicted from Barra sometimes chose to re-settle there rather than take the emigrant ships to Nova Scotia. In this regard Mingulay's remoteness was probably an advantage and rents were actually reduced from 1840–45. In 1878 Lady Gordon Cathcart inherited the estate and visited but once during her fifty-four year period of tenure.|$|E

5|$|The Saint Francis Health System owns several {{hospitals}} with {{a central}} location at Saint Francis Hospital {{in the southern part}} of the city. The facility contains 700 doctors and 918 beds, and with more than 7,000 employees, the network is the second largest healthcare employer in the state. The health system also operates a heart hospital, which was named by General Electric in 2004 one of the most advanced heart hospitals in the nation. St. John Medical Center, located in an 11-story midtown center, employs nearly 700 doctors. Other networks, such as Hillcrest Health System, operate a number of facilities in varying sizes. Beginning in 2007, the city elected to renew a five-year contract with EMSA for ambulance service after a period <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> to switch to the Tulsa Fire Department for providing such services.|$|E

5|$|The near {{simultaneous}} {{appearance of}} nodosaurids in both North America and Europe is worthy <b>of</b> <b>consideration,</b> {{because at the}} time, they were separated from each other by a huge body of water. Europelta is the oldest nodosaurid from Europe; it {{is derived from the}} lower Albian Escucha Formation. The oldest western North American nodosaurid is Sauropelta, from the lower Albian Little Sheep Mudstone Member of the Cloverly Formation, at an age of 108.5±0.2million years. Eastern North American fossils seem older. Teeth of Priconodon crassus have been derived from the Arundel Clay of the Potomac Group of Maryland, which dates near the Aptian–Albian boundary. A Propanoplosaurus hatchling was uncovered {{from the base of the}} underlying Patuxent Formation, dated to the upper Aptian, making Propanoplosaurus the oldest nodosaurid.|$|E

Mona breaks out of her cell, and after fighting off the Cleaners, Max and Mona begin hunting down the people responsible for the attack. Their search leads them to a construction site, where he and Mona defend themselves against the Cleaners. After their foes leave, Winterson arrives and holds Mona at gunpoint. Mona claims that Winterson is there to kill her, while Winterson claims that she is simply trying to arrest a fleeing fugitive. After several moments <b>of</b> <b>consideration,</b> Max fatally shoots Winterson, allowing Mona to escape. Before she dies, Winterson shoots Max, hospitalizing him.|$|E
5|$|After {{announcing his}} plans for the World Coal Center, Wilkinson began {{attending}} meetings of the Lexington Urban City Council, where he advocated his fiscally conservative political views. He was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, although he said he wished Reagan was a Democrat like himself. In 1979, Wilkinson became involved with Terry McBrayer's campaign against John Y. Brown, Jr. in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. He held a critical fundraiser for Scotty Baesler's 1981 Lexington mayoral campaign, although most of the businessmen in Lexington favored Baesler's opponent. In the 1983 Democratic gubernatorial primary, he served as finance chairman for Harvey Sloane's campaign. When Sloane lost a close race to Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins, Republican nominee Jim Bunning tried to enlist the support of Sloane and his supporters, including Wilkinson. After a month <b>of</b> <b>consideration,</b> however, Wilkinson endorsed the entire Democratic ticket. The following year, he managed former governor Brown's brief senatorial campaign. Already considering running for governor in 1987, Wilkinson had hoped to remove Brown as a potential competitor for that office by helping him get elected to the Senate, but Brown ended his campaign early for health reasons. Through his work in various the campaigns, Wilkinson found that he enjoyed the challenges of competing in the political arena. He lobbied the General Assembly to pass a multi-bank holding company bill allowing banking companies to own more than one Kentucky bank. The bill passed in 1984.|$|E

5|$|McKinsey & Company grew {{quickly in}} the 1940s and 50s, {{especially}} in Europe. It had 88 staff in 1951 and more than 200 by the 1960s, including 37 in London by 1966. In the same year, McKinsey had six offices in major US cities like San Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., as well as six abroad. These foreign offices were primarily in Europe, such as in London, Paris, Amsterdam, {{as well as in}} Melbourne. By this time, one third of the company's revenues originated from its European offices. Guy Crockett stepped down as managing director in 1950, and Marvin Bower was elected in his place. McKinsey's profit-sharing, executive and planning committees were formed in 1951. The organization's client base expanded especially among governments, defense contractors, bluechip companies and military organizations in the post-World War II era. After seven years <b>of</b> <b>consideration,</b> McKinsey became a private corporation with shares owned exclusively by McKinsey employees in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days before}} {{scheduled}} services were to start, {{permission to use}} the trains had still not been granted by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. The inspectorate had a series of safety concerns, including follow-up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles; lack of documentation of the crew's training; denying NSB's request to have fewer inspections and less maintenance on the trains; lack <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> of critical events deemed to have a high probability to occur but have a low consequence; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted axle load of the lines. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) warned against a possible weakness in the axles. NSB wanted to use an expert from Deutsche Bahn to perform the necessary tests, but limited availability of the expert resulted in the Norwegian National Rail Administration granting a half-year delay of the inspections.|$|E
