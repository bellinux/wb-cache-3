5|$|Hordern's London debut came in January 1937, as an {{understudy}} to Bernard Lee in {{the play}} Night Sky at the Savoy Theatre. <b>On</b> <b>nights</b> {{when he was not}} required, Hordern would be called upon to undertake the duties of assistant stage manager, for which he was paid £2.10s a week. In March, Daltry, who had since formed his own company, Westminster Productions, cast Hordern as Ludovico in Othello.|$|E
5|$|BuzzSaw is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. In 1876, the Town of Gold Rush was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great gold rush. Eleven years later, in 1887, the town's Gold supply was {{completely}} gone. The town then established a sawmill and turned their focus to timber. On a clear moon-lit night, a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by the buzz saw after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill and slipped into the path of the buzz saw. The sawmill has remained closed since with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack <b>on</b> <b>nights</b> similar to that of his death.|$|E

5|$|Development of Burning Rangers started around November 1996, {{after the}} release of Sonic Team's {{previous}} game Christmas Nights (a Christmas-themed demo for Nights into Dreams...). The concept originated with the idea of rescuing people as opposed to killing them, which was an element that producer Yuji Naka felt was too common in contemporary video games. The development team of 31 (out of Sonic Team's staff of about 50) was directed by Naoto Ohshima, the director and lead designer Takao Miyoshi. The rest of the team consisted of three game planners, six programmers, eighteen designers, and two sound producers, most of whom had worked <b>on</b> <b>Nights</b> into Dreams....|$|E
5|$|Mondays through Saturdays, BART trains run on five routes; {{four are}} transbay routes {{connecting}} San Francisco to Oakland and various destinations in the East Bay, while the fifth, the Richmond–Warm Springs line, runs {{exclusively in the}} East Bay. Two of the five routes do not run <b>on</b> <b>nights</b> and weekends, and one is truncated on Saturdays, but all stations remain accessible by transfers via other routes. In September 1972 BART's first route opened: Fremont to MacArthur, extended to Richmond in January 1973. Concord to MacArthur started in May 1973 and Montgomery Street to Daly City began in November 1973. The original system was completed in September 1974 when trains first carried passengers through the underwater Transbay Tube. BART's three routes then were Concord–Daly City, Fremont-Daly City and Richmond–Fremont.|$|E
5|$|As Sonic Team {{was working}} <b>on</b> <b>Nights</b> into Dreams, Sega tasked the U.S.-based Sega Technical Institute (STI) with {{developing}} {{what would have}} been the first fully 3D entry in its popular Sonic the Hedgehog series. The game, Sonic X-treme, was moved to the Saturn after several prototypes for other hardware (including the 32X) were discarded. It featured a fisheye lens camera system that rotated levels with Sonic's movement. After Nakayama ordered the game be reworked around the engine created for its boss battles, the developers were forced to work between 16 and 20 hours a day to meet their December 1996 deadline. Weeks of development time proved fruitless after Stolar rescinded STI's access to Sonic Team's Nights into Dreams engine following an ultimatum by Nights programmer Yuji Naka. After programmer Ofer Alon quit and designers Chris Senn and Chris Coffin became ill, the project was cancelled in early 1997. Sonic Team started work on an original 3D Sonic title for the Saturn, but development was shifted to the Dreamcast and the game became Sonic Adventure. STI was disbanded in 1996 as a result of changes in management at Sega of America.|$|E

5|$|Fish {{and other}} aquatic prey {{taken in the}} water or at the water's edge form the major part of American alligator's diet and may be eaten {{at any time of}} the day or night. Adult American {{alligators}} also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50m (170ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs <b>on</b> <b>nights</b> with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them {{from the edge of the}} water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the American alligator are designed to grip prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard instead to masticate their food. The American alligator is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone. Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed and documented killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that bonnetheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays and nurse sharks are components of the animal's diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators in turn, indicating encounters between the two predators are more common than thought.|$|E

25|$|Off-campus residents, {{who make}} up the {{remaining}} 80% of the student body, may travel to campus by walking, bicycling, driving by motor vehicle, or taking the off-campus shuttle.

Those who travel to campus by an automobile park on assigned student parking lots located throughout the campus and travel to their classes by walking or taking the on-campus shuttle. Motorcycle parking lots are also located throughout the campus for motorcyclists.

25|$|<b>On</b> <b>nights</b> and {{weekends}} {{away from the}} Ballets Russes, Brodovitch began sketching designs for textiles, china, and jewelry. By the time his work for the ballet had finished, he had already compiled an extensive portfolio of these side projects and was selling his designs to fashionable shops. He worked part-time doing layouts for Cahiers d'Art, an important art journal, and Arts et Métiers Graphiques, an influential design magazine. While working on layouts, Brodovitch was responsible for fitting together type, photographs, and illustrations {{on the pages of}} the magazines. He had the rare opportunity of having influence over the look of the magazine as there was no art director.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2012, NBC Sports was {{reportedly}} involved in negotiations for a television contract with Major League Baseball. NBCSN was expected to play a large part in NBC's bid. However, it was likely that NBC would want either marquee event (All-Star Game and World Series) to air on the broadcast network rather than cable. This could have potentially conflicted with the network's broadcasts of Sunday Night Football, which has generally had a game or two scheduled <b>on</b> <b>nights</b> when a World Series game is held since 2010; however, prior to this, no game was scheduled on these nights so {{it would not have}} been unprecedented. Besides the potential conflicts with Sunday Night Football, another disadvantage for NBCSN is that it was available in fewer than 80 million homes, trailing the national reach of both Fox Sports 1 and TBS.|$|E

25|$|KTVU officially joined Fox {{seven months}} later on October 9, 1986, when the fledgling network inaugurated {{programming}} with the debut of the late night talk show The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers. Similar to other Fox stations during the network's early years, KTVU was programmed as a de facto independent station, even after Fox expanded its programming into prime time on weekend evenings in April 1987. Until Fox completed the expansion of its prime time schedule (which began with the launch of a Saturday night lineup in July 1987, and was gradually rolled out to additional nights {{over the next seven}} years) and began offering programming on a nightly basis in September 1993, KTVU continued to air a movie at 8:00p.m. <b>on</b> <b>nights</b> when the network did not offer any programming. However, the station also decreased its reliance on movies during this period, due to the growing difficulty of broadcast stations in acquiring film content as the number of cable television networks increased. The strong ratings that KTVU had as an independent station carried over into its tenure with Fox, turning it into one of the network's strongest affiliates; despite having its programming occasionally being pre-empted by San Francisco Giants game telecasts, Fox was very satisfied with KTVU because of its ratings performance.|$|E
