50|$|The GO-300's tainted {{reputation}} was largely undeserved, since its problems {{were the result}} of pilots who were unfamiliar with gear reduction engines, simply not operating the engine as specified in the C-175 Pilot's <b>Operating</b> <b>Handbook.</b> Pilots unfamiliar with the engine often operated the engine at the low RPM settings (2300-2700) appropriate to direct-drive engines, while the 175's <b>Operating</b> <b>Handbook</b> called for cruising at 2900 RPM. The low RPM caused harmonic vibration in the reduction gear between the quill shaft (that turned the propeller) and crankshaft, and the low power resulted in low airspeeds that prevented the engine's air-cooling system from operating effectively, resulting in chronic reliability problems for engines not operated at the recommended power settings.|$|E

All SPCs may be placed “on call” during campus crises and assist in emergency situations as required. Campus crises may include but are not limited to snow emergencies, class cancellations, inclement weather, group disturbances, and power outages. 5. The SPC sleeps in their assigned rooms most evenings. Conspicuous patterns of absence may result in disciplinary action.; The SPC, prior to Winter recess, spring break, and the closing of the halls for summer, stays until all students have vacated the hall, the hall is officially closed, and all required administrative paperwork has been completed. Permission to leave early for these closings must be approved by the GLBT Center Director and/or Graduate Assistant, and/or Senior Center staff, and/or designated staff member.; COMPENSATION AND ELIGIBILITY 1. The SPC is compensated at a value equivalent of a full resident room waiver (set at RA room charge) and the standard meal plan during entire period of employment. If SPC is assigned to and living in an apartment unit he/she is not required to have a meal plan. A $ 300. 00 longevity stipend is provided to SPCs who are employed beyond two full academic year semesters. 2. Loss of employment results in the loss of these room and board waivers and all related stipends, privileges, and room assignment.; 3. The SPC pays all fees associated with attending The University of Rhode Island as a fully matriculating student. These fees include the University resident technology fee. The GLBT Center reserves the right to suspend employment for the SPC if his/her University account is in arrears. 4. The SPC is required to maintain a grade point average of 2. 5 during the entire period of employment. If the grade point level falls below the 2. 5 minimum, the SPC will have no more than 2 semesters to return his/her GPA to a 2. 5 or better status. If sufficient improvement is not made over a 2 semester period, the SPC’s employment can be terminated. 5. The SPC is expected to abide by all URI policies and regulations. If the SPC receives active judicial sanctions during his/her employment, he/she may loss his/her eligibility for continued SPC employment. Loss of employment will be decided upon by the GLBT Center Director and/or Graduate Assistant, and/or Senior Center staff, and/or designated staff members.; Please Note: The SPC position could affect your financial aid package. Check with a financial aid advisor for information specific to your circumstances. Financial Aid is required by US Department of Education to include RA/SPC compensation as part of a student’s financial aid package. However, it cannot be counted against a student’s entitlement aid (Pell Grants and Need Grants). Current tax law interpretation indicates that the room and board portion of the SPC compensation package is considered a “convenience to the employer” and, as such, is non-taxable income. Meals are provided on premises and the SPC is required to live in an assigned room as a condition of employment. Also, the SPC is an “at will” employee. As such, the University may terminate the position at any time given reasonable cause...|$|R

5000|$|In light aircraft, {{full power}} is {{typically}} used when climbing. The type of climb is therefore {{determined by the}} pitch attitude. The aircraft's Pilot <b>Operating</b> <b>Handbook</b> (P.O.H.) will list the airspeeds for {{the various types of}} climbs. The pilot adjusts the aircraft's pitch attitude to match the speed quoted in the P.O.H. for that particular type of climb desired. While the airspeed indicator is used for precise airspeed control, it is generally fairly easy for an experienced pilot to distinguish the different [...] "look" [...] of the cruise, max-rate, or max-angle climb attitudes when he is familiar with a particular aircraft type. Larger aircraft follow the same principles, the only difference being that full power is not always used, especially at lower altitudes, as the engines are usually powerful enough to create excessive airspeed or engine overheating.|$|E
50|$|The {{required}} procedure differs {{based on}} the aircraft type, so the Pilots <b>Operating</b> <b>Handbook</b> (POH) should be consulted for the specific aircraft type. In general, the technique is to utilize maximum flaps {{for this type of}} landing. The approach is made with engine power commensurate with maintaining the approach airspeed listed in the POH. In cases where a POH is unavailable, a speed not more than 1.3 VSO should be used. The use of full flaps will enable steeper approaches to the aiming point, which is particularly useful in cases where the approach must be made over obstacles. Speed must be maintained precisely in order to execute a stabilized approach. After touch-down, the pilot applies maximum wheel braking and up-elevator to counter the pitch-over moment caused by braking and reduce the chances of a propeller strike. Flaps are sometimes retracted to allow better braking performance by reducing lift on the wing. Spoilers may also be used, where equipped.|$|E
50|$|NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart {{emphasized}} that consideration of human factors, {{which was not}} emphasized in the design, safety assessment, and operation of SpaceShipTwo’s feather system, is critical to safe manned spaceflight to mitigate the potential consequences of human error. “Manned commercial spaceflight is a new frontier, with many unknown risks and hazards. In such an environment, safety margins around known hazards must be rigorously established and, where possible, expanded. For commercial spaceflight to successfully mature, we must meticulously seek out and mitigate known hazards, as a prerequisite to identifying and mitigating new hazards.” In its submission to the NTSB, Virgin Galactic reports that the second SS2, currently nearing completion, has been modified with an automatic mechanical inhibit device to prevent locking or unlocking of the feather during safety-critical phases. An explicit warning {{about the dangers of}} premature unlocking has also been added to the checklist and <b>operating</b> <b>handbook,</b> and a formalized crew resource management (CRM) approach, already used by Virgin for its WK2 operations, is being adopted for SS2. However, despite CRM issues being cited as a likely contributing cause, Virgin confirmed that it would not modify the cockpit display system.|$|E
5000|$|A {{carburetor}} is used {{to provide}} the air-fuel mixture. Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing, a condition most {{likely to occur in}} conditions of a low 11 °C (20 °F) difference between the outside air temperature and dew point (the [...] "dew point spread"), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere. Icing can lead to loss of engine power and, if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control {{is used to}} supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the collective pitch control lever. Pulling the control up slides a gate valve near the carburetor that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a [...] "carburetor heat assist" [...] which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's <b>Operating</b> <b>Handbook</b> (POH).|$|E

The handbook recognizes established standards and describes accepted aviation and engineering practices. The instruction provided by this handbook is intended to identify desired results, establish standardized requirements, and provide statewide uniformity in the administration, maintenance, and construction of airports managed by the state. The primary audience for this handbook is WSDOT Aviation staff, WSDOT maintenance staff, private contractors, airport volunteers, and other interests. Other local, state, and federal agencies and organizations that use the airport facilities should also be familiar with the guidance and instructions included in this handbook. The guidance is intended to complement airport design, construction, and maintenance techniques to promote uniformity of results among all WSDOT regions. WSDOT State-Managed Airport Handbook M 3072 Page 1 - 1 February 2011 Aviation System Overview Chapter 1 This handbook is divided into two primary sections.

The key to successful management of an emergency situation, and/or preventing a non-normal situation from progressing into a true emergency, is a thorough familiarity with, and adherence to, the procedures developed by the airplane manufacturer and contained in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual and/or Pilot’s <b>Operating</b> <b>Handbook</b> (AFM/POH). The following guidelines are generic and {{are not meant to}} replace the airplane manufacturer’s recommended procedures. Rather, they are meant to enhance the pilot’s general knowledge in the area of non-normal and emergency operations. If any of the guidance in this chapter conflicts in any way with the manufacturer’s recommended procedures for a particular make and model airplane, the manufacturer’s recommended procedures take precedence. EMERGENCY LANDINGS This section contains information on emergency landing techniques in small fixed-wing airplanes. The guidelines that are presented apply to the more adverse terrain conditions for which no practical training is possible. The objective is to instill in the pilot the knowledge that almost any terrain can be considered “suitable ” for a survivable crash landing if the pilot knows how to use the airplane structure for self-protection and the protection of passengers.

The project was executed by Edi Progetti & Sviluppo and completed in August 2013 {{with the construction of}} a full-scale prototype of IDINTOS. The primary objective of this thesis was to establish an initial draft manual (Pilot’s <b>Operating</b> <b>Handbook,</b> POH) based on the IDINTOS research activities compliant with standard regulations for future use in certification applications. This encompassed observing, actively participating and documenting the manufacturing and assembly end to end process during all phases of the IDINTOS project. The thesis is divided in three parts. The first part provides an overview of the main aviation regulations and the current legislative framework for sport and recreational aviation. The second part illustrates the prototype construction and assembly through a series of pictures taken during the assembly process. Additionally it addresses the thought process for identifying the best features of the prototype and their integration into the final product. The last part of the thesis is the initial draft of the POH for the IDINTOS prototype, prepared in accordance with standard requirements set forth in General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) Specification No. 1...|$|E
