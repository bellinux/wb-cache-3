5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
25|$|A {{room on the}} {{northeast}} corner of {{the third floor of the}} Arsenal was made into a courtroom, and the prisoners were brought into the room through a side door, which prevented them from passing by or being harassed by spectators. Surratt was given special considerations during the trial because of her illness and gender. In the courtroom, she sat apart from the other prisoners. Sources differ as to whether an armed guard sat <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> like for other prisoners during the trial. While the others wore wrist and ankle manacles in the courtroom, she did not. She was also permitted a bonnet, fan, and veil to hide her face from spectators. As her illness worsened during the trial, she was moved to a larger and more comfortable prison cell.|$|E
25|$|In {{the centre}} panel, Mary {{is shown in}} a red robe holding the Christ's lifeless long body. Saint Peter and Luke the Evangelist stand <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Both are dressed in black clothes, and represent, the {{foundation}} of the early Church and the Gospels, respectively. The right-hand panel shows the moment (not in any of the Gospels) when Christ appears to his mother after his Resurrection, which is repeated at a smaller scale in the distance through the open doorway at rear. Although van der Weyden had otherwise presented the chronology of the triptych from left to right, the background resurrection is {{to the right of the}} Appearance in the foreground. The sequence is suggested by the picture's depth (in that the scene in the foreground is chronologically the more recent), and by the long winding path that leads from the tomb to the interior.|$|E
50|$|Depictions include Saint Peter and Andrew the Apostle, these shown <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a Christ in Majesty. <b>On</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> {{the central}} {{painting}} are large statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Peter.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{because the}} level set filter not only {{preserves}} edges but also enhances edges by inhibiting diffusion across edges and allowing diffusion <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge. So, standard deviation will become large in Table 1. Meanwhile, {{it appears that}} some edges are enhanced, that is, the difference <b>of</b> intensity value <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge becomes large (Figure 3 (i)). At a word, black will become more black while white more white <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge.|$|R
50|$|Fracture {{zones and}} the {{transform}} faults that form them are separate features. Transform faults are plate boundaries, meaning that <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the fault {{is a different}} plate. In contrast, <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a fracture zone, the crust belongs to the same plate.|$|R

After the modifications, she carried eighteen 2 cm guns, fourteen 3.7 cm guns, {{and the rest of}} her armament remained unchanged.|$|E
500|$|During this time, La Spezia was {{attacked}} many times by Allied bomber groups. Attacks on 14 and 19 April 1943, did not hit Roma, but an American raid on 5 June, severely damaged both Vittorio Veneto and Roma. B-17 aircraft carrying [...] armor-piercing bombs damaged the stationary battleships with two bombs each. Roma suffered from two near hits <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bow. The starboard-side bomb hit the ship but {{passed through the}} side of the hull before exploding. The ship began taking on water through leaks from frames 221 to 226—an area covering about —and through flooding from the bow to frame 212. The second bomb missed but exploded in the water near the hull. Leaks were discovered over a [...] area ranging from frames 198 and 207. Approximately [...] of water entered the ship.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, for example, {{the court}} {{accepted}} {{the claim of}} the Dean of Westminster to advise the Queen on the proper procedure during the ceremony (for nearly a thousand years he and his predecessor abbots have kept an unpublished Red Book of practices), the claim of the Lord Bishop of Durham and the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells to walk beside the Queen as she entered and exited the Abbey and to stand <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> through the entire coronation ritual, the claim of the Earl of Shrewsbury {{in his capacity as}} Lord High Steward of Ireland to carry a white staff. The legal claim of the Scholars of Westminster School {{to be the first to}} acclaim the monarch on behalf of the common people was formally disallowed by the court, but in practice their traditional shouts of [...] "Vivat! Vivat Rex!" [...] were still incorporated into the coronation anthem I was glad.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{of the church is}} relatively plain, with two towers <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the main door, topped with onion domes.The interior is decorated in lavish Baroque style, with pink marble columns.There are three <b>side</b> chapels <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a wide main nave.|$|R
50|$|At {{the top of}} {{the command}} tower were the captain's {{personal}} quarters, including a chair mounted on a vertical track giving him the capability of rapidly transiting to his command post in Bridge 1. <b>On</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the main bridge were radar units. Below that was Bridge 2, and directly below the command tower, {{on the underside of the}} ship, is Bridge 3. There were also observation domes <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the command tower, and larger windowed sections <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the main hull.|$|R
50|$|The medial {{and lateral}} {{portions}} of the quadriceps tendon pass down <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the patella to be inserted into the upper extremity <b>of</b> the tibia <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the tuberosity; these portions merge into the capsule, as stated above, forming the medial and lateral patellar retinacula.|$|R

Two birds of prey are situated <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head. Her hair is being plaited by a small woman on the right.|$|E
2500|$|Rainbow and [...] were {{in company}} on 18 June {{searching for a}} [...] "remarkably fast-sailing brigantine", of one gun and 40 men. During the night they found her {{and were able to}} come up <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> They then forced her on shore under Cape Cavallo, Sardinia ( [...] ; {{probably}} Capo Coda Cavallo).|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} shows a half-length figure, {{the body}} of a woman turned at a three-quarter angle toward her right, but her face turned toward her left. Her gaze is directed neither straight ahead, nor toward the viewer, but toward a [...] "third party" [...] beyond the picture's frame. In her arms, Gallerani holds a small white-coated stoat, known as an ermine. Gallerani's dress is comparatively simple, revealing that she is not a noblewoman. Her coiffure, known as a coazone, confines her hair smoothly to her head with two bands of hair bound <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face and a long plait at the back. Her hair is held in place by a fine gauze veil with a woven border of gold-wound threads, a black band, and a sheath over the plait.|$|E
5|$|Korall radar-jammers were mounted <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the {{mainmast}} {{as well as}} a Machta {{system on}} the foremast. Solentse-1P infrared detectors were carried <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the superstructure. Fakel-MO and Fakel-MZ antenna comprised the IFF system. A Gerkules sonar was also fitted in addition to various radio direction finders.|$|R
