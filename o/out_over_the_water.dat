5|$|For 15,000 years, {{native peoples}} {{gathered}} at Wyam {{to fish and}} exchange goods. They built wooden platforms <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and caught salmon with dipnets and long spears on poles as the fish swam up through the rapids and jumped over the falls. Historically, an estimated fifteen to twenty million salmon passed through the falls every year, {{making it one of}} the greatest fishing sites in North America.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the launch}} site on Meck began in late 1967. In this installation, the {{majority}} of the system was built above ground in a single-floor rectangular building. The MSR was built in a boxy extension on the northwestern corner of the roof, with two sides angled back to form a half-pyramid shape where the antennas were mounted. Small clutter fences were built to the north and northwest, and the western side faced <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> which was only a few tens of meters from the building. Illeginni did not have a radar site; it was operated remotely from Meck.|$|E
25|$|Sometime later, as the reunited family look <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> at the Spanish ships, Jaguar Paw {{decides not to}} risk {{approaching}} the conquistadors, insisting his family head back into the jungle. They depart {{in search of a}} new home.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly he felt {{a strange}} {{catching}} of breath in his lungs. He coughed. Blood, warm and salt, welled up from his throat. Then his bitter, strangled cry went <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters.</b> At last he understood {{the voices of the}} river.|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} I, too, wearied of the scene of desolation. My errant steps took me in the {{direction}} of the sea. As I approached, I was aware of a figure standing in the moonlight, gazing silently <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters.</b> Beside <b>the</b> figure was a dog.|$|R
60|$|Had {{either of}} the others been left on guard it is {{possible}} something might have been done; but Jason Wentworth {{was not a man}} to be caught napping, and while he seemingly directed his gaze <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters,</b> at <b>the</b> slightest movement of {{either of the}} prisoners he was on the alert against an attempt at escape.|$|R
25|$|On calm summer afternoons {{with little}} {{prevailing}} wind, sea breezes from both coasts may collide in the middle, creating especially severe storms {{down the center}} of the state. These thunderstorms can drift towards either the west or east coast depending on the relative strengths of the sea breezes, and sometimes survive to move <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> at night, creating spectacular cloud-to-cloud lightning shows for hours after sunset. Due to its large size Lake Okeechobee may also contribute to this activity by creating its own lake breeze which collides with the east and west coast sea breezes.|$|E
25|$|After {{the closure}} of the {{upstream}} enclosed docks, the area was regenerated as part of the Docklands scheme, and is now home to the developments of Canary Wharf. The early phase one buildings of Canary Wharf were built <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> reducing the width of the north dock and middle dock, and the Jubilee line station was later constructed within the middle dock. Since 2009, the Canary Wharf Crossrail station and the Crossrail Place development above it have been under construction within the north dock. Further parts of the western end of the south and middle docks are also being built over in new developments currently under construction.|$|E
25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, swing <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a {{cushioned}} area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|E
60|$|As {{the minutes}} passed and {{we failed to}} hear any sound from <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> betokening <b>the</b> coming {{of those who were}} to meet us, it was only with {{difficulty}} I refrained from crying aloud in my impatience and fear, and when one of the boys moved suddenly, breaking the silence, I started in alarm, believing the lobster backs were close at hand.|$|R

5000|$|Gulf of Tehuantepec (Golfo de Tehuantepec) is a {{large body}} of <b>water</b> on <b>the</b> Pacific coast of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, southeastern Mexico, at [...] Many (but not all) Pacific hurricanes form in or near this body of water. A strong, gale-force wind called the Tehuano {{periodically}} blows <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> Gulf of Tehuantepec, inducing strong upwelling of nutrient-rich waters which support abundant sea life.|$|R
25|$|The {{approach}} procedure in use for this flight {{in the low}} clouds and low visibility conditions that night required the pilot to fly over the MAC VOR at 3,900 feet, then turn west-northwest to fly <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> descend to 1,540 feet and level off within nine miles, then make a left base turn to fly east, back toward the airport (a teardrop procedure turn), and descend for final approach {{with the use of}} the MAC VOR. The pilot was not allowed to descend below 1,540 feet until the turn was completed, and then not below 1,045 feet unless he had the runway in sight. Once the pilot could see the airport from that altitude, he would be allowed to circle and land on the runway of his choice. This is called a circle-to-land manoeuvre, or sometimes a cloud break procedure. The pilot elected to attempt this circling approach to land on runway 29 instead of landing straight in on runway 11, though the reported clouds at the time would have made a circling approach impossible at the minimum altitude of 1,045 feet.|$|E
60|$|Margery {{looked at}} the eager face turned towards her, and then she gazed <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "'Bout {{as far as}} I can get, in this country," [...] the boy replied, gazing <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> [...] "Isn't {{this the}} Pacific Ocean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God Almighty!" [...] he cried. And his caustic {{laughter}} rolled <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> whirling <b>waters.</b> <b>The</b> boat, now disengaged {{from the}} driftwood, floated swiftly down the river.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he raised {{both hands to}} his mouth and gave vent to a {{prolonged}} halloo that swept <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> calm <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> bay.|$|R
60|$|Sullenly the Wieroos acquiesced. Bradley {{examined}} the knots {{that held the}} rope to their ankles, and feeling them secure directed the girl to mount {{the back of the}} leading Wieroo, himself upon the other. Then he gave the signal for the two to rise together. With loud flapping of the powerful wings the creatures took to the air, circling once before they topped the trees upon the hill and then taking a course due west <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> sea.|$|R
60|$|So saying, Rollo {{pointed to}} a large mill wheel which was slowly {{revolving}} {{by the side of}} a building that projected <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> on the island.|$|E

6000|$|... "It always tranquillizes me," [...] said Margery, as {{they stood}} {{side by side on}} the bank, [...] "to look <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Doesn't it have that effect on you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 'Voyages' is Steinunn's two part {{sculpture}} {{that was}} commissioned by the British and Icelandic governments. The sister statues gaze <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> between Hull, England and Vik, Iceland. The two fishing towns {{have a long history}} of trade relations spanning over 1000 years which was colored by the Cod War in the 1950s and 1970s. The statues symbolize the reestablishment of friendship between the two towns. Poets Angela Leighton, Carol Rumens, Cliff Forshaw, and David Wheatley composed poems in honor of the unveiling of the sculptures.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 January 1991, Worden participated in the air war by {{directing}} combat aircraft into Kuwait and Iraq and by providing air search radar coverage and combat air patrol for the northern Persian Gulf Naval Force. Worden air intercept controllers were instrumental in the shoot down of the only two Iraqi aircraft to venture <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> Persian Gulf. Two Navy F-14 Tomcat fighters under positive control of Worden were directed at the two Iraqi aircraft which attempted to escape <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Saudi desert only to be shot down by Royal Saudi Air Force F-15 Eagles.|$|R
5|$|As Florence {{remained}} <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> open <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> central Atlantic, no effects, damages, or fatalities were reported. No {{tropical storm}} watches or warnings were issued, and {{the storm was}} never forecast to strike land.|$|R

60|$|Teddy, {{remembering what}} Jake {{had said about}} hunting, began to clean the guns, for both had been {{thoroughly}} wetted during the landing, and Neal walked slowly along as he looked <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> intently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said Mrs. Brinkley hopelessly, {{and both}} ladies looked <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> where the waves came rolling in {{one after another}} to waste {{themselves}} on the shore as futilely {{as if they had}} been lives.|$|E
60|$|We {{got here}} three days ago, {{and we have}} made a visit to the Isle of Wight. We went {{straight}} down to the southern coast, and stopped all night at the little town of Bonchurch. It was very lovely down there with roses and other flowers blooming out-of-doors as if it was summer, although it is now getting so cold everywhere else. But what pleased me most was to stand {{at the top of a}} little hill, and look <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> English Channel, and feel that not far out of eyeshot was the beautiful land of France with its lower part actually touching Italy.|$|R
6000|$|The two {{swimmers}} bore to the left, {{away from}} the captured schooner. Laughter and song followed on board after the hymn, then the phonograph started again. Grief grinned to himself at the appositeness of it as [...] "Lead, Kindly Light," [...] floated <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|Another maiden, {{the wind}} tossing her long chestnut-locks, uncovered, but tied with the Scottish snood, {{sat on the}} battlement, gazing far <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters,</b> with eyes of the same tint as the hair. Even the sea-breeze failed to give more than a slight touch of colour to her {{somewhat}} freckled complexion; and the limbs that rested in a careless attitude on the stone bench were long and languid, though with years and favourable circumstances {{there might be a}} development of beauty and dignity. Her lips were crooning at intervals a mournful old Scottish tune, sometimes only humming, sometimes uttering its melancholy burthen, and she now and then touched a small harp that stood by her side on the seat.|$|R
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head, still gazing far <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> [...] "I don't b'lieve this {{is bigger than}} any other ocean," [...] said he. [...] "I can't see any more of it than I can of the Atlantic." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{little later}} Blacky the Crow {{discovered}} another hunter {{hiding behind the}} bushes on his side. [...] "Caw! caw! caw!" [...] shouted Blacky, flying <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> far enough to be safe from that terrible gun he could see.|$|E
60|$|He took Marian's {{ring from}} his pocket and kissed it reverently. Then he threw it from him far <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> For a second the diamond flashed in the moonlight; then, with a tiny splash, it fell among the ripples.|$|E

5000|$|U.S. President Harry S. Truman commented: [...] "We {{must make}} the United Nations {{continue}} to work, {{and to be a}} going concern, to see that difficulties between nations may be settled just as we settle difficulties between States here in the United States. When Kansas and Colorado fall <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> in <b>the</b> Arkansas River, they don't go to war over it; they go to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the matter is settled in a just and honorable way. There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled {{in exactly the same way}} in a world court". -- President Truman's remarks in Omaha, Nebraska on June 5, 1948, at the dedication of the War Memorial. The cultural moment of the late 1940s was the peak of World Federalism among Americans.|$|R
