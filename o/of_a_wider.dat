5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
5|$|Between March and September 1939, {{the months}} leading up to the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Nicholas Winton, a 29-year-old Christian British stockbroker whose parents were of German Jewish descent, organised eight trains to transport mainly Jewish Czech and Slovak refugee children from Czechoslovakia to homes in Britain. The Winton trains were part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> British rescue effort from various other countries across Europe, known as the Kindertransports.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead.

5|$|It was {{the first}} battle in the War in Afghanistan in which Afghan army units were the {{principal}} fighting force.

Military engagement over Musa Qala is part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> conflict between coalition forces and the Taliban in Helmand.

5|$|Late Registration is {{the second}} of Kanye West's planned four education-themed studio albums. Following the major success of The College Dropout, the album reveals his {{progression}} in writing lyrics and an incorporation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> range of musical styles. At the time, {{the focal point of}} West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, {{due in part to the}} acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This {{was one of only}} a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E
5|$|Much Middle Scots {{literature}} {{was produced by}} makars, poets with links to the royal court. These included James I who wrote The Kingis Quair. Many of the makars had university education and so were also connected with the Kirk. However, Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris (c. 1505) provides evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk now largely lost. Before the advent of printing in Scotland, writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas {{have been seen as}} leading a golden age in Scottish poetry.|$|E

Józef Cyrankiewicz, the chief prosecution witness, was already dead, and Łapiński died in 2004, before the trial was concluded.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, concerns grew in the British government about the threat of German invasion along the east coast of England. The bays just to the north of Dunstanburgh Castle were vulnerable targets for an enemy amphibious landing, and efforts were made to fortify the castle and the surrounding area in 1940, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> line of defences erected by Sir Edmund Ironside.|$|E

It was hoped at this stage that the debt raised to pay for the bridge would be repaid by the Government within 12 months.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of perspective was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> trend towards realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously {{in the case}} of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.|$|E
