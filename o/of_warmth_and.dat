40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to clarify the tactile {{response}} of building materials by tactile sensor. We developed the compact tactile sensor that can measure the physical values <b>of</b> <b>warmth,</b> hardness <b>and</b> roughness <b>of</b> building materials. At a temperature of 2 ℃, psychological values <b>of</b> <b>warmth,</b> hardness <b>and</b> roughness were obtaind from the physical values of sixty materials by the tactile sensor. The tactile comfort value can be expressed from physical values <b>of</b> <b>warmth,</b> hardness <b>and</b> roughness by the tactile sensor. It was found that physical values <b>of</b> <b>warmth</b> hardness <b>and</b> roughness at 20 ℃ can be pridicted from the values measured by the tactile sensor in the region of 10 ? 30 ℃ other than 20 ℃.

25|$|The Great Parlour was {{the most}} {{important}} room in the early 17th century. According to the inventory of 1611 it had the best furniture, and contained the Batts' collection of maps. In the 1630s the Batts added a magnificent plaster ceiling and painted the oak panelling including a landscape scene above the fireplace. Most of the original panels have survived. The painting technique known as scumbling was a way of decorating to create an air <b>of</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> grandeur. Few examples of this decorative work survive today. In the late 17th century, dining rooms and parlours were the preferred rooms for eating and entertaining guests in private. The great parlour is furnished with pieces intended to show it as a fashionable and comfortable room of the 1690s.|$|E

The Rimsky-Korsakovs would eventually have seven children. Nadezhda was to become a musical as well as domestic partner with her husband, much as Clara Schumann had been with her own husband Robert. Beautiful, capable, strong-willed and far better trained musically than her husband at the time they married, she proved a good and most demanding critic of his work; her influence over him in musical matters was strong enough for Balakirev and Stasov to wonder sometimes whether she was leading him astray from their musical preferences. Although she gradually gave up composition after her marriage, she had a considerable influence on the creation of his first three operas. She travelled with her husband, attended rehearsals and proofread and arranged compositions by him and others.|$|E
500|$|Inflow is {{the flow}} of a fluid into a large {{collection}} of that fluid. Within meteorology, inflow normally refers to the influx <b>of</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> moisture from air within the Earth's atmosphere into storm systems. Extratropical cyclones are fed by inflow focused along their cold front and warm fronts. Tropical cyclones require a large inflow <b>of</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> moisture from warm oceans {{in order to develop}} significantly, mainly within the lowest [...] of the atmosphere. Once {{the flow of}} warm and moist air is cut off from thunderstorms and their associated tornadoes, normally by the thunderstorm's own rain-cooled outflow boundary, the storms begin to dissipate. Rear inflow jets behind squall lines act to erode the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and accelerate its forward motion.|$|E

500|$|Storms {{which have}} moved slowly, or loop, over a {{succession}} of days lead to the highest rainfall amounts for several countries.

[...] Many tropical cyclones progress at a forward motion of 10knots, which would limit the duration of this excessive rainfall to around one-quarter of a day, which would yield about 8.50inches (216mm) of rainfall.

[...] After their wedding in the summer of 1877, the Prokofievs moved to a small estate in the Smolensk governorate.

[...] He did not get along with everyone; he and England cricketer Wally Hammond feuded for nearly ten years over what Constantine perceived as a slight in 1925–26. Subsequently, Constantine continually bowled short when he encountered Hammond on the field, until the pair made peace in the Old Trafford Test match of 1933. After this, they pursued a more good-natured rivalry and became quite friendly; Hammond publicly expressed sympathy towards Constantine and other black West Indians for the discrimination that they faced.|$|E
500|$|Deep Blue Sea had {{a budget}} of $82 million and {{represented}} a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since Cliffhanger in 1993. Harlin's main goal was to bring the horror genre back to the serious and high-budget production values of films like The Exorcist, Jaws, The Shining, {{as opposed to the}} tongue-in-cheek style of subsequent films in the genre. Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien was an influence on the casting process, as Harlin wanted to cast the characters in a way as to make it impossible for the audience to know who was going to die or survive. To achieve this, he combined relatively unknown actors who could deliver solid performances and meet the physical demands of the diving and stunts with a star, Academy Award nominee Samuel L. Jackson, who [...] "anchors the whole piece". Harlin also forced the studio into hiring rapper LL Cool J because he wanted a character who could bring [...] "a lot <b>of</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> humor to the film without it being joke-type humor".|$|E

500|$|The {{war with}} France {{that began in}} 1793 {{was seen as an}} ideological war between the British monarchy vs. the French republic, which led {{conservative}} writers such as Jane West, Hannah More, and Elizabeth Hamilton to depict the feminine private sphere in the family as the embodiment of British values under threat from France, and to write a series of polemical works demanding that young women defend their [...] "modesty", as defined by conduct books, to give Britain the moral strength to prevail over the French. Johnson argued that Austen appropriated the sort of plot that More, West and Hamilton used in their books to quietly subvert via irony. In support of her thesis, Johnson noted in Sense and Sensibility the Dashwood sisters are victimized by their greedy half-brother John, showing the family as an area for competition instead <b>of</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> comfort; in Mansfield Park the lifestyle of the eminently respectable Bertram family is supported by a plantation in Antigua worked by slave labour; and Northranger Abbey where satirizing Gothic stories gives [...] "a nightmare version of patriarchal oppression" [...] as General Tilney, if not guilty of the specific crimes that Catherine Moreland imagines he has committed, is indeed a vicious man. Likewise, Johnson noted that Maria Rushworth's adultery in Mansfield Park is portrayed as merely salacious local gossip that does not presage a great victory for Napoleon while Marianne Dashwood does not die after being seduced by Willoughby, which undercuts the standard plot devices of the conservative writers. Johnston argued because of the drastic wartime censorship and the campaign of vitriolic abuse waged against Wollstonecraft that Austen had to be quiet in their criticism of patriarchy.|$|E
40|$|To gain {{information}} on the topographical distribution <b>of</b> <b>warmth,</b> burning <b>and</b> itch sensations in healthy humans, we delivered laser stimuli to elicit sensations <b>of</b> <b>warmth,</b> applied capsaicin cream for burning, and pricked histamine for itch on {{the skin of the}} face, shoulder, hand, thigh and foot in 12 healthy subjects. We found that whereas warm and burning sensations progressively increased from foot to face, itch sensation increased from face to foot (P < 0. 0001). Hence our findings indicate that unlike thermal and pain receptors, itch receptors are denser at distal than at proximal body sites. Our psychophysical study provides new information supporting the idea that specific unmyelinated neuronal pathways mediate sensations <b>of</b> <b>warmth,</b> burning <b>and</b> itch.
