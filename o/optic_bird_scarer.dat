40|$|Often {{perceived}} as pests, pigeon control is applied without investigating environmental, ecological and anthropogenic factors which affect their populations {{and response to}} controls. Estate Management of the University of South Africa’s Muckleneuk campus identified a need to investigate and address a perceived pigeon problem. Staff perceptions regarding the presence and attitude towards control of the pigeons was undertaken through an online Survey Monkey questionnaire and semi- structured interviews until saturation was achieved. It was determined that the a s sumed negative perception towards the pigeons was in fact incorrect. Participants would rather encourage the nesting and breeding activities of pigeons on campus, as they felt that the human–pigeon interactions and viewing of squabs in nests contributed positively to their work environment. Participants did not consider the pigeons or their related activities to pose a problem. It was felt that should control be imposed, the birds should rather be humanely managed through non-lethal measures rather than eradication. Pigeon numbers on five buildings on the University’s campus were counted at dawn and dusk, every week, for two years. The first year provided baseline data and the second year was when control measures were applied. The study determined that the pigeon population index fluctuated seasonally while breeding occurred throughout the year, with notable peaks and declines relating to physiological and population dynamics. The pigeons seemed to make opportunistic use of crop availability in surrounding farmlands during optimal production periods, while conserving energy when not favourable. Site selection in relation to building aspect indicated significant differences in all the seasons except for winter, while a positive significant relationship between level height and pigeon number was recorded. Once the control measures were applied, the total pigeon index on the campus declined by 50 %. Control structures differed significantly in efficacy. Bird spikes indicated the highest efficacy at reducing the pigeon population index and seasonality did influence this efficiency. Birds of prey and an audio <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> were used to compare actual versus implied predator presence, {{it was determined that}} there was an association between method of scaring and the number of pigeons observed on the different time periods. Pigeons were observed to continue the natural trend of dispersion and return at the dawn and dusk counts during the audio <b>bird</b> <b>scarer</b> trial without being actively discouraged or dislodged from the building. Pigeons reacted positively to the visual raptor presence, which caused them to take flight from the buildings. The visual effect was only temporary however as pigeons returned once the threat had been removed 10 minutes post scare.

Canada geese (Branta Canadensis) were offered selected ryegrass/endophyte Neotyphodium lolli seed and herbage {{to examine the effects of}} known endophyte alkaloids on their feeding behavior in 2000 - 2001. Forty geese were captured annually, contained in fenced areas by wing clipping and fed entophyte-free herbage and seed for a 3 -week period prior to starting any treatments. In a choice 60;cafeteria 61; and no choice feeding trial, geese consumed 30 % less herbage containing the selected endophyte than the endophyte-free ryegrass herbage. In a seed feeding trial, the geese did not discriminate on first exposure between the endophyte-free seed and that containing the selected endophytes. However, on day two there was an 80 % rejection of the seed containing the selected ryegrass/endophyte compared to the endophyte-free seed. The same rejection of 80 % was observed after a 3 -month endophyte-free feeding period, suggesting the rejection was a long-term, learned response or post-digestion feedback. The authors suggest continued research into this area will be of benefit in producing a living deterrent to birds by habitat modification. Learned-behavior response has been well documented in the past as the way forward. Farming grass/endophyte associations may add to mankind’s armory of bird-control methodology...|$|R
5|$|Conservationists {{are working}} with governments and {{fisheries}} {{in order to prevent}} further declines and increase populations of endangered procellariids. Progress has been made in protecting many colonies where most species are most vulnerable. On 20 June 2001, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels was signed by seven major fishing nations. The agreement lays out a plan to manage fisheries by-catch, protect breeding sites, promote conservation in the industry, and research threatened species. The developing field of island restoration, where introduced species are removed and native species and habitats restored, has been used in several procellariid recovery programmes. Invasive species such as rats, feral cats and pigs have been either removed or controlled in many remote islands in the tropical Pacific (such as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands), around New Zealand (where island restoration was developed), and in the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The grey-faced petrels of Whale Island (mentioned above) have been achieving much higher fledging successes after the introduced Norway rats were finally completely removed. At sea, procellariids threatened by long-line fisheries can be protected using techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and using <b>bird</b> <b>scarers</b> can all reduce the seabird by-catch. A further step towards conservation has been the signing of the 2001 treaty the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, which came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by eight countries, Australia, Ecuador, New Zealand, Spain, South Africa, France, Peru and the United Kingdom. The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce by-catch and pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands.|$|R

40|$|Ten {{years ago}} I waxed lyrical on the deep, {{indelible}} ties {{of the sounds}} of Dartmoor with its inhabitants (Drever 2002), betraying an inclination towards what Sterne’s has called the audio-visual litany (Sterne 2003). In this endeavour I added a sonic turn to Tuan’s concept of topophilia (Tuan 1974) : “fleeting visual pleasure; the sensual delight of physical contact; the fondness for place because it is familiar, because it is home and incarnates the past, because it evokes pride of ownership or of creation; joy in things because of animal health and vitality. " My notion of topophonophilia stressed the affirmative relationships between place, the sensation of sound and sentiment. Those of us who research and practice soundscapes, tacitly extol the positive attributes of sound and hearing with relation to space and place. We talk of how through sound we connect, locate, embody, discern and immerse. Through my recent research I am urged to propose that the opposite is also a reality: sound isolates, excludes, disconnects, disembodies and dislocates from the material and social world. Through {{a study of the}} impact of noise from high-speed hand dryers, my research uncovered a wide range of vulnerable groups that due to the sensitivity of their hearing or particular hearing requirements led to elevated anxiety, fear, pain and confusion and were in some cases exacerbating their social avoidance. These groups included infants; the elderly; partially sighted people; hearing aid users; and people with dementia, cerebral palsy, Ménière's disease, phonophobia, hyperacusis, or hyperacute hearing in the context of autism and Asperger's syndrome. In the case of autism exposure to noise can even lead to a shutdown. Following on from this study I came across an extensive range of environmental sounds that are causing suffering to these groups: <b>bird</b> <b>scarers,</b> mosquito alarm, classroom noise, traffic noise, waves on a beach and even the dawn chorus. With reference to Beethoven, Grandin, Canetti, Kafka and Noël Coward as well as new interview material, this paper will explore the sensory threshold shift of the sensitive hearer, and the sensitising of hearing, including the use of sonic thresholds to control subgroups. In conclusion, I propose a new paradigm for understanding hearing that extends from a medical classification of the otologically normal to a socio-cultural conception of the auraltypical. Within what I see as the hegemony of the auraltypical, I call for a new agenda of auraldiversity within acoustics and sound studies...|$|R

This suggests that processing by the left hemisphere is important in courtship singing, consistent with previous suggestions that it is involved in maintaining attention on stimuli to which a motor response is planned.

However, {{little is known about}} the development of specific subtypes of neurons in the tectum, particularly those which contribute tectofugal projections to the thalamus, isthmic region, and hindbrain. Here we show that two homeodomain transcription factors, Brn 3 a and Pax 7, are expressed in mutually exclusive patterns in the developing and mature avian midbrain. Neurons expressing these factors are generated at characteristic developmental times, and have specific laminar fates within the tectum. In mice expressing βgalactosidase targeted to the Pou 4 f 1 (Brn 3 a) locus, Brn 3 a-expressing neurons contribute to the ipsilateral but not the contralateral tectofugal projections to the hindbrain. Using misexpression of Brn 3 a and Pax 7 by electroporation in the chick tectum, combined with GFP reporters, we show that Brn 3 a determines the laminar fate of subsets of tectal neurons. Furthermore, Brn 3 a regulates the development of neurons contributing to specific ascending and descending tectofugal pathways, while Pax 7 globally represses the development of tectofugal projections to nearly all brain structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Most biochemical, physiological, and {{behavioral}} processes in verte-brates show significant daily rhythms. Under constant conditions, these rhythms exhibit an endogenous periodicity around 24 h showing {{that they are}} driven by an internal circadian clock. In Japanese quail, the circadian clock driving activity and body temperature rhythms is functionally organized as a dual-oscillator system. Under certain conditions, such as switching birds from light:dark (LD) 12 : 12 to continuous darkness (DD), the body temperature rhythm splits into two circadian components that free-run independently before recoupling in a normal phase-relationship. The behavior of the activity rhythm parallels that of the body temperature rhythm, supporting the hypothesis that both rhythms are driven by {{the same set of}} oscillators. In some instances, recoupling fails to occur and birds continue to exhibit two circadian components that free-run independently.

The present study provides the ®rst electrophysiological evidence that reversible blockade ofthe pigeon nucleus ofthe basal optic root by lidocaine can change visual responsiveness ofpretectal neurons in a direction-dependent manner. Thirty pretectal cells examined were classi®ed as unidirectional � 80 %), bidirectional � 10 %) and omnidirectional � 10 %) cells according to their directional selectivity. Among the unidirectional cells, seven cells changed ®ring rates in all directions ofmotion, 11 changed visual responses only in the preferred directions and six others did not change their responsiveness during lidocaine. Most ofthe bidirectional cells changed ®ring rates in the temporonasal direction, and two-thirds ofthe omnidirectional cells showed these changes in all directions.
