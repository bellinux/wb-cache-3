Concerns that fluorotelomer-based polymers are a possible source of âlow level â exposure to humans, coupled with their widespread use have prompted the need to develop a method to detect and measure perfluorooctanoate (PFO) in carpet. A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of PFO in carpet using a dual labeled 13 C-perfluoroctanoic acid (13 C-PFOA) internal standard is successfully developed and validated. Levels of PFO are determined using a gradient, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with acetic acid acidified waterâmethanol, separated on a 50 mm Phenomenex Synergi Polar RP column.

The use of lipase in household laundry reduces environmental pollution and enhances the ability of detergent to remove tough <b>oil</b> or grease <b>stains.</b> Results: A lipase-producing indigenous Bacillus subtilis strain [accession no. KT 985358] was isolated from the foothills of Trikuta mountain in Jammu and Kashmir, India. The lipase (BSK-L) produced by this strain expressed alkali and thermotolerance. Lipase has an optimal activity at pHÂ  8. 0 and temperature 37 Â°C, whereas it is stable at pHÂ  6. 0 â 9. 0 and showed active lipolytic activity at temperatures 30 to 60 Â°C.

40|$|Addressing {{the problem}} of {{aesthetics}} in urban space nowadays implies dealing with new models of cities, in which sustainable development, regeneration, requalification and urban reuse become indispensable. The reuse of the city, in regions concerned with a dramatic declining in the population, might prove an opportunity for inventing new ways aimed at creating new urban public spaces and new shared meanings (2010). Results, these last, obtainable by the construction of appropriate decision-making inclusive processes (Musco 2009) capable of working as strategy of modification of the metropolitan area (Mazzoleni 2009) towards a line of greater sustainability. In {{the prospect of a}} social construction of space, these urban models become achievable by resorting to an economic and social, as well as urban, landscape. The image of the urban space {{is at the same time}} the image of power (Gans 2002, Zukin 2002, Chandra Mukerji 1997, Verdi 2004), but also that of a public space in which new practices of art and architecture can generate renewed places. Thanks to the spread of new artistic practices, cities may achieve enhancements by the recovering of community spaces, as by promoting dialog, social cohesion, and resilience. The understanding between artists and citizens can breed good practices and new models of connection with the environment and the aesthetics of the city. A responsible and involved citizenship is able to generate requalified relations with the social and physical surrounding environment. The theory of âDifendible Spaceâ by Oscar Newman (1972) argues the existence of a correlation between the adoption and application of security measures in the subdivision and use of urban space, the improvement in the conditions of urban life, and a drastic reduction of the crime rate in certain urban areas. Also Alice Colemanâs research (1985) examines the relationship between design and deviant behaviors. Even the so-called theory of the âbroken windowsâ (1982), by G. L. Kelling and J. Q. Wilson, associates urban decay and insecurity, affirming that the disorder (broken glass) propagates itself in a virtuous circle, expanding to a <b>oil</b> <b>stain.</b> Instead, artistic practices can foster huge cultural changes into the public spaces, contributing to revitalize our sense of place.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} thermal maturity {{pattern has}} been investigated and the hydrocarbon generation potential assessed for the Permian and Triassic sequences of the southern Bowen and northern Gunnedah Basins and {{the lower part of}} the overlying Jurassic Cretaceous Surat Basin sequence in northern New South Wales. An oil-source rock correlation also {{has been investigated}} in the Gunnedah Basin. Vitrinite reflectance measurements were conducted on 256 samples from 28 boreholes. A total of 50 of these samples were subjected to Rock-Eval pyrolysis analysis, and 28 samples extracted for additional organic geochemical studies (GCMS). A re-evaluation of the stratigraphy in the southern Bowen Basin and a stratigraphic correlation between that area and the northern Gunnedah Basin was also included in the study. An overpressured shaly interval has been identified as a marker bed within the lower parts of the Triassic Moolayember and Napperby Formations, in the Bowen and Gunnedah Basins respectively. Suppressed vitrinite reflectance in the Permian sequence was used as another marker for mapping the stratigraphic sequence in the southern Bowen Basin. The Permian sequence in the Bowen Basin thins to the south, and probably pinches out over the Moree High and also to the west. The coal-bearing Kianga Formation is present in the north and northeastern parts of the study area. A disconformity surface between Digby and Napperby Formations in the Gunnedah Basin is probably time-equivalent to deposition of the Clematis Group and Showgrounds Sandstone in the Bowen Basin. The Clematis Group is absent in the study area, and the Moolayember Formation considered equivalent to the Napperby Formation. Although in many cases core samples were not available, handpicking of coal or shaly materials from cuttings samples where geophysical log signatures identify these materials helped in reducing contamination from caved debris. Histogram plots of reflectance also helped where the target and caved debris were of similar lithology. Vertical profiles of the vitrinite reflectance identified suppressed intervals in the study area due to marine influence (Back Creek Group and Maules Creek Formation) and liptinite rich source organic matter (Goonbri Formation). The suppression occurs due to the perhydrous character of the preserved organic matter. High reflectance values were noted within intrusion-affected intervals, and two types of igneous intrusion profiles were identified; these are simple and complex profiles. An isoreflectance map for the non-suppressed interval at the base of the Triassic sequence in the southern Bowen Basin shows that the organic matter is mature more towards the east close to the Goondiwindi Fault, and also towards the west where the Triassic sequence directly overlies the basement. High values also occur over the Gil Gil Ridge in the middle, to the south over the Moree High, and to the north where the sequence is thicker. The reflectance gradient in the suppressed intervals is higher than in the overlying non-suppressed sequences, especially when the rank has resulted from burial depth. Tmax from Rock-Eval pyrolysis was found to be lower in the perhydrous intervals, and was high in mature and igneous intrusion-affected intervals. Based on the source potential parameters, the Permian Back Creek Group is a better source than the Kianga Formation, while the Goonbri Formation is better than the Maules Creek Formation. The Triassic Napperby Formation has a fair capacity to generate oil, and is considered a better source rock than the equivalent Moolayember Formation. The Jurassic Walloon Coal Measures is a better source than Evergreen Formation, and has the best source rock characteristics, but is immature. The Rock-Eval S 1 value shows better correlation with extracted hydrocarbon compounds (saturated and aromatics) than the total extractable organic matter. This suggests that solvent extraction has a greater ability to extract NSO compounds than temperature distillation over the Rock-Eval S 1 interval. Terrestrial organic matter is the main source input for the sequences studied. This has been identified from organic petrology and from the n-alkane distributions and the relatively high C 29 steranes and low sterane/hopane ratios. The absence of marine biomarker signatures in the Permian marine influenced sequence, could be attributed to their dilution by overwhelming amounts of non-marine organic matter. A mainly oxic to suboxic depositional environment is inferred from trace amounts of 25 -NH, BNH and TNH. This is further supported by relatively high pr/ph ratios. Although C 29 /C 30 is generally regarded as an environmental indicator, high values were noted in intrusion-affected samples. The 22 S and 20 S ratios were inverted Â¡Â¥reaches pseudo-equilibriumÂ¡Â¦ in such rapidly heated, high maturity samples. The ratio of C 24 tetracyclic terpane to C 21 -C 26 tricyclic terpanes decreases, instead of increasing, within the Napperby Formation close to a major igneous intrusive body. The 22 S ratio, which is faster in reaction than the other terpane and sterane maturity parameters, shows that the Permian sequence lies within the oil generation stage in the Bowen Basin, except for a Kianga Formation sample. The Triassic sequence is marginally mature, and the Jurassic sequence is considered immature. In the Gunnedah Basin, the Permian sequence in Bellata- 1 and Bohena- 1, and the Triassic sequence in Coonarah- 1 A, lie within the oil generation range. In the intrusion-affected high maturity samples, the ratio is reaches pseudo-equilibrium. This and other terpane and sterane maturity parameters are not lowered (suppressed) in the perhydrous intervals. The ÂÃÂÃ sterane ratio, however, is slowest in reaction to maturity, and variations in low maturity samples are mainly due to facies changes. Diasterane/sterane ratios, in the current study, increase with increasing TOC content up to 5 % TOC, but decrease in rocks with higher TOC contents including coals. Highly mature samples, as expected, in both cases are anomalous with high ratios. Calculated vitrinite reflectance based on the method of Radke and Welte (1983), as well as MPI 1 and MPI 2, shows the best comparison to observed values. These aromatic maturity parameters are lowered within the reflectance-suppressed intervals. Oil stains in the Jurassic Pilliga Sandstone in the Bellata- 1 well have been identified as being indigenous and not due to contamination. The vitrinite reflectance calculated to the <b>oil</b> <b>stain</b> suggests that the source rock should be within a late mature zone. Such high maturity levels are only recognised within intrusion-affected intervals. A close similarity between the <b>oil</b> <b>stain</b> sample and the intruded interval of the Napperby Formation is evident from the thermal maturity and biomarker content. Hydrocarbon generation and expulsion from {{the lower part of the}} Napperby Formation as a result of igneous intrusion effects is suggested as the source of the oil in this particular occurrence. Terpane and sterane maturity parameters increase with increasing burial depth in the intervals with suppressed (perhydrous) vitrinite reflectance. The generation maturity parameters also increase through intervals with perhydrous vitrinite, which suggests that hydrocarbons continue to be generated and the actual amount is increasing even though traditional rank Â¡Â¥stressÂ¡Â¦ maturity parameters are lowered. Accordingly, the Permian sequences in the lower part of the Bowen Basin are at least within the peak oil generation zone, and probably within late oil generation in the north and northeast of the study area. To generate significant amounts of hydrocarbon, however, the thickness of the shaly and coaly intervals in the Permian sequence is probably a critical parameter. In the Gunnedah Basin, a significant amount of hydrocarbon generation is probably only possible as a result of igneous intrusions...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe use of {{integrated}} approach {{to evaluate the}} quality of reservoir rocks is increasingly becoming vital in petroleum geoscience. This approach was employed to unravel {{the reason for the}} erratic reservoir quality of sandstones of the F-O gas field with the aim of predicting reservoir quality, evaluate the samples for presence, distribution and character of hydrocarbon inclusions so as {{to gain a better understanding}} of the fluid history. Information on the chemical conditions of diagenetic processes is commonly preserved in aqueous and oil fluid inclusion occurring in petroleum reservoir cements. Diagenesis plays a vital role in preserving, creating, or destroying porosity and permeability, while the awareness of the type of trap(s) prior to drilling serves as input for appropriate drilling designs. Thus an in-depth understanding of diagenetic histories and trap mechanisms of potential reservoirs are of paramount interest during exploration stage. This research work focused on the F-O tract located in the eastern part of Block 9 on the north-eastern flank of the Bredasdorp Basin, a sub-basin of Outeniqua Basin on the southern continental shelf, offshore South Africa. The Bredasdorp Basin experienced an onset of rifting during the Middle-Late Jurassic as a result of dextral trans-tensional stress produced by the breakup of Gondwanaland that occurred in the east of the Falkland Plateau and the Mozambique Ridge. This phenomenon initiated a normal faulting, north of the Agulhas-Falkland fracture zone followed by a widespread uplift of major bounding arches within the horst blocks in the region that enhanced an erosion of lower Valanginian drift to onset second order unconformity. This study considered 52 selected reservoir core samples from six wells(F-O 1, F-O 2, F-O 3, F-O 4, F-R 1 and F-S 1) in the F-O field of Bredasdorp Basin with attention on the Valanginian age sandstone. An integrated approach incorporating detailed core descriptions, wireline log analysis (using Interactive petrophysics), structural interpretation from 2 D seismic lines (using SMT software) cutting across all the six wells, multi-mineral (thin section, SEM,XRD) analyses, geochemical (immobile fluid and XRF) and fluid inclusion(fluid inclusion petrography and bulk volatile) analyses were deployed for the execution of this study. Core description revealed six facies from the six wells grading from pure shale (Facies 1), through progressively coarsening interbedded sand-shale âheterolithic facies (Facies 2 - 4), to cross bedded and minor massive sandstone (Facies 5 - 6). Sedimentary structures and mineral patches varies from well to well with bioturbation, synaeresis crack, echinoid fragments, fossil burrow, foreset mudrapes, glauconite and siderite as the main observed features. All these indicate that the Valanginian reservoir section in the studied wells was deposited in the upper shallow marine settings. A combination of wireline logs were used to delineate the reservoir zone prior to core description. The principal reservoirs are tight, highly faulted Valanginian shallow-marine sandstones beneath the drift-onset unconformity, 1 At 1 and were deposited as an extensive sandstone âsheetâ within a tidal setting. The top and base of the reservoir are defined by the 13 At 1 and 1 At 1 seismic events,respectively. This heterogeneous reservoir sandstones present low-fair porosity of between 2 to 18 % and a low-fair permeability value greater than 0. 1 to 10 mD. The evolution of the F-O field was found to be controlled by extensional events owing to series of interpreted listric normal faults and rifting or graben generated possibly by the opening of the Atlantic. The field is on a well-defined structural high at the level of the regional drift-onset unconformity, 1 At 1. Multi-mineral analysis reveals the presence of quartz and kaolinite as the major porosity and permeability constraint respectively along with micaceous phases. The distribution of quartz and feldspar overgrowth and crystals vary from formation to formation and from bed to bed within the same structure. The increase in temperature that led to kaolinite formation could have triggered the low-porosity observed. Three types of kaolinite were recognized in the sandstone, (1) kaolinite growing in between expanded mica flakes; (2) vermiform kaolinite; and (3) euhedral kaolinite crystals forming matrix. Compositional study of the upper shallow marine sandstones in the Valanginian age indicates that the sandstones are geochemically classified as majorly litharenite having few F-O 2 samples as subarkose with all F-O 1 samples classified as sub-litharenite sandstone. Most of the studied wells are more of wet gas, characterized by strong response of C 2 â C 5 with F-O 1 well showing more of gas condensate with oil shows (C 7 â C 11) based on the number of carbon atom present. In some cases,sulphur species (characterized by the presence of H 2 S, S 2, CS 2 and SO 2) of probably thermal origin were identified while some log signatures revealed aromatic enriched sandstones possibly detecting nearby gas charges. The studied wells in the F-O field, based on fluid inclusion bulk volatile analysis are classified as gas discoveries except for F-O 1 with gas condensate and oil shows. The integration of multi-mineral results and fluid inclusion studies show a dead <b>oil</b> <b>stain</b> with no visible liquid petroleum inclusion in the samples indicating the presence of quartz, kaolinite and stylolite as a major poro-perm constraint...|$|E

In fact, a light intensity value {{in the range of}} 35 â 45 Â cd is suitable for industrial application in the proposed system. The obtained results also revealed that the algorithm is robust to the interference of <b>oil</b> <b>stains,</b> rust, oxide, shot-blasting pits, and different background colors and can significantly enhance the contrast between MSCs and the background. Therefore, the proposed method can greatly reduce the dependence on the character segmentation and recognition algorithm. All of these results show that the proposed method is an effective method for identifying MSCs.|$|R
