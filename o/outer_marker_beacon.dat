25|$|An {{investigation}} into the crash found the cause to be pilot error by the captain. Failure to receive the <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> signal (probably due to a fault that had developed in the receiver) was a contributory factor.|$|E
50|$|At 8:15 am, {{the flight}} {{reported}} that it was starting descent {{and at that time}} was given the San Francisco weather report. Just after 8:21 am ARTC cleared the flight to the San Francisco Instrument Landing System (ILS) <b>Outer</b> <b>Marker</b> <b>beacon</b> via the Half Moon Bay Fan Marker direct to the San Francisco Outer Marker, with instructions to maintain at least 500 ft above all clouds and to contact San Francisco Approach Control after passing the Half Moon Bay Fan Marker.|$|E
50|$|Flight 128 {{departed}} Los Angeles at 17:37 Eastern Standard Time {{and operated}} to Cincinnati without incident. The flight was initially scheduled {{to make an}} Instrument Landing System approach to Greater Cincinnati Airport's runway 18. The <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> for runway 18 was operational, but the middle marker beacon, glide slope, and runway approach lights were inoperative. Under these conditions, proper procedure would be to maintain the minimum approach altitude of 1,290 feet {{above mean sea level}} until the pilots made visual contact with the runway.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Locator <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> (LOM), a low {{frequency}} radio beacon, colocated with an [...] "outer marker" [...] (OM) 75-MHz <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The LOM is {{becoming}} less important now that GPS navigation {{is well established}} in the aviation community. [...] Some countries, such as Canada, have abandoned <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> completely, replacing the <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> with a non-directional beacon (NDB); and, more recently, with GPS fixes.|$|R
50|$|The Outer Marker, which {{normally}} identifies the {{final approach fix}} (FAF), is situated on the same course/track as the localizer and the runway center-line, four to seven nautical miles before the runway threshold. It is typically located about 1 NM km inside {{the point where the}} glideslope intercepts the intermediate altitude and transmits a 400 Hz tone signal on a low-powered (3 watts), 75 MHz carrier signal. Its antenna is highly directional, and is pointed straight up. The valid signal area is a 2400 ft × 4200 ft ellipse (as measured 1000 ft above the antenna.) When the aircraft passes over the <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> antenna, its <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receiver detects the signal. The system gives the pilot a visual (blinking blue <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> light) and aural (continuous series of audio tone morse code-like 'dashes') indication.|$|R
5000|$|At 14:24 Central Standard Time, Flight 553 {{was cleared}} by {{air traffic control}} to Midway Airport on an {{approach}} to runway 31L. The localizer approach for runway 31L used an <b>Outer</b> <b>Marker</b> <b>Beacon</b> (OMB) named [...] "Kedzie," [...] located [...] prior to the threshold of runway 31L. Under the published landing procedures, the aircraft was to maintain a minimum altitude of 1500 ft until it passed the OMB, {{at which point the}} flight was allowed to descend to a minimum altitude of 1040 ft. Published procedures, and pilots operating under instrument flight rules, use mean sea level (MSL) to measure altitude; at Midway Airport, an altitude of 1040 ft MSL corresponded to an actual height above ground level (AGL) of only 429 ft. The area was overcast at the time Flight 553 landed, and pilots landing at Midway Airport immediately before Flight 553 reported that the airport was only visible below 500 - 600 ft AGL.|$|E
5000|$|NDBs {{are most}} {{commonly}} used as markers or [...] "locators" [...] for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach or standard approach. NDBs may designate the starting area for an ILS approach or a path to follow for a standard terminal arrival procedure, or STAR. In the United States, an NDB is often combined with the <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> in the ILS approach (called a locator outer marker, or LOM); in Canada, low-powered NDBs have replaced marker beacons entirely. Marker beacons on ILS approaches are now being phased out worldwide with DME ranges used instead to delineate the different segments of the approach. German Navy U-boats during World War II were equipped with a Telefunken Spez 2113S homing beacon. This transmitter could operate on 100 kHz to 1500 kHz with a power of 150 W. It was used to send the submarine's location to other submarines or aircraft, which were equipped with DF receivers and loop antennas.|$|E
50|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is a {{specialized}} beacon used in aviation {{in conjunction with}} an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to determine distance to the runway. Marker beacons transmit on the dedicated frequency of 75 MHz. This type of beacon is slowly being phased-out and most new ILS installations have no <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|B-scope (Search)-Target azimuth and range, range strobe, range <b>markers,</b> <b>beacon</b> and IFF {{responses}} ...|$|R
50|$|On some installations, <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> {{operating}} at a carrier frequency of 75 MHz are provided. When the transmission from a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is received it activates an indicator on the pilot's instrument panel and {{the tone of}} the beacon is audible to the pilot. The distance from the runway at which this indication should be received is published in the documentation for that approach, together with the height at which the aircraft should be if correctly established on the ILS. This provides a check on the correct function of the glide slope. In modern ILS installations, a DME is installed, co-located with the ILS, to augment or replace <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b> A DME continuously displays the aircraft's distance to the runway.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> that may be {{installed}} {{as part of their}} most common application, an Instrument Landing System: ...|$|R
50|$|The AN/MRN-3 was a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> set {{used by the}} Army Air Force {{during and}} after World War II, it was {{standardized}} 23 October 1943, and replaced SCR-241.|$|R
5000|$|FuBL 1 Used the Lorenz {{landing beam}} system. Consisted of the EBL 1 and EBL 2 {{receivers}} with display device ANF 2. The EBL 1 operated between 30 and 33 MHz {{and received the}} azimuth signals from a transmitter {{at the far end}} of the runway, The EBL 2 operated at 38 MHz and received the two <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> as the aircraft approached the threshold to land. The AFN 2 provided the pilot with a left/right display and a signal strength. The pilot could also hear the azimuth signal and the <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> in his headset. When the aircraft passed over the beacons a light was also illuminated in the cockpit.` ...|$|R
50|$|According to Article 1.107 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> {{is defined}} as A {{transmitter}} in the aeronautical radionavigation service which radiates vertically a distinctive pattern for providing position information to aircraft.|$|R
50|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is a {{particular}} type of VHF radio beacon used in aviation, usually in conjunction with an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to determine position along an established route to a destination such as a runway.|$|R
50|$|The DME/N or DME/P is an {{integral}} part of the MLS and is installed at all MLS facilities unless a waiver is obtained. This occurs infrequently and only at outlying, low density airports where <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> or compass locators are already in place.|$|R
50|$|Each system {{requires}} three <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> sets, one to {{be located}} in the airport runway boundary, one at approximately one mile from the approach end of the runway, and one 4.5 miles from the approach end of the runway, all on the center line of the runway to be used. The equipment transmits a vertical pattern to be received by the RC-43, RC-193, or AN/ARN-8, AN/ARN-12. A signal, amplitude modulated at 1,300 cycles per second, may be keyed at two dashes per second, six dots per second, or may be unkeyed. The <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> transmitter projects a vertical fan-shaped pattern to a height of approximately 3,000 feet. The transmitter is placed so that the longer horizontal axis is perpendicular to the line of approach.|$|R
50|$|The term {{fan marker}} {{refers to the}} older type of beacons used mostly for {{en-route}} navigation. Fan-type <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> were sometimes part of a non-precision approach and are identified by a flashing white light and a repeating dot-dash-dot signal. Recent editions of the FAA's AIM publication no longer mention fan markers.|$|R
5000|$|Anderson is memorialized by the [...] "ANDOE" [...] {{waypoint}} for the <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> on ILS runway 27 approaching Duluth International Airport.|$|R
25|$|Radio {{aeronautical}} navigation aids (Navaids) {{use other}} frequencies. Non-directional beacons (NDB)s operate on low frequency and medium frequency bands between 190–415kHz and 510–535kHz. The Instrument landing system (ILS) glide path operates in the UHF frequency range of 329.3–335.0MHz with <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> at 75 MHZ. Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) also uses UHF from 962–1150MHz.|$|R
50|$|At {{approximately}} 1749:30, {{the plane}} passed the <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> 5.7 {{miles from the}} runway threshold at approximately 8,200 feet, over 2,000 feet above the normal glideslope.|$|R
5000|$|A {{back course}} marker (BC) {{normally}} indicates the ILS back course {{final approach fix}} where approach descent is commenced. Its is identified by pairs of morse-code [...] "dots" [...] at 3000 Hz (95 pairs per minute), which will trigger the white light on a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> indicator, but with a different audio rhythm from an inner marker or en route marker.|$|R
5000|$|On {{some older}} <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receivers, {{instead of the}} [...] "O", [...] "M" [...] and [...] "I" [...] {{indicators}} (outer, middle, inner), the indicators are labeled [...] "A" [...] (or FM/Z), [...] "O" [...] and [...] "M" [...] (airway or Fan and Z <b>marker,</b> <b>outer,</b> middle). The airway marker was used to indicate reporting points along the centerline of now obsolete [...] "Red" [...] airways; this was sometimes a [...] "fan" [...] marker, whose radiated pattern was elongated at right angles across the airway course so an aircraft slightly off course would still receive it. A [...] "Z" [...] marker was sometimes located at low/medium frequency range sites to accurately denote station passage. As airway beacons used the same 3,000 Hz audio frequency as the inner marker, the [...] "A" [...] indicator on older receivers {{can be used to}} detect the inner marker.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft use DME to {{determine}} their distance from a land-based transponder by sending and receiving pulse pairs - two pulses of fixed duration and separation. The ground stations are typically collocated with VORs or ILS systems. A low-power DME can be collocated with an ILS glide slope antenna installation where it provides an accurate distance to touchdown function, similar to that otherwise provided by ILS <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} 1950s, markers were used {{extensively}} along airways {{to provide an}} indication of an aircraft's specific position along the route, but from the 1960s they have become increasingly limited to ILS approach installations. They are now very gradually being phased out of service, especially in more developed parts of the world, as GPS and other technologies have made <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> increasingly obsolete.|$|R
50|$|The {{swimming}} area {{ranges from}} knee deep to approximately five feet deep, undulating in three sandbars {{from the shore}} to the <b>outer</b> <b>markers.</b> The bottom is mostly sandy, with a few mucky places.|$|R
50|$|The VAR bridged the {{technological}} {{gap between the}} Low-Frequency Radio Range (LFR) radio navigation system and the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation system. VAR provided four courses for navigation, two using visual instrument signals functionally and technically similar to the modern localizer and backbeam components used in the ILS system and two using audio signals similar to the LFR system. VAR also used <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> similar to the ILS.|$|R
50|$|The RC-43-A (BC-357) is a UHF {{receiver}} {{which provides}} a visual indication when flying over a 75-MHz <b>marker</b> <b>beacon.</b> it operates {{in the frequency of}} 67 to 80 MHz. The receiver box is located with other radio equipment and lights a lamp on the pilot's instrument panel when over the beacon. the RC-43 is 24 volts, the RC-39 is 12 volts. the unit uses a fixed wire antenna.|$|R
50|$|Similar to {{the outer}} and middle markers; located at the {{beginning}} (threshold) of the runway on some ILS approach systems (usually Category II and III) having decision heights of less than 200 ft AGL. Triggers a flashing white light on the same <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receiver used for the outer and middle markers; also a series of audio tone 'dots' at a frequency of 3,000 Hz in the headset.|$|R
2500|$|There was no audible voice {{radio contact}} with traffic {{controllers}} from either plane after the collision, although LaGuardia had begun tracking an incoming, fast-moving, unidentified plane from Preston toward the LaGuardia [...] "Flatbush" [...] <b>outer</b> <b>marker.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Delta Flight 723 final {{approach}} (plan view) from NTSB report; actual path flown (red) {{is shown in}} relation to nominal localizer path (blue); <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> is shown as blue dot; flight direction is from left to right.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: FAA ILS/LOC {{approach}} {{plate to}} runway 23 at Buffalo Niagara International Airport (KBUF). The flight crashed (marked in red) near the locator <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> (LOM) (identifier: [...] "KLUMP") about five nautical {{miles from the}} threshold of Rwy 23.|$|R
50|$|At this point, Kaser and Brink {{called the}} Albuquerque Radar Approach Control unit, {{who were able}} to confirm a target moving eastwards in the {{expected}} area. It turned south, moving (according to Kaser) at a very high speed, before orbiting {{in the vicinity of the}} Albuquerque Low Frequency Range Station for a number of minutes. The target then moved back north towards Kirtland, hovering over the <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> south of the main north-south runway. It finally took up position half a mile behind a C-46 leaving the base and followed it for around 14 miles before again hovering over the <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> and fading. The total period of radar contact lasted around 20 minutes.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} departed McGhee Tyson Airport {{outside of}} Knoxville 27 minutes late {{on what was}} the second leg of the flight with seven passengers and three crew. The DC-3A was cleared for an approach to runway 27 at Tri-Cities Regional Airport. The visibility at the airport was 3 miles (4.8km) in light snow and fog with a 900-foot (274 m) broken ceiling and overcast at 1,700 feet (518 m). The crew reported problems with the automatic direction finder and {{they were unable to}} find the <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> visually or aurally. The aircraft passed to the east of the <b>outer</b> <b>marker</b> and while outside the normal procedure turn area descended and hit the wooded slope on the north-west side of the Holston Mountain range, killing all 10 people on board.|$|R
2500|$|The {{airliner}} left Stallings Field at Kinston, North Carolina, and {{the flight}} proceeded to Huntington without incident. The crew established radio contact with air traffic controllers at 7:23 pm with instructions to descend to 5,000 feet. The controllers advised the crew that there was [...] "rain, fog, smoke and a ragged ceiling" [...] at the airport, making landing more difficult but possible. At 7:34 pm, the airliner's crew reported passing Tri-State Airport's <b>outer</b> <b>marker.</b> The controller gave them clearance to land. The aircraft began its normal descent after passing the <b>outer</b> <b>marker,</b> but did not arrest its descent and hold altitude at 1240ft, {{as required by the}} assigned instrument approach procedure. Instead, the descent continued for another 300ft for unknown reasons, apparently without either crewmember seeing the airport lights or runway.|$|R
