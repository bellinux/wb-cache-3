Based on the fracture mechanics, the cohesion of the crossfeed surface varied with the contact areas was acquired, and the algorithm of the corssfeed mechanical model of the contact bodies was studied. Compared with the photo-elastic experiment of the joint sample, the result shows that the corssfeed mechanical model of the contact bodies is more practical than the traditional model...|$|E

30|$|Dynamic {{characteristics}} of rotate speed and output torque were studied, considering they {{can affect the}} working condition and lifetime of the air-powered vehicle. Rotate speed is determined by output flow which is mainly created by extrusion of piston directly during the moving time, and the flow through hydraulic motor establishes pressure based on the <b>outside</b> mechanical <b>load</b> which determines the output pressure of the hydraulic system and then reflects the output torque. We take the average rotate speed and torque values during each working process under difference working condition which can directly reflect the dynamic capability of the power system. What’s more, variances of the output rotate speed and torque are calculated which can reflect the volatility of the dynamic characteristics and greatly affect the lifetime of the power system. In order to illustrate the influence, for the comparison, each parameter changes while other parameters keep constant. Then we get the final results as follows.|$|R

The myoelectric upper limb prosthesis is a function recovery device for the hand, which demands lightweight, high torque, many degrees of freedom, and viscoelasticity. The hand uses twisting spring wire drive system for drive system, and two wires in parallel configuration for the interference driven joint mechanisms for articulated mechanism. 1. Twisting Spring Wire Drive System Proposition technique generates movement by twisting a wire by the motor <b>loaded</b> <b>outside</b> the hand(Fig. 1). The motors <b>loaded</b> <b>outside</b> the hand, so it’s possible to make the hand light. And the wire has the nature of spring by twisting double wires, so this can expect the realization of viscoelasticity actuator. 2. Joint mechanisms The hand uses the wire driven mechanism at the fingers (Fig. 2 (a)) imitating the human hand structure. The wire W 1 passes through the wire guide that corresponds to the fiber sheath, so the wire W 1 can curl not only the DIP joint and PIP joint but also the MP joint. This mechanism allows us to provide MP joint with a high grip power. And, we developed an interference drive joint mechanism at the wrist joint and the thumb MP joint.
