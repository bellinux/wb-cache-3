Fleming stated that with the slower development time, they knew they needed to develop the game for the PlayStation 3 and that the work needed to complement their previous game, akin to how Shigeru Miyamoto's The Legend of Zelda series contrasted his earlier Mario series. They also sought a project that would allow them to become familiar with the new PlayStation 3 hardware but had enough commonalities to allow them to bring their previous work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sly</b> Cooper series forward.|$|E
500|$|Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq's {{compositions}} {{are characterized}} by [...] "groove rather than song". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are [...] "tied together by the Mellotron, a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings, but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings", adding that [...] "Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed [...] "a little less Motown gloss" [...] than The Way I See It and [...] "a little more rock grit in Saadiq’s grooves, heavy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sly</b> Stone (witness the opening 'Heart Attack'), late '50s/early '60s Isley Brothers (the joyful 'Radio'), and Ray Charles ('Day Dreams'), {{to say nothing of}} the skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc, sort of like the Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ('The Answer')." [...] Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq [...] "personalizes each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man’s existence and experience".|$|E

2500|$|In November 1994, The Washington Post {{came out}} with an {{announcement}} that Sweden could have kept its nuclear weapons option open <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sly.</b> That statement stemmed from the [...] fact that the R3 reactor in Ågesta facility was still in place, {{but it was not}} subject to the ongoing inspection within the NPT framework. The reactor was shut down in 1974, but not dismantled. The Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate (SKI) pointed out that the reason for the facility [...] not to be covered by the inspection was that Sweden signed the NPT in 1975 (not in 1968 when the NPT was ratified). Only then R3 was taken out of service and all fissile material was removed. Since none of the remaining components of the reactor had been maintained since 1974, the site was not viewed as an immediate subject for the SKI inspection.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} other preset drum {{machines}} were released in the 1970s, but early examples of the use {{can be found on}} The United States of America's eponymous album from 1967–8. The first major pop song to use a drum machine was [...] "Saved by the Bell" [...] by Robin Gibb, which reached #2 in Britain in 1969. Drum machine tracks were also heavily used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sly</b> & the Family Stone album There's a Riot Goin' On, released in 1971. Sly & the Family Stone was the first group to have a number #1 pop single that used a drum machine: that single was [...] "Family Affair". The German krautrock band Can also used a drum machine on their song [...] "Peking O". The 1972 Timmy Thomas single [...] "Why Can't We Live Together"/"Funky Me" [...] featured a distinctive use of a drum machine and keyboard arrangement on both tracks. Another early example of electronic drums used by a rock group, is Obscured by Clouds by Pink Floyd, from early in 1972. The first album on which a drum machine produced all the percussion was Kingdom Come's Journey, recorded in November 1972 using a Bentley Rhythm Ace. French singer-songwriter Léo Ferré mixed a drum machine with a symphonic orchestra in the song [...] "Je t'aimais bien, tu sais..." [...] in his album L'Espoir, released in 1974. Osamu Kitajima's progressive psychedelic rock album Benzaiten (1974) also utilized drum machines, and one of the album's contributors, Haruomi Hosono, would later start the electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra (as [...] "Yellow Magic Band") in 1977.|$|E
2500|$|Frank was {{the first}} son of Canon William Buckland, a noted {{geologist}} and palaeontologist, and Mary, a fossil collector, palaeontologist and illustrator. Frank was born and brought up in Oxford, where {{his father was a}} Canon and the Dean of Christ Church. His godfather was the sculptor Sir Francis Chantrey. Educated at home by his mother, he went, at eight and a half, to a boarding school in Cotterstock, Northamptonshire staying with his uncle John Buckland. From 1837–39, he went to a preparatory school in Laleham, Surrey, run by his uncle, John Buckland, a brutal headmaster who flogged his pupils quite excessively. Relief came with a scholarship to Winchester College, a school with an unbroken history of six hundred years. Here he was taught by the Second Master, Charles Wordsworth, who sent letters of praise to his father. Winchester had a harsh regime, but was much preferable to his previous school. While at Winchester he continued to take an interest in animals, trapping rats and mice, dissecting and sometimes eating them. Students complained of a foul smell emanating from the remains of a cat under his bed. Towards the end of his schooling he was dissecting human parts that he obtained from the hospital <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sly.</b> He was known for his exploits with a lancet. One student with a dolichocephalous head heard Frank muttering [...] "what wouldn't I give for that fellow's skull!" [...] He was not a first-rate scholar, but managed to gain entrance to Christ Church, Oxford in October 1844, after failing to get a scholarship to the smaller Corpus Christi. He joined a debating club and the first essay he read was on [...] "whether Rooks are beneficial to the farmer or not". He became a friend of the curator at Surrey Zoo and when he heard that a panther had died, he had it dug up and declared that the meat [...] "was not very good". When the British Association met in 1847 at Oxford, Frank took along his pet bear Tigleth Pileser dressed in student attire of a cap and gown to the party. Charles Lyell wrote that Buckland introduced the bear formally to him and other zoologists present. This was not to go on for long as the Dean finally informed him that [...] "either you or your bear must go". In 1845 Frank went to Giessen for three months to study chemistry under Justus von Liebig. In September 1846 he made a trip around Switzerland. Frank also attended some of the lectures of his father.|$|E

Yet Elizabethan texts paradoxically deviate from this rich tradition as they often present a much simpler version of the hero, where the phrase “wise Ulysses” excludes any attempt at critical investigation.

40|$|We present new {{results on}} instabilities in rapidly and {{differentially}} rotating neutron stars. We model {{the stars in}} full general relativity and describe the stellar matter adopting a cold realistic equation of state based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unified <b>SLy</b> prescription. We provide evidence that rapidly and differentially rotating stars that are below the expected threshold for the dynamical bar-mode instability, beta_c = T/|W| ~ 0. 25, do nevertheless develop a shear instability on a dynamical timescale and {{for a wide range}} of values of beta. This class of instability, which has so far been found only for small values of beta and with very small growth rates, is therefore more generic than previously found and potentially more effective in producing strong sources of gravitational waves. Overall, our findings support the phenomenological predictions made by Watts, Andersson and Jones <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of the low-T/|W|.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{temperature}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{evolution of the}} isovector dipole and isoscalar quadrupole excitations in Ni 68 and Sn 120 nuclei is studied within the fully self-consistent finite temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation framework, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Skyrme-type <b>SLy</b> 5 energy density functional. The new low-energy excitations emerge due to the transitions from thermally occupied states to the discretized continuum at finite temperatures, whereas the isovector giant dipole resonance is not strongly impacted by the increase of temperature. The radiative dipole strength at low energies is also investigated for the Sn 122 nucleus, becoming compatible with the available experimental data when the temperature is included. In addition, both the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance and low-energy quadrupole states {{are sensitive to the}} temperature effect: while the centroid energies decrease {{in the case of the}} isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance, the collectivity of the first 2 + state is quenched and the opening of new excitation channels fragments the low-energy strength at finite temperatures...|$|R
