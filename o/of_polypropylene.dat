5|$|Titanium was {{discovered}} in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791, and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, and it is found in almost all living things, water bodies, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and {{is used in the}} manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene</b> felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Linear {{shear flow}} {{behavior}} and molecular structure studies {{were carried out}} on linear polypropylenes produced using Ziegler-Natta catalysts and sets <b>of</b> branched <b>polypropylenes</b> produced from these linear precursors. A method combining dynamic and creep measurements was employed to obtain a complete picture of the linear viscoelastic behavior <b>of</b> these <b>polypropylenes.</b> It was found that all samples in a set <b>of</b> <b>polypropylenes</b> have the same linear viscoelastic behavior in the high-frequency range, but display dramatic differences at low frequencies. Increasing branching level results in a steep increase of the zero-shear viscosity, an increase of the steady-state compliance, and a broadening of the relaxation spectrum whose shape changes dramatically and peaks shift to longer times. Molecular models were tested and applied to the linear polypropylenes to predict linear viscoelastic properties from the molecular weight distribution (MWD). The parameters obtained from the best fit of predicted and experimental data <b>of</b> linear <b>polypropylenes</b> were used to calculate a fictive relaxation spectrum for branched polymers from their MWDs as if they were linear. The comparison between this predicted result and the experimental spectrum showed the separate effects of polydispersity and branching on rheology. To obtain detailed structural information, the branching process <b>of</b> <b>polypropylenes</b> was simulated using a Monte-Carlo approach, which provides detailed information such as MWD and branching distribution. The simulated MWD was adjusted to the measured GPC curve using a single parameter simply related to the branching density lambda (LCB/ 1000 C). Relations between branching parameters and moments of the MWD were determined, which offer the possibility to calculate branching parameters directly from GPC results. The branching efficiency was estimated and correlations between engineering properties <b>of</b> <b>polypropylenes</b> and the structural information were obtained, which is of valuable industrial interest for polymer design. A determination of the weight fractions of branches and segments between branch points from the relaxation spectrum is proposed. Due to the complexity of molecular relaxation mechanisms, only approximate correlations between molecular architecture and rheology were observed. **This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

40|$|The {{possibility}} of application <b>of</b> atactic <b>polypropylene,</b> which isn't used practically in Russian industry right now, is considered in this article.

25|$|The {{melt flow}} rate (MFR) or melt flow index (MFI) {{is a measure of}} {{molecular}} weight <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene.</b> The measure helps to determine how easily the molten raw material will flow during processing. Polypropylene with higher MFR will fill the plastic mold more easily during the injection or blow-molding production process. As the melt flow increases, however, some physical properties, like impact strength, will decrease.|$|E
25|$|Expanded {{polypropylene}} (EPP) is a foam form <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene.</b> EPP {{has very}} good impact characteristics {{due to its}} low stiffness; this allows EPP to resume its shape after impacts. EPP is extensively used in model aircraft and other radio controlled vehicles by hobbyists. This is mainly due to its ability to absorb impacts, making this an ideal material for RC aircraft for beginners and amateurs.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene is in {{many aspects}} similar to polyethylene, {{especially}} in solution behaviour and electrical properties. The additionally present methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, while the chemical resistance decreases. The properties <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene</b> depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity. In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the CH3 groups are oriented {{on one side of}} the carbon backbone. This creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.|$|E

25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene,</b> although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene</b> or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|E
25|$|Fast pulse {{rise time}} rating, high {{dielectric}} strength (breakdown voltage), and low dissipation factor (high Q) are {{the reasons for the}} use <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene</b> film capacitors in fly-back tuning and S-correction applications in older CRT tube television and display equipment. For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) cable fault locators, in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene {{has been}} used in hernia and pelvic organ {{prolapse}} repair operations to protect the body from new hernias in the same location. A small patch of the material is placed over the spot of the hernia, below the skin, and is painless and rarely, if ever, rejected by the body. However, a polypropylene mesh will erode the tissue surrounding it over the uncertain period from days to years. Therefore, the FDA has issued several warnings on the use <b>of</b> <b>polypropylene</b> mesh medical kits for certain applications in pelvic organ prolapse, specifically when introduced in close proximity to the vaginal wall due to a continued increase in number of mesh-driven tissue erosions reported by patients over the past few years. Most recently, on 3 January 2012, the FDA ordered 35 manufacturers of these mesh products to study the side effects of these devices.|$|E
