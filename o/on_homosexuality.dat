5|$|The Rejected (1961) is a made-for-television {{documentary}} film about homosexuality, produced for KQED in San Francisco by John W. Reavis. The Rejected {{was the first}} documentary program <b>on</b> <b>homosexuality</b> broadcast on American television.

The Rejected received positive critical reviews upon airing.|$|E
5|$|Cox {{has also}} said {{that there is a}} massive irony, both in the film and in real life, that a {{religion}} so focused on the family and its importance is ripping families apart through its teaching <b>on</b> <b>homosexuality.</b> In fact, Cox believes one cannot be Mormon and gay. Nevertheless, a major theme of Latter Days is that there is an underlying spirituality in the world that goes beyond the rituals and dogmas of religion.|$|E
50|$|As {{an older}} scholar, his {{research}} interests continued to evolve.

Upon retirement in 1995, Rice became Shepherd Professor of History Emeritus {{and a member of}} the Society of Senior Scholars where, in later years, he continued to teach in the core curriculum. He founded and chaired the Columbia University Seminar <b>on</b> <b>Homosexualities,</b> which ran in the early 1990s. Prof. Rice was a member of the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.|$|R

40|$|M. A. The aim of {{this study}} was to make an attempt to {{differentiate}} between certain etiological factors which could contribute to lesbian behaviour. Because of the fact that only a relatively small amount of research bas been done <b>on</b> female <b>homosexuality,</b> it was considered to be an important subject for further study. Because of the small amount of research <b>on</b> female <b>homosexuality</b> it is often found that generalizations are made about female <b>homosexuality</b> <b>on</b> the basis of findings <b>on</b> male <b>homosexuality.</b> This is an additional motivation for research <b>on</b> female <b>homosexuality</b> as a seperate entity. Initially, the general developement of sexuality in the female was examined without emphasizing hetero- or homosexuality. The importance of this approach was that important deductions could be made with regard to etiological factors. Secondly, attention was given to the theoretical approaches to female <b>homosexuality,</b> <b>on</b> the basis of previous research, as well as theoretical speculations. The approaches which were examined, were the psychoanalytical model, the biological model and the social model. Thirdly, the personality traits of the lesbian were considered in particular. This section was based on previous research relevant to this theme, for example specific factors like aggression, depression, sexual identity, social adaptation and feelings of dependency were considered. Although there was no agreement in the studies, it appeared that there were no obvious differences between lesbian and heterosexual women. The experimental section of this study contains the analysis of biographical data, which was obtained by means of a biographical questionnaire, and the analysis of data collected by means of administration of the Rorschach technique. The biographical data were collected to elicit etiological factors while the Rorschach aimed at finding personality characteristics typically encountered in lesbianism...|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Rob LaZebnik, {{inspired}} by when his teenage son came out. Critical reception was mixed: the emotionally touching aspects of LaZebnik's script and Harry Shearer's portrayal of Smithers were praised. However, criticisms included the plot possibly ending the innuendo-driven humor involving Smithers' secret love of Burns, and an assumption that the character was being retconned due to changing attitudes <b>on</b> <b>homosexuality</b> since the series' debut. The episode was covered by international media.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{following}} the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted {{pressure on the}} Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed Commissioners MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the Civil Liberties committee rejecting Rocco Buttiglione from the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views <b>on</b> <b>homosexuality.</b> That {{was the first time}} the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament allowed the Barroso Commission to take office.|$|E
5|$|In India, a 14th-century Indian text {{mentioning}} {{a lesbian}} couple {{who had a}} child {{as a result of}} their lovemaking is an exception to the general silence about female homosexuality. This invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled Fire in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse <b>on</b> <b>homosexuality</b> centers on men. Women's rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms, as lesbians and material focusing on female homosexuality are frequently suppressed.|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work <b>on</b> <b>homosexuality.</b> Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|With a seed {{grant from}} Steven Spielberg, {{the creators of}} the film have set up the Trembling Before G-d Orthodox Education Project, to teach Orthodox {{educators}} and rabbis about homosexuality, as well as convening the first Orthodox Mental Health Conference <b>on</b> <b>Homosexuality</b> and training facilitators to show the film to community leaders. Over 2000 principals, educators and school counselors have attended screenings within Israel's religious school system. The film has now been seen by an estimated 8 million people worldwide. Following the success of Trembling before G-d, DuBowski produced a documentary about gay devout Muslims entitled A Jihad for Love.|$|E

25|$|Religion {{has played}} a role in shaping Indian customs and traditions. While {{injunctions}} <b>on</b> <b>homosexuality's</b> morality are not explicitly mentioned in the religious texts central to Hinduism, the largest religion in India, Hinduism has taken various positions, ranging from homosexual characters and themes in its texts to being neutral or antagonistic towards it. Rigveda, one of the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism says Vikriti Evam Prakriti (Sanskrit: , meaning what seems unnatural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognises homosexual/transsexual dimensions of human life, like all forms of universal diversities. Historical literary evidence indicates that homosexuality has been prevalent across the Indian subcontinent throughout history, and that homosexuals were not necessarily considered inferior in any way until about 18th century.|$|R
