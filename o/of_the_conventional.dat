5|$|Fig.8 {{illustrates}} {{the operation of}} a Fourier transform spectrometer, which is essentially a Michelson interferometer with one mirror movable. (A practical Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.|$|E

In the company’s efforts to reconcile two conflicting goals, sufficient headroom with a low roofline, the new LS employs an available outer-slide-type panoramic moonroof instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conventional,</b> internally retracting item.|$|E
5|$|President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{attended}} 10 official inaugural balls {{during the}} evening of January 20, 2009. Barack Obama wore a new tuxedo made by Hart Schaffner Marx, a Chicago-based menswear company. He also wore a white bow tie, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> black. Traditionalists considered this a fashion faux pas, as a white tie is conventionally only worn with a white waistcoat and tails. Michelle Obama wore a white, one-shouldered, sleeveless gown designed by 26-year-old NewYork-based designer JasonWu, breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, who showcased designers from their hometowns.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{air raids}} {{significantly}} influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender. While the USSBS did not state that any single factor caused the surrender, during interrogations most Japanese wartime leaders nominated the prolonged air {{attacks on the}} home islands as {{the single most important}} factor which influenced their decision to end the war. In particular, Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki stated that the combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> B-29 raids, Potsdam Declaration and atomic bombings gave the Government the opportunity to begin negotiations with the Allies. Emperor Hirohito cited damage from the attacks, inadequate preparations to resist invasion and the Soviet offensive as his justifications for authorizing the surrender. To achieve this, the American Twentieth Strategic Air Force, in concert with its Allies, dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Of this total, 147,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the B-29 bomber force. Around 90percent of the American tonnage fell in the last five months of the war. The financial cost of the campaign to the United States was $4 billion; this expenditure was much lower than the $30 billion spent on bomber operations in Europe, and a small proportion of the $330 billion the US Government spent on the war.|$|E
5|$|Although strenuous and {{requiring}} physical fitness, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing. The main {{dangers of the}} mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, {{even those who are}} acclimatized. In serious cases, it can lead to high-altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries {{have the potential to}} replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively.|$|E

5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, the opposite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins. As a result, his right ankle had to be bound tightly {{in order to prevent}} jarring from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March 1773, Edgeworth's {{first wife}} Anna Maria Elers {{gave birth to}} their fifth child, Anna Maria Edgeworth, {{at the age of}} 29. Ten days later she died from puerperal fever. Edgeworth was still in Lyon to avoid temptation leaving his {{expectant}} wife in the care of Day. On learning of the death of his wife, Edgeworth travelled to London, where he consulted Day as to Honora Sneyd's situation. On learning that she remained in good health and unattached, he promptly headed to Lichfield to see Honora at the Sneyds, with the intention of proposing. His offer was accepted immediately, and there was no mention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> waiting period before remarrying after widowhood. Although Mr. Sneyd was opposed to his daughter's marriage, the couple were married at Lichfield Cathedral on 17 July 1773, officiated by Canon Thomas Seward, Anna Seward being a bridesmaid. After marrying, problems with the Edgeworth family estates in Ireland required the couple to immediately move to Edgeworthstown, County Longford in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The {{season began}} with Tropical Depression 17F on July 3, several {{months prior to}} the {{official}} start of the season. In late December, the strongest cyclone of the season, Cyclone Zoe severely affected many islands in the South Pacific, particularly the island of Tikopia. Zoe remained the strongest cyclone recorded in the Southern Hemisphere until Winston surpassed. Shortly after, in mid-January, Cyclone Ami struck Fiji as a Category3 cyclone, where it caused US$51.2million in damage. Cyclone Erica caused considerable damage to New Caledonia as a Category4 cyclone, causing numerous power outages. The final storm of the season, Cyclone Gina, formed well outside the bounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> tropical cyclone season, existing entirely in the month of June and causing some damage to Tikopia. As a result of tropical cyclones in the 2002–03 season, US$67.2million in damages was caused, along with 20fatalities.|$|E

This research was aimed to gather information on the {{diversity and}} abundance of Collembola and arthropods in organic and conventional lowland field at fallow time. The sampling was done using pitfall trap and Berlese funnel. The results showed that: (1) <b>the</b> abundance <b>of</b> Collembola in organic lowland field was higher than that <b>of</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> lowland field but the diversity of  Collembola in the organic lowland field was not different from that <b>of</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> field; (2) Entomobryidae was the family with the highest abundance; and (3) the diversity and abundance of soil arthropods were relatively greater in organic lowland field than that <b>of</b> in <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> lowland...|$|R
