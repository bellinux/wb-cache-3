50|$|Capacity {{attendance}} at Comic-Con in 2006 and 2007 has caused crowding issues. Concerns {{have been raised}} that the event is possibly too massive for the San Diego Convention Center, Comic-Con's home through at least 2021. In 2006, Comic-Con, for the first time, had to close registration {{for a few hours}} on Saturday to accommodate crowds. In response, for 2007, Comic-Con introduced a new three-day membership that did not include Saturday. Nevertheless, the 2007 show went on to sell out Saturday, as well as Friday and Sunday for the first time. Additionally, both the four-day and three-day memberships sold out for the first time. For 2008, the three-day memberships were abandoned and the convention decided to sell memberships only in advance, with no <b>on-site</b> <b>registration.</b> In 2008, all memberships were sold out before the convention for the first time ever. This sellout has given rise to the new phenomenon of Comic-Con memberships being scalped for exorbitant prices on websites such as eBay and Craigslist.|$|E

40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{occurrence}} of pesticide misapplication, {{it is necessary to}} establish support systems for appropriate pesticide use by applying information technology (IT) based on prior risk management. This paper introduces the concept of the Navigation System for Appropriate Pesticide Use (Nouyaku-navi), the state of development of the system, functions of the latest system and the results of the demonstration experiment. The latest Nouyaku-navi comprises various functions, as follows: support functions for creating guidelines on pest control, support functions for creating pesticide use plans, judgment functions for the pesticide use plans, on-site warning functions for pesticide application and functions for <b>on-site</b> <b>registration</b> of pesticide application records. Users of the system can create pesticide use plans by means of a personal computer and easily judge their propriety using the Nouyaku-navi judgment server. Also, users can easily use a cellular phone to determine the propriety of pesticide application from farming fields or agrochemical storage lockers just before the application. If the plan has no problem, data on the pesticide application can be simultaneously registered on the system as a pesticide application record. Also discussed are issues on the Nouyaku-navi and its relationship with good agricultural practice (GAP) and traceability systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the communications infrastructure {{used in the}} e-Triage Project. The main objective of e-Triage is the effcient electronic <b>on-site</b> <b>registration</b> of victims in Mass Casualty Incidents (MCIs) to enable a fast distribution of the information to operation control centers and hospitals for a better handling of victims. To achieve this, e-Triage designs the end-device used to register the victims, the distributed database where the information of the victims is saved, and the communications infrastructure necessary to transmit the data. After a disaster event the terrestrial commercial networks {{are likely to be}} overloaded, damaged or not operative, if they ever existed. A dynamic network extension is envisaged for dedicated Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) systems, or a complete deployment is foreseen if e-Triage is used abroad where no infrastructure is. This paper focuses on the technologies used to transmit data and voice traffc within the disaster area and to the remote control centers and hospitals. These technologies are GSM/GPRS, TErrestrial Trunked RAdio (TETRA) and WLAN and are backhauled over satellite (BGAN or VSAT) or UMTS links. Some modifications of the protocols underneath have been implemented, which show better performance over slow and limited bandwidth links...|$|E
40|$|Contextual archaeo-anthropological studies – whereby {{skeletal}} and archaeological {{analyses are}} treated as one whole – are still uncommon. The detailed study of a sub-sample of 400 individuals from the excavation of St. Rombout’s cemetery in Mechelen, Belgium (10 th- 18 th centuries AD) nevertheless demonstrates its enormous potential. A macroscopic study of mortality patterns and age and sex composition (palaeodemography) and the investigation of disease (palaeopathology) was combined with the study of funerary practices. This allowed the exploration of ‘who’ {{was buried in the}} churchyard, different socio-economic groups, burial customs and the physical health and lifestyle of the parish population. It also offered suggestions for circumstances of death in the case of several unusual burials. The excavation, carried out between 2009 and 2011, resulted in the largest skeletal assemblage so far in Belgium, with over 4, 000 individuals still in anatomical position, spread across more than eight centuries of continuous burial. Detailed <b>on-site</b> <b>registration,</b> extensive sampling for future biochemical analyses and archival documentation add to the exceptional nature of this collection and its potential for the study of patterns between groups and over time. The burials showed variation in the use of a coffin, the position and orientation of the body, the presence of a layer of lime, ash or loam and the number of individuals in the grave with indications for single, collective and multiple burial. This variation was used to explore patterns in the skeletal data. It offered interpretations on the socio-economic background, health and lifestyle of individuals and also documented the influence of sex and particularly age on social roles. Various skeletal changes were studied to explore wider patterns, including disturbances in the growth of individuals due to malnutrition or disease, lesions related to injury and physical stress, dental health and disease. Chronological changes in demographic and palaeopathological data were observed from the late medieval to post-medieval period and the presence of different social groups was established. The main change was the appearance of a large group of adolescents (12 - 17 years) and young adults (18 - 25 years), mostly males, from the 15 th- 16 th century layer onwards. Their less expensive and more unusual burials – including plain earth and collective burial, unusual positions and orientations – point towards a poorer and dependent social position. The individuals showed higher frequencies of growth disturbances, evidence of physical stress and disease. They may be servants, apprentices and immigrants and, considering the much higher proportion of males, may reflect the ‘extended male adolescence’ known from medieval historical sources. A Spanish military hospital (1585 - 1715 AD) near the cemetery may also have affected the age and sex composition. For individuals over 25 years of age single graves and coffins were more common. They showed fewer indications for growth disturbances and lesions related to disease, which were more commonly healed, indicating these were stronger, surviving, individuals. Wealth and social position may have depended on age or social position could have affected the probability of reaching old age. Although females were generally more commonly associated with coffin burial, over 50 years of age males were more frequently buried in coffins. Males showed a large presence in the young adult category, while females showed a larger presence in the over 50 year category. Young adult males were also associated with growth disturbances, a high degree of physical stress and disease, while young adult females only showed higher levels of injury. Patterns of physical stress varied between sexes and between age categories. Overall males showed more pronounced differences as they got older and seem to have achieved more evident changes in social position around 25 years of age. Females showed less marked differences, with an apparently lower impact of lifestyle on health. The multiple burials, which indicate episodes of unusual or elevated mortality, showed a large proportion of adolescents and young adults, who were almost all male. The high probability of death between 15 - 29 years of age was different from the single depositions and a natural mortality pattern. However, it also does not illustrate a catastrophic mortality, where all age categories would have been equally affected. The age and sex composition implies a selection and the inclusion of individuals was likely related to both circumstances of death and socio-economic background, with higher numbers of poor and dependent individuals. The palaeopathological patterns are similar to those in the plain earth burials, but with more pronounced evidence for growth disturbances, physical stress and disease. A background with high levels of stress may have made these individuals more likely to succumb to mortality crises such as epidemics or famines. There is no macroscopic evidence for a specific cause of death, although the lack of trauma inflicted around the time of death argues against violence. Differences in the organisation of the graves between the two studied groups of multiple burials (labelled as groups A and B), which date to different periods and showed differences in age and sex composition, suggest that they result from different circumstances of death and burial. Group A, with one phase of deposition (second half 15 th century–early 17 th century), reflects more abrupt mortality crises, such as epidemics or famines, in the parish population. Group B, where individuals were buried in different phases (second half 17 th century– 18 th century), may possibly be connected to the Spanish military hospital. Other unusual graves included lime burials. Physico-chemical analyses confirmed the presence of lime and the contextual analysis indicated the possibility of different motives and variable practices. Disease could however be proposed for several burials, where lime may have been included for disinfection. The contextual study of a mass grave with the remains of 41 executed brigands (1798 AD), also underlined the importance of detailed excavation and the combination of archaeological, historical and skeletal information. The execution could be reconstructed and compared to historical descriptions, some of which could be contradicted. Using the differences in funerary practices to explore patterns in the skeletal data resulted in detailed and nuanced interpretations. The assemblage does not directly represent the original parish population and includes different social groups from the lower and middle classes. Gender and particularly age influenced the meaning of social roles and affected physical health and lifestyle. The results could be compared to other late medieval and post-medieval studies in North-Western Europe. This showed similarities as well as regional variation and emphasised the influence of population background on patterns in the skeletal data. The study demonstrates the importance of contextual analyses for the interpretation of patterns in archaeological skeletal collections. Hopefully this approach will become more common, with an increased cooperation between archaeologists and archaeo-anthropologists. status: publishe...|$|E

The luncheon, {{which takes place}} during the {{university}} 2 ̆ 7 s Honors Week, recognizes individuals who have demonstrated a deep commitment to bettering the university. 2 ̆ 2 The UGA Alumni Association is pleased to once again celebrate the extraordinary contributions of the University of Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s most generous alumni and friends, 2 ̆ 2 said Meredith Gurley Johnson, executive director of alumni relations. 2 ̆ 2 It is also a time to {{recognize the importance of}} private support {{to the success of the}} university and to reflect on the transformative nature this engagement has on the lives of thousands of students each year. 2 ̆ 2 Family of the Year Award The John F. and Marilyn McMullan Family will be recognized as the 2015 Family of the Year. John and Marilyn McMullan, who met while attending UGA, value higher education and over the past 45 years, have made the university the beneficiary of their philanthropy. John graduated from UGA in 1959 and 1960 with undergraduate and master 2 ̆ 7 s degrees in business, and is now the CEO of Camden Real Estate, an Atlanta-based company he founded in 1990. The couple has established a number of scholarships at UGA, including a study abroad scholarship, the McMullan Academic Support Fund, the Mr. and Mrs. John F. McMullan Football Scholarship, and the McMullan Family Women 2 ̆ 7 s Tennis Scholarship. The Dean 2 ̆ 7 s Suite on the new Terry Business Campus will bear the McMullan family name. Marilyn serves on the Georgia Museum of Art board of advisors and John is an emeritus trustee of the UGA Foundation. In 2009, he received the Terry Distinguished Alumni Award, and in 2010, the UGA Alumni Association presented him with its Alumni Merit Award. Their son, John E. 2 ̆ 2 Ted 2 ̆ 2 McMullan, graduated from UGA with his Master of Business Administration in 1993. He is a former member and chairman of the Terry Alumni Board, a former chair of the Terry Alumni Awards 2 ̆ 6 Gala, and an advisory trustee to the UGA Foundation. Alumni Merit Awards The Alumni Merit Award, the UGA Alumni Association 2 ̆ 7 s oldest honor, will be presented to C. L. Morehead Jr. and James H. Blanchard. Morehead graduated from UGA in 1950 and 65 years later, is an Athens businessman and one of the university 2 ̆ 7 s most generous benefactors. Through his business, Flowers Inc., Morehead became close friends with the late Lamar Dodd, for whom UGA 2 ̆ 7 s School of Art is named. Dodd inspired Morehead to become an avid art collector and today, the alumnus has assembled the largest collection of Lamar Dodd works and other significant collections of rugs and Chinese, tribal and pre-Colombian art and artifacts. At the university and its Georgia Museum of Art, these items will be invaluable as a cultural resource that will be fundamental in teaching generations of students and the community. Morehead served as a trustee for the UGA Foundation and is on the board of advisors for the Georgia Museum of Art and the State Botanical Garden of Georgia. He has financially supported the expansion of the Georgia Museum of Art, which boasts the C. L. Morehead, Jr. Center for the Study of American Art and the C. L. Morehead Wing. Blanchard holds a Bachelor of Business Administration and a Bachelor of Laws from UGA. He spent 34 years as CEO of Columbus, Georgia-based Synovus Financial Corp., guiding it during its greatest era of growth and prosperity. His servant leadership approach led Georgia Trend to name him its Most Respected CEO in 1997 and Georgian of the Year in 2003. In 1999, Fortune Magazine named Synovus the best place to work in America, a direct result of Blanchard fostering a work-life balance as part of Synovus 2 ̆ 7 corporate culture. Blanchard is an emeritus trustee of the UGA Foundation, an emeritus member of the Terry College Dean 2 ̆ 7 s Advisory Council and a member of the Building Terry Campaign Cabinet. Friend of UGA Award Willis J. Potts Jr. will be honored with the 2015 Friend of UGA Award. The award is given to a non-UGA graduate whose professional or public service has greatly assisted the university. Potts graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s degree in industrial technology. In 2004, Potts retired as vice president and general manager of Temple-Inland Corporation. In total, he served 35 years in the international pulp and paper industry and was chairman of both the Paper Industry Management Association and the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry. Today he is the chairman of the board of CatchMark Timber Trust in Atlanta. In 2006, Potts was appointed to the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia and became chairman in 2010. He championed creation of the UGA College of Engineering, which has now enrolled more than 1, 300 students since it was founded in 2012. Faculty Service Award Rebecca H. White is receiving the Faculty Service Award. First presented in 1969, the award recognizes current or retired UGA faculty and staff who have distinguished themselves in service to the university. White, who specializes in the areas of labor law, employment discrimination, employment law and law arbitration, served as the first female dean of the UGA School of Law. During the 10 years she led the law school, she was inducted into the UGA Teaching Academy and was, awarded the Josiah Meigs Award, which is the university 2 ̆ 7 s highest honor for teaching excellence. She oversaw a multimillion-dollar facility renovation, the hiring of 30 additional faculty members, the launch of the Business Law and Ethics program, and the creation of 40 new endowed funds for scholarships and faculty. On Dec. 31, she stepped down as dean, yet remains on the School of Law faculty where she holds a J. Alton Hosch Professorship. In 2015, the School of Law established the Rebecca Hanner White Scholarship, which has since received more than 210, 000 in gifts and pledges. Young Alumni Award The inaugural Young Alumni Award will be presented to Deep J. Shah. Shah arrived at UGA with a Foundation Fellowship, the university 2 ̆ 7 s premier undergraduate scholarship for academically outstanding students. While attending UGA, he co-founded the UGA Roosevelt Institute Chapter, which is a student-led think tank, and was named a 2007 Truman Scholar and a 2007 Rhodes Scholar. After graduating summa cum laude in 2008 with degrees in international affairs and biology, Shah earned a master 2 ̆ 7 s degree from Oxford University and then enrolled in Harvard Medical School on a Paul 2 ̆ 6 Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans. Today, Shah is an internal medicine and primary care physician resident in the J. Willis Hurst Internal Medicine Residency Program at the Emory University School of Medicine.
