5|$|The First English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642. During its early campaigns, Kenilworth formed a useful {{counterbalance}} to the Parliamentary stronghold of Warwick. Kenilworth was used by Charles on his advance to Edgehill in October 1642 {{as a base for}} raids on Parliamentary strongholds in the Midlands. After the battle, however, the royalist garrison was withdrawn on the approach of Lord Brooke, and the castle was then garrisoned by parliamentary forces. In April 1643 the new governor of the castle, Hastings Ingram, was arrested as a suspected Royalist double agent. By January 1645 the Parliamentary forces in Coventry had strengthened their hold on the castle, and attempts by Royalist forces to dislodge them from Warwickshire failed. Security concerns continued {{after the end of the}} First Civil War in 1646, and in 1649 Parliament ordered the slighting of Kenilworth. <b>One</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the great tower, various parts of the outer bailey and the battlements were destroyed, but not before the building was surveyed by the antiquarian William Dugdale, who published his results in 1656.|$|E

25|$|The Otago Peninsula is a long, hilly {{indented}} {{finger of}} land that forms the easternmost part of Dunedin, New Zealand. Volcanic in origin, it forms <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the eroded valley that now forms Otago Harbour. The peninsula lies south-east of Otago Harbour and runs parallel to the mainland for 20km, with a maximum width of 9km. It is joined to the mainland at the south-west end by a narrow isthmus about 1.5km wide.|$|E
25|$|The Church of Nossa Senhora da Vitória (Our Lady of Victory)is a long {{rectangular}} temple grafted along <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the cloister (to {{the right}} of the main entranceway) and is also three-storeys tall. The main chapel, similarly rectangular, but much narrower, is covered in a vaulted ceiling with a niche located opposite the main entrance. On the nave wall {{on the side of the}} epistle, is the Chapel of Santo António, covered in 16th century azueljos (in blue, yellow and white) with two panels depicting the life of Saint Anthony.|$|E
25|$|In the Roman Empire, {{the first}} fish {{to be brought}} indoors was the sea barbel, which was kept under guest beds in small tanks made of marble. Introduction of glass panes around the year 50 AD allowed Romans to replace <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> marble tanks, {{improving}} {{their view of the}} fish. In 1369, the Hongwu Emperor of China established a porcelain company that produced large porcelain tubs for maintaining goldfish; over time, people produced tubs that approached the shape of modern fish bowls. Leonhard Baldner, who wrote Vogel-, Fisch- und Tierbuch (Bird, Fish, and Animal Book) in 1666, maintained weather loaches and newts.|$|E

25|$|The state rooms {{include the}} Library, the Music Room, Dining Room and upstairs, a rather rare Etruscan Room. The {{rooms of the}} hall were exquisitely {{finished}} by the finest artists and craftsmen of the period, {{with most of the}} furnishings and mahogany doors being made by Gillow's of Lancashire. Most of the decorative paintings, the Pompeiian Cupola Room and the case for the 18th century chamber organ built by Samuel Green in 1790, were the work of Italian artist, Biagio Rebecca. The organ fills <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the Music Room. The ornate plasterwork was created by the firm of Joseph Rose II of York.|$|E
25|$|All monastic orders {{required}} handwashing before meals. A lavatorium {{was therefore}} provided near the refectory, either against <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the cloister {{with a long}} trench basin, or as a free-standing building with a circular or octagonal basin in the centre. An example of the first type, dating to the 14th century, survives at Gloucester Cathedral, and has a towel cupboard nearby. At Durham Cathedral, the lavatorium was a square building with a circular basin which was replaced in 143233 with one of marble. At Wenlock Priory, the octagonal lavatorium, now ruined, was decorated with late-12th-century carved panels including one of Jesus with the apostles at the Sea of Galilee. There were sometimes taps; at Wenlock Priory, the water spouted from animal heads mounted on the central pillar.|$|E

500|$|Originating at 20:22 UTC, {{or around}} 2:30 local time, the {{earthquake}} {{was assigned a}} maximum intensity of VII. Minor damage occurred throughout the geographical region. Injuries were reported as well. The earthquake fractured walls, downed chimneys, and interfered with the stability of structures, even loosening stones. In Louisville and Leavenworth, chimneys fell; in Paola, the earthquake destroyed <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> a large post office building. Waves were observed on the Kansas River, [...] in height. Isolated reports from Iowa and Missouri, describing fallen and cracked plaster in Dubuque and Chillicothe, compliment additional reports of fallen plaster and roof shingles, damaged wells, and cracked walls.|$|E
500|$|The Kitchen Tower {{stands on}} the north-west corner of the castle and was {{intended}} to supply Lord Hasting's large household. The tower only had two storeys, as the ground floor kitchen had a very high, [...] high vaulted ceiling, and its walls were [...] thick and made of yellow sandstone. The well-lit kitchen had several hearths and an oven for cooking, a well and a cellar for storage. Above the kitchen was a large room, probably used as a winter parlour. <b>One</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the tower was slighted in 1648. An underground passage, probably dating from the English Civil War, links the Great Tower with the Kitchen Tower.|$|E
500|$|He was a cricket enthusiast, {{taking his}} bat {{with him when}} {{evacuated}} during the Blitz. In 1971, he told Mel Gussow: [...] "one of my main obsessions in life is the game of cricket—I play and watch and read {{about it all the}} time." [...] He was chairman of the Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of Yorkshire Cricket Club, and devoted a section of his official website to the sport. <b>One</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as a young man playing cricket, which was described by Sarah Lyall, writing in The New York Times: [...] "The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked glint in his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas." [...] Pinter approved of the [...] "urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of aggression." [...] After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running. [...] The BBC Radio 4 memorial tribute included an essay on Pinter and cricket.|$|E

500|$|The only ground {{other than}} Edgbaston used by Warwickshire for {{first-class}} or List A cricket {{in the 21st century}} is Swans Nest Lane in Stratford-upon-Avon. [...] Having only previously played a single match there in 1951, Warwickshire {{returned to the}} ground to play one first-class match in each of 2004 and 2005 as well as a single List A match in the latter year. [...] Additionally, the county played a Twenty20 match at Rugby School in 2013 and planned to make this an annual occurrence, although the match scheduled for 2014 was abandoned without any play taking place due to bad weather. [...] Some of the grounds formerly used by the county still play host to matches at lower levels of the sport, such as those in Leamington Spa and Stratford-upon-Avon, which are used regularly by club teams playing in the Birmingham and District Premier League. [...] Others, however, are disused, such as the Courtaulds Ground in Coventry, which in 2011 was reported to be overgrown and derelict, with only <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the pavilion still standing.|$|E
500|$|H. R. Giger {{designed}} {{and worked on}} all of the alien aspects of the film, which he designed to appear organic and biomechanical in contrast to the industrial look of the Nostromo and its human elements. For the interior of the derelict spacecraft and egg chamber he used dried bones together with plaster to sculpt much of the scenery and elements. Veronica Cartwright described Giger's sets as [...] "so erotic...it's big vaginas and penises...the whole thing is like you're going inside of some sort of womb or whatever...it's sort of visceral". The set with the deceased alien creature, which the production team nicknamed the [...] "space jockey", proved problematic as 20th Century Fox did not want to spend the money for such an expensive set that would only be used for one scene. Ridley Scott described the set as the cockpit or driving deck of the mysterious ship, and the production team was able to convince the studio that the scene was important to impress the audience and make them aware {{that this was not a}} B movie. To save money, only <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the set was created, and the [...] "space jockey" [...] sat atop a disc that could be rotated to facilitate shots from different angles in relation to the actors. Giger airbrushed the entire set and the [...] "space jockey" [...] by hand.|$|E

2500|$|A {{major step}} forward in our {{understanding}} of Neolithic winemaking came from the analysis of a yellowish residue excavated by Mary M. Voigt at the site of Hajji Firuz Tepe in the northern Zagros Mountains of Iran. The jar that once contained wine, with a volume of about 9 liters (2.5 gallons) was found together with five similar jars embedded in the earthen floor along <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "kitchen" [...] of a Neolithic mudbrick building, dated to c. 5400-5000 BC. In such communities, winemaking was the best technology they had for storing highly perishable grapes, although whether the resulting beverage was intended for intoxication as well as nourishment is not known.|$|E
2500|$|Successively {{from the}} first dynasty to the twenty-sixth dynasty, nine or ten temples were built on one site at Abydos. The first was an enclosure, about , {{surrounded}} by a thin wall of unbaked bricks. Incorporating <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> this first structure, the second temple of about [...] square was built within a wall about [...] thick. An outer temenos (enclosure) wall surrounded the grounds. This outer wall was thickened about {{the second or third}} dynasty. The old temple entirely vanished in the fourth dynasty, and a smaller building was erected behind it, enclosing a wide hearth of black ashes. Pottery models of offerings are found in these ashes and probably were the substitutes for live sacrifices decreed by Khufu (or Cheops) in his temple reforms.|$|E
