40|$|Packaged goods {{manufacturers}} {{spend in}} excess of $ 75 billion annually on trade promotions, even though their effectiveness has been hotly debated by academics and practitioners for decades. One reason for this ongoing debate is that empirical research has been limited mostly to case studies, managerial surveys, and data from one or two supermarket chains in a single market. In this paper, we assemble a unique data set containing information on prices, quantities, and promotions throughout the entire channel in a category. Our study extends the empirical literature on pass-through in three important ways. First, we investigate how pass-through varies across more than 1, 000 retailers in over 30 states. Second, we study pass-through at multiple levels of the distribution channel. Third, we show how the use of accounting metrics, such as average acquisition cost, rather than transaction cost, yields biased estimates of pass-through and therefore overstates the effectiveness of trade promotions. We find that mean pass-through elasticities are 0. 71, 0. 59, and 0. 41, for the wholesaler, retailer, and total channel, respectively. More importantly, at each level of the channel we observe large variances in pass-through estimates that we explain using various measures of cost and competition. Surprisingly, we find that market structure and competition have a relatively small impact on pass-through. We conclude by showing how the profitability of manufacturer and wholesaler deals can be improved by utilizing detailed effectiveness estimates. For example, a manufacturer using an trade promotion strategy might offer a 10 % <b>off</b> <b>invoice</b> deal to all retailers on every product. This strategy would decrease manufacturer and wholesaler profits for 56 % of product/store combinations, whereas retailers experience a profit boost in 96 % of cases. Manufacturers and wholesalers can avoid unprofitable trade deals for specific products and retailers by utilizing estimates of pass-through, consumer price elasticity, and margins. Compared to the inclusive strategy, such a trade promotion strategy would improve deal profitability by 80 % and reduce costs by 40 %. trade promotion, pass-through, channels, competition, measurement...|$|E
40|$|Commodity {{foods are}} {{available}} to child nutrition programs (CNP) through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Distribution Program. Using USDA commodity foods creates costs for CNP due to non-value-added expenses such as storage and delivery. Programs such as net <b>off</b> <b>invoice</b> (NOI) have been implemented {{in the past five}} years to remove non-value costs. Use of these programs is voluntary by the state distribution agency, manufacturers, and distributors. The purpose of this research was to compare CNP director perceptions on cost and value of commodity foods in states that use NOI and perceptions of CNP directors in states that do not use NOI as a value pass through (VPT) method;Methods. Qualitative and quantitative research using focus group and a survey design method were used to determine CNP director use of NOI and perceptions of cost and nutrient content of commodity foods in CNP. A total of 2, 868 letters containing a website link to an Internet survey were emailed to CNP directors in 8 purposely selected states. Four states used NOI (Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas) and 4 states did not (Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Washington). States were selected based on volume of commodities used, number of CNP directors to obtain a similar sample size of those using NOI and not using non-NOI, and availability of email addresses;Results. Study results indicated 75 % of CNP directors had unused commodity foods at the end of the school year with 95 % reporting end-of-year delivery as the reason for unused commodity foods. CNP directors in NOI states reported left over entitlement dollars and commodity food inventory remaining at the end of the year less often than CNP directors in non-NOI states do. NOI was the VPT system preferred by the majority of CNP directors in NOI and non-NOI states. CNP directors in NOI and non-NOI states agreed that diverting bulk commodity foods to manufacturers for further processing reduced labor costs and allowed directors to serve commodities in forms students preferred. More CNP directors in NOI states agreed or strongly agreed nutrition was more important than cost when making food purchase decisions for CNP;Conclusions and applications. Increased use of NOI by more states, distributors, and manufacturers may reduce the non-value-added cost of using commodity foods, allow more flexibility for CNP directors to receive commodity foods through commercial distribution channels, therefore provide more options to choose commodity foods with nutrient content desired. Eliminating commodity food storage will help remove non-value-added costs in commodity distribution for CNP directors. Research is needed to quantify the amount of commodity food inventory and entitlement dollars left at the end of the school year and determine reasons for end-of-year delivery;Additional research is needed to determine how commodity distribution decisions are made at the state level. To continue improving commodity programs, increased education for CNP directors, state distribution agencies, and manufacturers on efficient commodity processing programs is needed...|$|E

30|$|Pricing is {{the most}} {{effective}} profit lever (Dolan and Simon 1996). This is a process for determining what a company will receive in exchange for its products or services. Pricing can be considered in industry, market, and transaction levels. At the industry level, the main focus is on the overall economics of the industry, including price changes of the supply and demand changes of the customer. On the other hand, in the market level the competitive situation of the price in comparison with the value differential of the product to that of the comparative competing products will be considered. Pricing at the transaction level focuses on managing the implementation of discounts away from the reference or the price list which occur both on and <b>off</b> the <b>invoice</b> or receipt.|$|R
