5|$|The Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) {{maintains}} air {{and atmospheric}} measurement equipment at Troll. Combined {{with a similar}} measuring station, Zeppelin in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway. This allows the institute to collect such data from both polar regions. In particular, the facility measures aerosols, organic and inorganic pollution, ozone and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. NILU also creates air samples annually to generate data for trend analysis. The weekly air pollution measurements are compared to equivalent measurements at Zeppelin. Ground measurements are taken of ozone and mercury, two of the greatest pollution threats in the polar regions. Stratosphere measurements are conducted to measure ozone and UV levels, in particular to gain additional information about ozone depletion and the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E

Also again in 2011 an <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> appeared over mountainous regions of Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai and the Hindu Kush, along with an unprecedented hole over the Arctic, though the Tibet one is far less intense than the ones over the Arctic or Antarctic.|$|E

25|$|When the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> {{breaks up}} each year, the ozone-depleted air drifts out into nearby regions. Decreases {{in the ozone}} level of up to 10 percent have been {{reported}} in New Zealand in the month following the breakup of the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole,</b> with ultraviolet-B radiation intensities increasing by more than 15 percent since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The main {{public concern}} {{regarding}} the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> {{has been the}} effects of increased surface UV radiation on human health. So far, ozone depletion in most locations has been typically a few percent and, as noted above, no direct evidence of health damage is available in most latitudes. If {{the high levels of}} depletion seen in the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> were to be common across the globe, the effects could be substantially more dramatic. As the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> over Antarctica has in some instances grown so large as to affect parts of Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, and South Africa, environmentalists have been concerned that the increase in surface UV could be significant.|$|E
25|$|The Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> {{is an area}} of the Antarctic {{stratosphere}} {{in which}} the recent ozone levels have dropped to as low as 33 percent of their pre-1975 values. The <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> occurs during the Antarctic spring, from September to early December, as strong westerly winds start to circulate around the continent and create an atmospheric container. Within this polar vortex, over 50 percent of the lower stratospheric ozone is destroyed during the Antarctic spring.|$|E

25|$|G.M.B.

These were at that time the only known Antarctic ozone values available. What Dobson describes is essentially the baseline from which the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> is measured: actual <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> values are in the 150–100 DU range.|$|E

40|$|The climatic {{change is}} studied {{as a natural}} phenomenon. In the {{physical}} model the Sun is the generator of energy and the planets are oscillators coupled between them and coupled to the Sun. Two proper resonance frequencies are identified: The first one has a very high frequency and corresponds to the Solar Spots oscillation (magnetic coupling) when the tendency of planets is to be beside in the elliptic. During the second half part of the XX century the Solar Spots radiation has been very big and together the <b>ozone</b> <b>holes</b> el radiation entering in the Earth has also been very big causing a strong heating of the Earth. However from the sixty years of the XX century, the solar Spots began to diminish and even disappeared for two years (2008 - 2009). The second one has a big period and would correspond to the Platonic Year (elastic/electric coupling) when the radium of the Earth increased causing the <b>ozone</b> <b>holes</b> appearance.

30|$|The global {{circulation}} {{of the middle}} atmosphere tends to produce polar vortices in the winter hemisphere (Brewer 1949; Dobson 1956; Dunkerton and Delisi 1986; Schoeberl et al. 1992; Fisher et al. 1993), isolating the polar air from that at lower latitudes—the reason, for example, that the <b>ozone</b> <b>holes</b> form preferentially over the poles. While downwelling air dominates the middle atmosphere in the winter hemisphere, the summer hemisphere is dominated by upwelling (see Fig.  2). Adiabatic cooling of the rising air in the polar summer mesosphere produces the lowest temperatures found anywhere in the Earth’s environment (Reid 1989; Lübken 1999; Singer et al. 2003).|$|R
25|$|Alternative hypotheses, {{which had}} {{attributed}} the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> to variations in solar UV radiation or {{to changes in}} atmospheric circulation patterns, were also tested and shown to be untenable.|$|E

25|$|The {{behavior}} {{seen in the}} Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> {{is completely}} different.

Using the proposed technique, we compare the retrieval results obtained for various (both well-known and suggested {{for the first time in}} this paper) methods of approximation and regularization of retrieved profiles.

25|$|The {{hole in the}} Earth's {{ozone layer}} over the South Pole has {{affected}} atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere {{all the way to}} the equator.

25|$|Increased solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation {{resulting from the}} Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) {{by as much as}} 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.|$|E
25|$|Ozone {{depletion}} describes {{two related}} phenomena observed {{since the late}} 1970s: a steady decline of about four percent in {{the total amount of}} ozone in Earth's stratosphere (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone around Earth's polar regions.

40|$|<b>Ozone</b> mini <b>holes</b> are {{localized}} and transient (several days) column ozone amount depletion phenomena {{which often}} appear over northern Europe. In early February 1989, the extremely low ozone value of 172 DU was observed by Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer observation. Quantitative analyses {{of this event}} using a forward and backward trajectory method show that the total ozone depletion is by uplift of air throughout the lower stratosphere, whereas the effect of horizontal advection of ozone-poor air from lower latitudes is relatively small. Similar results are obtained for 4 other severe mini hole cases. However, these two dynamical effects cannot fully explain the total ozone depletion, which implies the existence of other possible processes responsible for <b>ozone</b> mini <b>holes...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Polar stratospheric clouds or PSCs, {{also known}} as nacreous clouds ( [...] , from nacre, or mother of pearl, due to its iridescence), are clouds in the winter polar {{stratosphere}} at altitudes of 15000 - 25000 m. They are best observed during civil twilight {{when the sun is}} between 1 and 6 degrees below the horizon as well as in winter and in more northerly latitudes. They are implicated in the formation of <b>ozone</b> <b>holes.</b> The effects on ozone depletion arise because they support chemical reactions that produce active chlorine which catalyzes ozone destruction, and also because they remove gaseous nitric acid, perturbing nitrogen and chlorine cycles in a way which increases ozone destruction.|$|R
25|$|Moreover, {{the polar}} vortex formed over Antarctica is very tight and the {{reaction}} occurring {{on the surface of}} the cloud crystals is far different from when it occurs in atmosphere. These conditions have led to <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> formation in Antarctica. This hypothesis was decisively confirmed, first by laboratory measurements and subsequently by direct measurements, from the ground and from high-altitude airplanes, of very high concentrations of chlorine monoxide (ClO) in the Antarctic stratosphere.|$|E
25|$|Reactions {{that take}} place on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play an {{important}} role in enhancing ozone depletion. PSCs form more readily in the extreme cold of the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere. This is why ozone holes first formed, and are deeper, over Antarctica. Early models failed to take PSCs into account and predicted a gradual global depletion, which is why the sudden Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> was such a surprise to many scientists.|$|E
25|$|Ozone {{depletion}} and the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> generated worldwide {{concern over}} increased cancer risks and other negative effects. The ozone layer prevents most harmful UVB wavelengths of ultraviolet light (UV light) from {{passing through the}} Earth's atmosphere. These wavelengths cause skin cancer, sunburn, and cataracts, which were projected to increase dramatically {{as a result of}} thinning ozone, as well as harming plants and animals. These concerns led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which bans the production of CFCs, halons, and other ozone-depleting chemicals.|$|E
40|$|Study of students’ {{knowledge}} {{about global warming}} can help authorities to have better imagination of this critical environmental problem. This research examines high school students' ideas about greenhouse effect and the results may be useful for the respective authorities to improve cultural and educational aspects of next generation. In this cross-sectional study, a 42 question questionnaire with mix of open and closed questions {{was used to evaluate}} high school students' view about the mechanism, consequences, causes and cures of global warming. To assess students’ knowledge, cognitive score was also calculated. 1035 students were randomly selected from 19 educational districts of Tehran. Sampling method was multi stage. Only 5. 1 % of the students could explain greenhouse effect correctly and completely. 88. 8 % and 71. 2 % respectively believed “if the greenhouse effect gets bigger the Earth will get hotter” and “incidence of more skin cancers is a consequence of global warming”. 69. 6 % and 68. 8 % respectively thought “the greenhouse effect is made worse by too much carbon dioxide” and “presence of <b>ozone</b> <b>holes</b> is a cause of greenhouse effect”. 68. 4 % believed “not using cars so much is a cure for global warming”. While a student’s ‘cognitive score’ could range from - 36 to + 36, Students' mean cognitive score was equal to + 1. 64. Mean cognitive score of male students and grade 2 & 3 students was respectively higher than female ones (P 0. 05). In general, students' {{knowledge about}} global warming was not acceptable and there were some misconceptions in the students’ mind, such as supposing <b>ozone</b> <b>holes</b> as a cause and more skin cancer as a consequence of global warming.

30|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{there have been}} {{increasing}} reports on the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer (reviewed in [1]). At first, the thinning ozone layer and <b>ozone</b> <b>holes</b> have been mainly associated with polar regions [2], yet this has been observed in the northern hemisphere too [3 – 5]. Although the transmission of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is highly variable due to e.g. solar variability or meteorological conditions, climate change is expected to enhance UVR, consisting of UVA (320 to 400 nm) and UVB (290 to 320 nm), {{in the long run}} [6, 7]. These reports initiated numerous investigations on possible effects of UV radiation on terrestric and aquatic (marine and freshwater) organisms. In the pelagic zone, an elevated sensitivity of phytoplankton and zooplankton versus UVR could be observed with effects on growth, production, cell biochemistry, ontogeny, genome and mortality (reviewed in [8 – 10]).|$|R
