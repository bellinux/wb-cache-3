However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> especially in the transport sector. Using transportation fuels more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} are {{devices that}} convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power. The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured {{in a wide}} range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting. Some have even been found to roost in caves and {{possibly}} housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain. Tracking the species by radio signals, {{it was found that the}} species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals. Recent years have seen less reliance <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts to identify those which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present a new {{framework}} for investigating the environmental im- pact of and optimal policies for biofuel production. The model captures {{the interactions between}} <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> and biofuel {{in addition to the}} dynamic nature of the carbon cycle. Compared with the social planner optimum, two external effects that the market fails to integrate are exposed; the negative environmental impact of emission from fuel consumption, and the benefits of carbon capture through growth in the crops used for biofuel production. It is then shown that these deficiencies can be corrected through a common carbon price, where emission is taxed and carbon capture is subsidized. The socially optimal solution can also be reproduced using a tax/subsidy scheme <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> and biofuel production. The last part of the thesis investigates the effects of the most commonly used policy instrument for biofuels; a blending mandate. It is shown that a blending mandate will, as desired, tend to increase the use of biofuel and lower <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> production. The optimal tax <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel,</b> {{in the presence of a}} blending mandate, is then derived. If the total benefits of biofuel are high enough to compensate for the environmental damage of the direct emissions, the tax <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> should be lower than the first-best tax...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study {{determinants}} of a readiness for pro-environmental travel behavior in households. Four empirical studies were conducted examining reduction in car use (Study I), acceptability of transport policy measures (Study II and III), and behavioral adaptations in response to travel demand management (TDM) measures (Study IV). In Study I, {{the aim was to}} interrupt habitual car use by means of a deliberation intervention and to examine the importance of moral motivation (i. e., personal norm) for car use reduction. Results showed that, {{as a result of the}} intervention, car use was mainly reduced among car users with a strong car use habit and a strong moral motivation to reduce car use. The aim of Study II was to examine factors important for the acceptability of three TDM measures: raised tax <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel,</b> improved public transport, and an information campaign. The results demonstrated the importance of general environmental beliefs (i. e., pro-environmental orientation, problem awareness, personal norm, and willingness to reduce car use) and policy specific beliefs (i. e., perceived impact on freedom to choose travel mode and own car use, perceived effectiveness, and perceived fairness) for the acceptability of the measures. Furthermore, personal norm was found to be particularly important for the acceptability of raised tax and the information campaign, whereas problem awareness was more important for the acceptability of improved public transport. Following up on Study II, the purpose of Study III was to examine the acceptability of single and combined transport policy measures, more specifically, raised tax <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel,</b> improved public transport, subsidies of renewable fuel, a package of raised tax <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> and improved public transport, and a package of raised tax <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> and subsidies of renewable fuel. General environmental beliefs (i. e., pro-environmental orientation, problem awareness, personal norm, and willingness to act) and policy specific beliefs (i. e., perceived effectiveness and perceived fairness) were found to be important for the acceptability of the measures. Moreover, personal norm was particularly important for the acceptability of raised tax <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> and the packages, while problem awareness was more important for the acceptability of improved public transport and subsidies of renewable fuel. The aim of Study IV was to examine the behavioral adaptations, more specifically, the expected car use reduction, in response to three hypothetical TDM measures: raised tax <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel,</b> improved public transport, and a package of raised tax <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> and improved public transport. Furthermore, factors important for the expected car use reduction were analyzed. Results showed that a combination of the measures was expected to lead to a larger car use reduction compared to the single measures, and the most commonly chosen reduction strategies were more efficient car use and changing travel mode. Moreover, internal motivational factors, such as personal norm, and the perceived personal impact of the measures were important for expected car use reduction in response to the measures...|$|R

40|$|With no {{indigenous}} <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> over 90 % of Hawaii's {{energy is}} derived from imported crude oil and finished petroleum products.

25|$|The {{impending}} {{depletion of}} natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Interestingly enough, shifting our dependence <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> prices, {{extraction}} paths and petroleum wealth {{of an international}} carbon tax <b>on</b> <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption. We present an intertemporal equilibrium model for <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> where the main {{focus is on the}} oil market. The impacts of a global carbon tax of $ 10 per barrel of oil depend heavily on the market structure in the oil market. If OPEC acts as a cartel, they reduce their production to maintain the oil price. Thus, the effects on the oil wealth of the competitive fringe is minor, while OPEC's oil wealth is considerably reduced. This may explain the difference in attitudes of OPEC and other oil producing countries to international global warming negotiations. If, on the other side, the oil market is competitive, the highest relative reductions in the oil wealth are to be found among non-OPEC producers.
