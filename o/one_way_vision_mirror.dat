50|$|Constructed at {{the corner}} of Linden and Monroe Streets, St. Thomas Hall was {{completed}} in 1962. Five stories tall, the modern L-shaped building contained 50 classrooms, 15 utility rooms, 11 equipment rooms, 10 corridors, and 128 offices, for both faculty and administrators. In addition, the building housed ROTC offices, student lounges, the St. Ignatius Loyola Chapel with room for over two hundred participants, and four laboratories. These laboratories included the education lab where students could practice lesson plans and make use of the latest model projectors and teaching aids in the audio-visual section of the lab; the psych and guidance laboratory with three interview rooms and a clinic complete with <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>vision</b> glass for observation and demonstration; the business department’s accounting and statistics labs containing modern business equipment; and the language laboratory where students can practice speaking and subsequently attain oral proficiency in foreign languages.|$|R

5000|$|The {{people in}} this room hope for a world where an individual's informational {{footprints}} -- everything from an opinion on abortion to the medical record of an actual abortion -- can be traced only if the individual involved chooses to reveal them; a world where coherent messages shoot around the globe by network and microwave, but intruders and feds trying to pluck {{them out of the}} vapor find only gibberish; a world where the tools of prying are transformed into the instruments of privacy.There is only <b>one</b> <b>way</b> this <b>vision</b> will materialize, and that is by widespread use of cryptography. Is this technologically possible? Definitely. The obstacles are political -- some of the most powerful forces in government are devoted to the control of these tools. In short, there is a war going on between those who would liberate crypto and those who would suppress it. The seemingly innocuous bunch strewn around this conference room represents the vanguard of the pro-crypto forces. Though the battleground seems remote, the stakes are not: The outcome of this struggle may determine the amount of freedom our society will grant us in the 21st century. To the Cypherpunks, freedom is an issue worth some risk.|$|R

40|$|Mirror {{therapy is}} more and more often {{suggested}} for the treatment of particular neuropathic pain syndromes, in complement to rehabilitation. Its mechanism of action is poorly elucidated and several non-exclusive hypotheses have been suggested: improvement of sensorimotor congruence, pain modulation by <b>vision,</b> <b>mirror</b> neurons activation, reduction of kinesiophobia, attentional effects, changes in cortical excitability. Even if case reports have given encouraging results, the few controlled studies have given more mixed results. More studies are necessary to better test this treatment, assess its modes of action and test the hypothesis suggesting that particular patients subgroups might be more susceptible to this treatment than others. Despite these questions, a few practical recommendations can be done. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|In 2013, Farid and Vasiliev [arXiv:quant-ph/ 1310. 4922] for {{the first}} time {{proposed}} a way to construct a protocol for the realisation of "Classical to Quantum" <b>one</b> <b>way</b> hash function, a derivative of the Quantum <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function as defined by Gottesman and Chuang [Technical Report arXiv:quant-ph/ 0105032] and used for constructing quantum digital signatures. We, on the other hand, {{for the first}} time, propose the idea of a different kind of <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function which is "quantum-classical" in nature, that is, it takes an n-qubit quantum state of a definite class as its input and produces a classical output. We formally define such a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function and propose a way to construct and realise it. The proposed <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function turns out to be very useful in authenticating a quantum state in any quantum money scheme and so we can construct many quantum money schemes based on such a <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function. Later in the paper, we also give explicit construction of quantum money schemes like quantum bitcoins and quantum currency schemes, solely based on the proposed <b>one</b> <b>way</b> function.
