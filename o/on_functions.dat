5|$|Concerned {{about the}} {{continuing}} turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg on 19 June 1741 {{to take up}} a post at the Berlin Academy, which he had been offered by Frederick the Great of Prussia. He lived for twenty-five years in Berlin, where he wrote over 380 articles. In Berlin, he published the two works for which he would become most renowned: The Introductio in analysin infinitorum, a text <b>on</b> <b>functions</b> published in 1748, and the Institutiones calculi differentialis, published in 1755 on differential calculus. In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.|$|E

25|$|In {{analogy with}} arithmetic, it is {{possible}} to define addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of functions, in those cases where the output is a number. Another important operation defined <b>on</b> <b>functions</b> is function composition, where the output from one function becomes the input to another function.|$|E

25|$|This {{suggests}} the generalization to Fourier transforms on arbitrary finite groups, which act <b>on</b> <b>functions</b> G → C where G is a finite group. In this framework, the standard DFT {{is seen as}} the Fourier transform on a cyclic group, while the multidimensional DFT is a Fourier transform on a direct sum of cyclic groups.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 19th century {{mathematics}} {{became increasingly}} abstract. Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work <b>on</b> <b>functions</b> of complex variables, in geometry, {{and on the}} convergence of series, leaving aside his many contributions to science. He also gave the first satisfactory proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra and of the quadratic reciprocity law.|$|E
25|$|Invariant theory studies {{actions on}} {{algebraic}} varieties {{from the point}} of view of their effect <b>on</b> <b>functions,</b> which form representations of the group. Classically, the theory dealt with the question of explicit description of polynomial functions that do not change, or are invariant, under the transformations from a given linear group. The modern approach analyses the decomposition of these representations into irreducibles.|$|E
25|$|Wangerin {{was also}} known for writing of textbooks, encyclopaedias and his {{historical}} writings.

25|$|The {{difficulty}} of a computation can be useful: modern protocols for encrypting messages (e.g., RSA) depend <b>on</b> <b>functions</b> {{that are known}} to all, but whose inverses (a) are known only to a chosen few, and (b) would take one too long a {{time to figure out}} on one's own. For example, these functions can be such that their inverses can be computed only if certain large integers are factorized. While many difficult computational problems outside number theory are known, most working encryption protocols nowadays are based on the {{difficulty of}} a few number-theoretical problems.|$|E

500|$|For the 12 years {{following}} 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government; district councils shared {{power with the}} Greater Manchester County Council. The county council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) effectively became unitary authority areas. However, the metropolitan county has continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference, and as a ceremonial county, has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff. Several county-wide services were co-ordinated through the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities until April 2011, when the Greater Manchester Combined Authority was established as the strategic county-wide authority for Greater Manchester, taking <b>on</b> <b>functions</b> and responsibilities for economic development, regeneration and transport.
