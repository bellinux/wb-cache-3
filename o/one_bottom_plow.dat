5000|$|All modern baleen whales or mysticetes are filter-feeders {{which have}} baleen {{in place of}} teeth, though the exact means by which baleen is used differs among species (gulp-feeding within balaenopterids, skim-feeding within balaenids, and <b>bottom</b> <b>plowing</b> within eschrichtiids). the first members of both groups {{appeared}} during the middle Miocene. Filter feeding is very beneficial as it allows baleen whales to efficiently gain huge energy resources, which makes the large body size in modern variety possible. The development of filter feeding {{may have been a}} result of worldwide environmental change and physical changes in the oceans. A large-scale change in ocean current and temperature could have contributed to the radiation of modern mysticetes. The earlier variety of baleen whales, or [...] "archaeomysticetes", such as Janjucetus and Mammalodon had very little baleen and relied mainly on their teeth.|$|R
