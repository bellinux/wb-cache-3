40|$|Using a semi-analytical {{approach}} {{we investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} predictions for the masses and metallicities of the baryonic matter in and around galaxies made by three galaxy formation models. These models represent three different feedback scenarios: one model with purely ejective feedback, one model with ejective feedback <b>with</b> <b>reincorporation</b> of ejected gas, and one preventative model. We find that, when the model parameters are adjusted to predict the correct stellar masses {{for a range of}} halo masses between 10 ^{ 10 } to 10 ^{ 12 }Msun, these three scenarios have very different predictions for the masses and metallicities of the interstellar and circum-galactic media. Compared with current observational data, the model implementing preventative feedback has a large freedom to match a broad range of observational data, while the ejective models have difficulties to match a number of observational constraints simultaneously, independent of how the ejection and reincorporation are implemented. Our results suggest that the feedback process which regulates the amounts of stars and cold gas in low-mass galaxies is preventative in nature.

The circuit, fabricated in a mixed 0. 18 - 0. 6 lm CMOS technology, obtains 1. 5 -lV residual <b>offset</b> <b>with</b> 2 VPP fully differential range.

40|$|The preview effect {{refers to}} the finding that new {{elements}} in a search display are prioritized over old elements. Donk and Theeuwes (2001) suggest that this prioritization is due to bottom-up attentional capture, as new elements that abruptly appear with increases in luminance produce a preview effect whereas new elements that are equiluminant to the background do not. The present study extends this research by examining if new elements that appear from <b>offsets,</b> <b>with</b> and without luminance changes, yield similar findings to onsets. This was indeed the case, as equiluminant offsets did not produce a preview effect but <b>offsets</b> <b>with</b> corresponding increases or decreases in luminance did show the prioritization of new elements over old elements. These findings show that the prioritization of new elements is sensitive to changes in luminance {{but not to the}} direction of such changes...|$|R
