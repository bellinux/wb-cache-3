5|$|At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme in {{a manner}} similar to Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and the challenges that this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current at <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the material causes changes in currents {{in other parts of the}} material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E

5|$|Bede, who is {{the main}} source for this information, is unclear on his {{chronology}} relating to Wighard. At <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the Historia Ecclesiastica, he states that Canterbury had been vacant for some time before Wighard's election, but in other writings he implies that Wighard was appointed soon after {{the conclusion of the}} Council of Whitby, which likely took place in 664. However Wighard was selected, he died in Rome. His death possibly occurred around 664, but could have been as late as 667. It may have been caused by the bubonic plague, or perhaps was due to some other disease epidemic. Like much else in his life, it is unclear if he was actually consecrated before his death. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Wighard states that he died before consecration. The historian Peter Blair, however, states that Wighard died {{as he was about to}} head home to Canterbury, after his consecration.|$|E
