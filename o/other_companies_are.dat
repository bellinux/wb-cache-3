Tim Scholl, author of From Petipa to Balanchine, considers Balanchine's Apollo (1928) to be the first neoclassical ballet. It represented a return to form in response to Serge Diaghilev's abstract ballets. Apollo and other works are still performed today, predominantly by the New York City Ballet.

In the following years, exports continuously increased, especially to the Arab world, Asia and Russia. For example, the EPC Group built a plant for plastic granulates in Saudi Arabia, which is one of the largest revamp projects in the world. Similar facilities for the production of Polycarbonate have been built in China, with a capacity of more than 100,000 tons per year. These projects were recognized as important for both the company and the whole industry. In 2009, the EPC Group acquired the CRYOTEC Anlagenbau GmbH, a cryogenic plant construction company in Wurzen, Saxony, with roots going back to the year 1879. Today, the HI Bauprojekt GmbH and RMN Ingenieure GmbH are also part of the EPC Group.|$|E
