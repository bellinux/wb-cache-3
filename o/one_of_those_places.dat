Two melas or fairs, {{also known}} as Jatras, are of particular note in Chamba; [...] "Suhi Mata Mela" [...] and [...] "Minjar Mela".

50|$|He entered {{politics}} {{through the}} influence of the Earl of Bedford, working for the Exchequer in Wiltshire before entering Parliament for Calne, Wiltshire in 1614. Despite his Puritanism he gained a good reputation in Parliament, although he was relentless in his campaigning against Roman Catholics. After the dissolution of Parliament in 1621 he was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> under house-arrest in January 1622. In 1624 he changed his seat, representing Tavistock, Devon, {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} November it was {{announced}} that 59th AGRA was to be disbanded to provide drafts for the infantry. 59th AGRA's guns continued to fire in support of Operation Guildford, then on 4 December the formation moved to the Svegehem area, where 61st Field Rgt left. Disbandment of 59th AGRA's remaining units began in December, with the first drafts of gunners transferring to the infantry in the United Kingdom. 116 Field Regiment was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>placed</b> in suspended animation from January 1945.|$|R
50|$|Savadi is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>place</b> in South India, that traces {{back its}} {{history to the}} Neolithic age.

The painted pottery was painted in black, and in some cases thin white colour was used. The painted motifs {{included}} a variety of designs and animals like fish, stork, dog, peacock, deer, etc. Designs were also engraved in relievo.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Cheerful enough. And {{mind what}} I've just told you; {{when you start}} into <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> you've got to go through. They are too narrow to turn around in, too crooked to back out of, and the shoal water is always up at the head; never elsewhere.

6000|$|The schoolhouse down on {{the creek}} was known as [...] "Hell's Corners" [...] all through the county, because of the {{frequent}} rows that took place therein at [...] "corkuses" [...] and the like, and {{also because of the}} number of teachers that had been [...] "ousted" [...] by the boys. In fact, it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> still to be found occasionally in the West, far from railroads and schools, where the primitive ignorance and ferocity of men still prowl, like the panthers which are also found sometimes in the deeps of the Iowa timber lands.|$|E

As this is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> in the Indies, where the saint, whose life I write, had most business, and whither he made many voyages, {{it will not}} be {{unprofitable}} to say somewhat of it. It is situate beyond the gulph of Bengal, towards the head of that great peninsula, which, {{from the mouth of the}} Ara, is extended to the south, almost to the equinoctial line; and is of two degrees and a half of elevation, over against the island of Sumatra, which the ancients, who had not frequented this channel, believed to be joined to the continent.|$|E

"To be {{perfectly}} frank with you, my dear fellow," [...] Mr. Parker explained, as he clambered {{into the car}} and took the place I had vacated by his daughter's side, [...] "it would give us no pleasure to go to the Ritz. We have courage, both of us--my daughter and I--as you may have observed for yourself; but courage is a different thing from rashness. We have been enjoying a very pleasant and not unlucrative time for the last six weeks, with the--er--natural result that there are several ladies and gentlemen in London whom I would just as soon avoid.

60|$|As {{this was}} the Templeton of the Pioneers, and the {{progress}} of society during half a century is connected with the circumstance, we shall give the reader a more accurate notion of its present state, than {{can be obtained from}} incidental allusions. We undertake the office more readily because this is not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> that shoot up in a day, under the unnatural efforts of speculation, or which, favoured by peculiar advantages in the way of trade, becomes a precocious city, while the stumps still stand in its streets; but a sober county town, that has advanced steadily, pari passu with the surrounding country, and offers a fair specimen of the more regular advancement of the whole nation, in its progress towards civilization.|$|E
6000|$|One further {{experiment}} of {{the same}} sort I made with the English Press in another direction and met again with failure. If there is one paper {{in the world for}} which I have respect and--if I may say it--an affection, it is the London Spectator. I suppose that I am only one of thousands and thousands of people who feel that way. Why under the circumstances the Spectator failed to publish my letter I cannot say. I wanted no money for it: I only wanted the honour of seeing it inserted beside the letter written from the Rectory, Hops, Hants, or the Shrubbery, Potts, Shrops,--I mean from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where the readers of the Spectator live. I thought too that my letter had just the right touch. However, they wouldn't take it: something wrong with it somewhere, I suppose. This is it: ...|$|E

It was because I had been slaving away for years at <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where {{you go in and}} pay five cents to dance with the lady instructresses. I was a lady instructress. Henry! Just think what I went through! Every day having to drag a million heavy men with large feet round a big room. I tell you, you are a professional compared with some of them! They trod on my feet and leaned their two hundred pounds on me and nearly killed me. Now perhaps you can understand why I'm not crazy about dancing! Believe me, Henry, the kindest thing you can do to me is to tell me I must never dance again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I tell?" [...] the Prince rejoined carelessly. [...] "Why should any one desire my death? These {{things are}} riddles. Ah! Here comes my friend Immelan!" [...] he went on.

5000|$|During {{the height}} of the American Revolutionary War, Irving writes that the country {{surrounding}} Tarry Town [...] "was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> highly-favored <b>places</b> which abound with chronicle and great men.

60|$|There {{has been}} a {{question}} fruitful of discussion among the Genoese themselves, whether Columbus {{was born in the}} city of Genoa, or in some other part of the territory. Finale, and Oneglia, and Savona, towns on the Ligurian coast to the west, Boggiasco, Cogoleto, and several other towns and villages, claim him as their own. His family possessed a small property at a village or hamlet between Quinto and Nervi, called Terra Rossa; in Latin, Terra Kubra; which has induced some writers to assign his birth to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places.</b> Bossi says that there is still a tower between Quinto and Nervi which bears the title of Torre dei Colombi. [271] Bartholomew Columbus, brother to the admiral, styled himself of Terra Rubra, in a Latin inscription on a map which he presented to Henry VII of England, and Fernando Columbus states, in his history of the admiral, that he was accustomed to subscribe himself in the same manner before he attained to his dignities.|$|E
60|$|In {{some such}} mood I came along a lean, pale road {{south of the}} fens, and found myself in a large, quiet, and {{seemingly}} forgotten village. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> that instantly produce a frame of mind which, it may be, one afterwards decks out with unreal details. I dare say that grass did not really grow in the streets, but I came away with a curious impression that it did. I dare say the marketplace was not literally lonely and without sign of life, but it left the vague impression of being so. The place was large and even loose in design, yet it had the air of something hidden away and always overlooked. It seemed shy, like a big yokel; the low roofs seemed to be ducking behind the hedges and railings; and the chimneys holding their breath. I came into it in that dead hour of the afternoon which is neither after lunch nor before tea, nor anything else even on a half-holiday; and I had a fantastic feeling that I had strayed into a lost and extra hour that is not numbered in the twenty-four.|$|E
60|$|I was now driven {{back upon}} the Assembly Ball. Robbie had failed me. The bank was watched; {{it would never}} do to risk Rowley in that neighbourhood. All I could do was {{to wait until the}} morrow evening, and present myself at the Assembly, let it end as it might. But I must say I came to this {{decision}} with a good deal of genuine fright; and here I came {{for the first time to}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where my courage stuck. I do not mean that my courage boggled and made a bit of a bother over it, as it did over the escape from the Castle; I mean, stuck, like a stopped watch or a dead man. Certainly I would go to the ball; certainly I must see this morning about my clothes. That was all decided. But the most of the shops were on the other side of the valley, in the Old Town; and it was now my strange discovery that I was physically unable to cross the North Bridge! It was as though a precipice had stood between us, or the deep sea had intervened. Nearer to the Castle my legs refused to bear me.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{it came to}} {{pass that}} the pugilist {{obtained}} suitable employment as a peacemaker and keeper of order, for a time at least, in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> disreputable <b>places</b> <b>of</b> amusement where the unfortunate poor of London are taught lessons of vice and vanity which end often in vexation of spirit, not only to themselves, but to the strata of society which rest above them.|$|R
