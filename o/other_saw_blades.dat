The results of the measuring the noise level of three structuraly different circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> are presented in this paper. The types of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> are: with six compensating slots in radial direction, with six compensating slots in tangential direction and with six sigmoid compensating slots. The diameters of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> were 350 mm. The measurements of the noise level were performed in the cutting process using the standard equipments. The circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> with compensating slots emited high cutting noise level but their noise level was different. The circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> with sigmoid compensating slots had the lowest noise levels {{in the range of}} (2 5) dB (A) as compared with the <b>others</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades...</b>|$|R

50|$|A French flush-cut saw is a {{double-edged}} tool, {{similar to a}} veneer saw, that is designed for trimming the ends of dowels, tenons, and other protusions flush with a surface.

5000|$|If possible, diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> {{should be}} used instead of {{abrasive}} <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> to cut. Diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> normally cut more quickly than abrasive blades while requiring less water.|$|R
30|$|However, {{thermal stress}} is {{produced}} when circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is working, because the temperature {{at the edge}} of the blade is higher than that in other regions of the blade. It will cause high tangential compressive stress on the edge of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> causing a buckling deformation that reduces cutting precision, increases kerf loss, and shortens the saw’s life [1, 2]. Thin circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is more easily affected by thermal stress. For saving materials, the stability of <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is very important, especially for thin circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|R
30|$|In step 1, {{the roll}} moved slowly down and elastic–plastic {{deformation}} was produced to the <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> In step 2, the roll slowly raised and the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> {{was no longer}} under any load. The residual stress of <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> was the tensioning stress.|$|R
50|$|Diamond: Fixed {{onto the}} <b>saw</b> <b>blade's</b> base to form diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades.</b> As diamond is a superhard material, diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> {{can be used}} to cut hard brittle or {{abrasive}} materials, for example, stone, concrete, asphalt, bricks, ceramics, glass, semiconductor and gem stone. There are many methods used to fix the diamonds onto the blades' base and there are various kinds of diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> for different purposes. High speed steel (HSS): The whole <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is made of High Speed Steel (HSS). HSS <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> are mainly used to cut steel, copper, aluminum and other metal materials. If high-strength steels (e.g., stainless steel) are to be cut, the blades made of cobalt HSS (e.g. M35, M42) should be used.|$|R
30|$|When {{circular}} <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> {{is cutting}} the work piece, tangential and radial tensile stresses are produced {{because of the}} centrifugal force generated by the higher rotational speed of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> Meanwhile, thermal stress is produced because {{the temperature in the}} edge of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is higher than other regions. The thermal stress will lead to a large tangential compressive stress in the edge of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> with the increase of temperature difference between the edge and center of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> which could cause the buckling deformation of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> reduction of cutting precision and machining quality of the surface, increase of kerf loss and shortening of saw life. The tensioning processes such as hammering, rolling and heating are proposed and applied {{in order to avoid the}} above-mentioned phenomenon. The tangential tensile tensioning stress field is produced during tensioning process in order to compensate the tangential compressive stress, which will improve the stability and quality of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> [1, 2]. Therefore, the tangential tensioning stress distribution after tensioning is the key factor that determines the quality of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  4, the {{tensioning}} stress {{distribution of the}} circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by the FEM model followed the same trend as previous research results [2, 6, 18]. The values of tensioning stress of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by the FEM model and the measured results in radial path of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> were similar in most regions. The results mentioned above demonstrated that the tensioning stress of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by the model in this paper was true and reliable. The tensioning stress distribution of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> after roll tensioning process was the key analysis object in the following.|$|R
50|$|It {{commonly}} {{consists of}} two hydraulic clamping cylinders which clamp the material {{on both sides of}} the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> horizontally, vertically, or angularly. In order to improve the life of the <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> the material is separated from the blade on both sides before the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is retracted from the cut.|$|R
30|$|For {{tangential}} tensioning stress, the tangential tensioning stress {{difference between}} {{outer edge of}} the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> and rolled region was increased with yield strength when circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> was under the same deformation, which meant that the tensioning effect was improved with the increase of yield strength, because the greater tangential tensioning stress difference between edge of the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> and rolled region meant that the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> could maintain stability during large temperature differences when it was at work.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a 2 -D and 3 -D {{finite element}} model of roll {{tensioning}} process of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> were established by Static/General module of ABAQUS software based on finite element method.

The effects of yield strength of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> on tensioning stress distribution and rolling force were studied. The research achievements showed that a circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> made with high yield strength obtained a higher tangential compressive stress and radial compressive stress in the rolled region during roll tensioning process, which has both advantages and disadvantages for {{the stability of the}} <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> Besides, a circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> made with high yield strength also put forward higher requirements for roll tensioning equipment because of the large rolling force during roll tensioning process.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  11, the {{tangential}} tensioning stress distribution of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> after unloading and the measured results in specified radial path of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> {{had the same}} trend and the value was similar in most regions, which proved that the tangential tensioning stress of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by finite element method in this paper was true and reliable. In the edge area of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> the tangential tensioning stress was increased with the ratio of radius, and the feasibility of multi-spot pressure tensioning process was theoretically proved.|$|R
30|$|The multi-spot {{pressure}} tensioning {{process of}} circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> {{was built by}} dynamic/explicit solution module of ABAQUS in this paper.

The linear elastic unloading process of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> with initial stress field calculated by the dynamic/explicit model was established by static/general solution module. The tangential tensioning stress of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> after unloading was finally obtained by the above-mentioned two models. Compared with the experimental results, the simulation result proved to be true and reliable.|$|R

30|$|However, for radial {{tensioning}} stress, the radial tensioning stress {{difference between}} inner {{edge of the}} <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> and rolled region was increased with yield strength when circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> was under the same deformation, which was not conducive to {{the improvement of the}} stability of the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> because the stress state is easy for the blade to lose stability and buckle into a “dish” shape.|$|R

The thesis also examines the impact of the noise on human body and proposes measures designed to reduce noise of the <b>saw</b> <b>blades.</b> In the experimental part of the study we are solving the impact of the speed, the type of gearing, feed speed and type of wood swept noise level and frequency of the disc wheels oscillation...|$|R
30|$|Tensioning is {{the most}} {{important}} and advanced technological process for production of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> for avoiding the above-mentioned phenomenon. Among all the tensioning processes, roll tensioning process is most widely applied in the cutting tool industry. The tangential tensile tensioning stress field is produced which can compensate for the tangential compressive stress caused by thermal stress and improve the stability of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> [3 – 5]. However, circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> can also obtain radial compressive tensioning stress during roll tensioning process which is easy for the blade to lose stability and buckle into a “dish” shape. The thin circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> requires higher tangential tensile tensioning stress and lower radial compressive tensioning stress for maintaining stability, which brings a challenge to roll tensioning process of thin circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|R

Because of this huge range of applications the circular saws have gained great importance in the industry. The rising request to improve the cutting quality, reduce the noise emission and increase the life time requires improvement of the dynamic behavior of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> The roll tensioning of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> has been empirically established {{as a solution to}} improve the static and dynamic properties of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> However, there are several influencing parameters for this process that have not yet been studied scientifically accurate. A scientific and economical solution for the study of various roll tensioning parameters is a simulation model based on finite elements method (FEM) that analyzes the effects on the dynamic behavior of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> A simulation model for roll tensioning of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> was developed in this study.

40|$|Abstract: Surgical site {{infection}} {{is a major}} potential complication of all operative interventions, and the diabetic foot is particularly at risk for bacterial recontamination and infectious sequelae. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify whether the sagittal <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> used during partial foot amputations and diabetic foot debridements carries the potential to serve as a bacterial fomite. We physically cultured the sagittal <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> during 20 foot debridements involving the resection of bone in patients diagnosed with a diabetic foot infection. The culture was taken after the initial debridement and during the irrigation phase of the procedure. We observed 16 positive routine intraoperative culture results, with positive <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> culture results in 15 (93. 8 %; 15 / 16) of these cases. In 14 (93. 3 %; 14 / 15) of these cases, the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> culture grew at least one of the same bacteria as our other routine intraoperative cultures. We observed 4 negative routine intraoperative culture results, with negative <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> culture results in 3 (75. 0 %; 3 / 4) of these cases. This results in agreement between routine intraoperative cultures and <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> culture of 85. 0 % (17 / 20). The results of this investigation demonstrate that the sagittal <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> used for osseous resection during diabetic foot debridements and partial foot amputations carries the potential for intraoperative bacterial transmission. We recommend changing at least the sagittal <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> if more bone is resected following irrigation, particularly if it is used to obtain a “clean margin” for microbiological or histological examination...|$|R

40|$|Material-saving and {{energy-saving}} {{belong to}} the basic requirements imposed on contemporary manufacturing processes. The realization of these processes gives measurable profi ts, not only economical but also ecological. In the case of wood sawing with circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> material and energy-savings are dependent on total overall set of teeth (theoretical kerf) and teeth position accuracy {{in relation to the}} workpiece. Hence, it is necessary to achieve a decrease of both raw material and energy losses by the use of narrow-kerf <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> an increase of sawing accuracy, as well as a reduction of spacing in case of sawing with a gang of circular saws. However, meeting these requirements in the case of rip sawing with circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> is a quite diffi cult issue and depends on many factors. The detailed analyses concerning ways of chip transportation in the kerf slot, <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> stiffness, <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> movement and workpiece feeding accuracy are the proof of these inconvenient technical problems in sawmills.
