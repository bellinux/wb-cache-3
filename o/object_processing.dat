50|$|A {{follow-up}} fMRI {{study by}} Gutchess, Welsh, Boduroglu, and Park (2006) confirmed the previous findings {{by using a}} rather complex stimulus, which consists of only the object pictures, object with background pictures and only the background pictures without the object. This particular study was done on East-Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans. Though the performance of both subject groups was equally good, {{the activity of the}} involved brain areas was significantly different. Non-Asian Americans had a higher activation in the <b>object</b> <b>processing</b> areas in the ventral visual cortex during the object recognition task whereas the East-Asian Americans exhibited higher activity in the left occipital and fusiform areas which are associated with perceptual analysis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Object</b> <b>processing</b> is said {{to occur}} by two processes. There is first a stage of object perception. In this step there is mapping of visual {{description}} from the stimulus {{to a set of}} stored structural descriptions onto a set of structural descriptions of familiar objects. In the second stage, there is object identification. In this step the structural description is mapped onto the semantic representations giving rise to a full specification of the object. Researchers differ in their belief [...] of how perceptual knowledge has an effect. Some believe that the loss of perceptual attributes should always accompany structural similarity. Others observe that perceptual and structural information often accompany each other but they believe that the information can occur independently from each other. Based on patient information it seems that objects belonging to a category with many structurally similar neighbours would be vulnerable to this semantic access impairment.|$|E
5000|$|Much of {{consumer}} research {{is devoted to}} studying the effect of brand associations on consumer preferences and how they manifest into brand memories. Brand memories {{can be defined as}} “everything that exists in the minds of customers with respect to a brand (e.g. thoughts, feelings, experiences, images, perceptions, beliefs and attitudes)”. Several studies have indicated there is not a designated area of the brain devoted to brand recognition. [...] Studies have shown that different areas of the brain are activated when exposed to a brand as opposed to a person, and decisions regarding the evaluation of brands in different product categories activate the area of the brain responsible for semantic <b>object</b> <b>processing</b> rather than areas involved with the judgment of people. [...] These two findings suggest that brands are not processed by the brain {{in the same manner as}} human personalities, indicating that personality theory cannot be used to explain brand preferences.|$|E

30|$|A {{variety of}} options, switches, and modes {{required}} in video bitstream actually {{results in the}} increasing interactions between different video tasks or function-specific IP blocks. Consequently, the functional oriented and fully dedicated architectures will become inefficient, if high levels of the flexibility are not provided in the individual IP modules. To make the architectures remain efficient, the hardware blocks need optimization {{to deal with the}} increasing complexity for visual <b>objects</b> <b>processing.</b> Besides, the hardware must keep flexible enough to manage and allocate various resources, memories, computational video IP accelerators for different encoding tasks. In view of that the programmable solutions will be preferable for video codec applications with programmable and reconfigurable processing cores, the heterogeneous functionality and the algorithms can be executed on the same hardware platform, and upgraded flexibly by software manipulations.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} well known {{examples}} of functional specialization is the fusiform face area (FFA). Justine Sergent {{was one of the}} first researchers that brought forth evidence towards the functional neuroanatomy of face processing. Using positron emission tomography (PET), Sergent found that there were different patterns of activation in response to the two different required tasks, face processing verses <b>object</b> <b>processing.</b> These results can be linked with her studies of brain-damaged patients with lesions in the occipital and temporal lobes. Patients revealed that there was an impairment of face processing but no difficulty recognizing everyday objects, a disorder also known as prosopagnosia. Later research by Nancy Kanwisher using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), found specifically that the region of the inferior temporal cortex, known as the fusiform gyrus, was significantly more active when subjects viewed, recognized and categorized faces in comparison to other regions of the brain. Lesion studies also supported this finding where patients were able to recognize objects but unable to recognize faces. This provided evidence towards domain specificity in the visual system, as Kanwisher acknowledges the Fusiform Face Area as a module in the brain, specifically the extrastriate cortex, that is specialized for face perception.|$|E
50|$|Cultural {{differences}} {{exist in the}} ventral visual cortex and many studies have shown this. In a study conducted in 2005 they found that East Asians {{were more likely to}} keep their eyes focused on background scenes than westerners who would instead focus more on the central object such as a giraffe in a savanna. In a similar 2006 study it showed that in congruence to the difference in society structure westerners showed more activation in <b>object</b> <b>processing</b> regions, including the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, and right superior temporal gyrus, although no activation differences were observed in context-processing regions such as the hippocampus. However, there has been some research contradicting cultural bias in the oculomotor control such as one conducted in 2007 by Rayner, Li, Williams, Cave, and well who failed to find evidence that East Asians focus more on context although they did find evidence that {{they are more likely to}} focus less on central objects. In a different study they focused more on difference in attention towards faces. They proved that Americans focus more broadly on the entire face such as both the eyes and mouth while Asians focus more on a single part, such as the mouth. The authors point out that this happens due to gaze avoidance in east Asian culture as a way of politeness. In 2008, another study focusing on context showed that East Asians were more likely to include greater details and background when taking photographs of a model when they were free to set the zoom function of the camera as they saw fit. In 2003, a group of researchers used the Frame-Line Test and asked the participants to draw a line of either the exact same length as the one showed or one that was proportional in size. Americans were more accurate in the absolute task, suggesting better memory for the exact or absolute size of the focal object, but East Asians were more accurate in the relative (proportional) task, suggesting better memory for contextual relationships. In a later study conducted by the same group they found a pattern within the cultures when processing emotions. East Asians were less likely to know the difference between fear and disgust than Americans when sampling faces.|$|E
