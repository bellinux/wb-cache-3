5|$|Nine years earlier, Tchaikovsky had penned a {{ruthless}} dissection of The Five for Nadezhda von Meck. At that time, his feelings of personal isolation and professional insecurity {{had been at}} their strongest. In the nine intervening years, Mussorgsky and Borodin had both died, Balakirev had banished himself to the musical sidelines, and Cui's critical missives had lost much of their sting for Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov was the only <b>one</b> <b>left</b> who was fully active as a composer, and much had changed {{in the intervening years}} between him and Tchaikovsky as a result of Rimsky-Korsakov's change in musical values. Tchaikovsky had also changed. More secure as a composer and less isolated personally than {{he had been in the}} past, Tchaikovsky enjoyed the company he now kept with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov, and found much to enjoy in their music.|$|E

In December 1918, personnel of No. 207 Squadron RAF erected a new cross {{in place of the}} <b>one</b> <b>left</b> by the Germans. The Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) were working at the time to consolidate the British war graves into fewer cemeteries; 23 British bodies in graves in the location where Ball was buried were moved to the Cabaret Rouge British Cemetery, but at his father's request Ball's grave was allowed to remain. Albert Sr. paid for a private memorial to be erected over Ball's grave, No. 643, in what later became the Annoeullin Communal Cemetery and German Extension. Ball's is the only British grave from the First World War in this extension, the rest being German. Ball's father also bought the French field where his son had died and erected a memorial stone on the crash site.|$|E

When he wakes up, he runs in his pajamas to Professor Oak's laboratory where Ash runs into his rival and the Professor's grandson, Gary Oak. Gary proceeds to taunt Ash for arriving to the ceremony late and brags about having already received his first Pokémon. When Ash enters Professor Oak's lab to receive his Pokémon, he is told that all three starter Pokémon have already been taken. Ash pleads for any Pokémon and Oak replies that he still has <b>one</b> <b>left.</b> Ash does not care and receives the Pokémon, which {{turns out to be the}} electric-type Pokémon Pikachu. Ash thinks that it is cute, but it gives him an electric shock when he picks it up to hug it.

The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when she was the only <b>one</b> <b>left,</b> she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E
