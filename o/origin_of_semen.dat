40|$|The {{earliest}} genetic concepts {{arose from}} the mists of antiquity. In the 6 th century BC the so-called Pre-Socratic Greek philosophers started to postulate concepts {{based on the assumption}} that hereditary factors from mother and father were transferred to the child via the male and female semen (or semen equivalent). The Hippocratic doctors (5 th and 4 th centuries BC) consolidated existing wisdom by way of a complex theory which stated that hereditary factors (sex and general characteristics) transferred via male and female semen, determined the appearance of the child, but only after modifying factors such as volume, consistency and <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen,</b> the elements heat, cold, moistness and dryness, and the position of foetus in the uterus, had played a role. Aristotle (4 th century BC) postulated a very different theory, {{based on the assumption that}} the male was superior to the female, and that his strong semen would determine the hereditary process. Ideally this would lead to the birth of a male child, resembling his father. It was, however, possible that due to factors such as a strongly ‘concocted’ (enriched) female generative substance (menstrual blood, as she had no semen), specific weather conditions, the age of and interaction between parents, as well as the type of water drunk, the male dominance could be qualified, resulting in a sub-ideal child - e. g. a male child with the mother’s characteristics, or even a female child. Subsequent philosophers and physicians including Galen (2 nd century AD), added little new to these two main doctrines, and Roman writers in particular tended to introduce elements of mysticism and superstition. </p...|$|E

In vivo, HIV protein and RNA were also detected primarily in seminal vesicle macrophages in seven of nine HIV-infected donors, some of whom were receiving prolonged suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy.

40|$|Summary. Pilocarpine (50 mg) {{administered}} to the boar 20 min before semen collection had no detectable effect on either ejaculation or semen composition. However, the volume <b>of</b> fluid <b>semen,</b> the total volume <b>of</b> <b>semen,</b> and the time required for ejaculation differed significantly(P< 0 =. 1) between breeds ofboars. Atropine, a parasympathetic-blocking drug, {{has been found to}} reduce the volume <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> with little or no effect on the total number of spermatozoa ejaculated by the boar (Dziuk & Norton, 1962). Differences in composition <b>of</b> the <b>semen</b> from atropine-treated and control boars indicated that atropine suppressed the secretion of the urethral glands (Dziuk & Mann, 1963). In the bull, atropine has been found to reduce both the volume <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> and the number of spermatozoa per ejaculate (Signoret, 1962; Baker, VanDemark & Graves, 1963), whereas pilocarpine, a parasympathetic-stimulating drug, has significantly increased the volume <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> and total spermatozoa per ejaculate (Baker et al., 1963; J.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} aim of {{a breeding}} management programme for captive Asian elephants {{is to establish}} a self-sustaining population, while maintaining maximal genetic diversity. In this respect, artificial insemination (AI) is considered a crucial tool for facilitating the exchange of genetic material between animals housed in different areas and emanating from different founder populations. Moreover, an AI programme can be most effectively implemented if spermatozoa are cryopreserved, since this allows storage of unlimited duration and makes it easier to ensure semen availability when a female is at the appropriate stage of the cycle. At present, two of the major obstacles to more widespread implementation of AI within captive Asian elephant populations are the poor quality <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> collected from many adult bulls, and difficulties in maintaining adequate sperm fertilizing capacity during cooled storage or cryopreservation. In this thesis, the potential contribution of sperm DNA damage to the loss of fertility during the storage of elephant sperm was assessed by developing a dynamic test of sperm DNA stability based around the sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) test. It transpired that Asian elephant spermatozoa are highly susceptible to iatrogenic DNA damage during storage or preservation, probably {{as a result of the}} low cysteine residue content of the P 1 protamine and relatively high contribution of protamine P 2 to the total protamine pool employed in sperm DNA packaging. The susceptibility to DNA damage was emphasized by the demonstration that a semen diluent designed to prevent DNA damage was better for preserving DNA integrity during cooled storage than the diluent used more commonly for storing elephant sperm, when examined using the dynamic test. This suggests that attention to the effects of diluent and storage technique on DNA integrity should be considered important components of selecting and refining semen preservation protocols for Asian elephants; inclusion of additional antioxidants in the diluents may further improve sperm DNA stability during preservation. It was also demonstrated that the quality <b>of</b> fresh <b>semen</b> significantly influences post-thaw quality of Asian elephant spermatozoa. For this reason, the high proportion of fresh ejaculates from Asian elephants that have very poor sperm quality is a major obstacle to attempts to develop semen preservation protocols that can be applied to a large proportion of potential breeding males, and thereby meet the goal of preserving a genetically diverse breeding population. Increasing age, sperm accumulation as a result of infrequent ejaculation, and small size of the ampullae were all associated with poor sperm quality in Asian elephants. In particular, we demonstrated that sperm accumulation may be a significant contributor to poor semen quality in some Asian elephant males, because semen quality could be improved by frequent (alternate day) semen collection. Since it is important to retain as many males from different genetic lines as possible within the breeding pool, further studies to investigate and ameliorate the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> poor <b>semen</b> quality and techniques to maintain the fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa during cooled or frozen storage are considered critical to the viability of the captive Asian elephant population...|$|R
