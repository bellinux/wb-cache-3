40|$|In 1999 the {{digitisation}} of old rainfall {{records of}} measurements at Uccle (Belgium) was completed, {{which resulted in}} a unique rainfall series of 100 years (period 1898 - 1997), This is an ideal opportunity to search for trends in <b>the</b> rainfall <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last <b>century.</b> Large variations in rainfall probability <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> have been observed, For small aggregation levels there is a small decrease in extreme rainfall events <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> For large aggregation levels there is a more explicit increase in extreme rainfall. Because the rainfall on seasonal aggregation level is only slightly increased, the increase in extreme rainfall events for aggregation levels between a few days and a few months can only occur due to larger clustering. However, the final conclusion is that no significant trend can be observed. A pure random variation of the rainfall can cause equally large variations. This does not exclude a possible trend in flooding frequency, due to the strong increase in urbanisation <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last <b>century.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>centuries,</b> {{the variety}} of harmful uses of poisons {{continued}} to increase. The means for curing these poisons also advanced in parallel.

5|$|Though Melanesian {{settlement}} is recorded on Grande Terre's Presqu'île de Foué {{as far back}} as the Lapita culture, the origin of Kanak people is unclear.

5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do {{the great majority of}} Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively about Jesus <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>centuries.</b> Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E
5|$|Ashdod {{is home to}} the Israeli Andalusian Orchestra, which {{performs}} Andalusian classical music. It is an Arabic music {{style that}} originates from Moorish Iberia or Al-Andalus, has been jealously preserved in its original form by Arab and Jewish musicians of the Maghreb <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>centuries,</b> and has left its mark on the cante flamenco, the flamenco singing style, perhaps better known in the West. The orchestra was awarded the Israel Prize in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>centuries</b> to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.|$|E

5|$|Norway's {{architectural}} {{trends are}} also seen to parallel political and societal changes in Norway <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>centuries.</b> Prior to the Viking Age, wooden structures {{developed into a}} sophisticated craft evident in the elegant and effective construction of the Viking longships. Following that, the ascent of Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, cruciform piers supporting vaults, and groin vaults; in large part {{as a result of}} religious influence from England.|$|E

The thatched stone building is rented to a tenant and has limited public access.|$|E

Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E
