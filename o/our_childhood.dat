5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of <b>our</b> <b>childhood</b> in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E

500|$|In adulthood, Chekhov criticised {{his brother}} Alexander's {{treatment}} {{of his wife}} and children by reminding him of Pavel's tyranny: [...] "Let me ask you to recall that it was despotism and lying that ruined your mother's youth. Despotism and lying so mutilated <b>our</b> <b>childhood</b> that it's sickening and frightening to think about it. Remember the horror and disgust we felt in those times when Father threw a tantrum at dinner over too much salt in the soup and called Mother a fool." ...|$|E

500|$|Alec Mapa of The Advocate elaborates: [...] "While {{the rest}} of us were sleeping, Cher's been out there for the last four decades living out every single one of <b>our</b> <b>childhood</b> fantasies... Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to." [...] Rolling Stone Jancee Dunn wrote, [...] "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get {{multiple}} tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us." [...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1949 Marcel Duchamp {{commented on}} Paul Klee: [...] "The first {{reaction}} {{in front of}} a Klee painting is the very pleasant discovery, what everyone of us could or could have done, to try drawing like in <b>our</b> <b>childhood.</b> Most of his compositions show at the first glance a plain, naive expression, found in children's drawings. [...] At a second analyse one can discover a technique, which takes as a basis a large maturity in thinking. A deep understanding of dealing with watercolors to paint a personal method in oil, structured in decorative shapes, let Klee stand out in the contemporary art and make him incomparable. On the other side, his experiment was adopted in the last 30 years by many other artists as a basis for newer creations in the most different areas in painting. His extreme productivity never shows evidence of repetition, as is usually the case. He had so much to say, that a Klee never became an other Klee." ...|$|E
