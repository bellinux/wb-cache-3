40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} {{on the effect of}} sex hormones on thyroid function in infra-human primate species. We have investigated the effect of prolonged oestrogen treatment on thyroid function in adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), and the recovery of the gland after the treatment had ceased. Nineteen adult male rhesus monkeys, weighing 9 =n- 0 kg., were maintained at 75 =+-=deg under uniform conditions. They received <b>oestradiol</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (2 =. mg. in 0 =. ml. sterile olive oil) i. m. twice weekly for 42 days, and thereafter once weekly up to 140 days. Controls were injected with solvent. The monkeys were killed 0, 7 and 60 days after the injections had ceased. A day before killing each animal received a single s. c. injection of propylthiouracil (20 mg.) followed by 20 =m Na 131 I by the same route 1 hr. later. Each thyroid was dissected out and weighed, hydrolysed with 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{disposition}} of oestradiol, oestrone and oestriol is considered together, {{because there is}} interconversion between oestradiol and oestrone in vivo in both humans and other mammals, and the latter is converted to oestriol (Figure 4). Various preparations of oestradiol, such as crystalline oestradiol, micronized oestradiol and esterified oestradiol (e. g. oestradiol valerate, oestradiol 3 -benzoate, <b>oestradiol</b> <b>dipropionate),</b> are used for post-menopausal hormonal therapy. The absorption of these oestradiol preparations differs, while the route of exposure remains the same. For example, crystalline oestradiol applied dermally in a cream diffuses more readily through the skin to the systemic circulation than esterified oestradiol, because oestradiol is more lipophilic than its ester derivative. Similarly, micronized oestradiol is absorbed more rapidly than crystalline oestradiol because of its small particle size. The absorption of these oestradiol preparations also depends on the dose administered and the route of administration. The pharmacokinetics of conjugated equine oestrogens is complicated because so {{many different kinds of}} oestrogens are present, including oestrone sulfate (15 %), equilin sulfate (25 %), dihydroequilin sulfate (15 %) and several other oestrogen sulfates. All o...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of growth hormone on the uterine {{response}} to oestradiol. Ovariectomized rats were treated with a single injection of <b>oestradiol</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (10 =m rat, i. m.), together with a single injection of human growth hormone (0. 04 mg per rat, i. m.). The effects of oestradiol in the uterus were determined by measuring the following: mitotic index; the percentage of cells positive for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (using immunocytochemistry); the DNA content (using Feulgen's method); and the volume of cells, nuclei and nucleoli (using morphometry) in the luminal epithelium, glandular epithelium and stroma of the endometrium 24, 36 and 48 h after injection with oestradiol. All values for all structures were decreased after oestradiol and growth hormone treatment compared with values of rats treated with oestradiol only. However, parameters that reflected proliferative processes (mitotic indices, the number of cells positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and DNA content) were much more reduced than those indicating cell growth (volumes of cells, nuclei and nucleoli). In the absence of oestradiol, administration of growth hormone did not influence the uterine parameters tested. The effect of growth hormone is likely to be brought about by changing the mechanism of oestrogen action on the uterus...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} analysis of mammary {{development in the}} gonadectomized Hooded Norway rat treated with various levels of <b>oestradiol</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (Oe. DP.) from the 20 th to 80 th day of life was carried out. The relative rate of mammary growth in the oestrogen-treated animals was compared with that found in intact and gonadectomized control rats. Over the dose range 0 =. 5 - 1 =. =m. DP. / 2 days a positively allometric mammary-growth phase was induced, but the equilibrium constants obtained for all groups, except the males receiving 1 =. =m. DP., were {{significantly lower than the}} value of 3 =. 0 =+-=. 7 for the intact female. In the majority of oestrogen=req- treated groups no statistically significant differences between the values of =a found, although the approximate time of onset of the artificially-induced allometric phase of growth appeared {{to be related to the}} dose of hormone given. When a dose of Oe. DP. increasing proportionately with the body weight was employed, the resultant rate of mammary growth relative to body growth (=a 3 Ì„=. 0 =+-=. 3) was similar to that found in the intact female. An analysis of the number of ducts and side-buds present in the thoracic glands after various treatments at the end of the 60 -day experimental period was made in the female groups. While duct development at all levels of oestrogen treatment was similar to that found in the intac...|$|E
