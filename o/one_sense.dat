5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In <b>one</b> <b>sense,</b> the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in <b>one</b> <b>sense</b> they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|Waterloo was {{a decisive}} battle {{in more than}} <b>one</b> <b>sense.</b> Every {{generation}} in Europe up to {{the outbreak of the}} First World War looked back at Waterloo as the turning point that dictated the course of subsequent world history. In retrospect, it was seen as the event that ushered in the Concert of Europe, an era characterised by relative peace, material prosperity and technological progress. The battle definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe, and involved many other regions of the world, since the French Revolution of the early 1790s. It also ended the First French Empire and the political and military career of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history.|$|E

25|$|Elena Garro {{was active}} during the mid and latter 20th century, whose {{writings}} {{were said to}} “grab” the reader. Most of her work was autobiographical in <b>one</b> <b>sense</b> or another. She was married to another Mexican writer Octavio Paz, from whom she divorced in 1959.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} system (100) adapted to assess {{performance}} {{of at least}} one physical task. The system includes at least <b>one</b> <b>sensing</b> device (116) configured to output a signal upon activation and an instructing arrangement (112, 114) configured to provide instructions to a subject in relation to performing at least one physical task involving the at least <b>one</b> <b>sensing</b> device. The system further includes a processing device (102) configured to receive data corresponding to signals output by the at least <b>one</b> <b>sensing</b> device. The processing device is further configured to compare the received data with reference data (108) and generate an output based on the comparison representing an assessment of performance of the at least one physical task...|$|R

50|$|Losing <b>one’s</b> <b>sense</b> {{of meaning}} or purpose and {{experiencing}} life as becoming more redundant {{is important to}} the loss of the will to live among the dying which seems to correlate with how one perceives oneself to be seen and their appearance; which can leave people with depressive symptoms. Therefore, sensing that these qualities are no longer valued or appreciated or losing <b>one’s</b> <b>sense</b> of essence/personhood could undermine the will to live.|$|R
25|$|My object {{has been}} to dramatize like the Greeks (a modest phrase!) {{striking}} passages of history, as they did of history & mythology. You will find all this very unlike Shakespeare; and {{so much the better}} in <b>one</b> <b>sense,</b> for I look upon him to be the worst of models, though the most extraordinary of writers.|$|E
25|$|Other writers echoed Alden's lament {{through and}} after the 1880s; the first {{collections}} of shanties appeared in that decade, in <b>one</b> <b>sense</b> {{as a response to}} what the authors believed was a vanishing art. Shanties continued to be used to some extent so long as windjammers were, yet these were comparatively few in the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|His {{views on}} the flora of Colorado and Utah: There are two temperate, and two cold or {{mountain}} floras, viz: 1. a prairie flora derived from the eastward; 2. a so-called desert and saline flora derived from the west; 3. a sub-alpine; 4. an alpine flora, the two latter of widely different origin, and in <b>one</b> <b>sense</b> proper to the Rocky Mountain ranges.|$|E
40|$|Children {{are often}} {{inextricably}} linked to their parents? hopes and dreams. As such, {{the loss of a}} child often represents one of the most traumatic experiences possible. The current research explores how this specific loss relates to <b>one?s</b> <b>sense</b> of purpose in life. We further explore whether the loss of a child is particularly detrimental to <b>one?s</b> <b>sense</b> of purpose for highly interdependent parents. Analyses of parents from the Midlife in the United States data set revealed, as expected, that the loss of child negatively predicts <b>one?s</b> <b>sense</b> of purpose in life, and that this effect is most pronounced for parents high in interdependent self-construal. Potential mechanisms and implications of the present findings are discussed. The open access fee for this work was funded through the Texas A&M University Open Access to Knowledge (OAK) Fund...|$|R

25|$|In <b>one</b> <b>sense,</b> {{associative}} algebra representations generalize both {{representations of}} groups and Lie algebras. A {{representation of a}} group induces a representation of a corresponding group ring or group algebra, while representations of a Lie algebra correspond bijectively to representations of its universal enveloping algebra. However, the representation theory of general associative algebras does not {{have all of the}} nice properties of the representation theory of groups and Lie algebras.|$|E
25|$|As the Manifestations of God are {{believed}} to both possess both a human soul, and to be Manifestations of the eternal logos, each prophet is described by Bahá'u'lláh as in <b>one</b> <b>sense</b> the return of every previous prophet. The concept of return is further extended to the companions of the Manifestations, {{with members of the}} Letters of the Living being regarded as the return of figures such as the Prophet Muhammad, Imam Ali and Fatima.|$|E
25|$|Hot media usually, but not always, provide {{complete}} involvement without considerable stimulus. For example, print occupies visual space, uses visual senses, but can immerse its reader. Hot media favour analytical precision, {{quantitative analysis}} and sequential ordering, {{as they are}} usually sequential, linear and logical. They emphasize <b>one</b> <b>sense</b> (for example, of sight or sound) over the others. For this reason, hot media also include radio, as well as film, the lecture and photography.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} {{can be seen}} {{in making}} the connection with Fourier analysis. The Fourier transform on the real line is in <b>one</b> <b>sense</b> the spectral theory of differentiation qua differential operator. But for that to cover the phenomena one has already to deal with generalized eigenfunctions (for example, by means of a rigged Hilbert space). On the other hand it is simple to construct a group algebra, the spectrum of which captures the Fourier transform's basic properties, and this is carried out by means of Pontryagin duality.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of Illingworth for this match was ironic in <b>one</b> <b>sense.</b> All through the summer, {{there had been}} speculation about which of Cowdrey, Dexter or Sheppard (amateurs all) would lead England in Australia to try and recover The Ashes. In the final Test against Pakistan, they occupied the first three positions in the England batting order. England failed to recover The Ashes on the 1962–63 tour {{and it was not}} until the 1970–71 tour that they finally succeeded, under the leadership of the ultra-professional Ray Illingworth.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole world}} {{is said to be}} filled with living beings. In all the three parts, there is the {{existence}} of very small living beings called nigoda. Nigoda are of two types: nitya-nigoda and Itara-nigoda. Nitya-nigoda are those which will reborn as nigoda throughout eternity where as Itara-nigoda will be reborn as other beings too. The mobile region of universe (Trasandi) is one Rajju wide, one Rajju broad and fourteen Rajju high. Within this, there are animals and plants everywhere where as Human beings are restricted to 2.5 continents of middle world. The beings inhabiting lower world are called Naraki (Hellish beings). Deva (roughly demi-gods) live in whole of the top and middle world and top three realms of lower world. Living beings are divided in fourteen classes (Jivasthana) : 1. fine beings with <b>one</b> <b>sense.</b> 2. Crude beings with <b>one</b> <b>sense.</b> 3. beings with two sense. 4. beings with three sense. 5. Beings with four sense. 6. beings with five sense without mind. 7. beings with five sense with a mind. These can be under-developed or developed which makes it a total of fourteen. Human beings get any form of existence and are the only ones which can attain salvation.|$|E
50|$|Proprioception is the “sense {{of bodily}} position.” It {{includes}} the vestibular <b>sense</b> (i.e., <b>one’s</b> <b>sense</b> of balance) and kinesthetic <b>sense</b> (i.e., <b>one’s</b> awareness of one’s movements).|$|R

25|$|Because {{ethology}} {{is considered}} a topic of biology, ethologists have been concerned particularly with the evolution of behaviour and the understanding of behaviour {{in terms of the}} theory of natural selection. In <b>one</b> <b>sense,</b> the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals influenced many ethologists. He pursued his interest in behaviour by encouraging his protégé George Romanes, who investigated animal learning and intelligence using an anthropomorphic method, anecdotal cognitivism, that did not gain scientific support.|$|E
25|$|Collections of subgroups {{that are}} each maximal in <b>one</b> <b>sense</b> or another {{are common in}} group theory. The {{surprising}} result here {{is that in the}} case of Sylp(G), all members are actually isomorphic to each other and have the largest possible order: if |G| = pnm with n > 0 where p does not divide m, then every Sylow p-subgroup P has order |P| = pn. That is, P is a p-group and gcd(|G : P|, p) = 1. These properties can be exploited to further analyze the structure of G.|$|E
25|$|Public benefit {{corporations}} in New York operate like quasi-private corporations, generally with boards appointed by elected officials. They are {{a form of}} government bureaucracy in <b>one</b> <b>sense</b> but, unlike government agencies, public benefit corporations are exempt from some regulations. Of particular importance, they can take out their own debt, allowing them to bypass legal limits on state debt. This allows them to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments without putting {{so much of the}} credit of New York on the line. However, it also allows them to avoid many of the oversight and reporting regulations that apply to state government.|$|E
