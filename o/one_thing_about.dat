25|$|<b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> {{this club}} {{over the years}} is it has had many personalities, not as famous as those {{mentioned}} above but real personalities in their own right. Unfortunately for the readers' sake {{it is not possible}} to pass on the reasons.|$|E
25|$|I will, however, {{tell you}} just <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the war, my first story and my last. I {{was asked by}} some American friends to search out the grave of their son near Bastogne. I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and I told myself that here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons why you should {{keep your mouth shut}} after the war.|$|E
25|$|Heading {{into the}} 1997–98 season, Linden {{resigned}} his captaincy for Messier, who {{had developed a}} strong reputation as a leader, having captained the New York Rangers over the Canucks in 1994 (he also captained the Oilers to a Stanley Cup in 1990). Linden later recalled regretting the decision, feeling that Messier generated hostility and tension in the dressing room. Messier later said if he could change <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> his time in Vancouver, {{he would not have}} accepted the captaincy.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent survey}} {{conducted}} at the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found that 63% of individuals interested in college football preferred a playoff system to the BCS, while only 26% favored the status quo. President Barack Obama had been vocal about {{his opposition to the}} BCS. During an appearance on Monday Night Football during the 2008 presidential campaign season, ESPN's Chris Berman asked Obama to name <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> sports he would like to change. Obama responded that he did not like using computer rankings to determine bowl games, and he supported having a college football playoffs for the top eight teams. When Steve Kroft asked then-President-elect Obama about the subject during an interview on 60 Minutes, Obama reiterated his support of eight-team playoffs; although he has said it is not a legislative priority.|$|E
500|$|On 6 December 2012, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard {{delivered}} a hoax speech for {{the radio station}} triple J in which she declared [...] "My dear remaining fellow Australians; {{the end of the}} world is coming. Whether the final blow comes from flesh-eating zombies, demonic hell-beasts or from the total triumph of K-Pop, if you know <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> me it is this - I will always fight for you to the very end." [...] Radio announcer Neil Mitchell described the hoax as [...] "immature" [...] and pondered whether it demeaned her office.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were {{completely}} negative; others were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "as far as [...] go, 'Agua Mala' was pretty standard fare." [...] However, he criticized the episodes resolution, noting that Scully should have {{had no way to}} know pure water would kill the creature. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris wrote that, [...] "'Agua Mala' won't end up on anybody's 'best of' list, but it's so silly that it's sort of fun." [...] Timothy Sexton from Yahoo! News named [...] "The Hurricane Monster" [...] as one of [...] "The Best X-Files Monsters of the Week", writing, [...] "I'll tell you <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> this X-Files episode and this X-Files monster: you'll never go to the bathroom during a rainstorm again without thinking twice." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Badlaa" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{inspired}} by stories of Indian fakirs. In fact, the episode's title means [...] "to retort" [...] or [...] "to revenge" [...] in Urdu. Further inspiration came [...] "from {{a little bit of}} desperation" [...] according to Shiban. He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought, [...] "What if someone who {{came up to me and}} asked me for money was actually a bad guy." [...] Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power. He explained, [...] "My original idea was a beggar with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear, and Chris Carter–and this is why he's Chris Carter–said 'No, no, no! I know what's even better.'" [...] Shiban later said that [...] "... <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics also {{questioned}} {{his commitment to}} Canada, pointing out that Ignatieff had lived outside of Canada for more than 30 years and had referred to himself as an American many times. When asked about it by Peter Newman in a Maclean's interview published on April 6, 2006, Ignatieff said: [...] "Sometimes you want to increase your influence over your audience by appropriating their voice, {{but it was a}} mistake. Every single one of the students from 85 countries who took my courses at Harvard knew <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> me: I was that funny Canadian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He can't abuse her, that's <b>one</b> good <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the whelp," [...] thought Bert as he {{crushed the}} young bridegroom's {{hand in his}} brown palm, just to see him cringe.|$|R

50|$|<b>One</b> last <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Mars: {{the surface}} gravity is 90% of that of Earth, when orbital {{calculations}} {{indicate that it}} should be less than half. Published Space: 1889 material never explains the discrepancy.|$|R

I accidentally met a boy who told me about an {{agricultural}} high school Choctaw County Agricultural High School. I went down and within 10 minutes of getting off the train I'd registered. The old superintendent didn't ask me <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> my education. He didn't know if I could read or write. Said {{you look like a}} big stout boy. You look like you'd make a good football player. So I was admitted as a football player. I went to that school for four years [...] reasonably basic preparation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 23, 2012, T.I. held an NYC {{listening}} session, {{during which}} he described {{the inspiration for the}} album: [...] "I've learned that <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> my life that is certain is trouble...Be that as it may, I shall embrace that fact and not evade it. We all have faults. Before I let you stand on your high horse and point a finger back down at me, I'm {{going to give you a}} big, stiff 'Fuck you.'" [...] On Power 105's The Breakfast Club, T.I. hinted that Trouble Man could be his last album, explaining that he wanted to quit rapping, believing that it is not how it once was: ...|$|E
2500|$|Gutta {{has been}} {{listed as the}} most {{inspirational}} sportswomen from India on numerous occasions. Her outspoken nature has often attracted controversies from various groups. According to Gutta, such controversies do not bother her {{as she had been}} taught to speak up for whats right and take a stand for herself and others too. [...] "My father (Kranti) told me at a young age to fight for what I believed in. I've never learnt to butter up people," [...] stated Jwala in an interview with Hindustan Times. [...] "Controversies don't bother me. I'm not the one who instigates them. But when your name gets dragged into it, you can't keep quiet," [...] she said. [...] She said she is targeted because she speaks her mind. S. M. Arif Jwala's coach said, [...] "This girl, she is there with me since she was 4 years old, from that age she is there with me and <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> her is that she is the laziest person as far as the training is concerned {{and as far as the}} court is concerned you keep her for the whole long day and she will be happy, otherwise her genes might be helping her out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well, we'll {{just have}} to plant them over again next spring," [...] said Anne philosophically. [...] "That is <b>one</b> good <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> this world [...] . there are always sure to be more springs." ...|$|R

2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well--There's <b>one</b> nice <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> this job. It gives a girl {{a chance}} to meet some awfully nice gentlemen and improve her mind with conversation, and you get so you can read a guy's {{character}} at the first glance." ...|$|R

50|$|At {{another such}} session, Mr Rucastle told {{a series of}} funny stories that made Miss Hunter laugh until she was quite weary. The <b>one</b> {{astonishing}} <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> this was that Mrs. Rucastle not only did not laugh, but did not even smile.|$|R
