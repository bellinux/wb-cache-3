40|$|Subject {{description}} {{representing the}} contents of library materials {{is one of the}} key processes that support the retrieval of materials. Quality of the latter relies on the quality <b>of</b> the <b>subject</b> description <b>of</b> library materials. If they are represented poorly or inadequately, the quality of the searching will likewise be poor. Inappropriate assignment of indexing terms can lead to unsuccessful retrieval - users cannot find relevant materials. The quality <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> description can be improved by studying numerous factors that could affect it. The author raises a question: Can the quality <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> description be affected by the library management, which is not directly connected to the process <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> description? In the article the connection between the quality <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> description and the management is studied.
