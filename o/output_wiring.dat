50|$|Parasitic {{oscillation}} in an {{amplifier stage}} occurs when {{part of the}} output energy is coupled into the input, with the correct phase and amplitude to provide positive feedback at some frequency. The coupling can occur directly between input and <b>output</b> <b>wiring</b> with stray capacitance or mutual inductance between input and output. In some solid-state or vacuum electron devices there is sufficient internal capacitance to provide a feedback path.

[4] as a novel class of distributed data structures that provide highly-concurrent, low-contention solutions to a varietyofmultiprocessor synchronization problems. A balancing network is constructed from elementary switches with # input <b>wires</b> and # <b>output</b> <b>wires,</b> called (## #) -balancers. A (## #) -balancer accepts {{a stream of}} tokens on its # input wires. The #-th token to enter the balancer leaves on <b>output</b> <b>wire</b> # mod #, where # = 0 # 1 ####.

50|$|Several {{measures}} {{are used to}} prevent parasitic oscillation. Amplifier circuits are laid out so that input and <b>output</b> <b>wiring</b> are not adjacent, preventing capacitive or inductive coupling. A metal shield may be placed over sensitive portions of the circuit. Bypass capacitors may be put at power supply connections, to provide a low-impedance path for AC signals and prevent interstage coupling through the power supply. Where printed circuit boards are used, high- and low-power stages are separated and ground return traces are arranged so that heavy currents don't flow in mutually shared portions of the ground trace. In some cases the problem may only be solved by introduction of another feedback neutralization network, calculated and adjusted to eliminate the negative feedback within the passband of the amplifying device.|$|E

40|$|SummaryRecent {{progress}} {{in understanding the}} diversity of midbrain dopamine neurons has highlighted the importance—and the challenges—of defining mammalian neuronal cell types. Although neurons may be best categorized using inclusive criteria spanning biophysical properties, wiring of inputs, wiring of outputs, and activity during behavior, linking all of these measurements to cell types within the intact brains of living mammals has been difficult. Here, using an array of intact-brain circuit interrogation tools, including CLARITY, COLM, optogenetics, viral tracing, and fiber photometry, we explore the diversity of dopamine neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). We identify two parallel nigrostriatal dopamine neuron subpopulations differing in biophysical properties, input wiring, <b>output</b> <b>wiring</b> to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) versus dorsolateral striatum (DLS), and natural activity patterns during free behavior. Our results reveal independently operating nigrostriatal information streams, with implications for understanding the logic of dopaminergic feedback circuits and the diversity of mammalian neuronal cell types...|$|E

50|$|A {{comparator}} circuit is {{a network of}} wires and gates. Each comparator gate, which is a directed edge connecting two wires, takes its two inputs and outputs them in sorted order (the larger value ending up in the wire the edge is pointing to). The input to any wire can be either a variable, its negation, or a constant. One of the wires is designated as the <b>output</b> <b>wire.</b> The function computed by the circuit is evaluated by initializing the wires according to the input variables, executing the comparator gates in order, and outputting the value carried by the <b>output</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|R

The function {{is viewed as a}} Boolean circuit, with inputs in binary of fixed length. A Boolean circuit is a collection of gates connected with three different types of wires: circuit-input wires, circuit-output wires and intermediate wires. Each gate receives two input wires and it has a single <b>output</b> <b>wire</b> which might be fan-out (i.e. be passed to multiple gates at the next level). Plain evaluation of the circuit is done by evaluating each gate in turn; assuming the gates have been lexicographically ordered. The gate is represented as a truth table such that for each possible pair of bits (those coming from the input wires' gate) the table assigns a unique output bit; which is the value of the <b>output</b> <b>wire</b> of the gate. The results of the evaluation are the bits obtained in the circuit-output wires.|$|R

40|$|This {{assignment}} is an asymptotic analysis of some sorting networks {{in terms of}} time and energy. Here, a sorting network is n input wires of some fixed bit width (assumed to represent integers) that traverses a series of comparators leading to n <b>output</b> <b>wires</b> and any input will be output in sorted order. A comparator is a module of hardware logic of unit area with two input <b>wires</b> and two <b>output</b> <b>wires,</b> where the values input are output in sorted order.

We assume that the values of t and e can vary for each wire and comparator. We look at some existing sorting networks to cast into our definition of a sorting network.

50|$|The {{function}} F {{should be}} {{represented as a}} Boolean circuit on which the key generation algorithm would be applied. The key generation algorithm runs Yao’s garbling procedure over this Boolean circuit to compute the public and secret keys. The public key (PK) is composed of all the ciphertexts that represent the garbled circuit, and the secret key (SK) is composed of all the random wire labels. The generated secret key is then used in the problem generation algorithm. This algorithm first generates {{a new pair of}} public and secret keys for the homomorphic encryption scheme, and then uses these keys with the homomorphic scheme to encrypt the correct input wires, represented as the secret key of the garbled circuit. The produced ciphertexts represent the public encoding of the input (σx) that is given to the worker, while the secret key (τx) is kept private by the client. After that, the worker applies the computation steps of the Yao’s protocol over the ciphertexts generated by the problem generation algorithm. This is done by recursively decrypting the gate ciphertexts until arriving to the final <b>output</b> <b>wire</b> values (σy). The homomorphic properties of the encryption scheme enable the worker to obtain an encryption of the correct <b>output</b> <b>wire.</b> Finally, the worker returns the ciphertexts of the output to the client who decrypts them to compute the actual output y = F(x) or ⊥.|$|R

50|$|Commonly used in {{distributors}} for {{ignition timing}} (and in {{some types of}} crank and camshaft position sensors for injection pulse timing, speed sensing, etc.) the Hall effect sensor {{is used as a}} direct replacement for the mechanical breaker points used in earlier automotive applications. Its use as an ignition timing device in various distributor types is as follows. A stationary permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall effect chip are mounted next to each other separated by an air gap, forming the Hall effect sensor. A metal rotor consisting of windows and tabs is mounted to a shaft and arranged so that during shaft rotation, the windows and tabs pass through the air gap between the permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall chip. This effectively shields and exposes the Hall chip to the permanent magnet's field respective to whether a tab or window is passing though the Hall sensor. For ignition timing purposes, the metal rotor will have a number of equal-sized tabs and windows matching the number of engine cylinders. This produces a uniform square wave output since the on/off (shielding and exposure) time is equal. This signal is used by the engine computer or ECU to control ignition timing. Many automotive Hall effect sensors have a built-in internal NPN transistor with an open collector and grounded emitter, meaning that rather than a voltage being produced at the Hall sensor signal <b>output</b> <b>wire,</b> the transistor is turned on providing a circuit to ground through the signal <b>output</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|R
