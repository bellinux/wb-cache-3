5|$|Like {{many old}} buildings, Ordsall Hall has stories of hauntings. The White Lady who {{is said to}} appear in the Great Hall or Star Chamber is popularly {{believed}} to be Margaret Radclyffe, who died <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> heart in 1599 following the death at sea of her twin, Alexander. There are webcams overseeing the areas that are said to be the most haunted. An episode of the television programme Most Haunted was filmed in the hall in 2005.|$|E

In 1950, the Canadian Press named him the best ice hockey player {{of the first half of}} the 20thcentury, and in 2017 the NHL included him on their list of the 100 greatest players in league history.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 2012, the Land Transport Authority {{carried out}} a ground {{deployment}} exercise with SMRT to test their incident management plans {{in the event of}} a train service disruption. In total, about 135 personnel including representatives from the Singapore Police Force's Transport Command (TransCom) and SBS Transit participated in the exercise. Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise. Codenamed 'Exercise Greyhound', the exercise went through the scenario <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> rail on the East West Line at Buona Vista. SMRT had also activated their Rail Incident Management Plan.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1815, Bute had his Glamorgan estates fully surveyed, which {{highlighted}} that the estates had been neglected {{for many years}} and were now in a poor condition. Edward Richards became the senior official in charge of the estates by 1824 and represented Bute on both estate and political affairs across the region. Despite this, Bute retained the final authority over even quite minor issues on the estates, including making decisions on the buttons to be used on local school uniforms or the reuse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> flag pole, for example, which could result in considerable delays as letters were sent between South Wales and Scotland. As the complexity of the Glamorgan estates grew, more officials were appointed to help manage the docks, farms and mineral interests, but these all reported separately to Bute, putting increasing pressure on the marquess.|$|E

5|$|Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit {{in front}} of a warm fire, {{continuing}} from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> heart. The narrator explains that Hal {{went on to become a}} good and noble king.|$|E
5|$|Ged flies back to Ogion on Gont, who crafts a new {{staff for}} him. Contrary to Gensher, Ogion insists that all {{creature}}s have a name, and advises Ged {{to confront the}} shadow creature. Ged pursues the creature in a small sailboat, until it lures him into a fog and wrecks the boat on a reef. Ged recovers {{with the help of}} an elderly couple marooned on the island, who give Ged part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> bracelet as a gift. Ged patches his boat and escapes the island, pursuing the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him. They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Here Ged realizes that the shadow has always been a part of his own spirit. Naming it with his own name, he merges with the shadow creature, understanding and accepting it as part of himself, and thus healing himself.|$|E
5|$|General Eusebio Canales (alias Chamarrita or Prince of Arms) {{is forced}} into exile after {{being accused of}} the murder of Colonel José Parrales Sonriente. He appears to be {{organizing}} a guerrilla attack on the President, but dies <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> heart after reading a false news report detailing his daughter's wedding to Miguel Angel Face, at which the President was apparently present. The character of the General comes into clearer focus while he is on the road to exile. Canales's road to exile also introduces readers to the desperate financial situation of three sisters who are being taken advantage of by a doctor who visited their ailing mother. This episode demonstrates that corruption and malice exist not just in the capital city but also in rural villages.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} stage, the riders fell {{after only a}} few kilometres. Lipman broke a finger, and became the first rider to abandon this Tour. Around 100km in the race, Lucien Pothier lost ten minutes to the main group, led by Maurice Garin, because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> bicycle. In Cosne, at 174km, Pothier had reached the leading group. Aucouturier had lost more than one hour at that point. Just before the next control post in Nevers, Aucouturier fell on his face, and {{continued}} the race covered in blood. In {{the last part of the}} race, Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier rode away from the others. They were attacked by four masked men in a car, but still finished as the first two, with Garin beating Pothier by 50m. The many flat tires and crashes of Aucouturier, seemingly the results of sabotage, gave him a time loss of several hours.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{the loss of}} Franklin's {{expedition}} inspired a number of paintings in both the United States and Britain. In 1861, Frederic Edwin Church unveiled his great canvas The Icebergs; later that year, prior to taking it to England for exhibition, he added an image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> ship's mast in silent tribute to Franklin. In 1864, Sir Edwin Landseer's Man Proposes, God Disposes caused a stir at the annual Royal Academy exhibition; its depiction of two polar bears, one chewing on a tattered ship's ensign, the other gnawing on a human ribcage, was seen {{at the time as}} in poor taste, but has remained {{one of the most powerful}} imaginings of the expedition's final fate. The expedition also inspired numerous popular engravings and illustrations, along with many panoramas, dioramas, and magic lantern shows.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations {{to see how the}} cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen. Magnussen, Ricciardo, Button and Daniil Kvyat rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> exhaust valve, and Merhi spun at turn 13 (causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him).|$|E

Ruler3 is depicted on the 8th-century AltarQ, but his name glyph has broken away. KuIx was the 4thruler in the succession. He rebuilt temple 10L-26 in the Acropolis, erecting a stela there and a hieroglyphic step at its base. Although this king is also mentioned on a few other fragments of sculpture, no dates accompany his name. The next two kings in the dynastic sequence are only known from their sculptures on AltarQ.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that {{people will want to}} take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out that the purpose of the computer was not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, at {{the request}} of the England Rugby Board (known as the Rugby Football Union), Bedell-Sivright was {{selected}} to lead a British Lions team on a tour of Australia and New Zealand. He only played in one Test, against Australia, because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> leg, but the team did go undefeated in Australiawinning all their matches there, and the three Test matches 17–0, 17–3 and 16–0. A notable incident on the Australian leg of the tour was a dispute between the British side and one of the Australian referees. The refereeHugh Dolan had ordered off British Isles player Denys Dobson after claiming Dobson had directed a personal insult at him. Bedell-Sivright was not playing, but pulled his team from the field for 20 minutes while disputing the decision with Dolan and the other officials. Eventually the British side returned to play, but without Dobson. Following the match Bedell-Sivright accused the referee of incompetence, and an inquiry eventually cleared Dobson of using indecent language, but he became the first British Isles player ever ordered off.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of Bangladesh's opening bowler, Mortaza, Australia opened the innings with Andrew Symonds and Michael Bevan— giving the usual middle-order batsmen time at the crease. The Symonds {{experiment}} did not last long, as he was dismissed by Hasibul Hossain for seven. Martyn joined Bevan at the crease and quickly put the bowlers on the back foot with aggressive batting. Despite returning in the series {{for the first time}} since the 2003 Cricket World Cup because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> finger, he scored Australia's second fastest ODI half-century22 ballsand was on track to overtake Gilchrist's and Allan Border's record for the fastest Australian ODI century; 78 deliveries. Together they added 131 runs from 91 balls, seeing Australia home by nine wickets. Named man of the match, Martyn finished with 92 from 51 balls, dominating the partnership with Bevan, who scored 40 from 62 balls. Martyn was especially severe on Bangladeshi captain Khaled Mahmud, hitting three fours and a six from successive balls in Mahmud's second over. The captain finished with the unflattering figures of 0/34 from three overs.|$|E
5|$|Professor Ellis (Rudolf Martin), a {{lecturer}} {{of the dead}} woman, gives a eulogy at her funeral. Chloe, {{a friend of the}} dead woman, attacks Ellis and slashes his neck, whose blood Mick recognizes as the blood in the vial. Beth tracks down Chloe, who explains that the professor has a vampire-worshipping blood cult, and he believes that he is a vampire. Later, Mick finds Chloe's dead body, who was murdered by Ellis. Knowing that Beth has gone to Ellis's class, he rushes to save her. After the class, Beth talks to Ellis about vampires and the young woman's murder, but he discovers that she is wearing a wire. Ellis attacks Beth and although she escapes, she is kidnapped by the professor's teaching assistant. Mick tracks down the assistant, defeats him, and takes an unconscious Beth to his apartment. In flashbacks to 22years in the past, Mick investigates the case of a missing girl. In a domestic fight between Mick and his ex-wife Coraline over the kidnapped girl, Mick stabs Coraline's heart with the leg <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> chair. He lights the house on fire and rescues the girl, leaving Coraline to the fire. It is revealed that the little girl has grown up to be Beth, and that Mick has tried to watch over her and keep her safe over the years. In the present, Beth wakes up and remembers that Mick was stabbed by the assistant, and that {{he was the one who}} saved her as a child. Mick dismisses the claims as being caused by her head injury. Thanking him for saving her, she hugs him.|$|E
5|$|While {{this style}} {{facilitated}} his solid defensive play, it inhibited {{him as a}} stroke player and made him susceptible to hand and arm injuries. Such injuries would be common throughout his career. One such injury almost required the tip <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> finger to be amputated. He was occasionally vulnerable to left-arm bowlers, either due to his inability to adjust his line of stroke or because during his career there were few fast left-hand bowlers for him to practise against in the nets. Boycott himself disputes this. In spite of that, he was never vulnerable to any one particular bowler. Pace bowler Dennis Lillee was the most successful against him in Test matches, with seven dismissals. Gary Sobers also dismissed him seven times, but Lillee did so in fewer matches. Peter Lever, a Test colleague, discussed with Boycott his vulnerability when playing the hook stroke, which was {{to get him out}} on more than one occasion. Overall in Test cricket, 54% of Boycott's dismissals were by being caught, with lbw and bowled taking 14% and 16% respectively. Boycott was an occasional medium-pace inswing bowler. He was never a genuine all-rounder, but took seven wickets at Test level at an average of 54.57, often bowling wearing his cap turned back-to-front to assist his vision.|$|E
