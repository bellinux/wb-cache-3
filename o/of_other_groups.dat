Rats and mice have followed man around the globe, pigeons, peregrines, sparrows, swallows and house martins use the buildings for nesting, bats use roof space for roosting, foxes visit the garbage bins and squirrels, coyotes, raccoons and skunks roam the streets. About 2,000 coyotes are thought to live in and around Chicago. A survey of dwelling houses in northern European cities {{in the twentieth century}} found about 175 species of invertebrate inside them, including 53 species of beetle, 21 flies, 13 butterflies and moths, 13 mites, 9 lice, 7 bees, 5 wasps, 5 cockroaches, 5 spiders, 4 ants and a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>groups.</b> In warmer climates, termites are serious pests in the urban habitat; 183 species are known to affect buildings and 83 species cause serious structural damage.|$|E

The Times and Forbes noted that Scientologist computers were used to remove links between the Church of Scientology and a former anti-cult organization, since taken over by Scientology, the Cult Awareness Network. Der Spiegel reported that Wikiscanner revealed Scientology computers were used to promote Scientology's critical view of psychiatry, including adding links to the Scientology-founded Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) and to websites <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>groups</b> affiliated with Scientology.|$|E

Soon after, a plot of land was purchased at Fort Drummond, approximately two kilometres south of the Wollongong central business district, for the station's television studios.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to examine}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members on the travel {{experiences}} of Chinese tourists participating in domestic package tours. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the critical incident technique, usable responses were obtained from 253 tourists regarding the influence <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members on their travel experiences in the same group package tour (GPT). Findings: The {{results show that the}} travel experiences of Chinese tourists on a domestic package tour are affected by three general factors, namely, appearance, behaviors, and language <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members. Research limitations/implications: This research mainly involves samples of young tourists. The findings {{may not be able to}} generalize to elderly tourists. Future studies may involve samples from various age cohorts. Practical implications: The findings offer new insights and directions for GPT operators and tour guides to improve tourism management and tourist experiences. Social implications: This study contributes to tourism literature about customer-to-customer interaction by identifying the major categories <b>of</b> <b>other</b> customers’ characteristics or behaviors that may positively or negatively influence a GPT tourist’s travel experience. Originality/value: This study enriches the existing literature by investigating the attributes <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members that may affect the travel experiences of a domestic GPT participant. Tourism firms can formulate better strategies and staff training to enhance tourists’ travel experiences...|$|R
40|$|Although {{research}} on public service motivation (PSM) is vast, {{there is little}} evidence regarding the effects of PSM on observable behavior. This article contributes {{to our understanding of the}} behavioral implications of PSM by investigating whether PSM is associated with prosocial behavior. Moreover, we address if and how the behavior <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members influences this relationship. The study uses the (pseudo-) experimental setting of the public goods game (the experimental part), run with a sample of 263 students, in combination with survey-based PSM measures (the non-experimental element). We find a positive link between PSM and prosocial behavior. Moreover, we reveal that this relationship is moderated by the behavior <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members: High PSM people act even more prosocially when the <b>other</b> members <b>of</b> the <b>group</b> show prosocial behavior as well, but they do not do so if the behavior <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members is not prosocial...|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of teleost species {{belong to the}} clade Euteleostei, which consists of 17,419 species classified in 2,935 genera and 346 families. Shared traits of the euteleosts include similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and dorsal fin (supraneural bones), an outgrowth on the stegural bone (a bone located near the neural arches of the tail) and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base. The {{majority of}} euteleosts are in the clade Neoteleosti. A derived trait of neoteleosts is a muscle that controls the pharyngeal jaws, giving them a role in grinding food. Within neoteleosts, the Acanthopterygii have a spiny dorsal fin which {{is in front of}} the soft-rayed dorsal fin. This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may also play a role in defense. Acanthomorphs have developed spiny ctenoid scales (as opposed to the cycloid scales <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>groups),</b> tooth-bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming.|$|E
5|$|While Saladin was in Syria, {{his brother}} al-Adil governed Egypt, and in 1174–75, Kanz al-Dawla of Aswan revolted against the Ayyubids with the {{intention}} of restoring Fatimid rule. His main backers were the local Bedouin tribes and the Nubians, but he also enjoyed the support of a multitude <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>groups,</b> including the Armenians. Coincidental or possibly in coordination, was an uprising by Abbas ibn Shadi who overran Qus along the Nile River in central Egypt. Both rebellions were crushed by al-Adil. For the rest of that year and throughout early 1176, Qaraqush continued his raids in western North Africa, bringing the Ayyubids into conflict with the Almohads who ruled the Maghreb.|$|E

When perceivers formed relatively neutral impressions <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>group</b> members, however, higher diversity predicted less individuation of targets.
