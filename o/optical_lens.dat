In each case he sandblasted and cut the optical disc, draping, and in one case piercing, the disc with fluid, cased glass forms. These were followed, in 1978, by Littleton’s Solid Geometry series, in which heavy cased glass forms were cut into trapezoidal, spheroid and ovoid shapes and highly polished.|$|E

25|$|As a result, {{development}} of Fat Man was given high priority. Chemical explosives {{were used to}} implode a sub-critical sphere of plutonium, thus increasing its density and making it into a critical mass. The difficulties with implosion centered {{on the problem of}} making the chemical explosives deliver a perfectly uniform shock wave upon the plutonium sphere— if it were even slightly asymmetric, the weapon would fizzle. This problem was solved by the use of explosive lenses which would focus the blast waves inside the imploding sphere, akin {{to the way in which}} an <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> focuses light rays.|$|E

It deals with the production of <b>optical</b> <b>lenses</b> and their practical use. It describes types of optical blemishes that exist in real optical systems. Particular attention is given to parameters of <b>optical</b> <b>lenses</b> and their measurement in practice. It includes a Matlab program to calculate parameters of <b>optical</b> <b>lenses</b> derived from the measurements...|$|R

25|$|Electron lenses are {{designed}} {{to act in a}} manner emulating that of an <b>optical</b> <b>lens,</b> by focusing parallel electrons at some constant focal distance. Electron lenses may operate electrostatically or magnetically. The majority of electron lenses for TEM use electromagnetic coils to generate a convex lens. The field produced for the lens must be radially symmetrical, as deviation from the radial symmetry of the magnetic lens causes aberrations such as astigmatism, and worsens spherical and chromatic aberration. Electron lenses are manufactured from iron, iron-cobalt or nickel cobalt alloys, such as permalloy. These are selected for their magnetic properties, such as magnetic saturation, hysteresis and permeability.|$|E
500|$|The bomb bay {{accommodated}} four bomb racks, the No. 5 for SC50 {{bombs and}} two ETC 500 racks to carry heavier loads {{of up to}} [...] each. A Lotfe A, or B bombsight was issued together with the BZA-2 aperture (a modernised <b>optical</b> <b>lens</b> system). The aircraft's bomb bay allowed two options. The first was to carry four 250kg (550lb) bombs for a load of 1000kg (2,200lb), which reduced aircraft range. With half the maximum load, ten 50kg (110lb) bombs, additional fuel tanks could be placed into the forward part of the bomb bay to increase range. The bomb aimer would deploy the bomb load via the Lotfe (A, B or C 7/A, depending on the variant) bomb sight {{which was in the}} left side of the nose compartment directly under and forward of the pilot. When fully loaded, the Z-1 weighed 7,740kg (17,200lb).|$|E

40|$|Most of <b>optical</b> {{gravitational}} <b>lenses</b> {{recently discovered}} in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Lens Search (SQLS) have two-images rather than four images, {{in marked contrast to}} radio lenses for which the fraction of four-image lenses (quad fraction) is quite high. We revisit the quad fraction among <b>optical</b> <b>lenses</b> by taking the selection function of the SQLS into account. We find that the current observed quad fraction in the SQLS is indeed lower than, but consistent with, the prediction of our theoretical model. The low quad fraction among <b>optical</b> <b>lenses,</b> together with the high quad fraction among radio lenses, implies that the quasar optical luminosity function has a relatively shallow faint end slope...|$|R

50|$|William Taylor was {{convinced}} {{that to be a}} leader in <b>optical</b> <b>lenses,</b> he needed to have the best understanding and control of the surface quality of his lenses.

After other manufacturers in various domains became aware of this, they requested to purchase these instruments. He refused, as the invented instruments were crucial to Taylor Hobson's <b>optical</b> <b>lenses</b> supremacy.
