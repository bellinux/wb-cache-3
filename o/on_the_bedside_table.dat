25|$|On 29 January 1889, Franz Joseph and Elisabeth gave {{a family}} dinner party prior to leaving for Buda, in Hungary, on 31 January; Rudolf excused himself, {{claiming}} to be indisposed. He had arranged for a day's shooting at Mayerling early {{on the morning of}} the 30th, but when his valet Loschek went to call him, there was no answer. Count Joseph Hoyos, the Archduke's hunting companion, joined in, with no response. They tried to force the door, but it would not give. Finally Loschek smashed in a panel with an axe to find the room shuttered and half-dark. Rudolf was found sitting (by some accounts, lying) motionless by the side of the bed, leaning forward and bleeding from the mouth. Before him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table</b> stood a glass and a mirror. Without closer examination in the poor light, Loschek assumed that the crown prince had drunk poison from the glass, since he knew strychnine caused bleeding. On the bed lay the body of Mary Vetsera, white, ice-cold, and already quite rigid. The mistaken impression that poison was involved, and even that the baroness had poisoned the crown prince and then killed herself, would persist for some time.|$|E

5000|$|Eight {{months after}} the events of Secret Wars, Mysterio attacks Parker Industries with the {{intention}} of using the company's Webware technology to cause mass hysteria by beaming imagery directly into the minds of the product's users. The plot is thwarted by Deadpool, who runs Mysterio over with his [...] "Dead-Buggy". While recovering in the hospital, Beck is visited by an unknown figure, who leaves a Mysterio bust <b>on</b> <b>the</b> supervillain's <b>bedside</b> <b>table</b> while declaring that he is [...] "not out of the game yet". After Deadpool is manipulated into killing Spider-Man, Mysterio tortures the hero's Limbo-bound soul by projecting his own spirit into the realm using power provided by a mysterious benefactor. Deadpool is able to enter Limbo and help Spider-Man overpower Mysterio, who is afterward shown to have disappeared from his hospital bed.|$|R
5|$|In the Soviet times, mental {{hospitals}} were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, {{a human rights}} activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who {{have been living in}} a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> windows, no <b>bedside</b> <b>tables,</b> often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|R
6000|$|The {{doctor had}} found it left in the body--had {{withdrawn}} it to probe the wound--and had laid it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table.</b> It {{was one of those}} useful knives which contain a saw, a corkscrew, and other like implements. The big blade fastened back, when open, with a spring. Except where the blood was on it, it was as bright as when it had been purchased. A small metal plate was fastened to the horn handle, containing an inscription, only partly engraved, which ran thus: [...] "To John Zebedee, from--" [...] There it stopped, strangely enough.|$|E

50|$|The {{show was}} set in a story book resting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table,</b> and in later series with a child holding it, of a {{playroom}} during the night, whilst the child was asleep. The room also includes an element of Dream Street within it - the teddy bear clock. In later series, the title sequence revealed more of the things within the room, such as model Saturn bedposts.|$|E
50|$|Photographs {{and recipes}} {{are ways to}} track a player's success in the game. In {{addition}} to being collector's items, photographs and recipes are used as guides when the farm is rated during the third year. When the player reaches a certain milestone or achieves a certain goal—winning a festival or getting married for example—he will receive a photograph to remember the event. Earned photographs are available for viewing at any time by checking the photo album <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table.</b> If a character has become good enough friends with the player, he will give the player a recipe {{in exchange for a}} certain crop. As the player becomes friends with more townspeople, he will receive more and more recipes.|$|E

50|$|When Darren {{arranged}} a poker game with Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) in the loft, Jessica came with him. The stakes got very high and Darren offered Warren his half of The Dog in The Pond - he promptly lost it to Warren. A {{couple of days}} later whilst walking through the village, Darren and Jessica followed a drunk Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee) home, so Darren can confront Warren. They walk in to find Louise passed out on the bed. Jessica and Darren see Evissa's takings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table</b> and decide to steal the money. The following day, Jessica and Darren went to the casino with Evissa's takings and won £200,000. Jessica asked Darren what they would spend their money on, and Darren revealed that he was going use the money to buy The Dog in The Pond back from Warren. He also revealed that he planned to get back together with Zoe, much to the shock of Jessica. On New Year's Eve, Darren and Warren had a showdown and when Warren asked for the money on the stroke of midnight, Darren was shocked to discover that all of his money was gone. As Darren frantically searched for the money, Jessica departed Hollyoaks village for good - £200,000 richer.|$|E
5000|$|In the room, Wes {{picks up}} a note <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table</b> that says, [...] "I {{know what you did}} last album," [...] {{referencing}} I Know What You Did Last Summer. Then one of the girls decides to take a shower. The silhouette of a man is seen through the shower curtain with a knife, he opens the curtain to the shower, with the girl proceeding to scream, mimicking the famous shower scene from the movie Psycho. It is then shown that it {{is just one of the}} jocks with a banana, playing a prank on the girl. Wes and the jock (played by Doug Ardito) laugh, and throw a banana peel into the shower. The girl does not see it, and slips on it, banging her head against the wall and killing her in the process. The group seeing this, flees the room, except for one who is shown being sucked into a static television, parodying Poltergeist. Wes and his girlfriend run in a different direction than the others, but both groups make their way towards the famous Bates house. An imitation of Kanye West is seen outside the house banging on the window in an angry fashion. The group of remaining jocks and cheerleaders climb the stairs to the house featured in Blink-182's video for I Miss You, but are met by a girl portraying Paris Hilton at the top, who kicks them down the stairs. Wes and his girlfriend enter the Bates house, only to see an old woman sitting in a chair. The woman is revealed to be Wes himself, dressed up as an old lady, again referencing the ending to Psycho. Wes is then shown realizing [...] "I'm the one who is/the schizophrenic psycho." ...|$|E

[...] The Large editions contained all the tales collected to date, extensive annotations, and scholarly notes written by the brothers; the Small editions had only 50 tales and were intended for children. Jacob and Wilhelm's younger brother Emil Grimm illustrated the Small editions, adding Christian symbolism to the drawings, such as depicting Cinderella's mother as an angel, and adding a Bible to <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table</b> of Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to motorcycling advertising that emphasized rebellion or exaggerated masculinity, a 1989 30-second introductory television commercial for the PC800 depicted a couple awakening at a stylish waterfront home.

It {{is the beginning of}} a new day." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{often work}} on my laptop in bed. When needed, I park the laptop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table,</b> where the {{computer}} has to share the small available space with a lamp, books, notes, and heaven knows what else. It often gets quite squeezy. Being regularly faced with this tricky situation, it finally {{occurred to me to}} determine once and for all how to place the laptop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table</b> so that its ``footprint'' - the area in which it touches the bedside table - is minimal. In this note I give the solution of this problem, using some very pretty and elementary mathematics. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
5000|$|A {{table is}} {{an item of}} {{furniture}} with a flat top and one or more legs, used as a surface for working at, eating from or on which to place things. Some common types of table are the dining room table, which is used for seated persons to eat meals; the coffee table, which is a low table used in living rooms to display items or serve refreshments; and <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table,</b> {{which is used to}} place an alarm clock and a lamp. There are also a range of specialized types of tables, such as drafting tables, used for doing architectural drawings, and sewing tables.|$|R

50|$|I {{realised}} that I {{should have}} to try to outsmart him and I devised my own investigation system. The first thing was to make sure I always stayed at the same hotel for a race, and to have the room next to his so I could mount a surveillance. I would watch him leave with his mates, then I would tiptoe into the room which ten seconds earlier had been his headquarters. I would rush to the waste bin and <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table,</b> go through <b>the</b> bottles, flasks, phials, tubes, cartons, boxes, suppositories - I swept up everything. I had become so expert in interpreting all these pharmaceuticals that I could predict how Fausto would behave {{during the course of the}} stage. I would work out, according to the traces of the product I found, how and when he would attack me.|$|R

50|$|Both slatted or fully {{flexible}} bases can {{consist of}} four joints (back/stable/leg/foot) or 5 joints (neck/back/stable/leg/foot), usually operated by twin drive motors that operate {{the back and}} leg joint, {{and the movement of}} the neck and foot joint is semi automatic (sometimes there are motors with three actuators - also for the neck, and even with four - one for every joint). Another structural difference is the sliding back mechanism (sometimes called wall hugger or wall climber) which allows to minimise the gap with the back wall when the bed is uplifted, keeps <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table</b> within reach, and enables the partners using the bed (if split) to keep eye contact at all times. In the 90's the sliding back mechanism was found only in the elite luxury products but it is becoming more common with the popular models, even with those that use slatted bases.|$|R
5000|$|His {{body was}} {{discovered}} {{the day after he}} had checked in, despite an initial report stating that it had taken more than one day to find him. He had used his belt to hang himself inside of a closet. The belt was secured by the bar used to hang clothes on. He had left money to pay for the night and a note reading, simply, [...] "suicide." [...] Upon the discovery of the body, it was noted that the man had closed the blinds in the room and lined the closet in which he hanged himself with pillows. He had left a note at <b>the</b> <b>bedside</b> <b>table</b> that contained $160 in $20 bills with the words [...] "for the room." [...] It has been speculated that he may have committed suicide due to depression, or to quicken the pace of a fatal disease, although there were no signs of one.|$|R

50|$|Søltoft {{began his}} film {{career with the}} role of Jacob in 1962's Den kære familie, a film about turn of the century Copenhagen. After a few small roles, the {{breakthrough}} of Erik Soya's Sytten in 1965 began a wave of erotic films for Søltoft. In Den røde rubin, Søltoft starred as Ask Burlefot, who goes from shy schoolboy to sexually experienced. He went on to star in numerous films of the 1970s, mainly sex comedies and erotic comedies - roles that have always put him pigeonholed by the audience and the press. He usually played a confused little man who had to fight his way through a sea of sexy girls. He starred in the successful, decade-long series of Bedside-films, including Mazurka på sengekanten (Mazurka <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside),</b> Tandlæge på sengekanten (Dentist <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside)</b> and Rektor på sengekanten (Rector <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedside).</b> Søltoft also played in several of Zodiac-films, where Zodiac signs were part of the film's title; for example, I Løvens tegn (In Leo), I Jomfruens tegn (In Virgo), and I Tyrens tegn (In Taurus). He retired from film in 1978.|$|R
