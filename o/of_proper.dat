The investigating commission also found lack <b>of</b> <b>proper</b> pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E

The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year.
