[...] The matches were also popular amongst British viewers – a league game between the two in April 2003 was watched by 3.4million viewers in Britain, making it the top-rated programme on multi-channel television for that week. Sky Sports football summariser Andy Gray said of the encounters: [...] "In some ways it's maybe not surprising that <b>our</b> <b>major</b> clashes have been with United and Arsenal.

Jennings stated in a 1996 interview that he was satisfied that ABC came in third in terms of O.J. coverage.

500|$|Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes each named a Socratic {{dialogue}} after Aspasia (though neither survives {{except in}} fragments). <b>Our</b> <b>major</b> sources for Aeschines Socraticus' Aspasia are Athenaeus, Plutarch, and Cicero. In the dialogue, Socrates recommends that Callias send his son Hipponicus to Aspasia for instructions. When Callias recoils {{at the notion}} of a female teacher, Socrates notes that Aspasia had favorably influenced Pericles and, after his death, Lysicles. In a section of the dialogue, preserved in Latin by Cicero, Aspasia figures as a [...] "female Socrates", counseling first Xenophon's wife and then Xenophon himself (the Xenophon in question is not the famous historian) about acquiring virtue through self-knowledge. Aeschines presents Aspasia as a teacher and inspirer of excellence, connecting these virtues with her status as hetaira. According to Kahn, every single episode in Aeschines' Aspasia is not only fictitious but incredible.|$|E

Our main concern is the liberation of the blacks." [...] Elsewhere, Biko argued that it was the responsibility of a vanguard movement to ensure that, in a post-apartheid society, the black majority would not seek vengeance upon the white minority. He stated that this would require an education of the black population in order to teach them how to live in a non-racial society.|$|E

In a column written before the book's publication, Hitchens also explored themes contained in The Broken Compass, and wrote [...] "The cold, miserable truth is that both <b>our</b> <b>major</b> political parties are corpses, their original purposes long forgotten, their loyal members driven away or sidelined, and their traditional voters taken for granted".|$|E
2500|$|It {{seems to}} me that we are {{concerned}} in this case not with [...] "the complexity of the tax laws," [...] ante, at 200, but with the income tax law in its most elementary and basic aspect: Is a wage earner a taxpayer and are wages income? [...] t is incomprehensible to me how, in this day, more than 70 years after the institution of our present federal income tax system with the passage of the Revenue Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 166, any taxpayer of competent mentality can assert as his defense to charges of statutory willfulness the proposition that the wage he receives for his labor is not income, irrespective of a cult that says otherwise and advises the gullible to resist income tax collections.

2500|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, Crowell-Collier had {{recovered}} financially.

Book sales had surged for reference books, textbooks, and encyclopedias and {{like many of the}} large publishers of that era such as Random House and Simon & Schuster, Crowell-Collier embarked on a merger and acquisitions spree. Crowell-Collier kicked off the decade by merging with the American Macmillan company and moved into the educational space. This was then followed by a number of mergers and acquisitions. On the move into education, Chairman Raymond C. Hagel said, [...] "We envision <b>our</b> <b>major</b> role as that of a developer of complete educational systems." [...] He explained that an educational system was a [...] "unified instructional package involving a variety of tools." [...] and that [...] "the business of education has become a successor to the defense industry. It is a security lifeline." [...] Crowell would end the decade as Crowell Collier & Macmillan, a large conglomeration of subsidiaries that included books, schools, magazines, educational tools, bookstores, book clubs and radio stations and with an annual revenue of $390 million.|$|E
2500|$|Depending {{on whether}} or not Mathgamain and Máel Muad were {{successful}} in achieving anything following their resolution in 972, Ivar {{may or may not have}} found himself in a very weakened position. Curiously neither of <b>our</b> <b>major</b> primary sources has anything clear to say about the state of affairs at this time. But in 974 Ivar met with misforture, the Annals of Inisfallen reporting that [...] "The son of Aralt made a circuit of Ireland with a great company, and plundered Inis Cathaig, and brought Ímar from it into captivity.", and the Annals of the Four Masters [...] "The plundering of Inis-Cathaigh by Maghnus , son of Aralt, with the Lag-manns [...] of the islands along with him; and Imhar, lord of the foreigners of Luimneach, was carried off from the island, and the violation of Seanan thereby." [...] His captor is easily identified as Maccus mac Arailt, King of Mann and the Isles, but what are unknown are the circumstances. Ivar may have gone to Scattery because he had been driven out of Limerick proper, or it could have been for some other reason, and whether or not he and Maccus were already associated is unknown. Benjamin Hudson has offered the explanation that this event can be related to Ivar's earlier adventure in Britain as reported in the Cogad, arguing that the [...] "King of Britain" [...] reported slaying his comrade Amlaíb mac Amlaíb should be understood as either Maccus or his brother Gofraid mac Arailt and not some king of the Welsh, otherwise [...] "it probably would have been mentioned in the insular records". (Assuming Hudson is referring only to the Welsh and English records.) Elaborating, he reads this sequence beginning with [...] "a battle over the exploitation of the Welsh" [...] which the sons of Aralt won, and eventually ending with Maccus following Ivar all the way around Ireland to finish it.|$|E

[...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west. He said that as the situation deteriorated on 7 August, [...] "we moved one brigade [...] closer to South Ossetia, and later another [...] as well." [...] "But <b>our</b> <b>major</b> forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [...] and we did not call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," [...] he said. [...] "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; at that time we already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [...] Kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire, because, he was telling me, otherwise he was unable to bring [...] from [...] But my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened," [...] he said. Saakashvili also said that the Russian army had moved into South Ossetia before the war had even started. [...] "When we ask our western partners: didn't you see them coming, they respond that their satellites were directed mainly on Iraq and that they could not fly over , but it was impossible {{to see what was happening}} on the ground because it was cloudy. So it was a serious failure of international intelligence services; they would not have hidden this information from us, if they had known it; but they also did not know it," [...] Saakashvili said.|$|E
