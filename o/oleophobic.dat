5000|$|Natural {{stone is}} one of the most {{commonly}} used materials in countertops. Natural stone or dimension stone slabs (e.g. granite) are shaped using cutting and finishing equipment in the shop of the fabricator. The edges are commonly put on by hand-held routers, grinders, or CNC equipment. If the stone has a highly variegated pattern, the stone may be laid out in final position in the shop for the customer's inspection, or the stone slabs may be selected by experienced inspectors. Emerging technology allows for virtual stone placement on a computer. Exact photographs can now be taken which allow for the integration of a dxf file to lay on top of a stone image. Multiple slabs of material may be used in this layout process. Then the countertop assembly is installed on the job site by professionals.Commonly, initial countertop fabrication takes place at or near the quarry of origin, with blocks being sawn to thickness and then machined into standard widths (600mm and upwards), before being surface polished and edged.This method removes the need to ship waste material, and reduces the time needed to prepare client orders. This practice is called [...] "cut to size"A wide range of details may be pre-machined by the fabricator, allowing for installation of different sinks and cooker designs. A common drawback to natural stone is the need for sealing to prevent harboring of bacteria and/or fluids that may cause staining. In recent years <b>oleophobic</b> impregnators have been introduced as an alternative to surface sealers. With the advent of impregnators the frequency of sealing has been cut down to once every five to ten years on most materials.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDue to {{the much}} lower surface tension of oils in {{comparison}} to water, {{it is extremely difficult}} to obtain superoleophobic properties and also both <b>oleophobic</b> and hydrophilic properties.

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (POTS) at two concentration levels was applied to the roughened felt to render it both hydrophobic/superhydrophobic and <b>oleophobic.</b> The felt thus prepared was wettable by oil underwater, which allowed it to be effective as a coalescing material for separating 4 kinds of oil-in-water emulsions. The nanometer-thick POTS coating was durable for months. The coalescence separation efficiency was found to be dependent on both pore size and surface wettability of the felt in air. It was less sensitive to pore size change when the surface was more hydrophobic and <b>oleophobic</b> (amphiphobic). When the pore size was kept constant, more amphiphobic felt was less efficient for separation. When the surface turned superhydrophobic, the separation became better as the pore size was reduced.
