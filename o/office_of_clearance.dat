5000|$|Dual {{citizenship}} {{is associated with}} two categories of security concerns: foreign influence and foreign preference. Dual citizenship in itself is not the major problem in obtaining or retaining security clearance in the USA. If a security clearance applicant's dual {{citizenship is}} [...] "based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country", {{that can be a}} mitigating condition. However, exercising (taking advantage of the entitlements of) a non-U.S. citizenship can cause problems. For example, possession and/or use of a foreign passport is a condition disqualifying from security clearance and [...] "is not mitigated by reasons of personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country" [...] as is explicitly clarified in a Department of Defense policy memorandum which defines a guideline requiring that [...] "any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official permission for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government". This guideline has been followed in administrative rulings by the Department of Defense (DoD) Defense <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) <b>office</b> <b>of</b> Industrial Security <b>Clearance</b> Review (ISCR), which decides cases involving security clearances for Contractor personnel doing classified work for all DoD components.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Progress {{in therapy}} for cryptococcal {{meningitis}} {{has been slow}} {{because of the lack}} of a suitable marker of treatment response. Previously, we demonstrated the statistical power of a novel endpoint, the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection, based on serial quantitative cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, to differentiate the fungicidal activity of alternative antifungal drug regimens. We hypothesized that the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection should also be a clinically meaningful endpoint. METHODS: We combined data from cohorts of patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated cryptococcal meningitis from Thailand, South Africa, and Uganda, for whom the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection was determined, and clinical and laboratory data prospectively collected, and explored the association between the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection and mortality by Cox survival analyses. RESULTS: The combined cohort comprised 262 subjects. Altered mental status at presentation, a high baseline organism load, and a slow rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection were independently associated with increased mortality at 2 and 10 weeks. Rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection was associated with antifungal drug regimen and baseline cerebrospinal fluid interferon-gamma levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection or early fungicidal activity as a means to explore antifungal drug dosages and combinations in phase II studies. An increased understanding of how the factors determining outcome interrelate may help clarify opportunities for intervention...|$|R

40|$|To further {{delineate}} the mechanisms underlying murine pulmonary defenses against bacterial infection, we studied {{the effects of}} antioxidant enzymes and hydroxyl radical scavengers on pulmonary clearance processes. Intratracheal injection of catalase and superoxide dismutase resulted in prolonged intraalveolar residence of the enzymes, but caused no decrease in rates <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> either Staphylococcus aureus 502 A or Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1. In contrast, dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylthiourea caused significant depression <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> P. aeruginosa without altering <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> S. aureus. These results provide further differentiation between clearance processes affecting gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and suggest that murine <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> gram-negative organisms may be in part mediated by reactions which generate hydroxyl anion.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since GAO first identified the Department of DefenseÂs (DOD) Personnel Security Clearance Program as a high-risk area, DOD, in conjunction with Congress and executive agency leadership, took actions that resulted in significant progress toward improving the processing <b>of</b> security <b>clearances.</b> Congress held more than 14 oversight hearings to help oversee key legislation, such as the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which helped focus attention and sustain momentum of the governmentwide reform effort. In addition, the committed and collaborative efforts <b>of</b> DOD, the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Management and Budget (OMB), and <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Personnel Management (OPM) as leaders of the Suitability and Security Clearance Performance Accountability Council (Performance Accountability Council) demonstrated commitment to and created {{a vision for the}} reform effort, which led to significant improvements in the timeliness <b>of</b> processing security <b>clearances.</b> As a result, in 2011, GAO removed DODÂs Personnel Security Clearance Program from its high-risk list because of the agencyÂs progress in improving timeliness, development of tools and metrics to assess quality, and commitment to sustaining progress. Specifically, GAO found that DOD met the 60 -day statutory timeliness objective for processing initial clearances in fiscal year 2010 by processing 90 percent <b>of</b> its initial <b>clearances</b> in an average of 49 days. In addition, DOD developed two quality tools to evaluate completeness of investigation documentation and agencies' adjudication process regarding the basis for granting security clearances.

40|$|Inter-individual {{variation}} in pharmacokinetic parameters of drugs can have profound effects on drug safety in children. Midazolam and morphine {{are among the}} most commonly used drugs in critically children. Theophylline has seen several cycles of enthusiasm and unpopularity over the years, although oral theophylline is now rarely used, IV aminophylline is still used regularly in severe asthma. These drugs are metabolised by hepatic enzymes (CYP 3 A 4, CYP 1 A 2 and glucuronidation) which have variable expression. Three systematic reviews were conducted in order to explore the inter-individual variation <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> these drugs in children. The first systematic review evaluated the inter-individual variability <b>of</b> midazolam <b>clearance</b> in children. Midazolam is predominantly metabolised by CYP 3 A 4.
