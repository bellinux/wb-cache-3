5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types <b>of</b> <b>joints.</b> The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} deficits in the {{quantity}} and quality <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> attention in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To obtain a holistic measure <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> attention, the following four aspects were considered: a) the quantity <b>of</b> Initiation <b>Joint</b> Attention (IJA) and Response Joint Attention (RJA), b) non-verbal behaviours which were atypically used during joint attention, c) the quality <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> attention and d) the association between quality and quantity <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> attention in children with ASD. These aspects were measured in three children with ASD and three typically-developing children (TDC). Measures were derived from 30 -minute video recordings of a play session between each child and his/her caregiver and compared. This study established that there was a statistically significant difference in the quantity <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> attention in both IJA and RJA. The difference in the quality <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> attention was not statistically significant. However, when analysing children with ASD individually, a deficit in the quality <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> attention was identified in two of the three subjects. Compared to TDC, children with ASD engaged significantly less in IJA through manipulation of objects and eye-gaze and significantly more in IJA and RJA through challenging behaviour. In addition, there was no association between the deficits in quality and quantity <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> attention within individuals with ASD, as the three subjects portrayed diverse profiles. Children with ASD exhibited atypical joint attention skills when compared to the control group. Moreover, the frequency <b>of</b> initiations <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> attention bids was the most negatively affected aspect in children with ASD.

25|$|Arthritis <b>of</b> <b>joints</b> {{involves}} {{inflammation of}} the synovial membrane. Joints become swollen, tender and warm, and stiffness limits their movement. With time, multiple joints are affected (polyarthritis). Most commonly involved are the small joints of the hands, feet and cervical spine, but larger joints like the shoulder and knee can also be involved. Synovitis can lead to tethering of tissue with loss of movement and erosion of the joint surface causing deformity and loss of function.|$|E

Stretching muscles after engagement in any physical activity can improve muscular strength, increase flexibility, and reduce muscle soreness.

A coffee shop is a heavily controlled business establishment where individuals can purchase a personal dose of soft drugs in the form <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> pastry, drinks and packages. In theory illegal, these shops must abide by governmental and local regulations, as well as meet the AHOJ-G criteria, an acronym for: No Advertising, Hard drugs, Nuisance of any kind, Jongeren (minors under 18), and a limit of five grams per transaction. Additionally, the maximum stock at any time is five hundred grams. Local governments may impose additional rules, such as closing times, zoning (coffee shops may not be close to schools), and parking restrictions. The rationale behind coffee shops is to keep citizens away from the hard drugs scene, bringing them to a safe, social, and regulated environment.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with most}} of the other rock {{formations}} of Yosemite Valley, El Capitan was carved by glacial action. Several periods of glaciation have occurred in the Sierra Nevada, but the Sherwin Glaciation, which lasted from approximately 1.3 million years ago (mya) to 1 mya, is considered to be responsible {{for the majority of the}} sculpting. The El Capitan Granite is relatively free <b>of</b> <b>joints,</b> and as a result the glacial ice did not erode the rock face as much as other, more jointed, rocks nearby. Nonetheless, as {{with most of}} the rock forming Yosemite's features, El Capitan's granite is under enormous internal tension brought on by the compression experienced prior to the erosion that brought it to the surface. These forces contribute to the creation of features such as the Texas Flake, a large block of granite slowly detaching from the main rock face about halfway up the side of the cliff.|$|E
