5|$|Altogether Amir wrote fifty poems, {{eighteen}} {{pieces of}} lyrical prose, twelve articles, four short stories, three poetry collections, and one original book. He also translated forty-four poems, {{one piece of}} lyrical prose, and one book; these translations, Johns writes, generally reflected themes important in his <b>original</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Based on Béla Bánáthy's <b>original</b> <b>work,</b> {{the program}} is still {{organized}} into three phases, each consisting of a candidate, youth staff, and an adult staff level. This structure allows youth to develop their leadership skills over several years through gradually more intense and more advanced levels of instruction. Each level is tailored {{to the needs of}} youth at specific ages and maturity levels.|$|E

5|$|Murals, mostly {{replaced}} by monochromatic tin sheets, were also {{present on the}} church's ceilings. Though most ceiling paintings were unpreserved, an <b>original</b> <b>work</b> of Max Aya-ay in 1957 can still be seen on portions of the crossing. The walls were originally adorned with wooden images of Stations of the Cross commissioned by Father Ubeda in 1859 which were later {{replaced by}} European-made images.|$|E
5|$|Our dream {{began in}} the hearts of the {{students}} at Martin Luther King, Jr., Elementary School nearly ten years ago. The dream was nurtured by the late state Senator Bill McCoy, and through the donations of Oregonians and some of our state's most respected businesses; we will have an <b>original</b> <b>work</b> of art honoring the memory and ideals of one of America's greatest leaders.|$|E
5|$|Rivette edited shorter {{versions}} {{of several of}} his films with long running times. When L'Amour fou was released in January 1969 the 127 minute alternate version was simultaneously released at the production company's request. This version was simply a shorter version of the <b>original</b> <b>work</b> and Rivette immediately disowned it.|$|E

5|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary film critics. After {{the release of}} the film in June 1941, Columbia allowed the release of two more Medico films, Thunder Over the Prairie (July 1941) and Prairie Stranger (September 1941). Starrett, who went on to star in around sixty other western flicks, found The Medico of Painted Springs to be his favorite film. The film has many noticeable differences from Rubel's <b>original</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|The organ was {{originally}} built in 1685 by Renatus Harris {{at a cost}} of £500. This has been removed and repaired many times. However, some of the <b>original</b> <b>work,</b> including the case and pipes, is incorporated into the present instrument, which was built by J. W. Walkers & Sons in 1907, to be found above the stalls {{on the north side of}} the choir. It was further restored in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack was {{composed}} by various artists, such as Tetsuya Takahashi and Yasuharu Takanashi. Although the soundtrack contains mostly remixes of <b>original</b> <b>work</b> by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori, {{it also has}} some original material of its own.|$|E

5|$|A major {{complication}} in remastering the <b>original</b> <b>work</b> {{was having}} {{many of the}} critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts {{had been able to}} recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer Jory Prum had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.|$|E
5|$|A {{programme}} of work {{is scheduled}} {{to take place in}} 2018 to replace expansion joints in both towers along with replacing the truss end links. Plans to replace these joints were postponed by the bridge management following the Scottish Government's commitment to the construction of the Queensferry Crossing; the <b>original</b> <b>work</b> proposals would have involved round-the-clock contraflows during the installation of ramps and mini-bridges to carry traffic over the work area, and heavy lorries being diverted.|$|E
5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} {{prestige}} of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his <b>original</b> <b>work</b> (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E

5|$|Fuller, however, was {{confident}} {{in his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the <b>original</b> <b>work.</b> The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{tried to}} {{continue}} his scientific investigations in America {{with the support of}} the American Philosophical Society. He was hampered by lack of news from Europe; unaware of the latest scientific developments, Priestley was no longer on the forefront of discovery. Although the majority of his publications focused on defending phlogiston theory, he also did some <b>original</b> <b>work</b> on spontaneous generation and dreams. Despite Priestley's reduced scientific output, his presence stimulated American interest in chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Sculpturally, Rodin {{possessed a}} unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply {{pocketed}} surface in clay. Many {{of his most}} notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most <b>original</b> <b>work</b> departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory, modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, but refused to change his style. Successive works brought increasing favor {{from the government and}} the artistic community.|$|E

5|$|Some {{parts of}} the Bell Hill cutting are still visible from Princes Street, though the most obvious {{escarpment}} of the hill is found between Moray Place and Queen's Gardens, close to First Church. From Princes Street, the most notable part of the cutting is at Dowling Street, 300 metres south of the Octagon. Dowling Street narrows significantly above this intersection. The Dowling Street Steps, a 1926 structure listed by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, rise from close to the Princes Street-Dowling Street intersection, ascending a cliff that was formed {{as a result of}} the <b>original</b> <b>work</b> on Bell Hill.|$|E
5|$|Susanto Pudjomartono, {{former chief}} editor of Tempo, became The Jakarta Post second chief editor on 1 August 1991, after Siagian {{was chosen to}} be Indonesia's {{ambassador}} to Australia. Under Pudjomartono's leadership, the paper began publishing more <b>original</b> <b>work</b> and doing less translation; reporters {{were also asked to}} take {{a more active role in}} the day-to-day operations of the paper. The paper also became more vocal regarding politics, taking a pro-democracy stance like Tempo. It soon converted its offices into a new, two-story building built using the Kompas pension fund and expanded to 12 pages.|$|E
