5|$|Crucial to the {{attractiveness}} to investors of all MIS schemes is their taxation treatment. The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front tax deductions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> investment. Investors paid Great Southern a fee to lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct {{the cost of the}} lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt that is applied for DCF valuation <b>of</b> businesses in <b>the</b> specific environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic. Neither theory nor practice {{has focused on}} this issue in detail. There is no systematic and comprehensive list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt estimation methods usable in practice. Valuers and analysts disregard estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt arguing {{that it can be}} easily estimated from the current bank loan interest rates or from the traded bonds. Neither method is perfect and fully applicable in the Czech Republic. This dissertation thesis shows how <b>the</b> DCF value <b>of</b> an enterprise is shaped by <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt. Almost all formulas analysed caused <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> an enterprise to change with <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt, which makes <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt very important. Further, based on an analysis of 183 valuation reports, the thesis documents <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital estimation in <b>the</b> Czech Republic. It shows that while <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity is mainly estimated in compliance with theory, estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt is done by simple and sometimes inappropriate methods, because there is no guidance in the literature. Finally, this thesis suggests various methods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt estimation {{that can be used in}} practice in the Czech Republic. It provides full application guidance to these methods, data that was calculated by the author or taken from other sources and evaluates advantages and disadvantages of these methods. This thesis concludes by recommending methods that should be used for <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt estimation in <b>the</b> Czech Republic as opposed to the simple methods currently used...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, <b>the</b> {{market price}} <b>of</b> risk {{is a key}} input to the model, as it is prone to {{estimation}} errors, and the model output is relatively sensitive {{with respect to this}} parameter. As an alternative to a direct input <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market price <b>of</b> risk, we consider in the following an implied calculation based on an available estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity. <b>The</b> reasoning is that most applications focus on an accurate estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity and give a little attention to <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt. We, therefore, analyze how an existing estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity can be used to calibrate the model and consistently obtain an estimate for <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt without explicitly estimating <b>the</b> market price <b>of</b> risk.|$|R

5|$|The 1920s {{also saw}} an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain {{recovered}} from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats. An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At {{the end of the}} day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by gravity. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s. The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.|$|E
5|$|While many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> {{fossil fuels}} are well known, others (pollution related health problems, {{environmental}} degradation, {{the impact on}} national security from relying on foreign energy sources) are indirect and difficult to calculate.

A corrective pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax, could lead to renewable energy, such as solar thermal power, becoming cheaper to the consumer than fossil fuel based energy.|$|E

5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|E
