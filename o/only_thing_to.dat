5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and {{that the only way to}} ease the pain is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> help ease the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E

There may be {{embossed}} illustrations and graphs, with the lines either solid or made of series of dots, arrows, bullets that are larger than braille dots, etc. A full Braille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two columns, each having three dots. The dot positions are identified by numbers from one to six. 64 solutions are possible using one or more dots. A cell {{can be used to}} represent a letter, number, punctuation mark, or even a word.|$|E
25|$|Pre-set hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is pre-set. If the striker or hammer fail to discharge the cartridge, the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a double-action only (DAO) until the cartridge discharges or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a misfire malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do if a round fails to fire is to rack the slide, clearing the round and recocking the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster to pull the trigger a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using up even more time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional pre-set) offered this feature starting in 2006. The Walther P99 Anti-Stress is another example.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the end of}} the war the {{international}} community had begun to provide aid in large quantities to the refugees living in India. Although humanitarian aid was given, there was little support for the war crimes trials which Bangladesh proposed at {{the end of the}} war. Critics of the United Nations have used the atrocities of 1971 to argue that military intervention was the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> stop the mass murder. Writing to The New York Times, a group of women said in response to women being shunned by family and husbands, [...] "It is unthinkable that innocent wives whose lives were virtually destroyed by war are now being totally destroyed by their own husbands". International aid was also forthcoming owing to the issue of war rape.|$|E
500|$|With {{a modest}} income secured, Holst {{was able to}} marry Isobel; the {{ceremony}} was at Fulham Register Office on 22 June 1901. Their marriage lasted until his death; there was one child, Imogen, born in 1907. In 1902 Dan Godfrey and the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra premiered Holst's symphony The Cotswolds (Op. 8), the slow movement {{of which is a}} lament for William Morris who had died in October 1896, three years before Holst began work on the piece. In 1903 Adolph von Holst died, leaving a small legacy. Holst and his wife decided, as Imogen later put it, that [...] "as they were always hard up the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do was to spend it all at once on a holiday in Germany".|$|E

This he found in a [...] "meson", or caravanserai, attached to the hotel, where there was a goodsized room and a rough kitchen opening on a patio in which we could turn the beasts loose for the night. A sprinkling with water, a good sweeping,and a free use of Keating's powder, soon made the room habitable. The supper at the hotel was, however, far above the average, and the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> complain of was the poor forage supplied to the mules.".|$|E
2500|$|A {{military}} confrontation on 31March 1904 {{became known as}} the Massacre of Chumik Shenko. Facing the vanguard of Macdonald's army and blocking the road was a Tibetan force of 3,000 armed with antiquated matchlock muskets, ensconced behind a [...] rock wall. On the slope above, the Tibetans had placed seven or eight sangars. The Commissioner, Younghusband, was asked to stop but replied that the advance must continue, and that he could not allow any Tibetan troops to remain on the road. The Tibetans would not fight, but nor would they vacate their positions. Younghusband and Macdonald agreed that [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do was to disarm them and let them go". This at least was the official version. The writer Charles Allen has also suggested that a dummy attack was played out in an effort to provoke the Tibetans into opening fire.|$|E

2500|$|Sykes {{never got}} the chance to work on {{anything}} so large again. He missed out through illness and exhaustion on Operation Bertram, the major deception for the Second Battle of El Alamein: Barkas sent him by flying boat to Baghdad to recuperate, consoling him with promotion to General Staff Officer Grade 2. In Rick Stroud's view, Sykes had made an enormous contribution to British military camouflage. He had, writes Stroud, [...] "helped change the notion that the desert was a hopeless place for camouflage, where the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done was to disperse vehicles. His deception schemes, especially the dummy railhead, had made the authorities realise that the rock and sand of the desert wasteland was a theatre where the enemy could be deceived by the substitution of the real for the false and vice versa". These ideas were put to the test by Barkas in Operation Bertram.|$|E
2500|$|The stories {{published}} under Weisinger {{remained the}} basis for Superman's origin throughout the Bronze Age. But by the time Julius Schwartz took over as {{the editor of the}} Superman in 1970, continuity had strayed from the broader outline established in the 1960s. Schwartz relied on writer E. Nelson Bridwell, an expert in the fine details of the Superman mythology, to help refine the character's history. Bridwell explained to readers that many stories were no longer in continuity because they contradicted others, stating that, [...] "It was decided that the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do was to throw out part of the tales and work the rest into a consistent whole". Superman's origin was retold during this time in The Amazing World of Superman (Metropolis Edition), which adhered to the origin previously established in the Silver Age. Martin Pasko wrote Action Comics #500 (October 1979), which featured a history of the Superman canon as it existed at the time and was published in the Dollar Comics format.|$|E
2500|$|Gnocchi left an {{enormous}} amount of music, mostly sacred, but including some secular vocal music as well as some instrumental compositions. [...] None was published, and the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> emerge from a printer was the title page and dedication for a 12-volume set of masses, the Salmi brevi. [...] His compositions included 60 masses, many of which were Requiems, for four to eight voices, some with instruments; six Requiems, for two to four voices; six sets of Vespers for the entire church year, also for four to eight voices, with organ accompaniment; 12 settings of the Magnificat, for four voices; six settings of the Miserere, for four to eight voices; motets, hymns, and miscellaneous liturgical music. [...] In addition to the sacred music, he wrote some canzonette, and a body of instrumental music that includes a concerto for seven strings and basso continuo and three trio sonatas for two violins and basso continuo. [...] Stylistically his music borrows some traits from the Venetians, unsurprisingly considering that he studied there. [...] He uses double choirs in a homophonic texture, a style descended from the early Baroque Venetian School, rarely writing imitatively.|$|E

Next thing I knew, {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't.

2500|$|On {{the third}} day of the chase, Ahab sights Moby Dick at noon, and sharks appear, as well. Ahab lowers his boat for a final time, leaving Starbuck again on board. Moby Dick {{breaches}} and destroys two boats. Fedallah's corpse, still entangled in the fouled lines, is lashed to the whale's back, so Moby Dick {{turns out to be the}} hearse Fedallah prophesied. [...] "Possessed by all the fallen angels", Ahab plants his harpoon in the whale's flank. Moby Dick smites the whaleboat, tossing its men into the sea. Only Ishmael is unable to return to the boat. He is left behind in the sea, and so is the only crewman of the Pequod to survive the final encounter. The whale now fatally attacks the Pequod. Ahab then realizes that the destroyed ship is the hearse made of American wood in Fedallah's prophesy. The whale returns to Ahab, who stabs at him again. The line loops around Ahab's neck, and as the stricken whale swims away, the captain is drawn with him out of sight. Queequeg's coffin comes to the surface, the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> escape the vortex when Pequod sank. For an entire day, Ishmael floats on it, and then the Rachel, still looking for its lost seamen, rescues him.|$|E
