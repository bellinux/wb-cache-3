5|$|In July 2011, the BBC TV {{programme}} Fake or Fortune investigated {{a copy of}} Dirck van Baburen's The Procuress {{owned by}} the Courtauld Institute. Opinion had been divided {{as to whether it}} was a 17th-century studio work or a van Meegeren fake. The programme used chemical analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> to show that it contained bakelite and thus confirmed that the painting was a 20th-century fake.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the episode}} was shot on set at the Irish studios <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Paint</b> Hall. The exteriors of the {{entrance}} of Vaes Dothrak were filmed in the Sandy Brae area, and for the confrontation between Eddard and Cersei {{taking place in the}} Red Keep's gardens (identified as a godswood in the novels) the production used the cloister of the St Dominic Monastery in Rabat, in Malta.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
50|$|While {{there is}} some {{speculation}} that Raphael's pupil, Giulio Romano, and assistant, Gianfrancesco Penni, <b>painted</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background figures in the lower right half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> {{there is no evidence}} that anyone but Raphael finished <b>the</b> substance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> <b>The</b> cleaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> from 1972 to 1976 revealed that assistants only finished some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower left figures, while <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> is by Raphael himself.|$|R
25|$|The Heart - The {{heart is}} <b>the</b> focal point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> and all {{elements}} {{should lead to}} it. The heart defines <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> <b>The</b> concept should imply that each painting has a single focal point, and that all <b>the</b> natural lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> direct inwards to this point.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> process <b>of</b> {{restoring}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> began <b>the</b> same day. Following {{consultations with}} chemists, art restorers began washing <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> with water; they kept <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in <b>the</b> vertical position, and sprayed water at <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{to prevent further}} degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R
5|$|Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 {{with a quiet}} first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then {{missed their}} first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs' lead grew as big as 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer {{near the end of}} the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the {{previous}} 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot from the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an improbable 84–82 win to tie the series. The Blazers would go on to lose the series in 6 games, but it gave hope for Roy to start again next season.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E
5|$|Fay Michael Peter v. Public Prosecutor (1994) {{concerned}} an American teenager, Michael P. Fay, who {{was arrested}} in 1994 for vandalizing cars and stealing street signs. He pleaded guilty to two charges of vandalizing by spraying paint {{on a number of}} cars. On conviction by a subordinate court, he was sentenced to a total of four months' imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. For the purposes of sentencing, other charges were taken into consideration, including 16 charges of vandalism involving paint. Fay appealed to the High Court against the sentences, arguing that (a) proviso to section 3 of the Vandalism Act required the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the indelible quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> used before caning could be imposed; (b) a probation order was appropriate in this case; and (c) the trial judge below should have ordered a pre-sentencing report with a view to ordering probation. The appeal was dismissed. The case generated intense media interest in the United States, culminating in a formal request from the US Government for the caning sentence not to be carried out. The Singapore Government rejected the request on the basis that foreigners in Singapore could not be held to a different standard from citizens. However, it recommended that the President reduce the caning from six strokes to four.|$|E

50|$|The {{intent and}} meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> are unclear, and disputed by scholars. The highly diverse interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> are {{partly due to}} <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> {{information}} from <b>the</b> damage.|$|R
25|$|Leonardo's {{fingerprints}} {{have been}} found in the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint,</b> indicating he used his fingers to blend his delicate brushstrokes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} 15th century, oil {{paintings}} were generally {{done in a}} meticulous manner that simulated the smoothness and luminescent layering of tempera. In the 16th century the handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> became freer and painters exploited the possibility of laying paint on in broad, visible and varied brushstrokes.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the scenes}} of the episode were shot in the Belfast studios <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Paint</b> Hall, {{including}} the wedding of Tyrion and Sansa that was filmed at the huge semicircular set of the Great Sept of Baelor in mid September 2012. For this scene, a few hundred extras were recruited.|$|E

50|$|Lastly, {{the deep}} blue {{tablecloth}} draped over <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> brings strong contrast to the work. Vermeer needed to create a contrast spot {{in order to maintain}} <b>the</b> geometric layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> is {{currently}} in <b>the</b> Volgograd Museum <b>of</b> Fine Arts. <b>The</b> first version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> was completed by Brusilovsky at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s and given to <b>the</b> Ekaterinburg Museum <b>of</b> Fine Arts. <b>The</b> 1963 sketch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> is in <b>the</b> Perm State Art Gallery.|$|R
25|$|Roofing {{shingles}} {{account for}} most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics. Asphalt is used to make Japan black, a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel, and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> or ink, and to make the color darker. Asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.|$|E
25|$|In 1985 all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> on {{the bridge}} was scraped off, and then the bridge was re-painted. In the 1980s to 1990s the traffic volume on the Bund {{increased}} dramatically, and the then 90-year-old Waibaidu Bridge could no longer cope. In 1991, the Wusong Floodgate Bridge, a new concrete road bridge was constructed {{to the west of}} Waibaidu Bridge, and the river crossing traffic was mainly diverted onto the new bridge. After the completion of the Bund reconfiguration project, the Wusong Floodgate Bridge will be rendered obsolete by a new tunnel and will be demolished.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} distributions {{across the}} test model {{have historically been}} measured by drilling many small holes along the airflow path, and using multi-tube manometers to measure the pressure at each hole. Pressure distributions can more conveniently be measured {{by the use of}} pressure-sensitive paint, in which higher local pressure is indicated by lowered fluorescence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> at that point. Pressure distributions can also be conveniently measured by the use of pressure-sensitive pressure belts, a recent development in which multiple ultra-miniaturized pressure sensor modules are integrated into a flexible strip. The strip is attached to the aerodynamic surface with tape, and it sends signals depicting the pressure distribution along its surface.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} Lithuanian flag in {{the upper}} right hand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> which is not {{unexpected}} due to Chagall's Litvak roots. Also, in the upper left hand portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> there are <b>the</b> red flags <b>of</b> communism.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> depicts several {{different}} episodes from <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Waterloo in 1815, concentrating on charges by French cavalry. Physical elements in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> including cut-out figures, fences and bodies made of plaster and papier mache, disguise <b>the</b> lower edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> and enhance its immersive quality.|$|R
40|$|An angular and {{abstracted}} {{tree shape}} dominates <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> <b>The</b> brushstrokes are dark and angular.

25|$|U.S. Radium's {{management}} and scientists took precautions such as masks, gloves, and screens, {{but did not}} similarly equip the workers. Unbeknownst to the women, the paint was highly radioactive and therefore, carcinogenic. The ingestion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> by the women, brought about while licking the brushes, resulted in a condition called radium jaw (radium necrosis), a painful swelling and porosity of {{the upper and lower}} jaws that ultimately led to many of their deaths. This led to litigation against U.S. Radium by the so-called Radium Girls, starting with former dial painter Grace Fryer in 1927. The case was eventually settled in 1928. The company did not stop the hand painting of dials until 1947.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> {{was removed}} from the guitar in 1967 or 1968 during the Taste period, as {{evidenced}} from contemporary photographs. No further paint loss was seen over the subsequent twenty five years. Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. The paint removal and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers public persona and image. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the Strat was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it.|$|E
25|$|Lowry {{claimed to}} have only ever used five colours: Flake White (Lead White), Ivory Black, Vermillion Red, Prussian Blue and Yellow Ochre, all from the art-supply firm Winsor & Newton, but expert {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> used in Darby and Joan showed that it contained traces of Zinc White. However, the programme revealed a photograph of Lowry's studio in the 1950s which showed that he did have both Titanium White and Zinc White. The same painting was also plainly visible in a contemporary BBC documentary film about the artist, which included shots of his studio. All three works were judged to be genuine {{by a panel of}} experts, and the total value of the paintings was estimated to be in excess of £200,000.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{unfinished}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> such as <b>the</b> cloak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missing Virgin, {{would have}} required quantities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expensive lapis lazuli blue. If this was in short supply, {{it could be that}} this would have held up completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> which may explain why it was unfinished. However, even if this were so, it would not explain why the artist could not have completed the many other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> that did not require any blue.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} rival suppositions about the {{circumstances}} surrounding <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> after it was removed from Santa Maria del Popolo, partly because there were many copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> and partly due to delays in publication of vital documents.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> is {{separated}} into three sections by the dais {{at the base}} and the architectural feature towards <b>the</b> top, both <b>of</b> which use strong horizontal lines to create a defined central area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> <b>The</b> colours and figures are confined to <b>the</b> central section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> where their diagonal and open stances create a strong sense <b>of</b> movement. <b>The</b> top and bottom sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> are dominated by layered horizontal and vertical lines, in the floor tiles in the lower section and the architectural features in the top, that give <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> depth. Tiepolo’s masterful use <b>of</b> foreshortening in <b>the</b> figures accentuates this depth.|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{the period}} of their {{production}} Nottingham alabaster images were hugely popular in Europe and were exported in large quantities, some ending up as far afield as Iceland, Croatia and Poland. But by far the greatest export market for these images was in France, where even today some churches retain in situ their English alabaster altarpieces, unlike England, where survivals are extremely rare. The sculptures were normally brightly painted, sometimes all over, sometimes partially, but much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> has often been lost, and many pieces have had the rest completely removed by dealers, collectors or museums in the past. Most alabaster altarpieces and religious carvings other than church monuments remaining in England were destroyed in the English Reformation, after which the many workshops had to change their products to concentrate on church monuments.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his preoccupation for the simplification of geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with the means of rendering the effect of volume and space. His rather classical color-modulating system consisted of changing colors from warm to cool as the object {{turns away from the}} source of light. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the treatment and of application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> itself; a process in which his brushstrokes played an important role. The complexity of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a strong patchwork effect. Increasingly in his later works, as Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, the patchwork becomes larger, bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly abstract. As the color planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.|$|E
25|$|On September 3, 2002, {{astronomer}} Bill Yeung {{discovered a}} suspected asteroid, which {{was given the}} discovery designation J002E3. It {{appeared to be in}} orbit around the Earth, and was soon discovered from spectral analysis to be covered in white titanium dioxide, which was a major constituent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> used on the Saturn V. Calculation of orbital parameters led to tentative identification as being the Apollo 12 S-IVB stage. Mission controllers had planned to send Apollo 12's S-IVB into solar orbit after separating from the Apollo spacecraft, but it is believed the burn lasted too long, and hence did not send it close enough to the Moon, remaining in a barely stable orbit around the Earth and Moon. In 1971, through a series of gravitational perturbations, it is believed to have entered in a solar orbit and then returned into weakly captured Earth orbit 31 years later. It left Earth orbit again in June 2003.|$|E
50|$|The poetic {{words are}} {{incorporated}} harmoniously into the paintings’ composition: the words rhythmically encircle <b>the</b> round moon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> An Hour <b>of</b> Changing Scenes or follow <b>the</b> horizontal movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> textured horizontal bands <b>of</b> land below <b>the</b> moon. The series exemplifies Swartz’s continued transformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> frame’s role {{in relation to}} the image it frames. In previous paintings <b>the</b> frame is <b>painted</b> to become part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> but in <b>The</b> Thirteenth Moon paintings the frame’s role acquires new significance, for it contains words from the poetry written on the paintings' canvas.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{composition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> {{is rather}} simple as only the major bosals are depicted, without guardians such as Sacheonwang (Four Guardian Kings). <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> is divided horizontally {{into three parts}} where each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three Buddhas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, present and future are drawn on a large scale. The attendants are depicted {{at the top and}} bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> <b>The</b> main Buddha is depicted with a genial face and small features.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to publishing the postal stationery, the Society gave booklets both in Estonian and English <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil <b>painting</b> [...] "Maastik punase pilvega" [...] ("Landscape With A Red Cloud") by Konrad Mägi to Kumu Art Museum {{as a gift}} for handing out for free.
