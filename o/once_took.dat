5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip <b>once</b> <b>took</b> {{an hour and a}} half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E
5|$|During his {{ministry}} in England, Toulmin served two Dissenting congregations in Lancashire. From 1786 to 1788, he was pastor {{of a church}} in Monton, and from 1787 to 1793, he served another congregation at Chowbent Chapel in Atherton. He soon had nearly 1,000 followers, Many of his followers supported the French Revolution, attracting the attention of anti-dissenting partisans in England. A group of these partisans <b>once</b> <b>took</b> advantage of Toulmin's absence to threaten his house, necessitating his swift return to protect his family. Upon arriving, {{he was able to}} break up the mob via diplomacy alone.|$|E
5|$|Route 3 was the {{inspiration}} for a story in The New Yorker in 2004 by Ian Frazier. In this story, Frazier describes a bus journey along the route, mentioning scenes along the road such as traffic congestion, the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and the Tick Tock Diner off Route 3 in Clifton. He also described a walking journey he <b>once</b> <b>took</b> into New York City along Route 3, encountering heavy, noisy traffic speeding by and debris {{along the side of}} the road.|$|E

5|$|Bosanquet's {{final season}} for Oxford {{was his best}} statistically. He scored his maiden {{first-class}} century against London County and, against Sussex, he recorded what were {{to be the best}} bowling figures of his career, taking nine for 31 in the second innings and a total of 15 wickets in the game for 65 runs. His final match for Oxford was the 1900 University match, in which he scored 42 and 23. For the remainder of the season, Bosanquet re-joined Middlesex, and in his second match, against Leicestershire, achieved the rare distinction of a century in each innings: 136 in 110 minutes in the first innings, followed by 139 in 170 minutes in the second. He scored three further fifties for Middlesex and <b>once</b> <b>took</b> five wickets in an innings, but bowled comparatively rarely, only once bowling more than 13 overs in an innings. In all first-class matches in the season, Bosanquet scored 1,026 runs at 34.20 and took 50 wickets at 23.20.|$|E
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered {{that he did not}} know his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett <b>once</b> <b>took</b> advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often the center of attention among his peers.|$|E

His uncle Tom Graveney was an elegant batsman with Gloucestershire and Worcestershire (captaining both counties), and played in 79 tests for England (one as captain).|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from his}} mother, Al Saher's family were never {{supportive}} of his direction {{in becoming a}} musician.

Saher's brother <b>once</b> <b>took</b> him to different places where people usually sang, and told him it's your choice to sing a respectful way or you can choose to do it the bad way. He said {{that the only way to}} achieve success is if you respect your music and respect yourself.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} in office, Wickham first {{addressed}} the House of Commons in March 1937, to speak about foreign policy. He spoke at length at the subject again the following year. He was appointed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Florence Horsbrugh in the Ministry of Health in July 1939, and in November 1939 switched to the same role under the Secretary of State for War, Leslie Hore-Belisha. When, six weeks later, Hore-Belisha resigned from his post, Wickham also left his position in the War Office. He was appointed to another Parliamentary Private Secretary role in June 1940, assisting Victor Warrender, the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty. Eight months later, he <b>once</b> <b>took</b> on the role under the Secretary of State for War, this time David Margesson. In 1944 he led a parliamentary delegation to Australia and New Zealand, and the following year visited the Buchenwald concentration camp.|$|E

25|$|Before the Barnsley and Shepley Lane Head Turnpike was built, {{this small}} hamlet was {{situated}} on the packhorse route from Penistone to Huddersfield. Merchants would travel from Penistone, through Thurlstone, along Broadstones Road and Dearne Dike Lane to Five Lane Ends, down Piper Wells Road, Cross Lane and Carr Lane, before turning down the long drive into Shepley Carr. The route would then follow the fields (before they were enclosed), past the Shepley War Memorial, and into the village. The travellers would then head out towards Stocksmoor and Farnley Tyas through Stones Wood (where Devil worship <b>once</b> <b>took</b> place). Some old locals tell stories of a ghostly coach and fours furiously speeding down the long drive on wintry nights before vanishing at the hamlet. The present house at Shepley Carr is the third building on this site and dates from 1862. A house which stood on the site previously burnt down in 1740.|$|E
25|$|The Blob is {{vulnerable}} to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears {{do not have the}} same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, Sleepwalker defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk <b>once</b> <b>took</b> the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to concussions and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as Daredevil knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.|$|E
25|$|Prasad took 96 wickets from 33 Tests at {{an average}} of 35, and 196 wickets from 161 ODIs {{at an average}} of 32.30. Prasad was more {{effective}} on wickets that helped seam bowling even though his best Test bowling figures of 6 for 33, achieved against Pakistan in the 1999 Test series in India, came on a docile pitch in Chennai; these figures included a spell of bowling in which he took 5 wickets for 0 runs. Notably, he <b>once</b> <b>took</b> 10 wickets in a Test match in Durban, South Africa, in December 1996. It remains his only ten wicket haul in Test cricket. Prasad also took five wicket hauls in England, in 1996, in Sri Lanka, in 2001, and in the West Indies, in 1997. In the 1996/97 season, he took 55 wickets in 15 Tests and 48 wickets in 30 ODIs. For the period, he was named the CEAT International Cricketer of the Year.|$|E

25|$|Tublat (Keith David) – A rogue ape and {{a former}} member of Tarzan's gorilla family. He {{challenged}} Kerchak for leadership but he was defeated and cast out. He is considered dangerous by all the gorillas due to his aggressive and sociopathic behavior. He is based on Kala's husband (and Tarzan's foster father) in the original Tarzan novel. His personality is also very much like the original Kerchak or Terkoz from the novel. Conversely, Kerchak's personality in the 1999 film is just like Tublat's in the original novel. He <b>once</b> <b>took</b> over another gorilla family that Gobu belonged to, but inspired by Tarzan the family overthrew him and Gobu replaced him. He often calls Tarzan a hairless runt. He has four toes on his right foot (it is possible he lost one in a fight), and this is one way to tell he is in the area. In the series, he plots to dispose of Tarzan so that he can take over the gorilla pack for himself and makes no secret of his hatred against Tarzan, believing him to be unworthy of leading the gorilla family (despite Tarzan's actual success as a leader of the gorillas).|$|E
25|$|African {{cultures}} {{were heavily}} suppressed in the American slave era. The plantation and slave owners {{made sure to}} suppress African cultures through intimidation and torture, stripping away slaves' names and heritage. As expected, Igbo culture faced the same oppression, however some cultural remnants of Igbo origin was found and can still {{be found in the}} United States. Most of these cultural remnants can be found in music and entertainment. Igbo culture manifested in America through the Jonkonnu festivals that <b>once</b> <b>took</b> residence in the black slave population in Virginia. This masquerade bears similarity with the masking traditions of the Okonko secret society who still operate in the Igbo hinterland. The maskers wear horns which further shows similarity to Igbo culture and the Ikenga deity. Heavily African influenced American music genres such as Jazz and Ragtime stem from a mix of African cultures that creolized in the Americas. Although these genres could be described as a mix, there are elements of American music that have specific origin and Igbo instruments, such as the 'Eboe Drum'. The Igbo opi flute is similar to the drum and fife traditions.|$|E

Kat realises Mo knew about Luke, and argues with Mo and Charlie. Charlie has a heart attack and dies, leaving Kat devastated. Belinda returns and blames Kat for Charlie's death. Alfie tells her that he has a brain tumour, but assures her it is benign. Kat vows to attend Charlie's funeral, despite her sisters not wanting her there, but on the day, Stacey is ill so Kat stays with her at the Vic. She makes amends with Belinda and tells her about Luke. Belinda then reveals that Viv <b>once</b> <b>took</b> the family (minus Kat) to a village in Ireland called Redwater, and Viv visited a church and left crying, blaming Kat for this, and Belinda saw a couple with a boy watching them leave. Kat then finds out information about Redwater but she and Alfie then leave for Spain.|$|E
