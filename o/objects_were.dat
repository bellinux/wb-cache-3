5|$|As in Myst, the {{topology}} of {{the islands}} was originally created as grayscale images, where brightness corresponded to elevation. In Softimage, these maps were turned into the terrain models seen in the game. The large island <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which required them to be created using polygonal geometry. All other <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> modeled using B-splines and NURBS.|$|E
5|$|Bronze {{and iron}} casting were {{introduced}} to Japan from the mainland in the Yayoi period, initially bringing to Japan from Korea and China iron knives and axes, and later bronze swords, spears and mirrors. Eventually all {{of these and other}} metal <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> produced locally.|$|E
5|$|Many art <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} in Northern China {{during the time}} of the Northern Celestial Masters. These <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The image of the god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side of a stone stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead, a wish for the happiness of family members or wishes for political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.|$|E

5|$|Other archeological objects found {{along with}} the mummies included: headdresses with feathers, pottery, statues made out of gold and silver and textiles. A total of 145 <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> found {{together}} with the mummies.

5|$|The Kepler spacecraft's {{first days}} of science {{activity}} revealed a series of transit events, in which some body (such as a planet) crosses in front of, and therefore dims, its host star. Such <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> taken from the Kepler Input Catalog and reclassified as Kepler Objects of Interest. Kepler-5 {{was one of these}} objects of interest, and was given the designation KOI-18.|$|E
5|$|The {{clustering}} of {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown swarms of planetesimals that began with large semi-major axis orbits at random orientations and initially interacting with Neptune were sculpted into collinear groups of spatially confined orbits by a distant planet if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a highly eccentric orbit. These surviving <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> in orbits that were oriented with their long axes anti-aligned {{with respect to the}} massive planet and were roughly co-planar with it. The <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> also found to be in resonance with the massive planet. The resonances included high-order resonances, for example 27:17, and were interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that was fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales. The perihelia of these <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> also raised temporarily, producing Sedna-like orbits, before being returned to orbits more typical of typical trans-Neptunian objects after several hundred million years. Some of the eTNOs also evolved into orbits perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.|$|E

30|$|We {{continue}} to query the left (right) parallel {{line of the}} region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> and search the parent node of the found right (left) parallel line. If the right parallel line is the left child, and the region where the query <b>object</b> <b>is</b> does not have left adjacent parallel line, then the neighbor region of the queried data <b>object</b> <b>is</b> the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is</b> and the right parallel line. If the right parallel line is the right child, and the parent node parallel line is the left parallel line of the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> then the neighbor region of the queried data <b>object</b> <b>is</b> the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is</b> and {{the left and right}} parallel lines. If the left parallel line is the left child, and the parent node parallel line is the right parallel line of the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> then the neighbor region of the queried data <b>object</b> <b>is</b> the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is</b> and the left and right parallel lines. If the left parallel line is the right child, we use the middle order traversal algorithm to search for the direct stepfather node of the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> and the parallel line of the direct stepfather node is the right parallel line of the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is.</b> We calculate the distance between the data objects in the above searched region and the queried object, sorting and inserting these data objects into the sorting queue.|$|R
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E
5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E
5|$|Pallas {{is thought}} to have {{undergone}} at least some degree of thermal alteration and partial differentiation, which suggests that it is a remnant protoplanet. During the planetary formation stage of the Solar System, objects grew in size through an accretion process to approximately this size. Many of these <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> incorporated into larger bodies, which became the planets, whereas others were destroyed in collisions with other protoplanets. Pallas and Vesta are likely survivors from this early stage of planetary formation.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotation}} {{group of}} an <b>object</b> <b>is</b> equal {{to its full}} symmetry group {{if and only if}} the <b>object</b> <b>is</b> chiral. In other words, the chiral <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> those with their symmetry group in the list of rotation groups.|$|R

5|$|Released in 1981, Asteroids Deluxe is {{the first}} sequel to Asteroids. Dave Shepperd edited the code and made {{enhancements}} to the game without Logg's involvement. The onscreen <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> tinted blue, and hyperspace {{was replaced by a}} shield that depleted if used. The asteroids rotate, and the added killer satellite enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop. The game is much harder than the original and does not allow saucers to be hunteda common strategy for Asteroids high scores.|$|E
5|$|Several papyri {{and eleven}} mummies were {{discovered}} near the ancient Egyptian city of Thebes by Antonio Lebolo between 1818 and 1822. Following Lebolo's death in 1830, the mummies and assorted <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> sent to New York with instructions {{that they should}} be sold in order to benefit the bereft heirs of Lebolo. Michael H. Chandler eventually purchased the mummies and artifacts and began displaying them, starting in Philadelphia. Over the next two years Chandler toured the eastern United States, displaying and selling some of the mummies as he travelled.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after midnight}} on 21 August, Nhu's men {{attacked}} the pagodas using automatic firearms, grenades, battering rams and explosives, causing widespread damage. Some religious <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> destroyed, including {{a statue of}} Gautama Buddha in the Từ Đàm Pagoda in Huế, which was partially leveled by explosives. Temples were looted and vandalized, with the remains of venerated monks confiscated. In Huế, violent street battles erupted between government forces and rioting pro-Buddhist, anti-government civilians.|$|E
50|$|When an <b>object</b> <b>is</b> {{created by}} a {{constructor}} of the class, the resulting <b>object</b> <b>is</b> called an instance of the class, and the member variables specific to the <b>object</b> <b>are</b> called instance variables, to contrast with the class variables shared across the class.|$|R

50|$|Whitehead {{admitted}} indefinitely many eternal objects. An {{example of}} an eternal <b>object</b> <b>is</b> a number, such as the number 'two'. Whitehead held that eternal <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> abstractions of a very high degree of abstraction. Many abstractions, including eternal <b>objects,</b> <b>are</b> potential ingredients of processes.|$|R
5|$|Ten objects, {{among them}} {{one of the}} inscribed rings, were stolen shortly after the find was made, and when the {{remaining}} <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> recovered, {{it was discovered that}} the other ring had been cut into at least four pieces by a Bucharest goldsmith, whereby one of the inscribed characters had become damaged to the point of illegibility. Fortunately, detailed drawings, a cast, and a photograph made by London's Arundel Society of the ring before it was damaged survive, {{and the nature of the}} lost character can be established with relative certainty.|$|E
5|$|The Slavs erected sanctuaries, created {{statues and}} other sculptures, {{including}} the four-faced Svetovid, whose carvings symbolize {{various aspects of}} the Slavic cosmology model. One 9th-century specimen from the Zbruch River in modern Ukraine, found in 1848, is on display at the Archeological Museum in Kraków. Many of the sacred locations and <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> identified outside Poland, for example in northeastern Germany or Ukraine. In Poland, religious activity sites have been investigated in northwestern Pomerania, including Szczecin, where a three-headed deity once stood, and the Wolin island, where 9th– to 11th-century cult figurines were found. Archeologically confirmed cult places and figures have also been researched at several other locations.|$|E
5|$|The archaeologists {{discovered}} several bronze {{objects that}} were excavated {{with the hand}} cannon. The excavated <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> a bronze vase, a bronze mirror, and a bronze cooking pan. All the bronze artifacts were manufactured {{in the style of}} the Jurchen Jin dynasty. The Jin dynasty collapsed after the Mongols besieged and captured Caizhou in 1234, which suggests that the Heilongjiang hand-gun can reasonably be dated to the 13th century at the latest.|$|E

5|$|The average {{purity of}} the silver items is 96%. The {{remainder}} of the metal {{is made up of}} copper and a small amount of zinc, with trace amounts of lead, gold, and bismuth present. The zinc is likely to have been present in a copper brass used to alloy the silver when the <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> made, and the lead, gold, and bismuth probably were present in the unrefined silver ore.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} hoard, discovered {{within a}} large ring barrow known as Istriţa Hill near Pietroasele, Romania, consisted of 22 pieces, comprising a wide assortment of gold vessels, plates and cups {{as well as}} jewellery, including two rings with inscriptions. When first uncovered, the <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> found stuck together by an unidentifiable black mass, leading to {{the assumption that the}} hoard might have been covered in some kind of organic material (e.g. cloth or leather) prior to being interred. The total weight of the find was approximately 20kg (44lb.).|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{somewhat}} similar to {{elements of the}} 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast, which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston, as well as inanimate objects coming {{to life in the}} Beast's castle. The animated <b>objects</b> <b>were,</b> however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg had approved the revised script, and storyboarding began again. The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was not told the reason why.|$|E
