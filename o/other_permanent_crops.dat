40|$|Most citrus {{and avocado}} water-use {{studies have been}} {{conducted}} in inland orchards; however, orchards located in coastal areas are subject to cooler temperatures and foggier atmospheric conditions. To develop coastal area crop coefficients (Kc values) for irrigation management, we measured orchard consumptive water use (ETc) from two different commercial orchards located near Ventura. In addition to coastal climate variability, the ETc measurements were complicated by the wide variability in field soil, slope and elevation. On average, we measured Kc values of 0. 46 for young lemons, 0. 52 for mature lemons and 0. 64 for mature avocados. These values were slightly less than those published, perhaps as a result of greater fog conditions in the orchards as compared to those occurring at the nearest reference ET stations. Urbanization of Southern California coastal regions continues to press the remaining agricultural sector to use water more efficiently in orchard production.

The main goal of the research was to project {{the development of the}} production and trade of these crops in Bulgaria between 2013 and 2017, as well as to implement an analysis of certain scenarios related chiefly to upcoming changes in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

The research is an attempt to incorporate into Bulgarian analytical practice modelling methods that can provide useful figures and projections about the impacts of different political measures for decision makers, and market information on the prices and global supply and demand trends for farmers and agri-business organisations. The results show that the production of the modelled commodities will continue to increase in the coming years, mainly as a result of the growing global demand for cereals and the advantages of the production of these crops in Bulgaria compared to <b>other</b> field and <b>permanent</b> <b>crops.</b> It is also evident that the expected changes in the CAP will cause a small decrease in the planted and harvested area for most of these crops...|$|R
