5|$|A 2004 {{reference}} work <b>on</b> <b>Western</b> Desert painters suggests Wintjiya {{was born in}} about 1923; the Art Gallery of New South Wales suggests 1932; expert Vivien Johnson reports two possible years: 1932 or 1934. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians have a different conception of time, often estimating dates by comparisons with the occurrence of other events.|$|E

After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Ordnance Committee determined that a few CTLS-4TAC and 4TAYs would be dispersed to the U.S. Army and employed in the Aleutian Islands campaign. Under Ordnance Committee Minutes (OCM) 18526, these examples were subsequently designated as the Light Tank T16 and Light Tank T14 respectively.|$|E

5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} <b>on</b> <b>Western</b> institutions {{also takes}} more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong is avoided {{because it could}} result in a denial of visas for fieldwork in China. Ethan Gutmann also noted that media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire was the sole {{successor}} of the Roman Empire. Charlemagne's imperial coronation in 800 put strain <b>on</b> <b>Western</b> relations with the Byzantine Empire ruled from Constantinople. When Otto I became emperor in February 962, there was contention between him and the Byzantine Empire, and this issue revived in 967 between Otto and Nikephoros II Phokas over the dominion of Italy. On 25 December 967, Pope John XIII anointed Otto II as Otto I's co-emperor.|$|E
5|$|As an author, Soeman wrote stories which {{emphasized}} suspense and humour, drawing <b>on</b> <b>Western</b> detective {{and adventure}} fiction {{as well as}} classical Malay literature. His written Malay, with a vocabulary heavily influenced by his east Sumatran background, flowed readily and avoided excessive verbosity. Soeman's most popular work was his novel Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan (1932), whereas his short story collection Kawan Bergeloet (1941) has been considered his most interesting from a literary perspective. Though considered a minor author of the Poedjangga Baroe period, Soeman has been recognized with an eponymous library and his books have been taught at schools.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{introduced}} new tactics, {{units and}} equipment based <b>on</b> <b>Western</b> models, but the Polish-Lithuanian forces proved more adept with these innovations than the Russians. However, the main factors {{that kept the}} Russians from winning were the delay in moving siege artillery to Smolensk and the severe disruption of Russian supply lines by Polish cavalry. A scapegoat was nevertheless needed: Mikhail Shein was accused of treason and, together with his second-in-command Artemy Izmaylov and the latter's son Vasily, executed in Moscow on April 28, 1634. Learning from this defeat, the Russians would adopt new and more successful tactics in the Polish-Russian War (1654-1656).|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1968, the {{prospective}} purchases from the six countries amounted to 1,500 aircraft. Canada and Belgium had departed before any long-term commitments {{had been made to}} the programme; Canada had found the project politically unpalatable; there was a perception in political circles that much of the manufacturing and specifications were focused <b>on</b> <b>Western</b> Europe. France had made a favourable offer to Belgium on the Dassault Mirage 5, which created doubt as to whether the MRCA would be worthwhile from Belgium's operational perspective.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Inigo {{was tied}} with Cyclone Gwenda for being the most intense {{recorded}} cyclone in the Australian region in terms of pressure. It developed from a tropical low that crossed eastern Indonesia in late March 2003. Becoming a named tropical cyclone on 1 April, Inigo rapidly intensified as it tracked southwestward, reaching a minimum central pressure of 900hPa on 4 April. An approaching trough weakened the cyclone and turned it to the southeast, and on 8 April Inigo dissipated after making landfall <b>on</b> <b>Western</b> Australia as a minimal tropical storm.|$|E

5|$|Middle Devonian basaltic {{volcanic}} {{rocks are}} found <b>on</b> <b>western</b> Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay.

Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney. Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands. Boulder clay is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas.|$|E
