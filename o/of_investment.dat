40|$|We propose {{and test}} a {{conceptual}} model allowing for investigating the microeco nomic impact <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in telecoms. While the impact <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in telecoms on the macroeconomic outcomes {{has been previously}} investigated, {{there seems to be}} no published research that looked at the microeconomic impact <b>of</b> telecom <b>investments.</b> The proposed conceptual model links investments in telecoms with microeconomic constructs that are closely associated with such measure of macroeconomic bottom line as GDP; this allows us to outline a more detailed path traversed by the impact <b>of</b> <b>investments.</b> We use structural equation modeling to test the proposed model in the context of a sample of Transition Economies comprised of two groups differing in terms of the economic development. The results suggest the existence of the context- independent paths that are common to both groups; however, there is evidence that some of the impacts <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in telecoms are dependent on the level of economic development. The results of the investigation offer valuable insights to decision and policy makers tasked with the responsibility of improving the micro- and macroeconomic impacts <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in telecoms...|$|R

We use two unique databases: the First Brazilian Private Equity and Venture Capital Census and the Guia-GVcepe Endeavor, with information on this industry for the period 1999 to 2007. As measures of performance we use the percentage and number of exits through IPO, acquisition by a company or by another investor. Our {{results indicate that the}} factors influencing the performance <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> are: size <b>of</b> the fund, number <b>of</b> <b>investments,</b> the practice <b>of</b> co-investment, experience and foreign origin of the managing organization, focus on late stage, intensity of contact between managers and portfolio companies and the number of seats on the boards of the invested companies. The number of successes grows with the number <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> at a declining rate. This can indicate 1) a limit to the ability of managers or 2) that a large number <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> allows for greater diversification <b>of</b> risk, directing <b>investments</b> to companies <b>of</b> high risk but with a high upside...|$|R

40|$|A household-level {{switching}} {{regression model}} is implemented to examine potential selectivity bias for rural households under {{high and low}} levels <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in soil conservation in El Salvador and Honduras. In the presence of selectivity bias, separate stochastic production frontiers are estimated for low and high adopters. The main results indicate that households with higher levels <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in soil conservation show higher average TE than those with a lower level <b>of</b> <b>investments.</b> Constrains in the rural land and credit markets are likely explanations for these differences. The results also indicate that for farms with lower levels <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in soil conservation access to credit is a significant factor explaining the sources of inefficiency. Conversely, households with higher levels <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> have the highest partial output elasticity for land, {{the highest levels of}} TE and the smallest farms. These results are consistent with the presence of a failure in the land market which would limit access to land to the more efficient producers.

In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility of converting Marylebone into a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and {{been converted into a}} road for the exclusive use of buses and coaches.
