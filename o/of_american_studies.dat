Simone Weil Davis, {{professor}} <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>studies,</b> told Shameless magazine in 2005 that surgeons are perpetuating {{the idea that}} there is a right way for women's genitalia to look; because most women see only their own vaginas or pornographic images, it is easy to make them doubt themselves. The feminist organization, the New View Campaign, has spoken out against the existence of unregulated cosmetic surgery clinics as business enterprises, which it says trade on women's sexuality by appealing to their low self-esteem, thereby creating health risks.|$|E

500|$|These {{ships were}} an {{improvement}} over the preceding [...] Their engine rooms were larger to hold four Curtis or Parsons steam turbines. Their larger beam gave them greater metacentric height, in which the Delawares were notably deficient, which improved buoyancy and reduced hull stress. The ships mounted new /51 caliber guns as secondary batteries in casemates that boasted increased armor protection. The class retained the large and fully enclosed conning towers that were adopted for the preceding Delawares, as a result <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>studies</b> of the Battle of Tsushima in 1905.
