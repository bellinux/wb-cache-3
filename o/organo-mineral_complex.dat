40|$|The {{disappearance}} of the organophosphorus insecticide, malathion, from a silt loam soil and from its organic and inorganic components was examined. Half-lives and the time taken for 90 % decomposition in nonsterile, sodium azide-treated, and 2. 5 Mrad-irradiated soils were similar (3 / 4 - 1 1 / 2 days and 4 - 6 days, respectively) but breakdown in autoclaved soils was negligible. Decay in nonsterile sand, silt, and clay minus organic matter fractions was 3 - 6 times slower than that recorded in the original soil. Breakdown of malathion in the clay plus organic matter fraction (<b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complex)</b> was rapid (half-life, 1 day), {{as was the case}} in the separated organic matter (half-life, 1 3 / 4 days). Filter-sterilized organic matter was not as effective in catalyzing the breakdown of malathion (half-life, 4 days), and no loss occurred from any of the autoclaved components. Irradiation doses of 2. 5 and 5. 0 Mrad had little influence on the ability of soil to degrade malathion. Thereafter, increases up to 20 Mrad had a more drastic, though far from totally inhibitory, effect. The results suggest that either the colloidal organic matter itself, or a fraction associated with it, is the most important single factor concerned with the rapid breakdown of malathion in the soil studied. Direct microbial metabolism is a lower process and may have a significant role in malathion disappearance in coarse-textured soils low in colloidal organic matter. The catalytic component of the organic matter is suggested to be a stable exoenzyme and is supportive of reports by other workers. The quantitative effect of <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complex</b> (containing the active degradative ingredient) additions to sand and silt fractions on the rate of subsequent malathion decay is also described...|$|E

This technology provides an integral solution for the treatment of mining wastewaters and also has advantages in diluted matrices where there are no conventional, cost-efficient alternatives.

40|$|With 6. 5 m of peat {{accumulated}} {{during the}} past ca. 15, 000 years, Etang de la Gruère (EGr) represents the longest continuous record of atmospheric dust deposition in northern hemisphere. This paper presents a comparative study of the mineralogical composition of Sphagnum peat samples and their corresponding humic acids (HA) from a peat core collected at EGr bog. The {{purpose of this study}} was to better understand the dominant process responsible for the amount and distribution of mineral matter in ombrotrophic (i. e., rain-fed) peat. Specifically, the goal was to separate the relative importance of the changing rates of atmospheric mineral dust deposition ({{during the past}} two millennia) from the mineralization of organic matter (OM), for the distribution of the ash fraction of the peat profile. The results suggest that variations in ash content at EGr are mainly the result of an increase in the rate of supply of dust particles and cannot be attributed simply, or exclusively, to differences in the degree of OM decay: evidence is provided by both acid insoluble ash (AIA) profiles and the correlations among lithogenic elements (Al, Si, Ti, Y, and Zr), total ash content and AIA. Moreover, our findings suggest that part of the AIA occurring in peat extremely is stable, and is unaffected by the extreme chemical conditions used to extract the HA fraction: this may be partly due to the inherent stability of quartz and “heavy minerals” such as zircon and rutile, but organic coatings developed on mineral surfaces during peat diagenesis, or the formation of some other kind of <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complex,</b> might also play a role.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] and aqueous phase Al species are recognized to affect organic matter (OM) stabilization in forest soils. However, {{little is known about the}} dynamics of formation, composition and dissolution of organo-Al hydroxide complexes in microbially-active soil systems, where plant litter is subject to microbial decomposition in close proximity to mineral weathering reactions. We incubated gibbsite-quartz mineral mixtures in the presence of forest floor material inoculated with a native microbial consortium for periods of 5, 60 and 154 days. At each time step, samples were density separated into light (2. 0 g cm⁻³) fractions. The light fraction was mainly comprised of particulate organic matter, while the intermediate and heavy density fractions contained moderate and large amounts of Al-minerals, respectively. Multi-method interrogation of the fractions indicated the intermediate and heavy fractions differed both in mineral structure and organic compound composition. X-ray diffraction analysis and SEM/EDS of the mineral component of the intermediate fractions indicated some alteration of the original gibbsite structure into less crystalline Al hydroxide and possibly proto-imogolite species, whereas alteration of the gibbsite structure was not evident in the heavy fraction. DRIFT, Py-GC/MS and STXM/NEXAFS results all showed that intermediate fractions were composed mostly of lignin-derived compounds, phenolics, and polysaccharides. Heavy fraction organics were dominated by polysaccharides, and were enriched in proteins, N-bearing compounds, and lipids. The source of organics appeared to differ between the intermediate and heavy fractions. Heavy fractions were enriched in ¹³C with lower C/N ratios relative to intermediate fractions, suggesting a microbial origin. The observed differential fractionation of organics among hydroxy-Al mineral types suggests that microbial activity superimposed with abiotic mineral-surface-mediated fractionation leads to strong density differentiation of <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complex</b> composition even over the short time scales probed in these incubation experiments.

In recent years, the {{feasibility}} of using fly ash from the combustion of coal for the synthesis of zeolites has been studied (Belviso et al. 2010, Derkowski et al. 2010). One of the many uses of zeolites is to leverage their properties to act as organic sorbents (Bowman 2003). Unfortunately, the sorption process of organic substances on zeolites is hampered by the negatively-charged surface of the crystallites (Jashua & Bowman 2009). In order to increase the chemical affinity of the zeolite's surface to the organic molecules, its modification by organic surfactants is necessary. This leads {{to the formation of}} an <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complex</b> with improved sorption properties. It has been found that organo-zeolites may be used to remove volatile compounds in a pure form, and those which occur in nature as impurities of air, water and soil (Damjanovic et al. 2010, Vidal et al. 2012). Therefore, it seems reasonable to search for an organo-zeolite sorbent which is cheap, efficient and environmentally-friendly (Apreutesei et al. 2008). The zeolites modification takes place only on the outer surface of the crystallites as the ammonium salts' molecules are too large to enter the zeolite's channels. Therefore, external cation exchange capacity (ECEC) is an important property in the synthesis of organo-zeolites. The type of surfactant introduced and its amount, often given by ECEC values, is crucial-subsequently leading to the formation of materials differing in sorption properties. Thus, it is essential to determine the effectiveness of modification by examining the amount of surfactant adsorbed on zeolites' surface. In the experiments, a Na-P 1 zeolite synthesized from fly ash remaining after coal combustion and a natural Ukrainian zeolite were transformed into organo-zeolites. This involved the replacement of original exchangeable cations (K+, Na+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) by organic cations from the following salts: hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA) and octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (ODTMA) in amounts equal to 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 00 of ECEC. ECEC for synthetic zeolite Na-P 1 was determined, and it was 24. 4 meq/ 100 g, which corresponds to a single layer (1. 0). The aim {{of this study was to}} use the infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to determine the quantity of the surfactant adsorbed on the crystallites surface. The FTIR spectra were collected by a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 7600 spectrometer using the DRIFT technique. The CHN analysis was used to investigate the modification efficiency through quantification of the attached surfactant. The normalized intensity of selected bands attributed to C-H stretching vibrations in the 3, 000 - 2, 800 cm- 1 region was compared with CHN results. The results revealed a high correlation (R 2 > 0. 99) between spectroscopic and chemical analyses. The band intensities compared with the efficiency of modification enabled to obtain appropriate calibration curves. This proved that FTIR could be used for a fast determination of the surfactants amount in the obtained organo-zeolites. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

Organic matter present in < 2 µm particle-size fractions of soils has slow turnover times and it {{is assumed to be}} stabilized mainly by interaction with minerals. We aimed to quantify how much of the organic matter in < 2 µm particle-size fractions was free versus bound to minerals and to describe the nature of the association. Furthermore, we hypothesized that this bound organic matter was more resistant to biodegradation than free organic particles. We tested this by using a cultivation chronosequence on temperate silty soils and quantified free and clay-bound organic matter using density fractionation coupled with elemental analyses, as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with image analyses. Both methods showed that free organic matter was a minor fraction and that it was more depleted by cultivation than clay-bound organic matter. We deduced that clay-bound organic matter was more resistant to biodegradation. TEM showed that the distribution of organic matter in clay-sized fractions was patchy and that many of the so-called < 2 µm 'particles' were in fact nanometre- to micrometre-sized microaggregates in which OM was encrusted by minerals or coated minerals.

OC fractions exhibit different rates of biochemical and microbial degradation (Stevenson 1994; Tan et al. 2007) as well as different accessibility and interactions (Sollins et al. 1999). Very little is known {{of the dynamics of}} soil organic matter (SOM) after agricultural abandonment. SOC contains fractions with a rapid turnover rate as well as fractions with a slower turnover rate (Aminiyan et al. 2015). The labile fractions of OC, such as microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), can respond rapidly to changes in C supply. The dynamics of SOC are usually described by dividing SOM into two or more fractions. Density fractionation, that is a laboratory procedure, physically separates soil into light (LF) and heavy fractions (HF) (Wander and Traina 1996; Sollins et al. 1999). The procedure is useful method for studying labile pools of SOC that are more sensitive to cropping practice than is the total SOC pool in temperate soils (Janzen et al. 1992). Generally, sodium polytungstate (SPT) (1.85  g mL− 1) and NaI (1.3  g cm− 3) solutions are often used for density fractionation (Golchin et al. 1994; Magid et al. 1996; Six et al. 2002). Although LF is commonly referred to a plant-like and less stable fraction with high OC concentration (Gregorich et al. 2003), HF is more stable and high-density organo-mineral fractions having lower C concentrations (Golchin et al. 1995 a, b).|$|R

Many exudates form strong complexes with Fe and Al ions, retard or inhibit their hydrolytic reactions and promote the formation of noncrystalline or short-range ordered Al and Fe nanoprecipitates. The so-called iron plaques, present on many wetland plant roots, are Fe(III) -oxyhydroxides (mainly ferrihydrite). These precipitates may interact with biopolymers (proteins, polysaccharides, DNA, RNA and so on), phyllosilicates, soil organic substances as well as microorganisms forming <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes.</b> Root exudates {{play a vital role}} on the sorption/desorption of nutrients and pollutants at soil-root interface.

They may desorb, at least partially, nutrients and pollutants previously sorbed on soil components, promoting their bioavailability for plants and microorganisms.

This relatively large molecule (10, 419. 3 Da) possesses a flexible, porous structure and a distribution of functional groups appropriate to humic substances. Simulation results for the model humic systems included such diverse molecular-scale information as an infrared spectrum, an analysis of the position of polar groups relative {{to the center of the}} molecule, an accounting of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, porosity, and cation-oxygen coordination numbers, as well as dynamic and structural cation behavior.

Current model using least-squares linear regression generally underestimates C the maximal amount of soil C stabilization in fine soil particles. Using an analysis of published data, I proposed two alternative methods (boundary line analysis and the organic C loading method) to improve estimates, and found that while the organic C loading method is better since it incorporated mineral specific surface areas which would influence C saturation, it requires information about soil mineralogy and further tests {{to determine whether the}} monolayer-equivalent C loading indeed represents a maximal C stabilization potential.

Another important component of organic matter is the soil solution, where chemical, biochemical and physico-chemical reactions occur (Monreal and McGill, 1997). The latter reactions affect supply of crop nutrients, the type of microbial communities, and molecular structures of soil organic matter (Monreal et al., 1997) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An organo-clay {{composite}} {{was prepared}} by contacting Na-montmorillonite and humic acid {{in aqueous solution}} which was of variable pH. After freeze-drying the precipitate of the solution, the detailed structure of the humic acid-montmorillonite composite was observed. Transmission electron micrographs and electron diffraction patterns indicate that the composite which was formed under acidic conditions has a characteristic microstructure. Humic acid, a large organic molecule, is combined with bent or curled thin foils of montmorillonite to form a spherical aggregate. The X-ray diffraction pattern supports this observation and suggests that the montmorillonite s cleaved into thin flakes as a silicate layer. The composite formed under alkaline conditions was {{in the form of}} a thin plate or lath and had a similar morphology to that of montmorillonite. The difference in the microstructure of the composite is reasonably attributed tothe chemical f exibility of humic acid, i. e., conformation changes depending on the pH of the solution. Humic substances are the major organic compo-nents of soils. They interact with clay minerals to form <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes</b> and composites.

40|$|The {{development}} of sorbents {{that can be}} added to the soil to immobilize pollutants is an area of great interest because of its growing demand. We intend to get biosorbents by interaction of two natural clays (SWy and CTI) and a synthetic hydrotalcite (HT) and its calcination product (HT 500) with the washing water of a natural agro-residue from the olive oil production process. Those biosorbents try to emulate the <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes</b> that can be found or formed in soil, for their use to increase the retention and decrease the mobility of organic pollutants in soils. This process of interaction was previously checked to be beneficial by itself to remove the soluble organic matter (SOM) of the olive mill waste and its toxicity for plants, which represents an additional environmental advantage. Four biosorbents were prepared and the adsorption of diverse contaminants (three herbicides:diuron, terbuthylazine and terbutryn and an organic pollutant: dibenzofuran) was measured. The in situ formation of those biosorbents was tested by previously mixing the clays with the soil,and thereafter the contaminant is added in solution of olive mill waste SOM. The tested biosorbents produced an increase in the adsorption of contaminants (5 - 95...|$|R

40|$|Aggregate {{formation}} and aggregate strength depend on soil mechanical and hydraulic processes, {{but also on}} biotic processes, e. g. biological activity and kinds of organic exudates. Higher bulk density within aggregates, {{in comparison to the}} bulk soil, results in reduced diffusion of both gases and solutions. Interactions between microbial composition, their activity and physico-chemical properties of the decomposed organic components such as hydrophobicity and leachate composition are also reduced. Intra-aggregate pore geometries consist of finer pores with higher tortuosity. Many of the fine pores are discontinuous reducing their accessibility to the free mobilization of organic carbon. Investigations of physico-chemical properties in structured soils and their influences on organic carbon sequestration have been conducted at different scales ranging from <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes,</b> single aggregates to homogenised bulk soil. Soil aggregates are clusters of soil containing separate microbial colonies and gradients of C which are found into spherical layers, they differ between each other in their chemical and physical properties. For the purpose of investigation soil aggregates are being investigated in great detail by removing contiguous surface layer or crushing individual aggregates to better investigate their component parts. Evolutions of surface and interior regions of aggregates better identify biological, chemical and physical gradients which control most of the biogeochemical mechanisms influencing terrestrial C sequestration...|$|R
40|$|Cryptopodzols {{are black}} soils that occur under forests {{dominated}} by chestnut trees (Castanea sativa) in Southern Switzerland. Their soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks reach {{an average of}} 150 t C ha- 1 and are thus among the highest of European forest soils. We investigated the processes leading to the accumulation and stabilisation of SOC in these soils by analysing three Cryptopodzols and one Cambisol for charred organic matter content (macrocharcoal and BPCA), the amounts of Fe and Al, and the colour and SOC content in bulk soil and density fractions. The results showed that charred organic matter produced by frequent ␣res {{in the area for}} more than 10, 000 years is highly abundant in Cryptopodzols: the stocks of macrocharcoal and BPCA-C amount to up to 31 t ha- 1 and 17 t ha- 1, respectively. These high amounts of charred organic matter are responsible for the dark soil colour and high SOC concentrations that are, however, also closely related to Fep and Alp concentrations. We concluded that the occurrence of charcoal across the whole pro␣les of Cryptopodzols seems to be the dominating factor, although both the formation of organo-metallic or <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes</b> in the subsoil and the high abundance and stability of charred organic matter are responsible for the high SOC stocks in Cryptopodzols...|$|R
40|$|Sorption {{of organic}} {{molecules}} on clay surfaces in aquatic environment influence organic sedimentation fluxes to bottom water and to sediment. It {{is well known}} that physical and chemical interactions produce the flocculation of <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes.</b> Flocculation increases the density of sedimentary organic fractions and decreases the risks of oxidation and/or bacterial recycling, during transfer across the water column. Other studies, based on analyses of organic matter in sediments, revealed also that direct contacts between clay surfaces and organic molecules influence molecule availability to benthic fauna and bacteria. Many studies conclude that mineral sorption can be considered as one of the preservation mechanisms, leading to incorporation of metabolisable organic matter in sediments. The most part of these studies based their conclusions on analyses of sediments but never fully considered sorption processes resulting to organic matter preservation. Many questions in this topic remain unresolved. Does sorption of organic molecules on clay minerals can occur in the water column, i. e. before sedimentation ? Which organic molecules can be fixed on clays? What is the reactivity of these <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes</b> in deep water? Does interaction can be considered as an efficient process for organic molecules protection, leading transport of organic matter from the dynamic water column to sediments? The aims of this work are first to test the possible in situ sorption of organic molecules on clay minerals, in a lacustrine environment, and secondly to test the stability of the organo-clay complexes formed under these conditions. In this respect, the behaviour of natural organic matter in presence of synthetic saponites (high- and low-charge Na-smectites) has been studied in oxic and anoxic levels of an oligotrophic meromictic crater lake (Lac Pavin, Massif Central, France). Clay samples were positioned in traps, closed by two membranes, allowing only circulation of dissolved organic matter. Interactions were interrupted on the spot, after 3, 10 and 21 days. Bulk chemical analyses showed the presence of organic carbon, associated with clays after interaction with the water lake. Low-charge saponites present higher organic carbon concentrations than high-charges, suggesting the non-prominence of cation bridge linkages between organic molecules and clay surfaces. Molecular pyro-GC/MS investigations, performed on clays, revealed the sorption of n- and iso- fatty acids, alkanes, alkenes and alcohols, in significant amounts. The molecular GC/MS analyses of organic extracts carried out on waters emphasized the lack of selectivity during fixation, since the same molecular fractions are present in waters and on clay surfaces. X-ray diffraction analyses, performed on the two saponites, proved the lack of molecular intercalation in clay mineral structure. ESCA analyses showed a loss of sodium in the interlayer space of the two saponites, and its probable substitution by divalent iron in anoxic deep water. Failure of extractions by saponification and organic solvents, tested on sorbed molecules, indicates the strong stability of the assemblages between clays and organic molecules...|$|R
30|$|The {{proportion}} of labile and recalcitrant carbon specifies {{the quality of}} SOC, which determines the magnitude of SOC decomposition. The low quality SOC with more recalcitrant carbon needs a longer time to turnover (Leifeld and Führer 2005). Soil bulk density has a negative correlation with soil organic carbon content, and reflects the mineral soil percentage in the soil regime, the higher its value the slower the carbon mineralization. The change of soil microbial biomass nitrogen may represent the transition of microbial community composition and the substrate use strategy. After the depletion of labile carbon during the first weeks, microbial activity turned to be C-constrained (Demoling et al. 2007). The K-strategist bacteria decomposing recalcitrant carbon (Fontaine et al. 2003) or the fungi using N-rich SOM would become predominant in the microbial community during the late stage of the incubation period (Boberg et al. 2010). Soil pH not only modulates the soil micro-environment and microbial community composition (Strickland and Rousk 2010), but also governs the breakdown processes of SOC decomposition (Riffaldi et al. 1996). The soil mineralization process including the adsorption of SOC by colloids and the substitution between different multivalent cations within <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes</b> (Yuan et al. 2000; Rasmussen et al. 2006) is greatly influenced by soil pH, which ultimately controlled the availability of recalcitrant carbon in the late incubation stage of our experiment.|$|R
30|$|The HA {{fraction}} insoluble at pH  1 might {{correspond to}} the HA extracted following the IHSS procedure, except for the purification step. It has the typical composition of a mature HA formed in organic soils in a temperate climate: a high acidic group content and high aromaticity, but a low content of O- and N-containing groups [44]. A compound with nearly the same characteristics is obtained at pH  3. The inorganic phase in the fraction insoluble at pH  1 and pH  3 accounts for about 25 % of the total. It is largely constituted by clay minerals (montmorillonite-kaolinite) which only in drastic treatments, including HF-HCl, are able to dissolve. We cannot establish whether these <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes</b> {{were present in the}} soil and have been extracted or whether they are formed between two dissolved separated phases. On the other hand, the binding of HA to kaolinite and montmorillonite at pH ≤ 3 has been assessed by several adsorption studies [45]-[49]. The interaction between humic substances and clay minerals can include specific and columbic interactions, but Schutless et al. [46] recommend being careful in interpreting adsorption studies since at low pH values, adsorption and precipitation mechanisms are difficult to differentiate. The organo-mineral aggregates could also have been stabilized by the presence of Al and Fe, not included in phyllosilicate structures, and low amounts of alkaline and alkaline earth metals. Polyvalent cations are known to promote the interaction of HA with phyllosilicates through the formation of cation bridges [47],[50].|$|R
40|$|Mineral binding {{is a major}} {{mechanism}} for soil carbon (C) stabilization. However, the submicron information about the in situ mechanisms of different fertilization practices affecting <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes</b> and associated C preservation remains unclear. Here, we applied nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) to examine differentiating effects of inorganic versus organic fertilization on interactions between highly reactive minerals and soil C preservation. To examine such interactions, soils and their extracted colloids were collected during a 24 -year long-term fertilization period (1990 – 2014) (no fertilization, control; chemical nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilization, NPK; and NPK plus swine manure fertilization, NPKM). The results for different fertilization conditions showed a ranked soil organic matter concentration with NPKM > NPK > control. Meanwhile, oxalate-extracted Al (Al o), Fe (Fe o), short-range ordered Al (Al xps), Fe (Fe xps), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranked with NPKM > control > NPK, but the ratios of DOC ∕ Al xps and DOC ∕ Fe xps ranked with NPKM > NPK > control. Compared with the NPK treatment, the NPKM treatment enhanced the C-binding loadings of Al and Fe minerals in soil colloids at the submicron scale. Furthermore, a greater concentration of highly reactive Al and Fe minerals was presented under NPKM than under NPK. Together, these submicron-scale findings suggest that both the reactive mineral species and their associations with C are differentially affected by 24 -year long-term inorganic and organic fertilization...|$|R
40|$|Fracture {{surfaces}} of red mudstones (overbank deposits within the Kuzgun Formation of Late Miocene-Tortonian — age) are coated by thin black colored manganese oxide beneath a thin soil {{cover in the}} Mersin area of southern Turkey. These manganese oxide coatings have been investigated by a range of analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared-spectral (IR), differential thermal analysis–thermal gravimetric (DTA–TG), scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM–EDX) analyses. The basal reflections at 10. 00, 7. 22, 5. 00, 3. 35, 2. 50, 2. 29 and 2. 10 Å, sharp infrared spectral lines at 469 and 519 cm − 1 and typical dehydration of interlayer water < 200 °C, together with results from the EDX analysis, indicate the presence of calcium buserite — a manganese oxide mineral. SEM images of buserite crystals show degraded platy pseudo-hexagonal forms suggesting a non-biological origin. Pedogenic processes taking place at the soil material overlying red mudstones, likely induced the reducing or acidic conditions under which Mn 2 + was released by the dissolution of Mn-bearing minerals during the wet periods. Organic compounds were also most likely leached during these periods and subsequently, during the dry climatic intervals, manganese oxide minerals precipitated from the infiltrating soil solutions under oxidizing conditions. The nanometer-scale layering in manganese oxide coatings is here attributed to repeated changes in redox conditions. Some trace elements in the coatings, such as Ba, Ni, Co, and Ce have either been absorbed by the Mn oxide minerals or <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>complexes...</b>|$|R

The fate of these proteins in the environment depends strongly on their adsorption on the <b>organo–mineral</b> <b>complexes</b> of soil. Environmental monitoring requires the quantification of the proteins and this entails their chemical extraction from soil. Three Cry proteins, Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 C and Cry 2 A, present in commercial biopesticide formulations or synthesized by GM plants or both were studied. The adsorption of trace amounts of Cry proteins on over 40 types of soil with contrasting properties was measured in dilute suspension. After a short incubation the extraction yield was measured with a previously tested alkaline solution that contained surfactant and another protein. Each of the proteins had a strong affinity for soil. No soil property was observed to determine either the affinity for soil or the extraction yield. There was no simple relation between the affinity (assessed from the distribution coefficient, Kd) and the extraction yield, {{although there was a}} significant inverse relation (P < 0. 05) for two of the proteins, Cry 1 Ac and Cry 2 A. The proteins differ in both their affinity for soil and their extraction yields. We conclude that these insecticidal proteins will be largely immobile in soil, but that routine environmental monitoring can give only semi-quantitative values for protein in soil.
