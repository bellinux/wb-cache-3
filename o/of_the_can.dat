5|$|A {{favourite}} of {{the ruling}} Ngô family, Đính received rapid promotions ahead of officers who were regarded as more capable. He converted to Roman Catholicism to curry favour with Diệm, and headed the military wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cần</b> Lao party, a secret Catholic organisation that maintained the Ngôs' grip on power. At the age of 32, Đính became the youngest ever ARVN general and {{the commander of the}} II Corps, but he was regarded as a dangerous, egotistical and impetuous figure with a weakness for alcohol and partying.|$|E
5|$|Upon Tự Đức's death, Phan {{almost lost}} his life during a power {{struggle}} in the imperial court. The regent Tôn Thất Thuyết disregarded Tự Đức's will of succession, and three emperors were deposed and killed in just over a year. Phan protested against Thuyet's activities, was stripped of his honours and briefly jailed, before being exiled to his home province. At the time, France had just conquered Vietnam {{and made it a}} part of French Indochina. Along with Thuyet, Phan organised rebel armies as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cần</b> Vương movement, which sought to expel the French and install the boy Emperor Hàm Nghi at the head of an independent Vietnam. This campaign continued for three years until 1888, when the French captured Hàm Nghi and exiled him to Algeria.|$|E

25|$|In modern times, the {{majority}} of food cans in the UK have been lined with a plastic coating containing bisphenol A (BPA). The coating prevents acids and other substances from corroding the tin or aluminium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>can</b> but leaching of BPA into the can's contents is currently (as of 2013) being investigated as a potential health hazard.|$|E
25|$|The {{progressive}} improvement in canning stimulated the 1855 invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>can</b> opener. Robert Yeates, a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of Trafalgar Place West, Hackney Road, Middlesex, UK, devised a claw-ended can opener with a hand-operated tool that haggled its {{way around the}} top of metal cans. In 1858, another lever-type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the United States by Ezra Warner of Waterbury, Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a toxic {{chemical}} compound present in commercially available tin can plastic linings {{and transferred to}} canned food. The inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>can</b> is coated with an epoxy coating, {{in an attempt to}} prevent food or beverage from coming into contact with the metal. The longer food is in a can, and the warmer and more acidic it is, the more BPA leaches into it. In September 2010, Canada became the first country to declare BPA a toxic substance. In the European Union and Canada, BPA use is banned in baby bottles.|$|E

25|$|Phan {{spent the}} first five years of the 20th century living in Huế and {{traveling}} the country. Phan drew up a three-step plan to get the French out of Vietnam. First, he would need to organize remnants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cần</b> Vương movement and other sympathizers of the cause. Second, he would need to attain support from the Vietnamese imperial family and the bureaucracy, many of whom had already come to grips with French colonial rule. Finally, he would need to obtain foreign aid, from Chinese or Japanese revolutionaries, to finance the revolution.|$|E
25|$|On 19 February, at {{the request}} of the senior adviser of the IV Corps Tactical Zone, General Eckhardt, Task Force 117 units {{initiated}} joint waterborne patrols with units of the Republic of Vietnam Navy River Assault Group along a 21km stretch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> Tho River to halt all sampan traffic. At 2217 an American monitor was struck by B-40 rocket rounds that penetrated the 40-mm. turret. Although seven people, including a RVN interpreter, were wounded, the monitor was able to suppress the communist automatic weapons and small arms fire. The patrols continued throughout the night in an effort to prevent the escape of Vietcong units.|$|E
25|$|Explosive booby traps {{were also}} employed, some command detonated by hidden observers. They ranged from single bullets, to grenades, to dud bombs and shells. Anti-vehicle traps ranged from mines to buried {{artillery}} rounds. Helicopter traps were often deployed in trees surrounding a potential landing zone, triggered by an observer, or the rotor's wash. Booby traps were also made from American and ARVN trash in the field. Discarded ration cans, for example, were loaded with grenades that had pins pulled partially – {{the other end}} connected to tripwire. The sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>can</b> held the pin in place until the tripwire was activated. Discarded batteries and communications wire was also used – the batteries hooked to the waste wire, providing an ignition current to spark the charge of dud or discarded mortar/artillery rounds.|$|E

25|$|The book {{is noted}} for its {{negative}} assessment of {{the response of the}} Nguyễn Dynasty in the 19th century to the colonial challenges facing Vietnam and the failure to modernize, with the Nguyễn instead turning to ultra-orthodox conservative Confucianism. The book presents strident and emotive memorials to the key figures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> Vuong movement of the late 1880s and early 1890s, led by mandarins such as Tôn Thất Thuyết and Phan Đình Phùng, who led guerrillas against the French. The Cần Vương attempted to overthrow the French rule and establish the boy emperor Hàm Nghi as the ruler of an independent Vietnam. The book also analyzes the French social and economic policies in Vietnam, which it regards as oppression. In the book, Phan argues {{for the establishment of a}} nationwide pro-independence front with seven factions or interested groups with a specific motivation to fight the French colonial authorities.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Durbrow {{began to}} advise Diệm to remove Nhu {{and his wife}} from the government, basing his {{arguments}} on a need to cultivate broad popular support to make South Vietnam more viable in the long term. His key suggestions included Nhu being sent abroad as an ambassador and [...] "altering the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cần</b> Lao Party". As Nhu and the Can Lao were a core means of his keeping power, Diệm did not follow Durbrow's advice.|$|E

500|$|Đính once {{described}} himself as [...] "fearless and arrogant" [...] and Diệm's adopted son—the president was a lifelong bachelor. In August 1957, he was appointed commander of the 1st Division based in Huế, the old imperial capital and Cần's base. Đính served there for one year, until he became a one-star general and received a wider-reaching command in August 1958, making him the youngest ever ARVN general. Đính's favour among the Ngô family saw him appointed in 1958 to head the military wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cần</b> Lao, the secret organisation of Vietnamese Catholics loyal to the Ngô family that maintained the family's grip on power.|$|E
500|$|Traveling {{southbound}} on NY590, {{two significant}} movements are restricted {{due to the}} composition of the expressway. One is at Blossom Road in Brighton, where traffic entering NY590 southbound cannot access I-490 due to the location of the exit5 (left exit) flyover, which begins north of the Blossom Road onramp. This movement was possible prior to the reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> of Worms, as the original connection point between the Sea Breeze Expressway and I-490 was south of the Blossom Road interchange. In Irondequoit, there are no southbound exits between East Ridge Road and NY404; thus, there is no access to either NY104 or Norton Street. [...] An access road between NY590 at Titus Avenue and the Irondequoit Bay Bridge was planned to provide access from NY590 southbound to NY104 eastbound and from NY104 westbound to NY590 northbound, but it was never completed.|$|E
