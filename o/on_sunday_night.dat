5|$|The Great Fire {{started at}} the bakery (or baker's house) of Thomas Farriner (or Farynor) on Pudding Lane shortly after midnight on Sunday, 2 September and spread rapidly west across the City of London. The major {{firefighting}} technique of the time was to create firebreaks by means of demolition; this, however, was critically delayed owing to the indecisiveness of Lord Mayor of London Sir Thomas Bloodworth. By the time that large-scale demolitions were ordered <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night,</b> the wind had already fanned the bakery fire into a firestorm that defeated such measures. The fire pushed north on Monday {{into the heart of}} the City.|$|E

It would move from 8:00 PM <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night</b> to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time.

5|$|Molly Holly's final WWE {{pay-per-view}} appearance {{occurred at}} Taboo Tuesday in 2004 as {{she appeared in}} the Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal {{along with many other}} WWE Divas. The fans voted online for the Divas to wear schoolgirl uniforms, as opposed to French maid or nurse outfits. In contrast to the other girls who wore sexy schoolgirl uniforms, Molly wore a demure 1980s-style schoolgirl uniform with large pink panties underneath. Molly failed to win the match when Stratus eliminated her by tossing her through the ropes for the win. Molly's efforts in subsequent attempts to regain the title failed. Due to several wrestlers from the company's women's division being released in late 2004 and the introduction of the Raw Diva Search program, Molly was mostly left off television, only occasionally appearing <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>Night</b> Heat and Raw in losing efforts to the likes of Lita, Victoria, Trish Stratus, and Christy Hemme.|$|E

5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>night,</b> any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

5|$|Edge {{was then}} {{placed in a}} feud against the vampire wrestler Gangrel. During the feud, Gangrel {{introduced}} Christian, Edge's storyline brother, as his ally. Eventually, Gangrel and Christian convinced Edge to join them, {{and the three of}} them formed an alliance known as The Brood. At , The Brood defeated The J.O.B. Squad in a six-man tag team match. At the Royal Rumble, Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match and was eliminated by Road Dogg. The Brood was later abducted and converted into The Undertaker's Ministry of Darkness. In May 1999, the Brood broke away from the Ministry after Christian was attacked by Ken Shamrock and forced to reveal the location of the captive Stephanie McMahon. The Undertaker chose to have Christian punished for his trespass, but Edge and Gangrel stood by him and betrayed The Undertaker, leading to a brief feud with the Ministry. At , the Brood faced Ministry members Bradshaw, Faarooq, and Mideon in a losing effort. At King of the Ring, The Hardy Boyz defeated Edge and Christian in a match to determine the number one contender to the WWF Tag Team Championship, after their first match <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>Night</b> Heat ended in a no-contest.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, Dumas {{suffered}} {{what appeared}} to be a stinger while filming a fight scene for a role in the season finale of the television program Dark Angel. The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as she swung through the move, causing her to land on her neck and shoulders. After she underwent a CAT scan, it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent neck surgery under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her hip to fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>Night</b> Heat as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002. On the April 21, 2003, episode of Raw, as part of a new storyline, she was fired from her position on commentary by General Manager Eric Bischoff after she rejected his advances and his request that she follow in the footsteps of SmackDown!s Torrie Wilson and pose for Playboy.|$|E
5|$|The Colts {{suffered}} their largest {{margin of}} defeat, 34–14, against the Green Bay Packers the following week. Manning threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns (for {{the second time}} in his career; the first was on September 30, 2001 against the New England Patriots). The next week the Colts went into Tennessee on Monday Night Football to face the 6–0 Titans. They led 14–6 in the third quarter, but Tennessee scored 25 unanswered for a 31–21 victory and almost assured the Colts they would not win the AFC South division title {{for the first time in}} six seasons. At 3–4, the Colts opened up November with their annual showdown against the New England Patriots <b>on</b> <b>Sunday</b> <b>Night</b> Football. Tied at 15 in the 4th quarter, Manning set up Adam Vinatieri for a 52-yard field goal that proved to be the winning points in an 18–15 victory. Manning completed 21-of-29 passes for 254 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. The Colts were 4–4 halfway through the season and still alive in the AFC playoff race.|$|E
