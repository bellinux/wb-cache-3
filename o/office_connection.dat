40|$|Television {{technology}} is developing {{at a fast}} pace and 4 K looks set to be common for mainstream TV watching in countries like the US and Japan soon. Unless Australia has a broadband infrastructure plan that can accommodate such technology, we could be left behind. Last week we saw the stratospheric rise of the broadband comparison site, howfastisthenbn. com. au, but two days later we were reminded on Reddit that it was arguably already out of date. Netflix, the video on demand service, which can account for one-third of all US download traffic and represents a mainstream form of US television consumption, will start using " 4 K" Ultra High Definition quality video in 2014. It 2 ̆ 7 s not beyond the realms of reason that 4 K TV will be mainstream in the US by just 2016. Displaying such content right now {{is something of a}} challenge. Just three weeks ago, Samsung launched its first 4 K TV - an 85 -inch behemoth that costs 40, 000. This sits alongside Sony and LG 2 ̆ 7 s 84 -inch equivalents which cost 25, 000 and 16, 000 respectively. Last week LG announced a new 55 -inch version for 7, 000. Overseas, however, Chinese company Seiki priced its 50 -inch 4 K TV at just 1, 500. You can buy it now, in the US, for under 1, 200. In a 4 K world some thought needs to be given to Upload Speeds. It 2 ̆ 7 s all very well consuming content but it needs to be created too. Currently YouTube sees three days of video uploaded to it every minute and that figure is climbing quickly. The rise in Ultra High Definition is boosting the traffic size too. But the problem with copper networks is that upload speeds are dramatically slower than download speeds. The prime reasons for this are noise on the line and the traditional web practice of consuming content over creating it. However, if you 2 ̆ 7 re like me and you recently had to upload a two-minute child 2 ̆ 7 s homework video to YouTube over Telstra 2 ̆ 7 s fastest cable connection, it can take around five hours to complete. Alex Kidman recently lamented that his Ewan McGregor interview took 22 minutes to film and over eight hours to upload using his <b>office</b> <b>connection.</b> While YouTube is a pioneer distributor of 4 K video, one wonders how Australians will be able to contribute to content.

40|$|This paper uses {{household}} panel data from rural Vietnam {{to explore the}} effects of having a relative {{in a position of}} political or bureaucratic power on farmers' agricultural investment decisions. Our main result is that households significantly increase their investment in land improvement as a result of relatives moving into public <b>office.</b> <b>Connections</b> to <b>office</b> holders appear to be important for investment because they strengthen de facto land property rights and improve access to off-farm employment and to informal loans. The findings underline the importance of informal networks for economic behaviour in environments with developing institutions and markets. They also suggest the presence of an untapped potential for economic development: if households without connections could obtain equally strong property rights and access to credit and insurance as the well-connected households, investment levels would rise substantially...|$|R
