25|$|Morphologically {{the breast}} is tear-shaped. The superﬁcial tissue layer (superficial fascia) is {{separated}} from the skin by 0.5–2.5cm of subcutaneous fat (adipose tissue). The suspensory Cooper's ligaments are fibrous-tissue prolongations that radiate from the superficial fascia to the skin envelope. The female adult breast contains 14–18 irregular lactiferous lobes that converge at the nipple. The 2.0–4.5mm milk ducts are immediately surrounded with dense connective tissue that support the glands. Milk exits the breast through the nipple, which {{is surrounded by a}} pigmented area of skin called the areola. The size of the areola can vary widely among women. The areola contains modified sweat glands known as Montgomery's glands. These glands secrete oily fluid that lubricate and protect the nipple during breastfeeding.

25|$|Habituation {{involves}} decreased {{levels of}} attention and responsiveness to a stimulus {{that is no longer}} perceived as being novel. In the realm of olfactory memory, habituation refers to a decrease in responsiveness to an odor as a result of prolonged exposure (restricted to a certain repeated stimulus), which involves adaptation of cells in the olfactory system. Receptor neurons and mitral cells located in the olfactory system adapt in response to odors. This includes the involvement of piriform cortical neurons which adapt rapidly, more completely and selectively to novel odors and are also thought to play a very important role in the habituation of odors. Norepinephrine is considered to {{have an effect on the}} functioning of the mitral cells by increasing their responsiveness.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that memory for odors {{does not have a}} short-term (or working) memory system. The distinction between short- and long-term memory in other sensory modalities has been generally supported by three main lines of evidence: capacity differences between the proposed systems, evidence of differential coding, and differential memory losses in neuropsychological patients. The present paper examines these issues in an effort to establish a similar distinction for the memory of <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Each of these lines of evidence is examined in relation to the literature on olfactory memory. Based on this examination, it seems that there is at least preliminary support from each of these lines of evidence to advocate a distinction between a long- and short-term memory for <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Emphasis is placed upon the qualitative similarity of olfactory memory to other memory systems.

50|$|RHD {{patients}} with left tactile and visual neglect {{were reported to}} exhibit neglect and extinction of olfactory stimuli to the left nostril, {{in spite of the}} anatomically constrained projection of the olfactory input from that nostril to the intact left hemisphere. This ﬁnding was taken to suggest an impaired processing of all inputs from the contralesional side of space, regardless of whether such inputs were primarily directed to the damaged right hemisphere or the intact left hemisphere. Yet this interpretation is questionable because normal subjects appear unable to localize to a nostril a lateralized <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimulus</b> without the aid of an associated stimulation of the crossed trigeminal input from that same nostril. Further, and in keeping with the above notion, on a number of unilateral and bilateral olfactory stimulations those patients identiﬁed the left nostril input correctly, but misplaced it to the right nostril, possibly because of a rightward response bias related to left-sided neglect. Speciﬁcally, when two different stimuli were delivered to each nostril, RHD patients consistently failed to report the stimulus delivered to the left nostril. The olfactory system predominantly projects its ﬁbers ipsilaterally thus these results are evidence supporting the representational theory of neglect. Also patients affected by olfactory extinction showed a large number of displacements in that the correctly identiﬁed stimuli presented to the left nostril were described as being in the right nostril.|$|E

5000|$|Once wasps {{emerge from}} the syconium, they {{have to figure out}} how to get to the fig in which they want to deposit their eggs. [...] Not only that, they need to make sure that the fig they find is {{available}} and acceptable for breeding. In the case of B. psenes, olfactory stimuli drive the wasp to a fig that is available to receive wasp eggs. Figs emit compounds that the wasps can sense. Pentane extracts from figs which are in their receptive-phase will attract B. psenes from at least 5 meters. Upon sensing these signals from a specific syconium, the wasp will approach that fig. The wasps assess the figs before entrance. They do this by holding up their heads and antennae next to the opening of the syconium (the ostiole). The actual attractive substances come from the ostiole. If a wasp detects the signal, it will lower its antennae and will search for the entrance to the fig. Both smell and taste also help actual entrance into a fig once the desired fig has been located. If the wasp does not detect a signal, it will not enter the fig. Instead, it will move on and search for another receptive fig. Because these wasps have such short lives, selection has favored this attraction towards receptive plants to be easily distinguishable from a few meters. Due to the difference in male and female trees, male tree figs are more attractive than female tree figs as caused by selection. This <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimulus</b> is specific for the wasps' host fig (in this case, F. carica), and enables the wasps to distinguish between their host and other fig species.|$|E

In birds, the sense of smell has been considerably underestimated, and very {{little is known about}} the effects of early sensory experience on the regulation of feeding behaviour. We tested the hypothesis that the feeding behaviour of the domestic chicken could be regulated by olfactory learning during the embryonic life. To that end, chicken embryos were exposed to an <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimulus</b> (blend of essential oil of orange and nature identical vanillin) from embryonic day (ED) 12 to ED 20, and chicks were tested between 4 and 9 d of age. In short-term choice tests, at day 4 and 5, chickens previously exposed to a low concentration (LC) of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimulus</b> spent a higher proportion of time eating a familiar or an unfamiliar food bearing the <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimulus</b> compared to non-exposed control chickens.

Localization of the odour source requires not only detection of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimulus,</b> but also other sensory input regarding, e. g. visual and mechanical stimuli.

It is, however, not known where in the central nervous system the integration of information regarding different sensory modalities takes place.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} olfactory cognition is very complicated. Olfactory cognition is initiated by olfactory receptor proteins (odorant receptors), which are activated by <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimuli</b> (ligands). <b>Olfactory</b> receptors are the initial {{player in the}} signal transduction cascade producing a nerve impulse, which is transmitted to the brain. The sensitivity to a particular ligand depends on the expression level of multiple proteins {{involved in the process}} of olfactory cognition: olfactory receptor proteins, proteins that participate in signal transduction cascade, etc. The expression level of each gene is controlled by its regulatory regions, and especially, by the promoter (a region of DNA about 100 – 1000 base pairs long located upstream of the transcription start site). We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms using human whole-genome data from the 1000 Genomes Project and revealed an extremely high level of single nucleotide polymorphisms in promoter regions of olfactory receptor genes and HLA genes. We hypothesized that the high level of polymorphisms in olfactory receptor promoters was responsible for the diversity in regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression levels of olfactory receptor proteins. Such diversity of regulatory mechanisms may cause the great variability of olfactory cognition of numerous environmental <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimuli</b> perceived by human beings (air pollutants, human body odors, odors in culinary etc.). In turn, this variability may provide a wide range of emotional and behavioral reactions related to the vast variety of <b>olfactory</b> <b>stimuli...</b>|$|R

The magnitude of the NWR elicited by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve was measured while 18 subjects (9 women, 9 men) smelled pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral odors.
