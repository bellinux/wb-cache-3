5|$|Barycentric {{subdivision}} is {{an example}} of a subdivision rule with <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> type (that gets subdivided into two edges) and one tile type (a triangle that gets subdivided into 6 smaller triangles). Any triangulated surface is a barycentric subdivision complex.|$|E
5|$|Every 3-colorable graph G that {{contains}} a triangle (that is, has the complete graph K3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of G {{is the same as}} a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, every subgraph of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This also means that K3 is the core of any such graph G. Similarly, every bipartite graph that has at least <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> is equivalent to K2.|$|E
5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a {{rectangular}} area a by b, and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly. The {{sides of the}} rectangle {{can be divided into}} segments of length c, which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> (24/12=2) and five squares along the other (60/12=5).|$|E
5000|$|If a {{triangle}} is alternating, {{it must have}} <b>one</b> increasing <b>edge</b> and <b>one</b> decreasing <b>edge,</b> thus we have an odd number of alternating triangles.|$|R

5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket.|$|E

A second courtyard is located behind the inner building. The renovation {{that took place}} in the 1980s confirmed the theory by which the house was an accessory building partly intended to be a stable and partly a farmer's house.|$|R

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{contention}} {{is that the}} Brown crime scene fingerprint has the appearance of having been rolled, which is the practice of taking a person's inked finger and rolling it on an index card, and not the smudged, bloody and unreadable print as originally reported. Traditionally, after the fingertip is covered in ink from either the suspect's hand being pressed {{on top of an}} ink pad or an ink roller being run across it, the finger is placed on the card on <b>one</b> <b>edge.</b> It is rolled once from <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> to the finger's other edge to produce a large, clear print.|$|E
25|$|A regular path or {{cycle of}} a skew-symmetric graph {{corresponds}} to a path or cycle in the polar graph that uses at most <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> from each subset of edges at each of its vertices.|$|E
25|$|Winding — Two {{films are}} rolled {{together}} into a cylindrical winding.

50|$|In mathematics, and {{particularly}} geometric graph theory, a unit distance graph is a graph formed from {{a collection of}} points in the Euclidean plane by connecting two points by an edge whenever {{the distance between the}} two points is exactly <b>one.</b> <b>Edges</b> of unit distance graphs sometimes cross each other, so they are not always planar; a unit distance graph without crossings is called a matchstick graph.|$|R

25|$|There are 28 six-vertex cycles in the Heawood graph. Each 6-cycle is {{disjoint}} from exactly {{three other}} 6-cycles; among these three 6-cycles, {{each one is}} the symmetric difference of the other two.

40|$|We give {{necessary}} and sufficient {{conditions for a}} weight system on multiloop chord diagrams to be obtainable from a metrized Lie algebra representation, {{in terms of a}} bound on the ranks of associated connection matrices. Here a multiloop chord diagram is a graph with directed and undirected edges so that at each vertex precisely <b>one</b> directed <b>edge</b> is entering and precisely <b>one</b> directed <b>edge</b> is leaving, and each vertex is incident with precisely <b>one</b> undirected <b>edge.</b> Weight systems on multiloop chord diagrams yield the Vassiliev invariants for knots and links. The $k$-th connection matrix of a function $f$ on the collection of multiloop chord diagrams is the matrix with rows and columns indexed by $k$-labeled chord tangles, and with entries equal to the $f$-value on the join of the tangles...|$|R
50|$|A {{hypergraph}} homomorphism is a map {{from the}} vertex set of one hypergraph to another such that each <b>edge</b> maps to <b>one</b> other <b>edge.</b>|$|R
25|$|It {{is desired}} {{to set the}} scope to only trigger on <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> per cycle, so it is {{necessary}} to set the holdoff to be slightly less than the period of the waveform. That will prevent it from triggering more than once per cycle, but still allow it to trigger on the first edge of the next cycle.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{universe}} could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An {{easy way to}} understand this is to consider two-dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is toroidal and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space.|$|E
25|$|Some authors use the Schläfli {{symbol for}} such regular compounds. Others regard the symbol as {{indicating}} a single path which is wound m times around n/m vertex points, such that <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> is superimposed upon another and each vertex point is visited m times. In {{this case a}} modified symbol {{may be used for}} the compound, for example 2{3} for the hexagram and 2{5/2} for the regular compound of two pentagrams.|$|E

25|$|If {{there exists}} a linear {{ordering}} of the cycles in a cycle basis such that each cycle includes at least <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> that {{is not part of}} any previous cycle, then the cycle basis is called weakly fundamental. Every fundamental cycle basis is weakly fundamental (for all linear orderings) but not necessarily vice versa. There exist graphs, and cycle bases for those graphs, that are not weakly fundamental.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the images}} on {{the two sides of}} actual coins are made of raised metal, the toss is likely to {{slightly}} favor one face or the other if the coin is allowed to roll on <b>one</b> <b>edge</b> upon landing. Coin spinning is {{much more likely to be}} biased than flipping, and conjurers trim the edges of coins so that when spun they usually land on a particular face.|$|E
