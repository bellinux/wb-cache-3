You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

The chandeliered room has ten tables for the usual fun and games, plus 30 slot machines lining the walls. Beyond the gambling room are the nightclub's two dining, dancing and show areas. The two areas are distinct: one is outdoors, with tall royal palms rising among and over the tables; the other is indoors and called the Crystal Arch. The Arch is indeed a huge, modernistic arch-like structure, and this area is used in inclement weather (and also when the outdoor area gets so crowded {{that there is no}} more room for customers). Tropicana's total seating capacity: 1,750, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stand at the bar or at the crap table, and the management won't object at all. Because of Tropicana's bucolic surroundings, the producer of the shows, Rodrigo Neira (better known simply as Rodney), can really spread himself. A Tropicana production number is not complete unless it includes at least half the chorus line dancing on catwalks among the trees. The schoolteacher from Paducah is suitable impressed when he sees scantily clad lassies scampering in front of him, to his right, to his left and above him. This is as hard on the neck muscles as watching a tennis match." ...|$|E
