5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X {{is less of}} a {{distinct}} genre, in part because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>practical</b> constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E
5|$|Mersea Fort {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} Captain William Burrell. Guns and {{ammunition}} were kept there in case of a fresh rebellion, with a garrison of 36 men, which was temporarily reinforced by an additional squadron of horsemen and 50 foot soldiers in July 1650. Repairs were made from 1651 onwards, and new accommodation was constructed for the fort's gunners. After an invasion scare in 1655, Mersea was temporarily used to imprison Royalists suspected of planning an insurgency against Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth government. The fort was then demobilised by Cromwell as part of his efforts to reduce defence costs; Burrell was ordered to dismantle the fort but the order was never carried out, partially because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>practical</b> difficulties and because of opposition from the owner of the land. The admiralty court continued to be held in the fort, although it proved much harder to enforce the fishery rules because of the political turmoil.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his projected history of experimental philosophy, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours (referred to as his Optics), in 1772. He paid careful attention to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>practical</b> sections that had made his History of Electricity so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike his History of Electricity, it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the Optics convinced Priestley to abandon his history of experimental philosophy.|$|E
40|$|Although {{musculoskeletal}} disorders {{are the most}} common reason for general practitioner visits, training did not keep pace. Implementation of learning from patients with rheumatologic disorders linked together with <b>the</b> teaching <b>of</b> theoretical knowledge in the preclinical medical education might be an important step forward in <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> quality of care for these patients. The Leiden Medical School curriculum has implemented two non-obligatory real patient learning (RPL) <b>practicals</b> integrated within <b>the</b> preclinical block {{musculoskeletal disorders}}. This study investigates <b>the</b> educational effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>practicals,</b> <b>the</b> expectations students have of RPL, and students’ satisfaction. Participants’ grades on the end-of-block test served as <b>the</b> test results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> educational effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>practicals</b> and were compared with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-participants. Qualitative data was collected by means of questionnaires generated by focus groups. <b>The</b> participants in <b>practicals</b> scored significantly higher at the end-of-block test. <b>The</b> expected effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contact with real patients concerned positive effects on cognition and skills. ‘Contextualizing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory’, ‘better memorizing of clinical pictures’, and ‘understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease’ were the most frequently mentioned effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>practicals.</b> Overall, <b>the</b> participants were (very) enthusiastic about this educational format. <b>The</b> RPL <b>practicals</b> integrated within a preclinical block musculoskeletal disorders are a valuable addition to the Leiden medical curriculum. This relatively limited intervention exhibits a strong effect on students’ performance in tests. Future research should be directed towards <b>the</b> long-term effects <b>of</b> this intervention...|$|R

5|$|We give an acre for a cow or sheep willingly, {{while we}} shut our {{children}} and our chickens up in too limited spaces, and they suffer in consequence. Schools of the future must be provided with estates where the children will be surrounded with many natural and beautiful things. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>practical</b> work was growing food for the school. In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, for staff and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948–55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since.|$|E
5|$|Animators created digital {{versions}} of the battle suits, at times with the soldiers inside them. On the set a 3D scanner booth digitized the actors, while hand scanners captured the textures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>practical</b> suits. Imageworks received pieces of the suits for reference. The company's library of reflection data on various materials helped enhance the armor's shading. SPI's crew created the base at Heathrow by merging the set at Leavesden with digitally altered footage from the airport; the film's drop ships, barracks and mess halls, replaced the existing aircraft. Framestore created the digital Paris and recreated it with photomodeling from three days of visits. Given {{that the city is}} a no-fly zone, Framestore's artists obtained their aerial images by climbing an 80-meter crane parked in the Louvre courtyard. The quadcopter dropships were based on the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey that can tilt its rotors to fly as either planes or helicopters, while having a design closer to the Quad TiltRotor. Aside from the crashed ship on the beachhead and a gimbal set to depict the plane used by Cage's squad, the film used digital models for most ships. The computer-generated dropships had some of Imageworks' heaviest detail given the proximity of the actors to the aircraft in the camp scenes; the effects artists wanted to make sure the ships broke apart in a realistic way during the crashes.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} surviving mathematical treatises of ancient China is the Book on Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu), part of the Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts dated 202 to 186 BCE and found in Jiangling County, Hubei. Another mathematical text compiled during the Han was The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing), dated no earlier than the 1st century BCE (from perhaps multiple authors) and contained materials similar to those described by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, yet the zhoubi school of mathematics was not explicitly mentioned until Cai Yong's (132–192 CE) commentary of 180 CE. A preface {{was added to the}} text by Zhao Shuang 趙爽 in the 3rd century CE. There was also the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu); its full title was found on two bronze standard measurers dated 179 CE (with speculation that its material existed in earlier books under different titles) and was provided with detailed commentary by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century CE) in 263 CE. It is worth noting in this context that many of the documents excavated from Qin and Han sites contain evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>practical</b> mathematics used by administrators for inventories and taxes, as well as for calculating labor needed for public works projects, just as described in the mathematical treatises.|$|E
