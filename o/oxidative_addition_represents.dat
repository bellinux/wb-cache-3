50|$|<b>Oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> and reductive {{elimination}} are two important and related classes of reactions in organometallic chemistry. <b>Oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> {{is a process}} that increases both the oxidation state and coordination number of a metal centre. <b>Oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> is often a step in catalytic cycles, in conjunction with its reverse reaction, {{reductive elimination}}.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> {{proceeds}} with {{retention of}} stereochemistry with vinyl halides, while giving inversion of stereochemistry with allylic and benzylic halides.

50|$|In {{classical}} organometallic chemistry, {{the formal}} oxidation {{state of the}} metal and the electron count of the complex both increase by two. One-electron changes are also possible and in fact some <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> reactions proceed via series of 1e changes. Although <b>oxidative</b> <b>additions</b> can occur with the insertion of a metal into many different substrates, <b>oxidative</b> <b>additions</b> are most commonly seen with H-H, H-X, and C-X bonds because these substrates are most relevant to commercial applications.|$|R

40|$|Density {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations {{have been}} used to study the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of aryl halides to complexes of the type [Ni(PMenPh(3 -n)) 4], revealing the crucial role of an open shell singlet transition state for halide abstraction. The formation of NiI versus NiII has been rationalised through the study of three different pathways: (i) halide abstraction by [Ni(PMenPh(3 -n)) 3], via an open shell singlet transition state; (ii) SN 2 -type <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> to [Ni(PMenPh(3 -n)) 3], followed by phosphine dissociation; and (iii) <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> to [Ni(PMenPh(3 -n)) 2]. For the case of [Ni(PMe 3) 4], a microkinetic model was used to show that these data are consistent with the experimentally-observed ratios of NiI and NiII. Importantly, [Ni(PMenPh(3 -n)) 2] complexes often have little if any role in the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> reaction because they are relatively high in energy. The behaviour of [Ni(PR 3) 4] complexes in catalysis is therefore likely to differ considerably from those based on diphosphine ligands in which two coordinate Ni 0 complexes are the key species undergoing <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition...</b>|$|R

The organic compounds studied include lactones, epoxides, alkylpalladium(IV) complexes, alkyl halides including a coumarin derivative, and diphenyl diselenide and diphenyl disulphide.

5000|$|In {{organometallic}} chemistry, an unsaturated complex {{has fewer}} than 18 valence electrons {{and thus is}} susceptible to <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> or coordination of an additional ligand. Unsaturation is characteristic of many catalysts because it is usually a requirement for substrate activation. [...] In contrast, a coordinatively saturated complex resists undergoing substitution and <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> reactions.|$|R
50|$|Reductive {{elimination}} {{is sensitive}} {{to a variety of}} factors including: 1) metal identity and electron density; 2) sterics; 3) participating ligands; 4) coordination number; 5) geometry; and 6) photolysis/oxidation. Additionally, because reductive elimination and <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> are reverse reactions, any sterics or electronics that enhance the rate of reductive elimination must thermodynamically hinder the rate of <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ionic {{mechanism}} of <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> {{is similar to}} the SN2 type in that it involves the stepwise addition of two distinct ligand fragments. The key difference being that ionic mechanisms involve substrates which are dissociated in solution prior to any interactions with the metal center.

40|$|The <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of PhX (X = I, Br, Cl) to the {{complexes}} Pd(PtBu 3) 2 (1), Pd(1 -AdPtBu 2) 2 (2), Pd(CyPtBu 2) 2 (3), and Pd(PCy 3) 2 (4) {{were studied}} {{to determine the}} effect of steric properties on the coordination number of the species that undergoes <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> and to determine if the type of halide affects the identity of this species. The kinetic data imply that the number of phosphines coordinated to the complex that reacts in the irreversible step of the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> processes for complexes 1 - 4 depends on the halide more than the steric properties of the ligands. The rate-limiting step of the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of PhI occurred with L 2 Pd(0) in all cases, as determined by the lack of dependence of kobs on [PtBu 3], [1 -AdPtBu 2], and [CyPtBu 2] and the inverse dependence of the rate constant on [PCy 3] when the reaction is initiated with Pd(PCy 3) 3. The irreversible step of the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of PhCl occurred with a monophosphine species in each case, as signaled by an inverse dependence of the rate constant on the concentration of ligand. The irreversible step of the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of PhBr occurred with a bisphosphine species, as signaled by the zeroth-order or small dependence of the rate constant on the concentration of phosphine. Thus, the additions of the less reactive chloroarenes occur through lower-coordinate intermediates than additions of the more reactive haloarenes...|$|R
5000|$|Studies on Vaska's complex helped {{provide the}} {{conceptual}} framework for homogeneous catalysis. Vaska's complex, with 16 valence electrons, is considered [...] "coordinatively unsaturated" [...] and can thus bind to one two-electron or two one-electron ligands to become electronically saturated with 18 valence electrons. The addition of two one-electron ligands is called <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition.</b> Upon <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition,</b> the oxidation state of the iridium increases from Ir(I) to Ir(III). The four-coordinated square planar arrangement in the starting complex converts to an octahedral, six-coordinate product.

40|$|Abstract: In palladium-catalyzed Heck, Stille, or Sonogashira reactions, the nucleophilesâ respectively, alkenes, vinylstannanes or alkynesâare {{involved}} in carbopalladation or trans-metallation steps that follow the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of an aryl halide or triflate to a Pd 0 com-plex. As {{soon as the}} nucleophiles possess a C=C or a Câ¡C bond capable of coordinating the Pd 0 complex active in the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition,</b> they play a dual role since they interfere in the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> by a decelerating effect due to a partial coordination of the active Pd 0 complex. Indeed, its concentration decreases due {{to the formation of}} either unreactive com-plexes (Î· 2 -RCH=CH 2) Pd 0 L 2 (R = Ph, CO 2 Et, L = PPh 3; R = Bu 3 Sn, L = AsPh 3), (Î· 2 -RCH=CH 2) Pd 0 L 2 (OAc) â (R = Ph, L = PPh 3), (Î· 2 -R-Câ¡CH) Pd 0 L 2 (R = Ph, L = PPh 3) or more slowly reactive complexes (Î· 2 -R-Câ¡CH) Pd 0 L 2 (R = CO 2 Et, L = PPh 3), (Î· 2 -RCH=CH 2) Pd 0 L 2 (R = CO 2 Me, L 2 = dppf). Whenever the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> is faster than the ensuing carbopalladation or transmetallation, the decelerating effect of the nucleo-philes in the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> is in favor of a better efficiency for the catalytic cycle by bringing the rate of the fast <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> closer to that of the slow carbopalladation or transmetallation steps...|$|R

40|$|Detailed kinetic {{studies of}} the {{reaction}} of a model Ni 0 complex {{with a range of}} aryl electrophiles have been conducted. The reactions proceed via a fast ligand exchange pre-equilibrium, followed by <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> to produce either [NiIX(dppf) ] (and biaryl) or [NiII(Ar) X(dppf) ]; the ortho substituent of the aryl halide determines selectivity between these possibilities. A reactivity scale is presented in which a range of substrates is quantitatively ranked in order of the rate at which they undergo <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition.</b> The rate of <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> is loosely correlated to conversion in prototypical cross-coupling reactions.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{mechanistic}} studies reported here has revealed fundamental {{information about the}} individual steps of palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions. In one case, the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of PhX (X = I, Br, Cl) to the complexes Pd(PtBu 3) 2 (1), Pd(1 -AdPtBu 2) 2 (2), Pd(CyP tBu 2) 2 (3), and Pd(PCy 3) 2 (4) (1 -Ad = 1 -adamantyl, Cy = cyclohexyl) was studied {{to determine the effect}} of steric properties on the coordination number of the species that undergoes <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> and to determine whether the type of halide affects the identity of this species.

40|$|The <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> {{reactions}} of C-X bonds in alkyl or aryl halides to transition-metal complexes {{are some of}} the fundamental reactions in organometallic chemistry. 1 Reactions involving silicon, however, have received less attention. Recently, <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> reactions involving silicon-halide bonds to a rhodium complex were reported. (PNP) Rh fragment 1 (where PNP is the bis(o-diisopropylphosphinophenyl) amide âpincer â ligand), which is generated from (PNP) Rh (SPri 2), reacts with silyl halides compounds to undergo a silicon-halogen <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> reaction. 2 Fragment 1 is considered convenient for comparative studies because it is compatible with many reactions that provide several kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the reactions. 3, 4 Density functional theoretical (DFT) studies were carried out to determine the Gibbs free energy of the reaction for Si-...|$|R
50|$|In {{most cases}} the <b>oxidative</b> <b>Addition</b> is the rate {{determining}} step of the catalytic cycle. During this step, the palladium catalyst is oxidized from palladium(0) to palladium(II). The palladium catalyst 1 is coupled with the alkyl halide 2 to yield an organopalladium complex 3. As seen in the diagram below, the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> step breaks the carbon-halogen bond where the palladium is now bound to both the halogen and the R group.|$|R
50|$|Reductive {{elimination}} is {{an elementary}} step in organometallic chemistry {{in which the}} oxidation state of the metal center decreases while forming a new covalent bond between two ligands. It is the microscopic reverse of <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition,</b> and is often the product-forming step in many catalytic processes. Since <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> and reductive elimination are reverse reactions, the same mechanisms apply for both processes, and the product equilibrium depends on the thermodynamics of both directions.|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism for this reaction {{has been demonstrated}} to proceed through steps similar to those known for palladium catalyzed C-C coupling reactions. Steps include <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of the aryl halide to a Pd(0) species, addition of the amine to the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> complex, deprotonation followed by reductive elimination. An unproductive side reaction can compete with reductive elimination wherein the amide undergoes beta hydride elimination to yield the hydrodehalogenated arene and an imine product.|$|R
5000|$|Catalyst {{transfer}} polycondensation {{allows for}} the living polymerization of Ï-conjugated polymers and was discovered by Tsutomu Yokozawa in 2004 [...] and Richard McCullough. This was further refined by Ted Pappenfus in 2008 {{with the addition of}} a Grignard catalyst to initiate polymerization. In CTP the propagation step is based on organic cross coupling reactions (i.e. Kumada coupling, Sonogashira coupling, Negishi coupling) top form carbon carbon bonds between difunctional monomers. When Yokozawa and McCullough independently discovered the polymerization using a metal catalyst to couple a Grignard reagent with an organohalide making a new carbon-carbon bond. The mechanism below shows the formation of poly(3-alkylthiophene) using a Ni initiator (Ln can be [...] 1,3-Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp)) and is similar to the conventional mechanism for Kumada coupling involving an <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition,</b> a transmetalation and a reductive elimination step. However, there is a key difference, following reductive elimination in CTP, an associative complex is formed (which has been supported by intra-/intermolecular <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> competition experiments [...] ) and the subsequent <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> occurs between the metal center and the associated chain (an intramolecular pathway). Whereas in a coupling reaction the newly formed alkyl/aryl compound diffuses away and the subsequent <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> occurs between an incoming Ar-Br bond and the metal center. The associative complex is essential to for polymerization to occur in a living fashion since it allows the metal to undergo a preferred intramolecular <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> and remain with a single propagating chain (consistent with chain-growth mechanism), as opposed to an intermolecular <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> with other monomers present in the solution (consistent with a step-growth, non-living, mechanism). The monomer scope of CTP has been increasing since its discovery and has included poly(phenylene)s, poly(fluorine)s, poly(selenophene)s and poly(pyrrole)s.|$|R
50|$|Amines can {{interfere}} with the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> through an accelerating effect brought upon {{to the formation of}} more reactive Pd(0)L(amine) complexes.|$|R
