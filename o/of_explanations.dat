One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering a host <b>of</b> <b>explanations,</b> {{such as a}} possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. The split between Phaner {{and the rest of the}} cheirogaleids is thought to have occurred approximately 38mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43mya.|$|E

40|$|Introduction] The nomothetic {{conception}} <b>of</b> <b>explanation,</b> {{according to}} which all successful explanations must appeal to laws, has dominated the discussion <b>of</b> scientific <b>explanation</b> {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century. The best known formulation of the nomothetic conception <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> is, <b>of</b> course, Hempel’s Deductive-Nomological theory <b>of</b> <b>explanation.</b> While few philosophers today accept the D-N theory <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> in its original formulation, there is widespread consensus that laws play a central role in explanation, even among prominent critics of the D-N model such as Wesley Salmon (see, e. g., Salmon 1984, p. 262) ...|$|R

One important kind of explanatory concern involves asking {{a certain kind of}} “why” question.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{variation}} and selection form <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> can be prescinded from the evolutionary biology home ground {{in which it}} was discovered and for which it has been most developed. When this is done, {{variation and}} selection explanations are found to have potential application {{to a wide range of}} phenomena, far beyond the classical biological ground and the contemporary extensions into epistemological domains. It appears as the form <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> most suited to phenomena of fit. It is also found to participate in multiple interesting relationships with other forms <b>of</b> <b>explanation.</b> We proceed with an examination of multiple kinds of phenomena, interrelationships with other members of the family <b>of</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>explanation,</b> and some novel applications even within the home ground of evolutionary biology. KEY WORDS: evolutionary biology, evolutionary epistemology, explanation, variation and selection Variation and selective retention is the paradigm form <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> for adaptedness in evolutionary biology. This form <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> has also been extended to several other domains, including scientific thought itself. The basic thesis of this paper is that there are many forms <b>of</b> <b>explanation,</b> each appropriate to particular kinds <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> sought, and that variation and selection is a general form <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> that is appropriate for explaining fit:thatall regularized forms of satisfaction between the dynamics of systems and some criterion of “fit ” for those dynamics are, in general, best explicable Don died May 6, 1996, from complications after surgery.

40|$|Standard {{approaches}} to counterfactuals {{in the philosophy}} <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> are geared toward causal explanation.

Using a structural equation framework, we model impossible perturbations to mathematics and the resulting differences made to physical explananda in two important cases <b>of</b> extra-mathematical <b>explanation.</b> We address some objections to our approach...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{philosophical}} {{debate on}} explanation began with Hempel and Oppenheim's 1948 article: Studies in the Logic <b>of</b> <b>Explanation.</b> Hempel and Oppenheim's view: their Deductive-Nomological model <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> for deterministic phenomena, and the Inductive-Statistical model <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> for indeterministic phenomena, were {{for many years}} the received view on the subject. That view has since fallen out of favour, however, and in its wake, many alternative models have been proposed. Of these, Peter Railton's Deductive-Nomological-Probabilistic model represents an exceptionally promising proposal. In this thesis, I argue that while we should accept the essentials of Railton's account, we should not endorse it in its totality. Railton's account <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> forces us to ascribe to a hard form of reductionism. It also forces us to accept a propensity interpretation of probability and a causal interpretation of irreducibly indeterministic phenomena. In this thesis I argue that one {{should not have to}} engage in these metaphysical debates [...] that an account <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> should be neutral with respect to these issues...|$|R

These include {{the fact that many}} Somalis enter the British education system late due to their arrival as refugees and have had their education interrupted, stereotyping and a lack of cultural awareness on the part of school staff, an inability of parents to offer sufficient support due to lack of knowledge of the system and lack of maternal literacy, poverty and overcrowding in Somali homes, and a lack of role models. Lack of English language ability is a key factor. In the London Borough of Lambeth, around 87 per cent of Somali pupils are not fluent in English.|$|E

25|$|This {{historic}} intuition {{is therefore}} mathematical intuition. For Poincaré, it {{is a result}} of the principle of least effort, that is, of a link to scientific convention based on experimentation. Convention, thus given a context, permits one to consider different theories of the same problem, and subsequently make a choice based on the degree of simplicity and usefulness <b>of</b> <b>explanations</b> advanced by each of these theories (see also Occam's razor). The example chosen by Poincaré is that of three-dimensional space. He shows how the representation of this space is only one possibility, chosen for its usefulness among many models that the mind could create. His demonstration rests on the theory of The Mathematical Continuum (1893), one of Poincaré's earlier publications.|$|E
40|$|The {{idea that}} {{psychiatry}} contains, in principle, a series <b>of</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> has been criticised both as empirically false but also, by Campbell, as unintelligible because it presupposes a discredited pre-Humean view of causation. Campbell’s criticism {{is based on}} an interventionist-inspired denial that mechanisms and rational connections underpin physical and mental causation respectively and hence underpin levels <b>of</b> <b>explanation.</b> These claims echo some superficially similar remarks in Wittgenstein’s Zettel. But attention to the context of Wittgenstein’s remarks suggests a reason to reject explanatory minimalism in psychiatry and reinstate a Wittgensteinian notion <b>of</b> level <b>of</b> <b>explanation.</b> Only in a context broader than the one provided by interventionism is the ascription of propositional attitudes, even in the puzzling case of delusions, justified. Such a view, informed by Wittgenstein, can reconcile the idea that the ascription mental phenomena presupposes a particular level <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> with the rejection of an a priori claim about its connection to a neurological level <b>of</b> <b>explanation...</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the social {{sciences}} is to understand social phenomena, that is to exhibit the mechanism underlying and bringing them about. This task goes beyond description: to exhibit this mechanism requires identifying causal relations between variables of interest. In quantitative social research, causal models are used to provide such <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> social phenomena. This paper investigates whether causal models can be seen as models <b>of</b> <b>explanation,</b> and argues that causal modelling, by modelling causal mechanisms, provides (or ought to provide) genuine causal explanations and should be considered as a model <b>of</b> <b>explanation,</b> notably a hypothetico-deductive model <b>of</b> <b>explanation...</b>|$|R

25|$|Pretext for Mass Murder by {{historian}} John Roosa is a {{work that}} traces a historical path through the 1965 incidents, painting a scenario <b>of</b> <b>explanations</b> for what preceded, caused and followed the political coup. It focuses on several aspects of the coup such as the incoherence of facts and the incompetence of coup organizers to provide four main interpretations of the coup:(1) the movement as an attempted coup d’etat by the PKI, (2) the movement as a mutiny of junior officers, (3) the movement as an alliance of army officers and the PKI, and (4) the movement as a frame-up of the PKI. It also looks at material previously left unexplored in traditional discussions of the incident to give a reconstruction of the chaos that surrounds {{this period of time}} in Indonesian history.|$|E
25|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>explanations</b> {{for this}} high {{proportion}} of female Somali-born immigrants have been advanced. The IPPR suggests {{that it might be}} due to more men than women being killed in the Somali Civil War, leaving women as refugees, that some Somali men have left Britain for work in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, where their employment prospects are better, and also that some Somali men have left the UK in order to return to Somaliland, whilst their families stay behind to enable the completion of education. The civil war in Somalia resulted in a change in the composition of the Somali population in the UK. Prior to the 1980s, it was primarily composed of single seamen; {{as a result of the}} war it became a refugee community with an increased proportion of women and children.|$|E
25|$|The Babylonian {{defeat at}} Opis and the {{apparently}} unopposed Persian entry into Babylon ended {{the independence of}} Babylonia (although {{there were a number}} of unsuccessful revolts against later Persian rulers). That the Babylonian collapse was swift and apparently total is confirmed by the ancient accounts of Cyrus's campaign in Mesopotamia and corroborating evidence such as cuneiform inscriptions dating to shortly after the Persian conquest. A number <b>of</b> <b>explanations</b> have been advanced for the rapid collapse of the Babylonian state. The Cyrus Cylinder and the roughly contemporary Verse Account of Nabonidus attribute Nabonidus's failure to the desire of the god Marduk to punish a regime that had opposed his will. The strongly anti-Nabonidus tone of these documents, which accused the former king of behaving capriciously and neglecting the worship of the gods, suggests that their authors – the Babylonian priestly elite – were alienated from Nabonidus and may have welcomed a Persian takeover. It is, however, unclear how widely the Persians were supported within Babylonia, as accounts of the invasion and Nabonidus's rule are coloured by Cyrus's subsequent propaganda.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} two notions–the {{shadows and}} the shallows of explanation–in opening up explanation to broader, interdisciplinary investigation. The “shadows <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> ” refer to past philosophical {{efforts to provide}} either a conceptual analysis <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> or {{in some other way}} to pinpoint the essence <b>of</b> <b>explanation.</b> The “shallows <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> ” refer to the phenomenon of having surprisingly limited everyday, individual cognitive abilities when it comes to explanation. Explanations are ubiquitous, but they typically are not accompanied by the depth that we might, prima facie, expect. We explain the existence of the shadows and shallows <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> in terms <b>of</b> there being a theoretical abyss between explanation and richer, theoretical structures that are often attributed to people. We offer an account of the shallows, in particular, both in terms of shorn-down, internal, mental machinery, and in terms of an enriched, public symbolic environment, relative to the currently dominant ways of thinking about cognition and the world. Key words: explanation, theories, concepts, division of cognitive labor, cognitive development 1...|$|R
25|$|However, in {{the wider}} economy, Canada was {{surprisingly}} unhurt by these events. While growth slowed, the economy never actually entered a recession. This {{was the first time}} that Canada had avoided following the United States into an economic downturn. The rate of job creation in Canada continued at the rapid pace of the 1990s. A number <b>of</b> <b>explanations</b> have been advanced to explain this. Canada was not as directly affected by 9/11 and the subsequent wars, and the downward pressure of these events was more muted. Canada's fiscal management during the period has been praised as the federal government continued to bring in large surpluses throughout this period, in sharp contrast to the United States. Unlike the United States no major tax cuts or major new expenditures were introduced. However, during this time, Canada did pursue an expansionary monetary policy in an effort to reduce the effects of a possible recession. Many provincial governments suffered greater problems with a number of them returning to deficits, which was blamed on the fiscal imbalance. 2003 saw elections in six Canadian provinces and in only one did the governing party not lose seats.|$|E

In order to show this, I shall draw a distinction between two possible ways of understanding the notion of simulation, depending on how one views the relation in which a computing system that performs a cognitive task stands to the program that the system runs while performing that task. Next, I shall suggest that the kind <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> that results from simulation is radically different in each case. In order to illustrate the difference, I will point out some prima facie methodological difficulties {{that need to be addressed}} in order to ensure that simulation plays a legitimate explanatory role in cognitive science, and I shall emphasize how those difficulties are very different depending on the notion <b>of</b> <b>explanation</b> involved.
