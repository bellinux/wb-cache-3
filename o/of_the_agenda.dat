Written {{in collaboration with}} Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school voucher program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, NY93 was realigned to use Junction and Upper Mountain Roads instead. As a result, NY270 was {{cut back to}} its {{junction}} with Upper Mountain Road. On November1, 2005, the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure that, if passed, would allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to remove the NY93 designation from Upper Mountain Road, a county-maintained highway, and reassign it to Junction Road (NY270) and Saunders Settlement Road (NY31). The change was intended to eliminate truck traffic on Upper Mountain Road while providing additional capacity to NY93. This part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agenda</b> was passed. NYSDOT obliged to the request in 2006, rerouting NY93 as proposed and truncating NY270 southward to NY31.|$|E
5|$|The Class 93 was {{put into}} service as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agenda</b> {{regional}} train concept. Along with the Class 70 InterCity Express trains in Eastern Norway, the Class 93 would serve the regional services of NSB. Trains were initially put into service in 2000 on the Nordland Line, followed by the Rauma and Røros Line. The trains had several operational problems, some related to humidity, creating situations where the both engines would stop. This caused NSB in 2002 to demand an interior and technical reconfiguration by Bombardier. One year after delivery, six of eleven trains were out of order. To solve the problem, NSB had to rent back used Di3 locomotives from Ofotbanen. NSB had chosen to sell the old locomotives for less than market price, but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase price for the short-term rental back. The brand name Agenda failed, since customers were dissatisfied with the new stock, and NSB chose to discontinue the branding, just calling all former Agenda and Signatur trains regional trains.|$|E

Soon after that agreement however, the First Balkan War broke out {{and most of the}} remaining European territory of the Ottoman Empire was occupied by the Balkan League member states. After the army of the Kingdom of Serbia captured Skopje, Ismail Qemali invited a group of Albanians from the all four Ottoman vilayets that were agreed to be united into the Albanian Vilayet, to attend an All-Albanian Congress in Valona.
