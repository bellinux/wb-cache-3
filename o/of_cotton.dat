5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was <b>of</b> <b>cotton,</b> which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>cotton.</b> Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>cotton,</b> land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

The college has also created two grass variants, Shadow Turf, a drought-tolerant turf grass that thrives in shade, and Tech Turf (marketed as Turffalo), a turf grass with the rich color and texture of Bermuda and the resilience of buffalo grass.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{source of}} funds {{was to be the}} tax on exports <b>of</b> <b>cotton.</b> However, in {{addition}} to the difficulties associated with the blockade, the self-imposed embargo on cotton meant that for all practical purposes the tax was completely ineffective as a fund raiser.

5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> {{mills in}} Manchester itself reached {{a peak of}} 108 in 1853. Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> {{spinning}} by Bolton in the 1850s and Oldham in the 1860s. However, this period of decline coincided {{with the rise of}} the city as the financial centre of the region. Manchester continued to process cotton, and in 1913, 65% of the world's cotton was processed in the area. The First World War interrupted access to the export markets. Cotton processing {{in other parts of the}} world increased, often on machines produced in Manchester. Manchester suffered greatly from the Great Depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture.|$|E
