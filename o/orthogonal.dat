5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for <b>orthogonal</b> components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. <b>Orthogonal</b> components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of <b>orthogonal</b> basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. <b>Orthogonal</b> force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{the sum of}} {{a series}} of <b>orthogonal</b> vectors is {{independent}} of the order in which it is taken.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{analogue}} of an <b>orthogonal</b> matrix is {{a unitary}} matrix.|$|E
25|$|Thus finite-dimensional linear isometries—rotations, reflections, {{and their}} combinations—produce <b>orthogonal</b> matrices. The {{converse}} is also true: <b>orthogonal</b> matrices imply <b>orthogonal</b> transformations. However, linear algebra includes <b>orthogonal</b> transformations between spaces {{which may be}} neither finite-dimensional nor of the same dimension, and these have no <b>orthogonal</b> matrix equivalent.|$|E
25|$|A set of vectors in {{an inner}} product space is called {{pairwise}} <b>orthogonal</b> if each pairing {{of them is}} <b>orthogonal.</b> Such a set is called an <b>orthogonal</b> set. Nonzero pairwise <b>orthogonal</b> vectors are always linearly independent.|$|E
25|$|In linear algebra, an <b>orthogonal</b> matrix or real <b>orthogonal</b> matrix is {{a square}} matrix with real entries whose columns and rows are <b>orthogonal</b> unit vectors (i.e., {{orthonormal}} vectors), i.e.|$|E
25|$|In other words, {{the space}} of {{orthonormal}} bases is like the <b>orthogonal</b> group, but without a choice of base point: given an <b>orthogonal</b> space, there is no natural choice of orthonormal basis, but once one is given one, there is a one-to-one correspondence between bases and the <b>orthogonal</b> group. Concretely, a linear map is determined by where it sends a basis: just as an invertible map can take any basis to any other basis, an <b>orthogonal</b> map can take any <b>orthogonal</b> basis to any other <b>orthogonal</b> basis.|$|E
25|$|The center T of the {{twelve-point}} sphere also {{lies on the}} Euler line. Unlike its triangular counterpart, {{this center}} lies {{one third of the}} way from the Monge point M towards the circumcenter. Also, an <b>orthogonal</b> line through T to a chosen face is coplanar with two other <b>orthogonal</b> lines to the same face. The first is an <b>orthogonal</b> line passing through the corresponding Euler point to the chosen face. The second is an <b>orthogonal</b> line passing through the centroid of the chosen face. This <b>orthogonal</b> line through the twelve-point center lies midway between the Euler point <b>orthogonal</b> line and the centroidal <b>orthogonal</b> line. Furthermore, for any face, the twelve-point center lies at the midpoint of the corresponding Euler point and the orthocenter for that face.|$|E
25|$|A set of k−m {{mutually}} <b>orthogonal</b> m-dimensional latin hypercubes {{of order}} n {{is equivalent to}} a 2-(n, k, n'm−2) <b>orthogonal</b> array, where the indexing columns form an m-(n, m, 1) <b>orthogonal</b> array.|$|E
25|$|The latin squares {{produced}} {{in this way}} from an <b>orthogonal</b> array will be <b>orthogonal</b> latin squares, so the k−2 columns other than the indexing columns will produce a set of k−2 mutually <b>orthogonal</b> latin squares.|$|E
25|$|In Lie group terms, {{this means}} that the Lie algebra of an <b>orthogonal</b> matrix group {{consists}} of skew-symmetric matrices. Going the other direction, the matrix exponential of any skew-symmetric matrix is an <b>orthogonal</b> matrix (in fact, special <b>orthogonal).</b>|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{the spin}} {{representations}} are particular projective {{representations of the}} <b>orthogonal</b> or special <b>orthogonal</b> groups in arbitrary dimension and signature (i.e., including indefinite <b>orthogonal</b> groups). More precisely, they are representations of the spin groups, which are double covers of the special <b>orthogonal</b> groups. They are usually studied over the real or complex numbers, {{but they can be}} defined over other fields.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{from the}} {{previous}} section {{that there is a}} homomorphism from the Clifford group onto the <b>orthogonal</b> group. We define the special <b>orthogonal</b> group to be the image of Γ0. If K does not have characteristic 2 this is just the group of elements of the <b>orthogonal</b> group of determinant 1. If K does have characteristic 2, then all elements of the <b>orthogonal</b> group have determinant 1, and the special <b>orthogonal</b> group is the set of elements of Dickson invariant 0.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>orthogonal</b> {{transformation}} of a k-frame in Rn results in another k-frame, and any two k-frames are related by some <b>orthogonal</b> transformation. In other words, the <b>orthogonal</b> group O(n) acts transitively on V'k(Rn). The stabilizer subgroup {{of a given}} frame is the subgroup isomorphic to O(n'k) which acts nontrivially on the <b>orthogonal</b> complement of the space spanned by that frame.|$|E
25|$|A 2-(v,k,1) <b>orthogonal</b> array is {{equivalent}} {{to a set of}} k−2 mutually <b>orthogonal</b> latin squares of order v.|$|E
25|$|A set of k−3 {{mutually}} <b>orthogonal</b> latin {{cubes of}} order n {{is equivalent to}} a 2-(n, k, n) <b>orthogonal</b> array.|$|E
25|$|The {{projection}} of a vector {{on a plane}} is its <b>orthogonal</b> projection on that plane. The rejection of a vector from a plane is its <b>orthogonal</b> projection on a straight line which is <b>orthogonal</b> to that plane. Both are vectors. The first {{is parallel to the}} plane, the second is <b>orthogonal.</b> For a given vector and plane, the sum of projection and rejection is equal to the original vector.|$|E
25|$|Numerical {{analysis}} {{takes advantage}} {{of many of the}} properties of <b>orthogonal</b> matrices for numerical linear algebra, and they arise naturally. For example, it is often desirable to compute an orthonormal basis for a space, or an <b>orthogonal</b> change of bases; both take the form of <b>orthogonal</b> matrices. Having determinant ±1 and all eigenvalues of magnitude 1 is of great benefit for numeric stability. One implication is that the condition number is 1 (which is the minimum), so errors are not magnified when multiplying with an <b>orthogonal</b> matrix. Many algorithms use <b>orthogonal</b> matrices like Householder reflections and Givens rotations for this reason. It is also helpful that, not only is an <b>orthogonal</b> matrix invertible, but its inverse is available essentially free, by exchanging indices.|$|E
25|$|A term {{rewriting}} system {{is said to}} be <b>orthogonal</b> if it is left-linear and is non-ambiguous. <b>Orthogonal</b> term {{rewriting system}}s are confluent.|$|E
25|$|The <b>orthogonal</b> {{groups and}} special <b>orthogonal</b> groups {{have a number}} of {{important}} subgroups, supergroups, quotient groups, and covering groups. These are listed below.|$|E
25|$|The radical {{plane is}} {{the locus of}} the centers of all the spheres that are <b>orthogonal</b> to all the spheres in a pencil. Moreover, a sphere <b>orthogonal</b> to any two spheres of a pencil of spheres is <b>orthogonal</b> {{to all of them}} and its center lies in the radical plane of the pencil.|$|E
25|$|This {{construction}} is completely reversible and so strength 2, index 1 <b>orthogonal</b> arrays {{can be constructed}} from sets of mutually <b>orthogonal</b> latin squares.|$|E
25|$|The Laguerre polynomials are <b>orthogonal</b> {{with respect}} to the {{exponential}} distribution. Somewhat more general Laguerre polynomial sequences are <b>orthogonal</b> {{with respect to}} gamma distributions.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that two}} {{functions}} which are <b>orthogonal</b> {{with respect to}} one inner product, aren't necessarily <b>orthogonal</b> with respect to another inner product.|$|E
25|$|The {{sum of the}} squared (n-1)-dimensional {{volumes of}} the facets {{adjacent}} to the <b>orthogonal</b> corner equals the squared (n-1)-dimensional volume of the facet opposite of the <b>orthogonal</b> corner.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a pair of {{mutually}} <b>orthogonal</b> latin cubes of order three was given as the 2-(3,5,3) <b>orthogonal</b> array in the Examples section above.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, every bivector can {{be written}} as the sum of two simple bivectors. It is useful to choose two <b>orthogonal</b> bivectors for this, and this is always {{possible}} to do. Moreover, for a generic bivector the choice of simple bivectors is unique, that is, {{there is only one}} way to decompose into <b>orthogonal</b> bivectors; the only exception is when the two <b>orthogonal</b> bivectors have equal magnitudes (as in the above example): in this case the decomposition is not unique. The decomposition is always unique in the case of simple bivectors, with the added bonus that one of the <b>orthogonal</b> parts is zero.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the group}} SO(n) {{is not simply}} connected, the {{representation}} theory of the <b>orthogonal</b> Lie algebras includes both representations corresponding to ordinary representations of the <b>orthogonal</b> groups, and representations corresponding to projective representations of the <b>orthogonal</b> groups. (The projective representations of SO(n) are just linear representations of the universal cover, the spin group Spin(n).) The latter are the so-called spin representation, which are important in physics.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that this}} only works if the basis {e'i} is <b>orthogonal.</b> One {{can show that}} this map is {{independent}} of the choice of <b>orthogonal</b> basis and so gives a natural isomorphism.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>orthogonal</b> {{two-dimensional}} {{coordinate systems}} involving hyperbolas {{may be obtained}} by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping w = z2 transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of <b>orthogonal</b> hyperbolas.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the case}} with latin squares, {{in which there are}} no constraints, the {{indexing}} columns of the <b>orthogonal</b> array representation of a latin cube must be selected so as to form a 3-(n,3,1) <b>orthogonal</b> array.|$|E
25|$|The first {{condition}} {{was found by}} Sonine (and later by Hahn), who showed that (up to linear changes of variable) the classical <b>orthogonal</b> polynomials {{are the only ones}} such that their derivatives are also <b>orthogonal</b> polynomials.|$|E
25|$|In 4D, {{a double}} {{rotation}} symmetry {{can be generated}} as the composite of two <b>orthogonal</b> rotations. It is similar to 3D screw axis which is the composite of a rotation and an <b>orthogonal</b> translation.|$|E

25|$|The other component, <b>orthogonal</b> to the {{direction}} of action of the muscle (<b>Orthogonal</b> force = Total force × sinΦ) is not exerted on the tendon, but simply squeezes the muscle, by pulling its aponeuroses toward each other.|$|E
