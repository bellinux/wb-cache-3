5|$|On defense, the Seminoles {{were led}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> line by nose guard Brodrick Bunkley, who ranked among Florida State's {{historical}} leaders in tackles for loss. Also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> line was defensive end Kamerion Wimbley, {{who was among}} the ACC's leaders in recorded sacks. At linebacker, the Seminoles had A.J. Nicholson, who was a semifinalist for the Butkus Award, traditionally given to the best linebacker in college football.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{defensive}}</b> line, {{defensive tackle}} Jonathan Lewis {{was considered a}} key player. Though limited by a cast protecting a broken pinky finger suffered during Virginia Tech's game against Virginia, Lewis was expected to continue to perform well. Heading into the Sugar Bowl, Lewis had 38tackles, including 10tackles for loss and foursacks. Also <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> line was Darryl Tapp, who led the team in sacks, tackles for loss, and quarterback hurries. Tapp earned first-team All-ACC honors and had 55tackles and one interception during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Youngblood played {{defensive}} end, wearing number 52, for the Gator freshman team. It was {{his first}} experience <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> line, after playing linebacker in high school. As a sophomore, Youngblood played defensive end and defensive tackle (recording 24 tackles and four sacks) while also handling the kicking chores for the Gators, kicking a career-long 42-yard field goal to provide the three-point winning margin in his first collegiate game which was against Air Force.|$|E

5|$|During that period, the Byzantines were {{generally}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive,</b> and suffered some catastrophic defeats {{such as the}} razing of Amorium, the home city of the reigning Byzantine dynasty, in 838. Nevertheless, with the waning of the Abbasid Caliphate's power after 842 {{and the rise of}} semi-independent emirates along the Byzantine eastern frontier, the Byzantines were increasingly able to assert their own power.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, Britain and France {{declared}} war on Germany following the German invasion of Poland. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council decided to stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> along the border, relying on the Maginot Line in helping counter an anticipated German offensive across the German-French border. As neither side made any offensive moves, a Drôle de Guerre (Phoney War) developed as both sides stood-off along the border.|$|E
5|$|Lowell Reese, of Kentucky Roll Call, {{reported}} on September 28, 2015, that the Comer campaign had {{leaked to the}} Herald-Leader emails showing that the husband of Crosbie had {{been in contact with}} the blogger.

5|$|Offside has {{a unique}} {{implementation}} in field lacrosse. Instituted with rule changes in 1921, it limits the number of players that are allowed {{on either side of}} the midfield line. Offside occurs when there are fewer than three players on the offensive side of the midfield line or when there are fewer than four players <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> half of the midfield line (note: if players are exiting through the special-substitution area, it is not to be determined an offside violation).|$|E
5|$|On 16 February, a major German attack {{struck the}} 45th, and nearly {{broke through the}} 179th Infantry on 18 February. Lucas sent famed U.S. Army Ranger leader Colonel William Orlando Darby to assume command of the 157th Infantry, and the Germans were repulsed. The next three months were spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive,</b> with the 45th engaged in trench warfare, alike to that in World War I.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> {{side of the}} ball, reserve Nick Perry {{sustained}} a shoulder injury in practice prior to the Colorado State game that ended his season. On October 2, Nick Saban announced the indefinite suspension of Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, and indicated Landon Collins and Geno Smith would play more in Clinton-Dix's absence. Clinton-Dix's eligibility was reinstated by the NCAA on October 18 after he served a two-game suspension for receiving an improper benefit.|$|E

5|$|The early 1990s {{also served}} up {{a series of}} {{difficult}} experiences and public embarrassment for Jennings. On August 13, 1993, Jennings and Kati Marton publicly announced their separation in Newsday. The couple had previously split in 1987 for four months after Jennings found out that Marton {{was having an affair with}} Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen. In January 1994, he locked horns with his executive producer on World News Tonight, Emily Rooney. The public firing of Rooney made national headlines, and put Jennings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the Battle of Lewes, Montfort had won {{control of}} royal government, {{but after the}} {{defection}} of several close allies and the escape from captivity of Prince Edward, he found himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive.</b> Forced to engage the royalists at Evesham, he faced an army {{twice the size of}} his own. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and his body mutilated. Though the battle effectively restored royal authority, scattered resistance remained until the Dictum of Kenilworth was signed in 1267.|$|E
5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E

5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a better chance of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E
5|$|After the indecisive {{results of}} the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, Fidel Castro claimed that the {{increased}} cost of continuing to fight for South Africa had placed Cuba in its most aggressive combat position of the war, arguing that he was preparing to leave Angola with his opponents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive.</b> According to Cuba, the political, economical and technical cost to South Africa of maintaining its presence in Angola proved too much. Conversely, the South Africans believe that they indicated their resolve to the superpowers by preparing a nuclear test that ultimately forced the Cubans into a settlement.|$|E
5|$|After {{their victory}} over Michigan State in the Capitol One Bowl, Alabama's final team {{statistics}} were released. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> {{side of the}} ball, they ranked third in scoring defense (13.54 points per game), fifth in total defense (286.38 yards per game), tenth in rushing defense (110.15 yards per game) and thirteenth in passing defense (176.23 yards per game). They were also the conference leaders in both scoring and total defense. On offense, nationally the Crimson Tide ranked 18th in scoring offense (35.69 points per game), 22nd in total offense (444.08 yards per game), 27th in passing offense (261.15 yards per game) and 29th in rushing offense (182.92 yards per game).

50|$|Some four {{kilometers}} from <b>the</b> main <b>defensive</b> line and three {{kilometers from}} Tutrakan itself lay <b>the</b> secondary <b>defensive</b> line of <b>the</b> fortress.

With their attention focused almost entirely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main <b>defensive</b> line, <b>the</b> Romanian command largely ignored this secondary line.|$|R

5|$|Although several German states {{initially}} {{sided with}} Austria, they stayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> {{and failed to}} take effective initiatives against Prussian troops. The Austrian army therefore faced the technologically superior Prussian army with support only from Saxony. France promised aid, but it came late and was insufficient. Complicating the situation for Austria, the Italian mobilization on Austria's southern border required a diversion of forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the Third Italian War of Independence on a second front in Venetia and on the Adriatic sea. The day-long Battle of Königgrätz, {{near the village of}} Sadová, gave Prussia an uncontested and decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} {{initially}} {{been told that}} they would be withdrawn from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank. In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>defensive</b> again.|$|E
5000|$|Hargiss {{also ran}} the option pass play (possibly {{the first of}} all time) at the College of Emporia in 1910.
