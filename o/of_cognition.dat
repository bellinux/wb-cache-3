5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas <b>of</b> <b>cognition</b> and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|The {{short-term}} use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple areas <b>of</b> <b>cognition,</b> {{the most}} notable one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view {{is that many of}} the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E
40|$|While {{a number}} of studies have been {{conducted}} into individual employee cognitions and organizational performance, few studies have examined the combined effect of a range <b>of</b> <b>cognitions.</b> This gap in extant knowledge is particularly apparent in the retail sector where store performance and consequently company profitability are largely dependent on the relationship between shopfloor workers and customers. This paper presents the results of a study into the performance implications <b>of</b> work-oriented <b>cognitions</b> <b>of</b> shopfloor workers in the retail sector.

Research subjects of this study were residents age 18 to 65 and living in the Kaohsiung area where the 2009 Kaohsiung World Games was held. A total of 437 effective questionnaires were obtained. Results from this study showed that (1) there was significance between different genders in the <b>cognitions</b> <b>of</b> positive economic impact, the positive as well as negative social-cultural impact, and the positive as well as negative environmental impact; (2) there was significance with different age groups in the <b>cognitions</b> <b>of</b> positive as well as negative economic impact, the positive as well as negative social-cultural impact, and the negative environmental impact; (3) there was significance with different residency spans in the <b>cognitions</b> <b>of</b> positive as well as negative economic, social-cultural, and environmental impact; (4) residents are clearly in support of holding major sports events again in the future...|$|R

25|$|Cognitive {{biology is}} an {{emerging}} science that regards natural cognition as a biological function. It {{is based on}} the theoretical assumption that every organism—whether a single cell or multicellular—is continually engaged in systematic acts <b>of</b> <b>cognition</b> coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a sensory-motor coupling. That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survives {{from one generation to the}} next. And since by Darwinian theory the species of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study <b>of</b> <b>cognition</b> in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems, and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the more we understand the nature <b>of</b> <b>cognition.</b>|$|E

40|$|The article {{acknowledges}} {{the situation of}} methodical crisis in modern research <b>of</b> social <b>cognition</b> related to the domination of reductive approaches that ignore the uniqueness of human psyche. Heuristicity of concepts of cultural-historical theory of psychological development of L. S. Vygotsky, which serves to overcome the apparent inconsistencies is substantiated. Models <b>of</b> social <b>cognition</b> based {{on the principles of}} cultural-historical psychology are described, those being the model <b>of</b> social <b>cognition</b> within phylogenesis <b>of</b> M.

Current situation in the area of mental health is reviewed from the standpoint of cultural-historical psychology, its specifics reflected in the increased burden on reflexive functions, that is, skills lying within the sphere <b>of</b> social <b>cognition</b> is substantiated. Modern psychotherapeutic apparatus directed to compensate social cognition deficits due to various psychiatric disorders is reviewed. The assumption that adolescense is sensitive period for the development of higher forms <b>of</b> social <b>cognition</b> is made, and a summary of researches supporting this assertion is presented. Main contradictions of modern-day maturing are enunciated. To conclude the presented theoretical analysis, a comprehensive multiple-factor model <b>of</b> social <b>cognition</b> is presented based on concepts of cultural-historical theory of L. S.

40|$|ABSTRACT Despite the {{increasing}} prevalence of remarriages {{over the last}} several decades, little work has been done in establishing theories and models specific to remarried couples and stepfamilies. To address this gap, the multidimensional cognitive development model for individuals in stepfamilies was utilized. To evaluate the model, this study tested the consistency tenet, which is central to the model. Consistency <b>of</b> <b>cognitions</b> is assumed to be of primary importance in stepfamily relationships and a balanced system is one that is defined by consistency <b>of</b> <b>cognitions.</b> Data were analyzed from the 2 ̆ 2 Relationship Quality and Stability in Utah Newlywed Remarriages 2 ̆ 2 study. With a sample of 447 husband and wife couples, paired sample t tests and hierarchical regression were completed. The results indicate that individual endorsements of remarriage beliefs are more predictive of remarital outcomes than is consistency <b>of</b> <b>cognitions</b> between husband and wife. A critique of the multidimensional cognitive development model is discussed. Limitations of the current study are addressed and recommendations for future research are given...|$|R

40|$|Trichotillomania (TTM) is characterised by {{the removal}} of one 2 ̆ 7 s hair, causing hair loss. Phenomenological {{research}} on TTM has investigated its associated behavioural and affective factors. Few studies have investigated the possible role <b>of</b> <b>cognitions</b> and beliefs, despite emerging support for cognitive therapies in treating this disorder. This study aimed to explore and describe the cognitions and beliefs {{that contribute to the}} onset and maintenance of hairpulling in TTM. Eight women with TTM participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews to explore their experience <b>of</b> <b>cognitions</b> and beliefs before, during and after typical hairpulling episodes. Interviews were analysed using the qualitative method of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Six superordinate themes of beliefs were identified as important: negative self-beliefs, control beliefs, beliefs about coping, beliefs about negative emotions, permission-giving beliefs, and perfectionism. These preliminary findings suggest that cognitions may {{play an important role in}} TTM phenomenology. Future quantitative research on the role <b>of</b> <b>cognitions</b> and beliefs in TTM in larger samples has the potential to advance cognitive-behavioural models and treatments of this poorly understood disorder...|$|R
5000|$|The {{definition}} <b>of</b> perseverative <b>cognition</b> is: [...] "the repeated {{or chronic}} {{activation of the}} cognitive representation {{of one or more}} psychological stressors".

Importantly, there is a large body of knowledge about the typical constituents <b>of</b> perseverative <b>cognition,</b> such as worry, rumination, repetitive thinking and (negative) mind wandering (reviewed in Watkins, 2008).Perseverative cognition may partly be unconscious.
