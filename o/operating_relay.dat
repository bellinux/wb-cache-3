40|$|A new index {{reliability}} for power system protection by optimizing the relay time operating using multi agent system (MAS) is presented. In the proposed method, the MAS {{consists of two}} agents as follows; first agent is a fault current agent, i. e., to determine the fault current at all points before and after grounding. While, the second agent is the time operating, i. e., to determine the time <b>operating</b> <b>relay</b> before and after modifying the fault current. The simulation implementation is carried out in Iraqi national grid system (132 kV) - Najaf city. The {{results show that the}} failure rate is decreased to 50 % approximation for over current and earth fault relays...|$|E

25|$|Local {{stations}} protested at this proposal, {{arguing that}} their profits would fall, and that local output would also decrease.

If NBN were to take the Nine affiliation, for example, their two relays would offer programs from the Seven and Ten networks, direct from Sydney. This proposal was, however, rejected.|$|R
50|$|Electric motors need {{overcurrent}} protection to prevent damage from over-loading the motor, or {{to protect against}} short circuits in connecting cables or internal faults in the motor windings. The overload sensing devices are a form of heat <b>operated</b> <b>relay</b> where a coil heats a bimetallic strip, or where a solder pot melts, releasing a spring to operate auxiliary contacts. These auxiliary contacts are in series with the coil. If the overload senses excess current in the load, the coil is de-energized.|$|R

An intuition reflected {{in much of the}} literature on anonymous communications is that, as an anonymity network grows, it becomes more secure against a given observer because the observer will see less of the network. In particular, as the Tor network grows from volunteers <b>operating</b> <b>relays</b> all over the world, it becomes less and less likely for a single autonomous system (AS) to be able to observe both ends of {{an anonymous}} connection. Yet, as the network continues to grow significantly, no analysis has been done to determine if this intuition is correct.

The authors examine {{the rise and fall of}} the electro-mechanical robot in the early twentieth century. After exploring the roots and uses of the term ‘robot’, a historical survey of the early landmark robots is provided. Some were controlled remotely by wireless radio signals or by selectively <b>operating</b> <b>relays</b> with whistle tones or by converting sound into light. Long before the invention of the modern digital computer, there were robots working autonomously with simple sensing and open-loop control. There were even learning machines. Many of the machines were inspired by and in turn inspired the development of mechanistic biology in the early twentieth century. The article ends with the demise of the electro-mechanical robot as the computer is developed and the new artificial intelligence takes hold...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as pulse dialing (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the local loop between the telephone exchange and the calling party's telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the rotary dial as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by <b>operating</b> <b>relays,</b> or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of special subscriber trunk dialing equipment. Operators used an earlier type of multi-frequency signaling.|$|R
