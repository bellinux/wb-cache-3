5000|$|In August 2012, Feibush {{spent more}} than $20,000 {{of his own money}} to clean up a {{derelict}} city-owned lot abutting a coffee shop he was opening in Point Breeze. 40 tons of debris were removed and the lot was transformed into a landscaped area with planters, wooden benches, and a redone sidewalk. The following month, the Philadelphia Daily News reported on Feibush's efforts as well as the city government's opposition to his actions. The Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority accused Feibush of trespassing: [...] "Like any property <b>owner,</b> <b>authority</b> does not permit unauthorized access to or alteration of its property." [...] In correspondence with Feibush, the authority threatened to take legal action against him and demanded he immediately return the property to the condition in which he found it. Feibush said he had taken matters into his own hands out of frustration that repeated requests to buy or lease that parcel from the city went unanswered over a number of years. Feibush said he took independent action only after a last ditch effort calling on the city to clean the roughly 30-year vacant lot failed to achieve results. The story of the dispute between Feibush and the city government, which came to be dubbed [...] "lotgate," [...] quickly went [...] "viral," [...] garnering national and international media attention. The city ultimately relented, allowing Feibush to lease the property and maintain it as a public space until the city sells it. In an editorial, The Philadelphia Inquirer said, [...] "It’s clear that Ori's instincts were good in wanting to see an unsightly area spruced up. Indeed, how much better off would other city neighborhoods be if they were permeated by the same spirit? ... While one man's attempt to keep a vacant lot clean was unorthodox, it offers a reminder to City Hall officials that government needs {{to do a better job}} with the properties under its purview." [...] Commenting on the dispute, Philadelphia magazine wrote, [...] "Feibush might be a hero, because he did something that needs to happen more often in Philadelphia: He saw a mess. And he cleaned up the mess.This being Philadelphia, of course he’s in trouble." [...] Undeterred by his conflict with the city government, Feibush has continued to independently clean up vacant, trash-filled city-owned lots in Point Breeze. Within a year of [...] "lotgate," [...] Feibush said, [...] "We've probably cleaned 40 or 50 lots this year." ...|$|E

Korleis går dei som har slike mål fram for å realisera dei? Innleiing og omgrepsbruk: Kommunane kan i hovudsak påverka bustadutbygginga gjennom bruk av planmynde eller eigarmynde. Innleiingsvis blir det gjort reie for at bustadar kan bli rimelege gjennom å ha ein storleik/standard eller plassering som gjer at dei får ein relativt låg marknadspris, gjennom å subsidiera sjølve bustaden eller ved å subsidiera bebuaren. Ein sosial utbyggingspolitikk blir konkretisert gjennom tre punkt: Større tilgang på gode, varige utleigebustadar. Bygging av bustadar som vil få ein låg marknadspris. Bygging av bustadar kor anten sjølve bustaden eller bebuaren blir subsidiert. Teori: Dei tre viktigaste teoriane for oppgåva omhandlar institusjonar, bustadmarknadar og forhandlingar. Institusjonell teori seier noko om kva ramer kommunane opererer innanfor når dei skal prøva å styra utbygginga. Teoriane om bustadmarknadane seier noko om kva prisar bustadar i utgangspunktet vil få, avhengig av delmarknad og avstand frå sentrum. Teori om forhandlingar seier noko om prosessen kor utbyggar og kommunen prøver å bli samde om kva som skal byggast. Metode: Oppgåva er ein casestudie. Fyrst blir det gjennomført ein omfattande dokumentstudie av overordna utbyggingspolitiske dokument i dei 14 norske kommunane som har over 50 000 innbyggarar. Så blir det gjennomført ein djupstudie av dei fire kommunane med breiast sosiale mål og flest verkemiddel i bruk. I kvar av desse kommunane blir det gjennomført semistrukturerte intervju med 3 - 4 politikarar og 2 - 4 administrativt tilsette. Funn: Dokumentstudien viser at det er stor skilnad mellom kommunane sin utbyggingspolitikk langs to dimensjonar. For det fyrste varierer det kor breie sosiale mål kommunane har for utbyggingspolitikken. Nokre har breie mål om å påverka store deler av nybygginga, til det beste for nokså store grupper som slit i bustadmarknaden. For det andre varierer det sterkt kor mange ulike verkemiddel kommunane brukar innanfor område som plansystemet, utbyggingsavtalar, eigarmynde og eigenbygging. Gjennomgåande er det samanheng mellom målbreidde og verkemiddelbruk. Kommunane med breie mål brukar fleire verkemiddel. Plasseringa langs dei to dimensjonane gjer det muleg å gruppera kommunane i ei passiv klynge med smale mål og få verkemiddel i bruk, ei aktiv klynge med breie mål og mange verkemiddel og ei gruppe som plasserer seg rundt midten av begge dimensjonane. Djupstudien avdekkar at det er store skilnadar mellom korleis dei mest aktive kommunane, med nokså like mål, går fram for å realisera måla. Kommunane driv i ulik grad tilrettelegging for nybygging, styring gjennom planmynde og styring og subsidiering gjennom eigarmynde. Serleg varierer bruken av eigarmynde, frå ein kommune som styrer og subsidierer store deler av nybygginga gjennom tomtepolitikken til to kommunar med ein nokså passiv tomtepolitikk. Avslutningsvis stiller oppgåva spørsmål ved kva som kan forklara variasjonen i verkemiddelbruk og styring mellom fire kommunar med nokså like mål. Tre refleksjonar om dette blir presentert. Summary The thesis {{question}} is: Do Norwegian city municipalities {{have agreed}} ends about conducting a social development policy? In that case, {{what types of}} ends? How do they proceed to reach those ends? Introduction and use of concepts: The municipalities can mainly influence house building by using planning authority or <b>owner</b> <b>authority.</b> The introduction explains that housing can be affordable by having a size or standard that gives them a relatively low market prize, through subsidizing the housing or by subsidizing the person living there. Three points specify a social development policy: Higher supply of good, stable rental housing. Development of housing which will get a low market price. Building of housing where the housing itself, or the occupier, is subsidized. Theory: The three most important theories for the thesis are about institutions, housing markets and negotiations. Institutional theory says something about which limits the municipalities acts within when {{they are trying to}} govern the development. Theories about the housing markets say something about what prices housing as a starting point will have, dependent upon what submarkets it belongs to, and distance from the city centre. Theories about negotiations say something about the process where the developer and the municipality try to agree about what should be built. Design: The thesis is designed as a case study. The first part is a comprehensive study of important documents about development policy in all the 14 Norwegian municipalities with more than 50 000 inhabitants. The second part is an in-depth study of the four municipalities with the broadest social ends and most means in use. In each of these municipalities there were conducted semistructured interviews with 3 - 4 politicians and 2 - 4 from the administration. Findings: The document study shows that {{there is a big difference}} between the municipalities development policy along two dimensions. It varies how broad social ends the municipalities have for their development policy. Some have wide reaching ends about influencing large parts of the housing built, to improve the situation for rather large groups that are squeezed in the housing market. Secondly it varies how many means the municipalities use within areas as the planning system, development agreements, ownership authority and their own building projects. In general there is a correlation between how broad the ends are and how many means that are used. Municipalities with broad ends use more means. The localizations along the two dimensions make it possible to group the municipalities into one passive cluster of narrow ends and few means, one active cluster of broad ends and many means, and one cluster near the middle of both dimensions. The in depth study detects big differences between how the most active municipalities, with quite similar ends, proceed to reach those ends. The municipalities do in different degrees accommodate housing developments, govern by planning authority or govern and subsidize by <b>owner</b> <b>authority.</b> The difference is especially big regarding land development policy. One of the municipalities govern and subsidize large parts of the housing stock being built, while two of the municipalities do almost not use ownership of land as a mean in the housing policy at all. At the end the thesis raise the question as to what can explain the variation in use of means and degrees of governing between four municipalities with quite similar ends.
