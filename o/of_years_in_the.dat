5|$|Aboriginal peoples have {{inhabited}} {{what is now}} Manitoba {{for thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 17th century, fur traders arrived in the area when {{it was part of}} Rupert's Land and owned by the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1869, negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada, a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion. The rebellion's resolution led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E

5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are seen}} on Earth {{because of a}} fortuitous {{combination}} of circumstances. Even on Earth, the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary (on a geological time scale) phenomenon. Hundreds of millions <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, the Moon was closer to the Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total {{and there were no}} annular eclipses. Due to tidal acceleration, the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8cm more distant each year. Millions <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future, the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size. Estimates of the when the moon will be unable to occlude the entire sun when viewed from the Earth range between 1.4 billion and 650 million years in the future.|$|E

A ubiquitous agent from Chronopolis—code-named 12—brings her back to the future. The party learn that the Reptite time travelers—named Cakulha, Coyopa, and Yaluk—survived the human world's restoration, and had been manipulated by King Zeal. The party fix the Mystic War by retrieving the Masamune from Kasmir and putting it back in antiquity. In 1005A.D., new diplomatic talks are about to begin. Porre instead launches an assault, backed by King Zeal and Dalton, placed in Porre's high command by the king. King Guardia dies in the attack. The party venture to 11,995B.C. once more with Schala, intent on striking the Frozen Flame in antiquity to lure out King Zeal. This unleashes wild energies, and the party must overcome individual mental assaults by the Flame. King Zeal retreats, and the energies cause Schala to fall into the Darkness Beyond Time, a temporal netherworld. Unsuccessful, the party seek out Gaspar tens of millions <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past (known as the Dreamtime), where he's gone to witness the birth of the planet's consciousness.

5|$|Some of {{the caves}} around Adams {{were subject to}} {{commercial}} ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to Portland and The Dalles in years of short supply elsewhere. Oddly, a “claim” to the cave using mining laws was used {{in order to gain}} exclusive access to the ice. Cheese Cave was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, for a number <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, a bleu cheese similar to the Roquefort produced in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. A legend from the Klickitats regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the “mouse-wife,” they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man’s wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she dug out the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the “mouse-wife” to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the Native American word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.|$|E

5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E
5|$|Their party expands {{to include}} Ayla and Frog after they visit the prehistoric era to repair Frog's sword. They return to AD 600 to {{challenge}} Magus, believing {{him to be}} the source of Lavos; after the battle, a summoning spell causes a time gate that throws Crono and his friends to the past. In prehistory, the group battle the Reptites and witness the origin of Lavos. They learn that Lavos was an alien being that arrived on the planet millions <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, and began to absorb DNA and energy from every living creature before arising and razing the planet's surface in 1999 so that it could spawn a new generation. In 12,000 BC, Crono and friends find that the Kingdom of Zeal recently discovered Lavos and seeks to drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine. However Zeal's leader, Queen Zeal imprisons Crono and friends. Though Zeal's daughter Schala frees them, the Prophet, a mysterious figure who has recently begun advising the queen, forces her to banish them from the realm and seal the time gate they used to travel to the Dark Ages. They return next to AD 2300 to find a time machine called the Wings of Time (or Epoch), which can access any time period without using a time gate. They travel back to Zeal for the Mammon Machine's activation at the Ocean Palace. Lavos awakens, disturbed by the Mammon Machine, and the Prophet reveals himself to be Magus and tries to kill the creature. Crono stands up to Lavos but is vaporized by a powerful blast, after which Lavos destroys the Kingdom of Zeal.|$|E
