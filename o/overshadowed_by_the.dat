5|$|Izdeliye 174TK - A thin-wing {{version of}} the 156 with a Rolls-Royce Derwent engine, but {{performance}} was already <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lower-powered Aircraft 160 so further development abandoned.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics. Olympic football returned at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but was now <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> more prestigious World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Also {{in eastern}} Slavonia, the Lovas {{massacre}} occurred in October and the Erdut massacre in November 1991, {{before and after}} the fall of Vukovar. At the same time, the Škabrnja massacre occurred in the northern Dalmatian hinterland; it was largely <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> events at Vukovar.|$|E
50|$|Their {{season of}} triumph was <b>overshadowed,</b> however, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death of legendary former manager Bill Shankly, 67, {{following}} {{a heart attack}} in late September.|$|R
50|$|The Sussex Stakes {{became a}} 1-mile race for three-year-olds in 1878. The {{previous}} version had been <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> Goodwood Cup and the Stewards' Cup, {{but in its}} modified form it became the most prestigious race at Goodwood.|$|R
50|$|The {{delay in}} getting the Freeman to market limited its sales. Some users were fairly famous, but its release was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> Eminent Solina and Crumar Stringman, both of which had only one {{oscillator}} and were cheaper to make.|$|R
5|$|At home to Juventus, Arsenal won 2–0 with goals from Fàbregas and Henry; {{the match}} was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> return of former captain Vieira. A goalless draw at the Stadio delle Alpi meant the club progressed into the semi-finals against Villarreal.|$|E
5|$|Skopje {{experiences}} {{many environmental}} issues {{which are often}} <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> economic poverty of the country. However, alignment of Macedonian law on European law has brought progress in some fields, such as water and waste treatment, and industrial emissions.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Luxembourg {{was allowed}} to retain its own {{government}} and political system, but all proceedings were <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the Luxembourgish people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on other matters, such as the economy, education, and constitutional reform.|$|E
5000|$|Lacassagne's <b>overshadowing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Lombroso School was {{probably}} due to his insistence {{on the value of}} phrenology, which at that time had become decredited in most scientific circles. Criminology was at the time divided into two main schools - one relative more to [...] "biopsychological" [...] theories stressing the importance of individual traits and aiming at establishing an essential difference between honest citizens and criminals, the other opposed to this medical determinism social determinism, mainly influenced by Durkheim. Lacassagne's approach, which combined both biological and social factors, was too ambiguous to last.|$|R
40|$|In 1680 Cassini {{proposed}} oval curves as alternative trajectories for {{the visible}} planets around the sun. The Cassini ovals were of course <b>overshadow</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Kepler's first law (1609), namely the planets {{move around the}} sun describing conic orbits. Here we describe {{the possibility that the}} Cassini's idea works at larger or smaller scales. Indeed, we consider the Spiric curves (which are a generalization of the Cassini oval) and present the first steps towards a Spiric gravitational theory. We show that from our formalism an ellipse associated with a planet can be obtained as a particular case. Comment: 11 pages, Late...|$|R

5|$|One week later, Michigan {{suffered}} a 48–28 loss to Wisconsin. Robinson passed for 239 {{yards and two}} touchdowns, rushed for 121 yards and two touchdowns, set the Division I FBS record for rushing yards by a quarterback and become the first NCAA player with 1,500 rushing yards and 2,000 passing yards in the same season. However, Robinson's individual performance was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 20-point loss to the Badgers.|$|E
5|$|Simon & Schuster {{released}} The Firebrand on October 1, 1987 in hardcover, and it {{was issued}} in paperback in September 1988. The Firebrand has been <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> popularity of The Mists of Avalon, receiving less attention and critical praise. Reviews of the book ranged from mixed to positive, with many literary critics praising Bradley's ability to give new characterizations to legendary figures. It has been translated into at least twelve languages, beginning with Portuguese and French in 1989.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded him as an unambiguously saintly figure, a status that he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E
5000|$|According to New Zealand's Stage magazine, Rolfe [...] "is {{an actor}} of brilliancy on a {{somewhat}} wide range, a little <b>overshadowed,</b> perhaps, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stars {{with whom he}} has been so long associated, but by no means obscured." ...|$|R
50|$|Many of the resolution's {{articles}} were not fulfilled, since these were opposed by Israel, rejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Arab states, or were <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> war as <b>the</b> 1948 conflict continued until Armistice in 1949 between Israel and Transjordan.|$|R
50|$|I Am a Camera was {{critically}} unsuccessful {{upon its}} release {{in both the}} United Kingdom and the United States, and the film was subjected to restrictive ratings. Long <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> Cabaret, <b>the</b> 1966 stage and 1972 film adaptation of the same source material, contemporary critics have noted the historic interest of this earlier presentation.|$|R
5|$|Aquino was {{succeeded by}} Fidel V. Ramos, {{who won the}} Philippine presidential {{election}} held in May 1992. During this period the country's economic performance remained modest, with a 5–7 percent GDP growth rate. However, the political stability and economic improvements, such as the peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front in 1996, were <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> onset of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. On his Presidency {{the death penalty was}} revived {{in the light of the}} Rape-slay case of Eileen Sarmienta and Allan Gomez in 1993 and the first person to be executed was Leo Echegaray in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from those}} few {{individuals}} kept in zoos and pictured in books, the Sumatran rhinoceros has remained little known, <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> more common Indian, {{black and white}} rhinos. Recently, however, video footage of the Sumatran rhinoceros in its native habitat and in breeding centers has been featured in several nature documentaries. Extensive footage {{can be found in}} an Asia Geographic documentary The Littlest Rhino. Natural History New Zealand showed footage of a Sumatran rhino, shot by freelance Indonesian-based cameraman Alain Compost, in the 2001 documentary The Forgotten Rhino, which featured mainly Javan and Indian rhinos.|$|E
5|$|Dowding's {{insistence on}} waiting for AI led {{directly}} to his dismissal on 24 November 1940. Many historians and writers, including Bowen, have suggested his dismissal was unwise, and that his identification of AI radar as the only practical solution was ultimately correct. While this may be true, the cat's eye force did result {{in a number of}} kills during the Blitz, although their effectiveness was limited and quickly <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> night fighter force. In May 1941 cat's eye fighters claimed 106 kills to the night fighters' 79, but flew twice as many sorties to do so.|$|E
50|$|Set in a 22nd-century Earth <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> mega-corporations, <b>the</b> novel follows John Stranger, a Native American who {{is forced}} from his {{reservation}} home <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Trans-United company {{to work in}} orbital space construction. Stranger’s shamanistic skills become prized by his employer to assist in a race against rival companies to decode an alien transmission containing blueprints for a faster-than-light space drive.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> summit was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> {{riots in}} <b>the</b> city after a {{crackdown}} by police targeting anti-globalisation {{groups and the}} death of a 23-year-old Carlo Giuliani, leading some to talk of a deliberately followed strategy of tension.|$|R
50|$|In 1910 and 1912, Jadlowker {{appeared}} at the New York Metropolitan Opera House, where he proved {{to be one of}} the company's most versatile artists although his performances were <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> those of <b>the</b> great Enrico Caruso.|$|R
5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe {{that some of the}} stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, on the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Blackader was in India, commanding the 2nd Battalion of the Leicesters, which was mobilised for service as part of the 20th (Garhwal) Brigade of the 7th (Meerut) Division. The division was sent to France as part of Indian Expeditionary Force A, seeing its first action in the trenches on 29 October. On 19 December a force under Blackader's command staged a successful attack on the German trenches, though the attack was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the German attack on Givenchy the following day, through which the Leicesters remained in reserve.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners faced much {{adversity}} in the Newcastle region {{because of}} the Australian Rugby League's Newcastle Knights team being already well established in the region. The club played its home games at Topper Stadium and missed out on the finals of the 1997 Super League season, but made the grand final of the World Club Challenge. The team was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Newcastle Knights who won the ARL competition and were admitted into the 1998 re-united competition. The Mariners were disbanded after being {{left out of the}} new competition because they believed that the Hunter region could not support two entities.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the film}} was not a box office success and its release <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> that of <b>the</b> similarly-themed Goodfellas, it was {{received}} positively by most critics. Shot on location in New York City, {{the film was}} inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> real-life Hell's Kitchen gang The Westies.|$|R
50|$|During the Renaissance, {{printing}} of Catasterismi, invariably attributed to Eratosthenes, began early, {{but the work}} was always <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> Hyginus, <b>the</b> only other ancient repertory of catasterisms. Catasterismi was illustrated <b>by</b> woodcuts in <b>the</b> first illustrated edition by Erhard Ratdolt, (Venice 1482). Johann Schaubach's edition of Catasterismi (Meiningen 1791) was also illustrated with celestial maps drawn from another work, Johann Buhle's Aratus (Leipzig, 2 volumes, 1793-1801).|$|R
50|$|Another chevaux-de-frise was {{constructed}} across the Hudson between Plum Point and Pollepel Island, north of West Point. The defenses were never fully completed, and its importance was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> completion of <b>the</b> Great Chain at West Point the following year.|$|R
5|$|Winning the Champions League {{entitled}} Milan {{to compete}} in the 2007 UEFA Super Cup against UEFA Cup winners Sevilla. The match was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death of Sevilla player Antonio Puerta, which raised the possibility that the Super Cup might not go ahead. It did however, Milan beat Sevilla 3–1 to secure their fifth Super Cup victory. Milan's success also entitled them {{to compete in}} the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup. They entered the competition in the semi-finals, defeating Japanese team Urawa Red Diamonds 1–0 to progress to the final where they faced Argentine team Boca Juniors. Milan won the match 4–2 to secure their first FIFA Club World Cup triumph.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} first three matches of the 1906–07 season due to cricketing commitments, Bell was chosen to replace McFarlane for the visit of Nottingham Forest on 15 September 1906. Two weeks later he scored twice in the 4–0 home win over Burton United, {{and went on to}} score three more goals in his next four appearances, {{including}} a late winner away at Leeds City. However, the victory was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news that Leeds forward Soldier Wilson had died after collapsing during the match. Bell went on to score a total of 12 goals in 1906–07, his highest return in a single season. His performances for Burnley led to a call-up from the England amateur team in April 1907, and he won his first cap in the 8–1 defeat of the Netherlands in The Hague. In the match, he played alongside full England internationals Harold Hardman and Vivian Woodward, who, like Bell, was a professional architect.|$|E
5|$|As holders and {{participants}} {{of the top}} division, Arsenal entered the FA Cup in the third round, {{in which they were}} drawn to play Preston North End of the Second Division. Despite being 2–0 down in the first half, Arsenal came back to win the match 4–2 at Deepdale. In the fourth round, Arsenal played Wolverhampton Wanderers – a repeat of last year's semi-final. Goals from Overmars and Bergkamp helped Arsenal win 2–1; the match was <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sending off of midfielder Petit. A fifth round tie against Sheffield United was replayed on 23 February 1999 at the suggestion of Wenger. The winning goal, scored by Overmars came from failure to return the ball to the opposition, in order to get defender Lee Morris off the pitch. Arsenal {{went on to win the}} replay 2–1 and a 1–0 victory against Derby County meant the team reached the semi-finals for the second consecutive season.|$|E
50|$|News of the couple's fate, {{which had}} {{previously}} {{been the subject of}} press speculation, was soon <b>overshadowed</b> <b>by</b> events following <b>the</b> Japanese invasion of the Chinese administered areas of the city of Shanghai on 28 January 1932, following the Mukden Incident.|$|R

60|$|As {{the three}} men passed {{out of the door}} it came dimly to Morganson that it was Christmas Eve. That was the date. That was what he had come to Minto for. But it was <b>overshadowed</b> now <b>by</b> <b>the</b> three men themselves, and the fat roll of hundred-dollar bills.|$|R
