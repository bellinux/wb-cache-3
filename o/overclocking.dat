25|$|In 1994, Wang {{released}} the slimline Alliance 750CD 80486 based PC in the United Kingdom. These machines used standard PC/AT keyboards and were entirely IBM compatible, shipping with MSDOS 5.0 and Windows 3.11 as standard. The only unusual feature was that system BIOS settings and the real-time clock were maintained by four standard AA batteries {{as opposed to}} a more typical solutionsuch as a specialty battery pack or lithium battery. While originally offered with a 33MHz 80486DX, the 750CD could be upgraded to later Socket 3 processors such as the 80486DX2 through the use of third party CPU upgrade adapters or interposers. This allowed upgrading to speeds beyond 50MHz without <b>overclocking,</b> or alternatively the potential for speeds in excess of 100MHz with <b>overclocking,</b> dependent on the processor used.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{architectural}} {{difference between}} DDR SDRAM designed for different clock frequencies, for example, PC-1600, designed {{to run at}} 100MHz, and PC-2100, designed to run at 133MHz.

25|$|A Mobile Athlon XPs (Athlon XP-M) using a given core is {{physically}} {{identical to the}} equivalent desktop Athlon XPs counterpart, only differing by the configuration used to achieve a given performance level. Processors are usually binned and selected to become a mobile processor by their ability run a given processor speed while supplied with a lower (than desktop) voltage. This results in lower power consumption, longer battery life, and reduced heat over using a normal desktop part. Additionally Mobile XPs feature not being multiplier-locked and generally higher-rated maximum operating temperatures, requirements intended for better operation within the tight thermal constraints within a notebook PC—but also making them attractive for <b>overclocking.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Most Raspberry Pi chips {{could be}} overclocked to 800MHz, and some to 1000MHz. There are reports the Raspberry Pi2 can be {{similarly}} overclocked, in extreme cases, even to 1500MHz (discarding all safety features and over-voltage limitations). In the Raspbian Linux distro the <b>overclocking</b> options on boot {{can be done}} by a software command running [...] "sudo raspi-config" [...] without voiding the warranty. In those cases the Pi automatically shuts the <b>overclocking</b> down if the chip reaches , but it is possible to override automatic over-voltage and <b>overclocking</b> settings (voiding the warranty); an appropriately sized heatsink is needed to protect the chip from serious overheating.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{spokesman}} Bill Calder, Intel {{has maintained}} only the Celeron brand, the Atom brand for netbooks and the vPro lineup for businesses. Since late 2009, Intel's mainstream processors {{have been called}} Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7, in order of performance from lowest to highest. The first generation core products carry a 3 digit name, such as i5 750, and the second generation products carry a 4 digit name, such as the i5 2500. In both cases, a K {{at the end of}} it shows that it is an unlocked processor, enabling additional <b>overclocking</b> abilities (for instance, 2500K). vPro products will carry the Intel Core i7 vPro processor or the Intel Core i5 vPro processor name.

2500|$|AMD thus {{reworked}} the Thoroughbred's {{design to}} better match the process node {{on which it}} was produced, in turn creating the Thoroughbred-B. A significant aspect of this redesign was the addition of another ninth [...] "metal layer" [...] to the already quite complex eight-layered Thoroughbred-A. For comparison, the competing Pentium 4 Northwood only utilized six, and its successor Prescott seven layers. While the addition of more layers itself does not improve performance, it gives more flexibility for chip designers routing electrical pathways within a chip, and importantly for the Thoroughbred core, more flexibility in working around electrical bottlenecks that prevented the processor from attaining higher clock speeds. The Tbred-B offered a startling improvement in headroom over the Tbred-A, which made it very popular for <b>overclocking.</b> The Tbred-A often struggled to reach clock speeds above 1.9GHz, while the Tbred-B often could easily reach 2.3GHz and above.|$|E

2500|$|The current Mac Mini is {{designed}} to be opened using a round cover {{on the bottom of the}} computer. Prior versions of the Mac Mini were much more difficult to open. Some Mac Mini owners used a putty knife or a pizza cutter to pry open the cases of older models to gain access to the interior for installation of cheaper third party memory upgrades. The official Apple Service Source manual for Mac Mini describes this procedure in detail, including an official Apple part number for a [...] "modified putty knife". It's also possible to use wires to pull the white plastic bottom case out of the metal top case. While opening the case does not actually void the Mac Mini warranty, anything broken while the case is open is not covered. Other modifications include hard disk upgrades, <b>overclocking</b> the processor (G4 only), and upgrading the wireless networking (for older models) to 802.11n. The 2009 model can have its SuperDrive replaced with a second SATA hard drive. The removal of the optical drive in the 2011 models leaves internal space for a second internal hard drive or SSD, which can be ordered as a BTO option from Apple, or as an upgrade kit from 3rd party suppliers.|$|E
