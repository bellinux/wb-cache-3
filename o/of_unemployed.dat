40|$|In {{the face}} of high {{unemployment}} in Europe for the past thirty years, the unemployed have organized themselves and mobilized at levels ranging from the local to the transnational. These contentious movements invite us to revise traditional analyses that conclude that the unemployed {{are not able to}} get mobilized. Through long-term analysis of movements <b>of</b> the <b>unemployed</b> in ten countries (Belgium, Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Switzerland), this work explores why, when, and how the unemployed move from acquiescence to protest.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of the perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>unemployed</b> in 29 European countries along three dimensions: whether people see the unemployed as the ‘government’s responsibility’; whether they believe the unemployed do not ‘try {{hard to find a}} job’; and whether they think that the standard of living <b>of</b> the <b>unemployed</b> is ‘bad’. I derive a number of expectations from the political economy literature on policy preferences and test whether these expectations explain variation in the perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>unemployed.</b> Using logistic regression analysis, I find that labour market status and occupations influence individuals’ perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>unemployed.</b> For instance, the unemployed and workers in low skill occupations are most likely to think that the government is responsible for the standard of living <b>of</b> the <b>unemployed.</b> However, certain factors such as gender, occupations, education, and union membership affect distinct types of perceptions differently. The determinants of policy preferences help us make sense of perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>unemployed</b> but certain factors affect different types of perceptions in distinct ways...|$|R

30|$|The {{increase}} of {{the unemployment rate is}} modeled through reweighting of our samples 6. The weights <b>of</b> the <b>unemployed</b> are increased while those of the employed with similar characteristics are decreased, i.e., in effect, a fraction of employed households is made unemployed. With this reweighting approach we control for several individual and household characteristics that determine the risk <b>of</b> becoming <b>unemployed.</b> The implicit assumption behind this approach is that the socio-demographic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>unemployed</b> remain constant 7.|$|R
5|$|In 1978, a {{dissident}} movement {{of a different}} kind emerged when a group <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> miners led by Vladimir Klebanov attempted to form a labor union and demand collective bargaining. The main groups of Soviet dissidents, consisting mostly of intellectuals, remained aloof, and Klebanov was soon confined to a mental institution. Another attempt a month later to form a union of white collar professionals was also quickly broken up by authorities and its founder Vladimir Svirsky arrested.|$|E
5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool <b>of</b> <b>unemployed.</b> Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E

In response, the strikers resolved to occupy portions of the rail line, and to stop trains from passing unless the company rescinded the wage cuts.|$|E

5|$|There was {{in various}} transatlantic {{countries}} such {{an abundance of}} maize, that the farmers had to burn it as fuel in their railway engines.

5|$|Unemployment was {{particularly}} heavy in Britain's traditional staple export industries—coal mining, shipbuilding, {{iron and steel}} and textiles—all of which were in a slow decline from their Victorian heyday. Because of the concentration of these industries {{in the north of}} England, in Scotland and in Wales, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> persons in these regions was significantly higher, sometimes more than double, than in the south throughout the interwar period. The decline of these industries helped to create pockets of long-term unemployment outside the normal cyclical variations; some workers had no work for years.|$|E

5|$|At the 2001 census, the {{economic}} activity of {{residents in the}} Westgate-on-Sea electoral ward was 32.9% in full-time employment, 12.3% in part-time employment, 7.8% self-employed, 4.3% unemployed, 2.1% students with jobs, 4.3% students without jobs, 18.1% retired, 6.2% looking after home or family, 9.5% permanently sick or disabled and 2.3% economically inactive for other reasons. The percentage of retired people {{was significantly higher than}} the national figure of 14% and the percentage <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> people was high compared with the national rate of 3.4%. The number of permanently sick or disabled people was much higher than the national figure of 5.3%. 12% of residents aged 16–74 had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared with 20% nationwide.

5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|Despite the British {{attack on}} Saint Paul, French frigates {{continued}} {{to operate in}} the Indian Ocean, Hamelin personally leading a cruise in the Bay of Bengal during the autumn. His ships seized a number of small merchantmen and in the Action of 18 November 1809 he personally defeated and captured three large East Indiamen in convoy. Before his squadron and their prizes returned to Île de France in late December, they had also captured the British brig HMS Victor and the large Portuguese frigate Minerva. During the winter few ships were at sea, as the risk of being caught in a seasonal hurricane was considered too severe to operate between December and March. Rowley correspondingly withdrew most of his forces to the Cape of Good Hope, leaving a handful of smaller ships to watch the French islands. Hamelin too kept his forces in harbour at Île de France, replenishing his ships and recruiting sailors from the large pool <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> men in Port Napoleon.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} decade of the 19th century, {{minerals}} such as gold were mined with limited success. The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but panning for gold is still allowed in many areas of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads and accessibility to the region.|$|E
5|$|Following {{two years}} of negotiation, in 1920 the NFWW voted to merge with the National Union of General Workers and become that union's Women's Section. Bondfield, who {{supported}} the merger, believed that provided women could maintain their separate group identity, it was better {{for men and women}} to work together. The secretary of the new section was to have been Mary Macarthur, but she died of cancer on 1 January 1921, the date that the merger came into effect. Bondfield was appointed in her place, and remained in the post (with leave of absence while holding ministerial office) until 1938. To honour her friend, Bondfield helped to organise the Mary Macarthur Memorial Fund. She added other responsibilities to her heavy schedule: chairing the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women's Organisations (SJCIWO), membership of the Labour Party's Emergency Committee on Unemployment, and chairman of the 1922 Conference <b>of</b> <b>Unemployed</b> Women. In September 1923 she became the first women to assume the chair of the TUC's General Council.|$|E
5|$|In July 1809, Hamelin had {{departed}} Île de France for the Bay of Bengal in Vénus, {{accompanied by the}} corvette Créole and the frigate Manche. The frigates were both armed with at least 40 cannon each and the corvette 14. All three ships were crewed by {{a full complement of}} experienced sailors drawn from the pool <b>of</b> <b>unemployed</b> men stranded in Île de France by the British blockade. This force was followed a month later by the similarly sized frigate Bellone. Hamelin's early cruises were successful: operating initially off the Nicobar Islands, Vénus captured the HEIC armed ship Orient on 26 July. After this however, targets became scarcer and despite the capture of a number of small merchant vessels, Hamelin was forced to take his squadron further east and south to find British shipping to attack. On 10 October, he raided the small trading port of Tappanooly on Sumatra, captured its British population and razed the town.|$|E
30|$|The {{coefficient}} of the unemployment misperception is significant and positive—the overestimation of {{the unemployment rate}} is associated with a higher perceived probability <b>of</b> being <b>unemployed</b> in the near future.

30|$|We {{start with}} a base regression, leaving out all trade variables. The results are {{reported}} in the first column of Table  2. They show that the likelihood <b>of</b> becoming <b>unemployed</b> significantly depends on the individual’s qualifications (medium and low skills) and type of contract (part-time, temporary contract). 15 In this respect, we find also {{a positive relationship between}} the individuals’ likelihood <b>of</b> becoming <b>unemployed</b> and a short or medium tenure and for foreigners (typically {{due to a lack of}} local language skills). Married and widowed employees, on the other hand, are associated with a lower probability <b>of</b> becoming <b>unemployed.</b> Note that the coefficient for employment in an ICT-intensive industry or in a GAV industry is not significantly different from zero. The size of the coefficients in Table  2 can be interpreted as follows: Compared to a high-skilled worker, a low-skilled employee bears a 1.3 % higher probability <b>of</b> becoming <b>unemployed.</b>|$|R
