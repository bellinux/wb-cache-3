40|$|In nonequilibrium steady states, <b>the</b> probabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time-reversed <b>paths</b> {{differ in}} general from <b>the</b> <b>path</b> probabilities and they {{decrease}} {{at different rates}} given, respectively, by the time-reversed and standard entropies per unit time. These quantities characterize temporal disorder in <b>the</b> time-reversed <b>paths</b> and <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> themselves. <b>The</b> difference between these quantities gives the thermodynamic entropy production in units of Boltzmann's constant. Out <b>of</b> equilibrium, <b>the</b> temporal disorder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time-reversed <b>paths</b> {{turns out to be}} larger than <b>the</b> temporal disorder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> themselves. In this way, a theorem is obtained according to which <b>the</b> temporal order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> is greater than for <b>the</b> time-reversed <b>paths.</b> <b>The</b> temporal disorder or dynamical randomness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paths</b> and their time-reversal have large-deviation properties directly connected to the thermodynamic entropy production.

5|$|Tornadoes vary in {{intensity}} regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes.

5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane.

However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path.</b> The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E

5|$|Farther to the {{northeast}} in Fayette County, Tennessee, another powerful tornado touched down near the rural community of Yum Yum and quickly reached EF3 intensity. This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an hour earlier. Near the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path,</b> a shed was obliterated and a pickup truck parked inside was thrown 40 feet and mangled, killing a man inside the vehicle. Several other vehicles were tossed, and significant damage to large trees was observed before the tornado crossed into Haywood County. Weakening to EF2 strength, the tornado struck the town of Dancyville, destroying a house, severely damaging another house and a church, and uprooting numerous large trees. The tornado then struck the rural community of Hillville, where two mobile homes were completely destroyed, a frame home was heavily damaged, and a convenience store sustained roof damage. Numerous large trees in this area were snapped, and an outbuilding was flattened. Several other homes along this segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> sustained minor damage. Regaining EF3 strength, the tornado crossed into Madison County, striking the Huntersville community. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed in Huntersville, and two people were killed. A church in town sustained major damage, and a nearby church bus was tossed several hundred feet and flipped upside down. The tornado then exited Huntersville and headed towards the city of Jackson. Several cars and at least 13 tractor trailers were blown off of Interstate 40 by the tornado in this area. One car was tossed 75 yards into a farm field. A rest area along the interstate was severely damaged before the tornado began to weaken and lifted as it approached U.S. Route 412, dissipating just before it would have entered densely populated areas of western and northern Jackson.|$|E

5|$|Officials of the Port of Port Hedland, an {{important}} iron ore exporting terminal, closed and evacuated the port by {{the morning of}} 16 March, operating under standard emergency preparedness procedure.

The Port of Port Hedland reopened to shipping on 18 March, about 52 hours after its closure, {{with little or no}} damage reported, though the downtime drove iron ore prices up for a time, and reduced exports of the raw material by 4.7% compared to the previous month. In total, Lua cost natural resources companies over $217million (2012 AUD; $230million 2012 USD) in stunted industry, accounting for nearly all of the monetary losses resulting from the storm.|$|E

5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E
