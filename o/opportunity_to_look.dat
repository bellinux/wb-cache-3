5|$|During {{production}} Burtt had the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at {{the items}} used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer {{for many of}} their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on WALL-E. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked {{in sync with the}} animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not find one that worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot.|$|E

After several unsuccessful negotiations, he found hope with some men from Yathrib (later called Medina). The Arab population of Yathrib were somewhat familiar with monotheism because a Jewish community existed in that city.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there was}} no orchestra, {{there was no}} space {{separating}} the audience from the stage. The audience could stand {{directly in front of}} the elevated wooden platform. This gave them the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the actors from a much different perspective. They would have seen every detail of the actor and hear every word he said. The audience member would have wanted that actor to speak directly to them. It was a part of the thrill of the performance, as it is to this day.|$|E

Role playing also plays a large role in Gestalt therapy and allows for a true expression of feelings that may not have been shared in other circumstances. In Gestalt therapy, non-verbal cues are an important indicator of how the client may actually be feeling, despite the feelings expressed.|$|E

Being a mathematician and working on the main problems of mathematics, he never missed the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into specific problems in applied science, allowing for experimental proof of theory underlying the physical phenomenon. In 16 years of {{his work at the}} Russian Academy of Sciences, he published 62 works, and 4 more with coauthors, among whom are Leonhard Euler, Johann Euler, Wolfgang Ludwig Krafft, , and Christian Mayer.|$|E

After several unsuccessful negotiations, he found hope with some men from Yathrib (later called Medina). The Arab population of Yathrib were familiar with monotheism and were prepared for the appearance of a prophet because a Jewish community existed there. They also hoped, by the means of Muhammad and the new faith, to gain supremacy over Mecca; the Yathrib were jealous of its importance as the place of pilgrimage. Converts to Islam came from nearly all Arab tribes in Medina; by June of the subsequent year, seventy-five Muslims came to Mecca for pilgrimage and to meet Muhammad. Meeting him secretly by night, the group made {{what is known as the}} [...] "Second Pledge of al-`Aqaba", or, in Orientalists' view, the [...] "Pledge of War". Following the pledges at Aqabah, Muhammad encouraged his followers to emigrate to Yathrib. As with the migration to Abyssinia, the Quraysh attempted to stop the emigration. However, almost all Muslims managed to leave.|$|E

Her focus sharpened in early 1994 {{when it was announced}} that mountain biking would be an Olympic event at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Although she would be 39 then, {{she did not want to}} give the selectors an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> past her. The 1994 domestic mountain bike season was the most competitive yet, with Kate Rattray and the visiting Susan DeMattei providing good competition, but it was 1995 where it counted. Rather than go for another veteran's medal, Lynch entered the Pro race at the 1995 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in Kirchzarten in Germany's Black Forest. Lynch had a fierce start of the cross country race and led the field into the first climb. One by one, younger and full-time professional cylists went past her, and Lynch ended up 21st, with Mary Grigson 33rd, and the other Kiwis further back. They had gained New Zealand two qualifying positions for the Olympics; no New Zealand men qualified. Grigson accepted an offer to race for Australia and left New Zealand (she competed at the Olympics in 1996 and 2000), so the New Zealand Mountain Bike Association decided to nominate just one competitor for the New Zealand Olympic team. The team was announced on 16 April 1996 and Lynch's name came up. This was by no means a foregone conclusion, and Lynch thinks that she was selected against the selection panel's inclinations: ...|$|E

Heather Phares wrote for AllMusic the song [...] "flirts with satire" [...] in its usage {{in the film}} because [...] " [...] threatened by these upstarts from other cliques invading their territory", in reference of Troy and Gabriella's performance. Phares considered its medoly [...] "so bright" [...] and Tisdale and Grabeel's vocals [...] "so relentlessly cheery, {{it sounds like a}} parody of a show tune". A writer for Talkin' Broadway echoed this view, describing the song as [...] "a clever parody of Broadway styles". Chris Willman, for Entertainment Weekly, compared the song with [...] "You Are The Music In Me", a song included in the sequel High School Musical 2. He wrote [...] "both an earnest Troy/Gabriella duet and an insincere (but more fun) showstopper for self-absorbed Sharpay". A reviewer for Common Sense Media highlighted the track. Commenting on the reprise, DVD Verdict said it [...] "is a little soft".
