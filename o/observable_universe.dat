50|$|According to {{the current}} models of big bang nucleosynthesis, the {{primordial}} composition of visible matter of the universe should be about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium-4 (in mass).

Since the other common elementary particles (such as electrons, neutrinos, or weak bosons) are so light or so rare when compared to atomic nuclei, we can neglect their mass contribution to the <b>observable</b> <b>universe's</b> total mass. Therefore, one can conclude that most of the visible mass of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, which, like all baryons, in turn consist of up quarks and down quarks.|$|R

It can be shown that the photon propagator and a cosmic microwave background (CMB) angular correlation function are comparable, and if there exists such a multiverse system, the distance between the two layers can be estimated to be within the <b>observable</b> <b>universe's</b> radius.

5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the <b>observable</b> <b>universe</b> are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

Effectively, all baryonic matter will have been changed into photons and leptons.

40|$|For a flat {{universe}} presently {{dominated by}} static or dynamic vacuum energy, cosmological constant (LCDM) or quintessence (QCDM), we calculate the asymptotic collapsed mass fraction as {{function of the}} present ratio of smooth energy to matter energy R_ 0.

5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly <b>observable</b> <b>universe.</b> This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.|$|E

Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We analyse {{the cosmological}} {{implications}} of brane-antibrane systems in string-theoretic orbifold and orientifold models. In {{a class of}} realistic models, consistency conditions require branes and antibranes to be stuck at different fixed points, and so their mutual attraction generates a potential {{for one of the}} radii of the underlying torus or the 4 D string dilaton. Assuming that all other moduli have been fixed by string effects, we find that this potential leads naturally to a period of cosmic inflation with the radion or dilaton field as the inflaton. The slow-roll conditions are satisfied more generically than if the branes were free to move within the space. The appearance of tachyon fields at certain points in moduli space indicates the onset of phase transitions to different non-BPS brane systems, providing ways of ending inflation and reheating the corresponding <b>observable</b> brane <b>universe.</b> In each case we find relations between the inflationary parameters and the string scale to get the correct spectrum of density perturbations.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a variant of}} the brane-world model in which the universe is the direct product of a Friedmann, Robertson-Walker (FRW) space and a compact hyperbolic manifold of dimension d ≥ 2. Cosmology in this space is particularly interesting. The dynamical evolution of the space-time leads to the injection of a large entropy into the <b>observable</b> (FRW) <b>universe.</b> The exponential dependence of surface area on distance in hyperbolic geometry makes this initial entropy very large, even if the CHM has relatively small diameter (in fundamental units). This provides a possible solution to the cosmological entropy problem. Furthermore, this entropy can be achieved within the holographic limit if the ordinary FRW space is also a compact hyperbolic manifold. In addition, the very large statistical averaging inherent in the collapse of entropy onto the brane acts to smooth out initial inhomogeneities. This smoothing is sufficient to offer an alternative solution of the homogeneity problem of standard cosmology. With only mild fine-tuning, the flatness problem can also be solved. Finally, recent brane-world approaches to the hierarchy problem can be readily realized within this framework. CWRU-P 12 - 00 SU-GP- 00 / 12 -...|$|R
