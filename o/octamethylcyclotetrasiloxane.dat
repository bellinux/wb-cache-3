40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the equilibrium}} anionic polymerization of some cyclic siloxanes is modelled by using neural networks. Feedforward neural networks {{with one or}} two hidden layers have been used to appreciate the rates of disappearance of <b>octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane</b> and aminopropyl disiloxane at different catalyst concentrations (direct modelling). Alternatively, another neural model has been developed to estimate the amount of catalyst, which leads to an imposed final concentration of siloxane (inverse modelling). Experimental data for the polymerization of <b>octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane</b> in the presence of KOH as a catalyst and 1, 3 -bis(aminopropyl) tetramethyldisiloxane as a functional endblocker were used as training data sets for neural models.

These synthesized materials {{were used as}} adsorbents in adsorption test to {{determine the amount of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) namely, 2 -Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), <b>Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane</b> and Alkanes standard solution (C 8 -C 20). The adsorption capacities of both synthesized adsorbents and commercial grade adsorbents (Carbotrap™ B and Carbotrap™ C) were also compared. It was found that adsorbent A 402, which was produced from coconut shell, activated with 40 % (wt.) potassium hydroxide and at activating temperature of 800 °C for 1 hr, could adsorb higher amount of both HEMA and <b>Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane</b> than other synthesized adsorbents. The maximum adsorption capacity of adsorbent A 402 in adsorbing HEMA and <b>Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane</b> were 77. 87 % and 50. 82 % respectively. These adsorption capabilities were 79. 73 % and 70. 07 % of the adsorption capacity of the commercial adsorbent Carbotrap™ B respectively. All three types of the synthesized adsorbent (A 402, C 302, C 402) showed the capability to adsorb alkanes standard solution through the range of C 8 -C 20.

In this article we present accurate measurements of oscillatory solvation forces that arise due to confinement of <b>octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane</b> between an AFM tip and a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface. To measure these forces the cantilever was driven at a very small amplitude (<< 1 nm) with a home-built cantilever holder.

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{electron}} distribution in direct current corona plasmas is combined with a global chemistry model and a two-dimensional transport model to predict the rate of chemical vapor deposition of silicon dioxide on the discharge wire in {{both positive and negative}} discharges in dry air containing <b>octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane.</b> The gas-phase chemistry includes reactions to form atomic oxygen (O) and additional global reactions to form gaseous silicon dioxide precursors by the impact reactions of electrons and atomic oxygen with silicone molecules. Surface chemistry is approximated by a single step global reaction from gaseous to solid silicon dioxide. The rate coefficient between atomic oxygen and <b>octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane</b> is estimated from prior experiments to be on the order of 10 - 12 cm 3 /molecule-s. The effects of discharge polarity, current, wire radius and air velocity (Peclet number for mass transfer) on the deposition rate are considered. Deposition rates can be minimized by using positive coronas instead of negative coronas for Peclet number less than 18. 5. At higher Peclet numbers, the deposition rate is slightly higher in positive corona discharges, but devices used indoors should continue to use the positive corona in order to minimize the production of ozone. The deposition rate in the positive corona is relatively insensitive to air velocity for velocities from 0. 044 to 10 m/s. However, i...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model {{to predict the}} target organ doses of <b>octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane</b> (D 4) after intravenous (IV), inhalation, or implantation exposures. The model used 14 C-D 4 IV disposition data in rats to estimate tissue distribution coefficients, metabolism, and excretion parameters. We validated the model by comparing the predicted blood and tissues concentrations of D 4 after inhalation to experimental results in both rats and humans. We then used the model to simulate D 4 kinetics after single and/or repeated D 4 exposures in rats and humans. The model predicted bioaccumulation of D 4 in fatty tissues (e. g., breast), especially in women. Because of its high lipid solubility (Log P oct/water = 5. 1), D 4 persisted in fat with a half life of 11. 1 days after inhalation and 18. 2 days after breast implant exposure. Metabolism and excretion remained constant with repeated exposures, larger doses, and/or different routes of exposure. The accumulation of D 4 in fatty tissues should {{play an important role}} in the risk assessment of D 4 especially in women exposed daily to multiple personal care products and silicone breast implants.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{distribution}} of low molecular weight silicones in body organs, separate groups of female CD- 1 mice were injected with either breast implant distillate composed primarily of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, <b>octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane,</b> decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, and tetradecamethylcycloheptasiloxane or a polydimethylsiloxane oil containing low molecular weight linear siloxanes. Mice were injected subcutaneously in the suprascapular area and killed at different times. Levels of individual low molecular weight silicones were measured in 10 different organs (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, mesenteric lymph nodes, ovaries, spleen, skeletal muscle, and uterus). In mice treated with the cyclosiloxane mixture and killed at 3, 6, or 9 weeks, highest levels of cyclosiloxanes {{were found in the}} mesenteric lymph nodes, ovaries, and uterus, but all organs examined contained cyclosiloxanes. In a cohort killed at 1 year, most organs contained measurable cyclosiloxanes with highest levels in mesenteric lymph nodes, abdominal fat, and ovaries. Of the individual cyclosiloxanes measured, selective retention of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane relative to <b>octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane</b> was seen in all organs at all time points studied. Organs from animals receiving the linear siloxane mixture were harvested at 9, 12, and 15 weeks.
