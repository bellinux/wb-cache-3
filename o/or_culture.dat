He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E

25|$|Knox’s {{appointment}} at Ellis Island {{allowed him to}} make what was his most significant contribution to medical science. Early in their time at Ellis Island, both Knox and his colleague, Glueck recognized two issues with using the Binet and Simon scales to measure intelligence in emigrants. First, the scale tested semantic knowledge that was specific to geographic location <b>or</b> <b>culture.</b> Individuals from other cultures might not fare well on these tests, and thus the measures could inaccurately classify them as mentally defective, when tests specific to their own location <b>or</b> <b>culture</b> would not. Further, the normative data used for comparing any individual score to an “average” individual {{of the same age}} was based on French or American schoolchildren, which would not be appropriate for determining mental fitness for entering the United States.|$|E
