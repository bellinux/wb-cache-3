5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of the}} 19th century the area which is today Minnesota was not {{recognized}} as a single entity. The Mississippi River had divided the eastern British/French lands of North America from the western Spanish lands and even after the Louisiana Purchase this was for a time seen as a separation between territories. The division between the U.S. territories {{in the region and}} the British territories remained ambiguous until the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which set the border with British North America at the 49th parallel west of the Lake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Woods</b> (except for a small chunk of land now dubbed the Northwest Angle).

40|$|ABSTRACT Brazil is world's greater {{producer}} <b>of</b> charcoal, and <b>the</b> Brazilian state Minas Gerais presents <b>the</b> greater production <b>of</b> said product. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> proprieties influence <b>the</b> charcoal quality, making {{important to}} know them, {{it is known that}} these proprieties vary according to <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree. With that being said, this research aimed to determine the correlations existing between age, <b>the</b> proprieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> and charcoal proprieties. Three Eucalyptus sp. clones from Gerdau S/A were evaluated, at four ages, 3, 4, 5 and 7. From each tree, five discs were removed (0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % corresponding to <b>the</b> commercial height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trunk). We determined the core/sapwood relationship, basic density, chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> <b>the</b> calorific value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charcoal, the gravimetric yields, apparent relative density and charcoal chemical analysis, in addition to <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condensable and non-condensable gases. Correlations between age, proprieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> and charcoal were performed. It was observed a negative correlation between <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> and charcoal ashes content, regardless the clones evaluated. A positive correlation between <b>the</b> basic density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> and <b>the</b> apparent density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coal and a positive correlation between <b>the</b> lignin <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> content and <b>the</b> coal apparent density were observed, as well. The siringil/guaiacil relation, which determines <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> each type of lignin existent on <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> presented a negative correlation with the gravimetric yields in charcoal. Therefore, it is concluded that <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree influenced <b>the</b> proprieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> regardless <b>the</b> clone; <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic material did not influence the gravimetric yield in charcoal; the GG 680 clone presented greater potential to produce charcoal, considering only <b>the</b> proprieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood...</b>|$|R

5|$|There are two {{ornamental}} woods {{within the}} grounds, Summercombe Wood and Luscombe Wood. Luscombe Wood covers an area {{south of the}} house, through the centre of which runs a private road known as The Terrace. The wood is made up primarily of deciduous trees, interspaced with laurels. It also includes an 18th-century pine plantation to the east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> The north-west boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> is Haldon Lane {{and the other side}} of the road is Summercombe Wood. Summercombe has largely been replanted in the latter half of the 20th century, but the original 19th century drive follows a stream through the valley past a pond to a stone bridge to two further areas of nearby woodland. At the west side of Summercombe Wood, there is a 19th-century lodge, Haldon Lodge.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and {{political}} status was disputed.

Ownership of the area between Lake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Woods</b> and Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified {{the border between the}} United States and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's northern border).|$|E
