5|$|British <b>Open</b> <b>Championship</b> Golf is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt {{to hit a}} ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The <b>Open</b> <b>Championship,</b> the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole of a course, and the latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of stroke play, match play or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The <b>Open</b> <b>Championship,</b> which consists of four 18-hole matches.|$|E

50|$|Though Yamazaki {{tried to}} make time to {{practice}} karate while doing television production work, {{it was very difficult}} for him to continue training for the All-Japan Full Contact Karate <b>Open</b> <b>Championships.</b> He made a deliberate decision to retire from the All-Japan <b>Open</b> <b>Championships</b> and reported it to Masutatsu Ōyama after the Fifth All-Japan <b>Open</b> <b>Championships.</b> Yamazaki left a steady record of wins in all of the All-Japan <b>Open</b> <b>Championships</b> in which he participated.

5|$|Looking Glass' {{products}} were praised for innovations in video game technology and design. Several of their successes, such as Flight Unlimited and , sold {{over half a}} million copies each. Poor sales of their final two self-published games— (1996) and British <b>Open</b> <b>Championship</b> Golf (1997)—left the company in financial turmoil, however. This, combined with multiple failed business deals, including a temporary merger with Intermetrics to become Intermetrics Entertainment Software from 1997–99, led the company to close on May 24, 2000 and cancel several projects in development. Its final project, Jane's Attack Squadron, was completed by Mad Doc Software and released by Xicat Interactive in 2002. In total, Looking Glass Studios released 12original games in its 10years of activity, alongside several ports and other spin-offs.|$|E
