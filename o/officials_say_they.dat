Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) raided the house in December 2003 but did not find him.

O'Sullivan said BCTD had been ineffective in organizing new members and stopping the proliferation of nonunion contractors. O'Sullivan made four demands on BCTD: Its leaders must resign and new elections must be held; its budget must be trimmed to permit more money to be spent on organizing; it must alter its proportional representation rules, which give more delegates to smaller unions; and it must revise its rules for determining which unions have jurisdiction over various kinds of work. AFL-CIO <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> agreed to all of O'Sullivan's demands except for the first, arguing that the constitutionally scheduled BCTD elections should occur on schedule.|$|E
