500|$|Although Treehouse of Horror episodes are Halloween-themed, {{for several}} years new episodes premiered in November {{following}} the holiday, due to Fox's coverage of Major League Baseball's World Series. Season 12's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XI" [...] was the first episode to air in November. There have been several references to this in the show, such as in [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIV" [...] where Kang looks at a TV Guide and says, [...] "Pathetic humans. They're showing a Halloween episode... in November!" [...] and Kodos replies [...] "Who's still thinking about Halloween? We've already got <b>our</b> <b>Christmas</b> decoration up." [...] The camera then cuts {{to a shot of}} the fireplace with Christmas decorations, and festive Christmas music plays over the opening credits. Season 21's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XX" [...] aired October 18, before the World Series, but the following year's episode, [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXI", aired in November. Season 23's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXII aired on October 30, however, as the World Series (which went the maximum of seven games) had concluded on October 28. Subsequent Treehouse of Horror episodes have premiered in the month of October.|$|E
500|$|Santa's Little Helper's initial {{appearance}} on The Simpsons {{was in the}} first episode of the series, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which aired on Dec. 17, 1989. Since then, he has become a recurring character. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide in 2000 that [...] "we [...] painted ourselves into a corner with <b>our</b> <b>Christmas</b> episode. Once we wrote the dog into the show, we were stuck with him." [...] The name [...] "Santa's Little Helper" [...] was chosen because, according to writer Al Jean in the same TV Guide article, [...] "we needed a name that would inspire Homer to bet on him, an omen, a Christmas name since he was betting on Christmas Eve. But, at that point, nobody was thinking long-term. We weren't considering what might happen in ten years, when we've got to use this name." [...] Although [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" [...] was the first episode of the series to air on TV, it was the eighth episode produced by the staff. It was chosen to air first because there were animation problems with the others. Jean told the Houston Chronicle in 2001 that after the first episode was broadcast and [...] "the next seven didn't have the dog, people wondered why." [...] He also said in 2003 that the staff enjoyed the first episodes that centered on him, particularly [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which is the reason that more episodes about him were written.|$|E
500|$|... "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] was lauded {{by music}} critics. Parisien called the song [...] "a year-long banger", complimenting its {{instrumentation}} and melody. Steve Morse, editor of The Boston Globe, wrote that Carey sang {{with a lot}} of soul. According to Barry Schwartz from Stylus Magazine, [...] "to say this song is an instant classic somehow doesn't capture its amazingicity; it's a modern standard: joyous, exhilarating, loud, with even a hint of longing." [...] Schwartz praised the song's lyrics as well, describing them as [...] "beautifully phrased," [...] and calling Carey's voice [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "sincere." [...] Kyle Anderson from MTV labeled the track [...] "a majestic anthem full of chimes, sleigh bells, doo-wop flourishes, sweeping strings {{and one of the most}} dynamic and clean vocal performances of Carey's career". While reviewing the 2009 remix version, Becky Bain from Idolator called the song a [...] "timeless classic" [...] and wrote, [...] "We love the original song to pieces—we blast it while decorating <b>our</b> <b>Christmas</b> tree and lighting our Menorah." [...] In his review for Carey's Merry Christmas II You, Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "a simple, well-crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon". Shona Craven of Scotland's The Herald, said, [...] " [...] a song of optimism and joy that maybe, just maybe, hints at the real meaning of Christmas." [...] Additionally, she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject [...] "you" [...] in the lyrics, explaining, [...] "Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it's for absolutely everyone." [...] Craven opened her review with a bold statement: [...] "Bing Crosby may well be turning in his grave, but no child of the 1980s will be surprised to see Mariah Carey's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation's top festive song." [...] In a 2006 retrospective look at Carey's career, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker said, the [...] "charming" [...] song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it [...] "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon". Dan Hancox, editor of The National, quoted and agreed with Jones' statement, calling the song [...] "perfection". In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a [...] "holiday standard." ...|$|E

2500|$|Christmas {{clubs are}} savings programs, {{the first of}} which were offered by various banks in the United States during the Great Depression. The concept is that bank {{customers}} deposit a set amount of money each week into a special savings account, and receive the money back {{at the end of the}} year for Christmas shopping. For decades, financial institutions competed for the holiday savings business, offering enticing premiums and advertising items such as tokens. The Dime Saving Bank of Toledo, Ohio, issued a brass token [...] "good for 25 cents in opening a Christmas account" [...] for 1922-1923. There were also numbered tokens issued by the Atlantic Country Trust Co. in Atlantic City, New Jersey, inscribed on the reverse: [...] "Join <b>our</b> <b>Christmas</b> Club and Have Money When You Need It Most." [...] In the February 2006 issue of Forbes magazine, business writer James Surowiecki summarized the accounts' appeal: [...] "The popularity of Christmas club accounts isn't a mystery; if their money was in a regular account, people assumed they'd spend it." ...|$|E
