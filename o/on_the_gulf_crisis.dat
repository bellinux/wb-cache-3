Specifically, oil firms' accruals are analyzed {{in a period}} of rapid gasoline price increases during <b>the</b> 1990 Persian <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis.</b> Our results show that oil firms that expected to profit from the crisis used accruals to reduce their reported quarterly earnings during <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis.</b> In contrast to previous research, we find that the tendency to release good earnings news early, documented in prior research, is reversed for oil firms during <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis.</b> This finding suggests that the benefit of disclosing "good news" (i. e., earnings increases) early may have been outweighed by the political costs associated with timely releases of the information...|$|R

40|$|POLITICAL STABILITY AND CHANGES AFTER <b>THE</b> <b>GULF</b> <b>CRISIS</b> IN <b>THE</b> UNITED ARAB EMIRATES In {{this thesis}} I define the United Arab Emirates (the UAE) as a ruling monarchy, because the {{political}} system basically shares characteristics with a traditional monarchies. I have pointed at that the monarchy of the UAE is legitimated by {{the legacy of the}} British imperial rule and not by the tradition of kingship in the Arab world. The questions I pose in the thesis are: How can the political stability of the UAE be explained? and Was <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Crisis</b> one of <b>the</b> kinds of challenges that may threaten the survival of the ruling monarchy in the UAE? I argue that the unique combination of external influence (British imperial policy), the relatively enormous oil revenues and a specific local political culture which correspond to a hierarchical way of life explain the political stability of <b>the</b> UAE. <b>The</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Crisis</b> had a dynamic effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> political life of the UAE and did not challenge or threaten the survival of the ruling monarchy. Further, I maintain that prospects for democratization in the UAE after <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Crisis</b> are plausible when one considers the trend towards democratization in other countries in <b>the</b> <b>Gulf.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> one hand, I point to three factors, which may contribute to democratization: US influence upon the UAE concerning defence, economic development involving significant industrialization and global culture. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, I argue that the political actors must respond to more fundamental structural questions as reforms such as solving the question regarding succession, education, taxation, mobilization and assimilation before democratization can be a reality in the UAE...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> 1991 <b>Gulf</b> <b>Crisis</b> and US Policy Means. An Analysis of the Transition from ‘Soft Line’ to ‘Hard Line’ in US Foreign Policy toward Iraq In {{the last}} few months of 1998 the basis of <b>the</b> 1991 <b>Gulf</b> War between Iraq and the US-led Allied {{coalition}} once again occurred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> international agenda. In December 1998 the media attention culminated as the conflict over the implementation of UN Resolutions issued after <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis</b> resulted in <b>the</b> USA and UK bombing strategic targets in Baghdad. In the nearly 8 years since <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> War this was the first serious Western military reaction in the conflict of implementing sanctions. This thesis sets out to explain one aspect of <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis,</b> <b>the</b> basis of the US foreign policy toward Iraq during the 1991 crisis. In doing so it aspires to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} US interest in the conflict and the US role in the solution of the crisis. The main purpose of the thesis is to give an answer to the question: Why did the USA change their policy toward Iraq from ‘soft line’ to ‘hard line’ in <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis?</b> In short, ‘soft line’ in this context refers to the US policy of using economic incentives and diplomatic dialogue to induce an Iraqi policy favourable to the US goals in the region. The ‘hard line’ labels the abrupt change in policy as <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis</b> arose and contains the imposition of economic sanctions and ultimately war against Iraq. The explanatory factors emphasised in the thesis are external, that is the international environment in which the US foreign policy are formed is investigated, rather than the structure of domestic policy-making processes and what influence them. These factors constitute the independent variables of the thesis, also called the context variables. To ease the overview, each of the issues are dichotomised to the situation before and after <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis</b> occurred. What is to be analysed is the transition between the two values of each variable. Considering that the thesis view policy-making a process of continuous mutual influence, this render possible a dynamic analysis in which the outcome of the policy-making process provide the input for the continued policy-making process. The thesis has concentrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following four issues: 1) The structure of the international system, 2) The Arab-Israeli conflict, 3) <b>The</b> <b>Gulf</b> stability and 4) the access to oil. The first part of the analysis accounts for the change in the context of the US policy-making. Respectively, this part reviews; 1) the impact of the end of the Cold War, 2) the Iraqi hostility toward Israel, 3) the Iraqi threat to <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> balance of power and 4) the potential increase in Iraqi economic power resulting from the access to Kuwaiti oil resources in <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis.</b> <b>The</b> second part of the analysis explains how these factors caused the US policy to change from the ‘soft line’ to the ‘hard line’, considering their impact on US national security, autonomy, welfare and status and prestige. The foremost problem in this thesis is not the lack of sources of information, but the bias attached to the majority of the available material. The point of view conveyed in the major part of the sources is American, hence the critical review of the US behaviour is complicated. Another hinder to a comprehensive understanding is that a great part of information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> US decision-making process is classified. During a study trip to Washington DC in February 1998 declassified documents were obtained from the National Security Archives. The documents span the period of 1980 to 1994, but the material relevant to this thesis is scarce after 1989. From this time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thesis have had to rely on official statements and speeches. A critical review of the topic of the thesis would have benefited from access to information still classified regarding the period after 1989. The contention of this thesis is that despite these flaws, it still is possible to shed some light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> US policy. However tentative the conclusions of the thesis may be, the hope is to improve the understanding of how the factors reviewed contributed to the US behaviour in <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>crisis...</b>|$|R
