5|$|Written by ex-teacher Steven Moffat, {{more than}} half the episodes were {{directed}} by Bob Spiers, a noted British comedy director who had previously worked on classics such as Fawlty Towers.

One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated by reading the corresponding chapter {{on each of the}} three days, usually at noon.|$|E

5|$|Rhimes is {{the series}} head writer, or its most {{prolific}} writer. She often promotes the show by answering fan questions on her Twitter account. Other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> staff are Vernoff, Wilding, Peter Nowalk, Stacy McKee, William Harper, Zoanne Clack, Tony Phelan, Joan Rater, and Debora Cahn. From the second through seventh seasons, the writers maintained a blog entitled Grey Matter, where {{the writer of}} an episode discussed the motives behind the writing.

5|$|The Lambda Literary Awards include {{awards for}} science fiction, fantasy and horror. The awards were first {{presented}} in 1989, with separate categories for speculative fiction for {{lesbians and gay}} men. In 1993 these categories were merged and the combined award has undergone several name changes since then. Although the awards are given based on the quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> and the LGBT themes, the author's sexual orientation is also a factor.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the work}} of {{classical}} writers such as Plutarch, knowledge of the Osiris myth was preserved even after {{the middle of the}} first millennium AD, when Egyptian religion ceased to exist and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> systems that were originally used to record the myth were lost. The myth remained a major part of Western impressions of ancient Egypt. In modern times, when understanding of Egyptian beliefs is informed by the original Egyptian sources, the story continues to influence and inspire new ideas, from works of fiction to scholarly speculation and new religious movements.|$|E

5|$|With Anderson serving chiefly as {{executive}} producer, the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> input for Captain Scarlet {{was provided by}} Tony Barwick, who had previously written for the short-lived second season of Thunderbirds. Originally given the role of script editor, Barwick went on to pen 18 of the 32 episodes himself, and was also often required to make substantial changes to other writers' work. While discussing his approach to writing episodes in a 1986 interview, he drew parallels between the premise and characters of Captain Scarlet and those of Thunderbirds, suggesting, for example, that Spectrum was similar to International Rescue and that the character of Captain Black was like the earlier recurring villain from Thunderbirds, The Hood.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter, {{who also}} served as {{executive}} producer and showrunner during the season, wrote or co-wrote {{the bulk of the}} episodes for the season, with nine of the twenty one episodes. Of the nine, four were co-written with executive producer Frank Spotnitz. Carter also wrote five episodes solo, and Spotnitz wrote four episodes solo. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> staff contributed one or two episodes. Vince Gilligan was promoted to executive producer and wrote one episode. John Shiban was promoted to co-executive producer and wrote one episode. David Amann was promoted to producer and wrote one episode. Jeffrey Bell was promoted to executive story editor and wrote one episode. Greg Walker was promoted to executive story editor and wrote two episodes. Steven Maeda was promoted to story editor and wrote two episodes. Daniel Arkin, who wrote a freelance episode for the series previously, returned to contribute to the story for one episode.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by From Hell artist Eddie Campbell, the series' direction {{was taken}} over by Paul Jenkins in 1995. He had been former editor of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and other Mirage Studios lines. He had pitched to several comic houses, having tired of editing, and eventually managed to gain stewardship of Hellblazer, the first largely untested writer to achieve this. Jenkins' run is more traditionally English in its themes, with Albion, Arthurian legend, and old English battles all featuring, and even an appearance by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and a speculative explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> of Kubla Khan, and what the interruption of the 'man from Porlock' may have been. He also returns to Jamie Delano's coverage of anarchist lifestyles, and the effects of the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw raves and large demonstrations.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said a good portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party {{to learn from the}} other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E
5|$|Lilly Wachowski, after {{completing}} her gender transition, {{decided to take}} some time off and did not return as writer or director for the second season, although she remained active as co-creator. Straczynski, who had a very active role during season 1 from pre-production to post-production in order to assist the Wachowskis with their first foray into TV, said his primary involvement in season 2 finished with the completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> phase, as Lana felt this time she had the required experience to tackle the filmmaking aspect of the show on her own. He also said that the second season was designed to explore the mythology of sensates, introduce other clusters, and provide answers to many of the questions viewers had after the first season. Lana {{came up with the idea}} of making the first episode of the second season a two-hour Christmas special, because of her love for such programming in the television shows that she watched as a kid, such as Hill Street Blues, Mork & Mindy, and All My Children. Lana explained she enjoyed watching the lives of the characters in specials intersect with her own and considered birthdays, holidays and celebrations unique events for their ability to make one feel connected but also isolated and alone.|$|E
5|$|Sherlock has {{received}} critical acclaim, with many reviews praising the quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing,</b> performances, and direction. Sherlock {{has been nominated}} for numerous awards including Emmys, BAFTAs and a Golden Globe, winning several awards {{across a variety of}} categories. The show won in three categories at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards including Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for Cumberbatch, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for Freeman and Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special for Moffat. Two years later, it won Outstanding Television Movie. In addition, the show was also honoured with a Peabody Award in 2011. The third series has become the UK's most watched drama series since 2001. Sherlock has been sold to 180 territories.|$|E
