5|$|President Arthur was {{purchased}} in October 1924 by the Jewish-owned American Palestine Line to begin regular service between New York, Naples, and Palestine. On her maiden voyage to Palestine, she reportedly {{became the first}} <b>ocean</b> <b>liner</b> to fly the Zionist flag at sea and the first <b>ocean</b> <b>liner</b> ever to have female officers. Financial difficulties for American Palestine ended the service after three roundtrips, and the liner was sold to the Los Angeles Steamship Company for Los Angeles–Honolulu service. Following three years of carrying tourists and freight, the liner burned in Honolulu Harbor in 1930. She was deemed too expensive to repair and was eventually scrapped in Japan in 1933.|$|E

Rowling's book Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, autographed by the author. In a promotional press release for the event, Cunard said that this {{marked the first time}} a book had been transported to its international launch aboard an <b>ocean</b> <b>liner.</b>|$|E
5|$|The American Palestine Line was a {{steamship}} company, {{formed in}} 1924 in the U.S., {{for the purpose}} of providing direct passenger service from New York to Palestine. It was reportedly the first steamship company owned and operated by Jews. The company negotiated to purchase three ocean liners from the United States Shipping Board, but it was only able to purchase one, , a former North German Lloyd steamer that operated as Princess Alice before being seized by the United States during World War I. After refurbishing the liner, the company inaugurated service between New York and Palestine in March 1925, when President Arthur sailed on her maiden voyage. A crowd of 15,000 witnessed ceremonies that included songs, prayers, and speeches in English and Yiddish. The company claimed that President Arthur was the first <b>ocean</b> <b>liner</b> to fly the Zionist flag at sea and the first <b>ocean</b> <b>liner</b> ever to have female officers.|$|E

In March 1916, UB-13 was responsible for sinking the Dutch <b>ocean</b> <b>liner</b> , raising the ire of the Dutch public. Tubantia was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the war and among the 30 largest ships sunk by U-boats. On 24 April 1916, UB-13 was sunk with all hands.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} in New York on 20 June, George Washington {{was greeted by}} the unfurling of the {{official}} banner of the League of Peace from the Singer Building, and docked at 18:30 at the North German Lloyd piers in Hoboken, New Jersey.

The ship was constructed for eventual {{replacement of the}} aging Queen Elizabeth 2, the Cunard flagship from 1969 to 2004 and the last major <b>ocean</b> <b>liner</b> built before the construction of Queen Mary 2. Queen Mary 2 had the Royal Mail Ship (RMS) title conferred on her, as a gesture to Cunard's history, by Royal Mail when she entered service in 2004 on the Southampton to New York route.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport was}} again {{included}} in the subsequent 1924 games in Paris. The USOC decided to send a team in order to defend their gold medal. Along with the U.S. and the host nation, Romania entered. The American team was again made up of mainly Californian players, seven of whom {{were members of the}} 1920 team. The U.S. squad departed on a seven-day voyage to England on an <b>ocean</b> <b>liner</b> from New York City.|$|E
50|$|Bishop Rock {{is also at}} {{the eastern}} end of the North Atlantic {{shipping}} route used by <b>ocean</b> <b>liners</b> {{in the first half of}} the 20th century; the western end being the entrance to Lower New York Bay.

50|$|During the war, Cherbourg port {{was heavily}} damaged, so large <b>ocean</b> <b>liners</b> {{could no longer}} dock there. Nomadic was saved from the shipbreakers and again {{returned}} to tendering duties for the SCSR from Cherbourg. She served the <b>ocean</b> <b>liners</b> of the day, such as Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth. She finally retired from these duties on 4 November 1968.|$|R
50|$|Nomadic {{was one of}} two vessels {{commissioned}} by the White Star Line in 1910 to tender for their new <b>ocean</b> <b>liners</b> RMS Olympic and RMS Titanic, which were too large to dock in Cherbourg harbour.

After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Ericsson was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Ericsson made several unsuccessful attacks on U-boats, and rescued survivors of several ships sunk by the German craft.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939, Mackay was ranked seventh on the army's seniority list. Following formation of a second infantry division for the Second Australian Imperial Force in 1940, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey was elevated to command of the newly created I Corps. Mackay was selected to command the 7th Division {{on the advice of}} General Sir Brudenell White but Cabinet, after consulting with Blamey, switched this appointment to the 6th Division. Mackay assumed command on 4 April 1940, receiving the serial number NX363, and sailed from Melbourne for the Middle East on the <b>ocean</b> <b>liner</b> RMS Strathaird on 15 April.|$|E
50|$|The {{first serious}} {{attempt to take}} {{a share of the}} transatlantic {{passenger}} market away from the <b>ocean</b> <b>liners</b> was undertaken by Germany. In the 1930s, Germany crossed the Atlantic with Zeppelins that could carry about 60 passengers in a similar luxurious style to the <b>ocean</b> <b>liners.</b> However, the Hindenburg disaster in 1937 put an end to transatlantic Zeppelin flights.|$|R

5|$|Beagle was {{transferred}} to the 19th Destroyer Flotilla {{at the beginning of the}} war and spent her time until April 1940 escorting convoys and patrolling in the English Channel and the North Sea aside from yet another dockyard period from 18 December 1939 to 22 January 1940. During the Norwegian Campaign, she escorted convoys between the Orkneys and Narvik, Norway. During the Battle of France, Beagle evacuated British troops and civilians from St. Nazaire and Bordeaux, France. During the former action, she rescued 600 survivors of the <b>ocean</b> <b>liner</b> , sunk by German aircraft during the evacuation, on 17 June.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic <b>ocean</b> <b>liner.</b>|$|E
