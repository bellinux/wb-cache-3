5|$|Leslie and April {{take the}} <b>opossum</b> to Ann's home, where April {{has been paid}} $50 to housesit. April lets the <b>opossum</b> out of its cage, and it causes havoc and minor damage. While hiding from the animal, April reveals her {{feelings}} about Andy to Leslie for the first time. When Leslie refuses {{to hand over the}} <b>opossum,</b> Evelyn angrily takes back her promise of a favor from the mayor's office. Andy, still oblivious to the reasons behind April's jealousy, delivers coffee to April, as well as the day's newspaper, containing a story which credits April for providing moral support to Andy. It is later revealed that Leslie has donated the <b>opossum</b> to the Pawnee zoo.|$|E
5|$|He finds Banda delightful, with {{a smoking}} volcano {{and a fine}} view from the top. The nutmeg trees are {{beautiful}} but he regrets {{the ending of the}} Dutch monopoly in the nutmeg trade, which avoided the need to levy direct taxes. The only indigenous animals, he thinks, are bats, except possibly for its <b>opossum</b> species.|$|E
5|$|O. sydandersoni {{is known}} from the {{departments}} of Beni and Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia, including the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP), where the type locality is located. All but a few specimens come from pockets of woodland in seasonally flooded grasslands, where {{it is the most}} frequently encountered rodent; the related oryzomyine Hylaeamys acritus, the spiny rat Proechimys longicaudatus, and the <b>opossum</b> Marmosa murina were found in the same habitat. It is absent in other, more contiguous forests and in other grasslands without large forest patches. Thus, O.sydandersoni is a narrow habitat specialist with a limited distribution. It joins several other species with restricted ranges found in the NKMNP, including Hylaeamys acritus, the akodontine rodents Juscelinomys guaporensis and J.huanchae, and an <b>opossum,</b> Cryptonanus unduaviensis.|$|E
50|$|The diet of white-eared <b>opossums</b> {{also makes}} them {{effective}} seed dispersers. Younger <b>opossums</b> consume smaller fruits than older <b>opossums,</b> so usually the adult <b>opossums</b> disperse larger seeds. However, proportionally, smaller seeds have more chance {{to pass through}} the gut without damage.|$|R

5|$|Pettigrew State Park also {{provides}} habitats for eastern woodland mammals. Black bear and white-tailed deer inhabit the woods, as do Virginia <b>opossum,</b> raccoon, American mink, muskrat, North American river otter, fox, and bobcats. The endangered red wolf has been reintroduced to eastern North Carolina, including Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|The first species described, {{the eastern}} quoll, was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} American <b>opossum</b> genus Didelphis by an anonymous author, and named Didelphis maculata. This name is no longer considered valid, {{and the second part}} of the name is now given to a different species, the tiger quoll, Dasyurus maculatus, while the eastern quoll was renamed Dasyurus viverrinus by George Shaw in 1800.|$|E
5|$|Back at the {{department}} office, reporter Shauna Malwae-Tweep (Alison Becker) interviews Andy for a newspaper article. After he brags about the capture, the reporter suggests his heroics might win him back the affections of Ann (Rashida Jones), his ex-girlfriend, much to Andy's excitement. April (Aubrey Plaza), who has romantic feelings for Andy, overhears this and leaves jealously. Evelyn demands delivery of Fairway Frank. Leslie responds that there is uncertainty about the identity of Fairway Frank. She refuses {{to hand over the}} captured <b>opossum</b> and creates a ketchup-blood diversion so that April can escape with the caged animal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Opossums</b> have {{a remarkably}} robust immune system, and show partial or total {{immunity}} to the venom of rattlesnakes, cottonmouths, and other pit vipers. <b>Opossums</b> are about eight times {{less likely to}} carry rabies than wild dogs, and about one in eight hundred <b>opossums</b> is infected with this virus.|$|R
50|$|They {{are members}} the genus Didelphis, which {{contains}} the largest American <b>opossums,</b> {{and the order}} Didelphimorphia, to which all western hemisphere <b>opossums</b> belong.|$|R
50|$|South American <b>opossums</b> mainly consume {{invertebrates}} such as beetles, diplopods, and opiliones, {{together with}} fruit and vertebrates like small birds, mammals, fossorial snakes, and fish. The {{composition of the}} diet changes with the seasons and as the animal ages. During the dry season, older <b>opossums</b> prefer to consume vertebrates. On the other hand, the younger <b>opossums</b> consume more invertebrates and fruits during the wet season. These relatively small differences in diet can favour the survival of younger <b>opossums</b> during the wet season because they avoid competition with older animals.|$|R
5|$|The PT boat {{force at}} Morotai {{was reduced to}} a single {{squadron}} by February 1945 but remained active {{until the end of the}} war. As well as patrolling around Morotai, the boats operated in the eastern NEI to raid Japanese positions and support Australian and Dutch scouting parties. In May 1945 PT boats and the Australian Z Special Unit rescued the Sultan of Ternate along with his court and harem during an operation codenamed Project <b>Opossum</b> after he was mistreated by the Japanese. By the end of the war the PT boats had conducted nearly 1,300 patrols and destroyed 50 barges and 150 small craft off Morotai and Halmahera.|$|E
5|$|Bird predators may seize {{anywhere}} from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony. The fish crow (Corvus ossifragus) is common raider of American white ibis nests, accounting {{for up to}} 44% of egg loss in a field study at Battery Island, North Carolina. Other predators of eggs and young include the boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), gulls, and possibly vultures, {{as well as the}} common <b>opossum</b> (Didelphis marsupialis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and rat snakes (Elaphe species). Egg predation rates of the American white ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness by the parents, especially during the last week of incubation. High nest densities and reduced synchrony increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer incubation times, as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation.|$|E
5|$|Large mammals {{found in}} the city {{includes}} urbanized coyotes and numerous whitetail deer. Eastern gray squirrel, and other rodents are abundant, as well as cottontail rabbits and the nocturnal <b>opossum</b> and raccoon. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include the Canada goose, mallard duck, as well as shorebirds, including the great egret and great blue heron. Turkeys are also common in wooded areas and can occasionally {{be seen on the}} MKT recreation trail. Populations of bald eagles are found by the Missouri River. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The Eurasian tree sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. Columbia has large areas of forested and open land and many of these areas are home to wildlife.|$|E
40|$|Humoral {{immunity}} to the bacteriophage f 2 was studied in adult <b>opossums</b> (Didelphis virginiana) and their responses {{were compared to}} those in New Zealand White rabbits. Antibodies {{were found in the}} serum of <b>opossums</b> 7 days after the subcutaneous injection of the antigen and peak antibody responses were observed between 10 and 21 days after immunization. A second injection of antigen resulted in increased antibody activity. In either case the level of serum antibody reached in <b>opossums</b> was less than that in rabbits. More striking, however, was the relatively slow conversion from γM to γG antibodies in <b>opossums.</b> The course of the immune response in adult <b>opossums</b> was more nearly like that of cold-blooded vertebrates than that of eutherian mammals...|$|R
5|$|The primary {{wildlife}} reservoirs for Trypanosoma cruzi in the United States include <b>opossums,</b> raccoons, armadillos, squirrels, woodrats, and mice. <b>Opossums</b> {{are particularly}} important as reservoirs, because the parasite can complete its life cycle in the anal glands of this animal without having to re-enter the insect vector. Recorded prevalence of the disease in <b>opossums</b> in the U.S. ranges from 8.3% to 37.5%.|$|R
50|$|Cryptonanus is a genus of <b>opossums</b> from South America. It {{includes}} five species found from Bolivia to Uruguay {{and eastern}} Brazil, {{one of which}} is now extinct. Although the first species were discovered in 1931, the genus was not recognized as distinct from Gracilinanus until 2005. It includes small <b>opossums</b> with generally grayish, sometimes reddish, fur that are mainly distinguished from other <b>opossums</b> by characters of the skull.|$|R
5|$|Mammals include white-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, bobcat, coyote, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, Virginia <b>opossum,</b> gray fox, red fox, {{and eastern}} cottontail rabbit. Other mammals include: nutria, fox squirrel, gray squirrel, flying squirrel, chipmunk, brown bat, and weasel. Birds include {{cardinals}} (the state bird), barred owls, Carolina chickadees, red-tailed hawks, ospreys, brown pelicans, quail, seagulls, bald eagles, and wild turkeys. Virginia {{is also home}} to the pileated woodpecker as well as the red-bellied woodpecker. The peregrine falcon was reintroduced into Shenandoah National Park in the mid-1990s. Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish. Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish and salamanders. The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, and rockfish (also known as striped bass).|$|E
5|$|The typical prey {{consists}} of surface organisms such as small fish, squid, crustaceans and jellyfish. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, {{more than half}} the food items are zooplankton and the fish caught include small herring and sprats; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in vitamin A, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly Mediterranean sand eels. Petrels also catch <b>opossum</b> shrimps from waters close to the colony. Bluefin tuna farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including angiosperm seeds and sorrel, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.|$|E
25|$|The Virginia <b>opossum</b> {{was once}} widely hunted and {{consumed}} in the United States. <b>Opossum</b> farms have been operated in the United States in the past. Sweet potatoes were eaten together with the possum in America's southern area. South Carolina cuisine includes <b>opossum,</b> and President Jimmy Carter hunted opossums {{in addition to other}} small game. Raccoon, <b>opossum,</b> partridges, prairie hen, and frogs were among the fare Mark Twain recorded as part of American cuisine.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Although feeding deficits {{have been}} {{reported}} in snakes and lizards following vomeronasal system disruption, no deficit has been previously reported in a mammal. We tested gray short-tailed <b>opossums</b> with items from four different food categories prior to occluding access to the vomeronasal organ. Preoperatively, <b>opossums</b> preferred meat to fruit or vegetables. Following occlusion of the nasopalatine canal, but not after control treatment, <b>opossums</b> failed to demonstrate food preferences. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Like raccoons, <b>opossums</b> can {{be found}} in urban environments, where they eat pet food, rotten fruit, and human garbage. Though {{sometimes}} mistakenly considered to be rats, <b>opossums</b> are not closely related to rodents, or other placentalian mammals. They rarely transmit diseases to humans, and are surprisingly resistant to rabies, most likely because they have lower body temperatures than most placental mammals. [...] In addition, <b>opossums</b> limit the spread of Lyme disease, as they successfully kill off most disease-carrying ticks that feed on them.|$|R

25|$|<b>Opossum</b> pelts {{have long}} {{been part of the}} fur trade.|$|E
25|$|Opossums {{are found}} in North, Central, and South America. The Virginia <b>opossum</b> lives in regions {{as far north as}} Canada and as far south as Central America, while other types of opossums only inhabit {{countries}} south of the United States. The Virginia <b>opossum</b> can often be found in wooded areas, though its habitat may vary widely.|$|E
25|$|The Araguari {{virus was}} first {{isolated}} from a Gray four-eyed <b>opossum</b> (Philander <b>opossum)</b> in Serra do Navio, Amapá, Brazil in 1969. Its method of transmission is unknown. In laboratory infections, it is pathogenic to mice. The virion is around 105nm in diameter. The genome has six RNA segments. Based on partial sequence data the virus {{was found to}} be most closely related to THOV.|$|E

500|$|Didelphimorphia is {{the order}} [...] of common <b>opossums</b> of the Western Hemisphere. <b>Opossums</b> {{probably}} diverged from the basic South American marsupials {{in the late}} Cretaceous or early Paleocene.They are small to medium-sized marsupials, {{about the size of}} a large house cat, with a long snout and prehensile tail.|$|R
50|$|Brazilian gracile <b>opossums</b> are {{relatively}} small <b>opossums,</b> with males ranging from 86 to 129 cm and females from 81 to 116 cm in head-body length. The tail is between 30 and 50% of the head-body length. Males weigh 17 to 52 g and females from 12 to 37 g.|$|R
25|$|Although {{all living}} opossums are {{essentially}} opportunistic omnivores, different species vary {{in the amount}} of meat and vegetation they include in their diet. Members of the Caluromyinae are essentially frugivorous; whereas the lutrine <b>opossum</b> and Patagonian <b>opossum</b> primarily feed on other animals. The yapok (Chironectes minimus) is particularly unusual, as it is the only living semi-aquatic marsupial, using its webbed hindlimbs to dive in search of freshwater mollusks and crayfish. The extinct Thylophorops, the largest known <b>opossum</b> at 4-7 kilos, was a macropredator. Most opossums are scansorial, well-adapted to life in the trees or on the ground, but members of the Caluromyinae and Glironiinae are primarily arboreal, whereas species of Metachirus, Monodelphis, and to a lesser degree Didelphis show adaptations for life on the ground.|$|E
25|$|A well-publicized story {{arose in}} August 1929, when {{a boy who}} lived in the nearby {{mountains}} presented President Hoover with a live <b>opossum</b> on his 55th birthday. Six months later, the President arranged for a new schoolhouse in the area, which had been so remote that no school existed previously. The incident resulted in a variety of legends {{and a great deal of}} apocryphal media publicity, including tales that the boy had managed to sneak past the Marine guard on duty before giving the <b>opossum</b> to the President as a birthday present.|$|E
