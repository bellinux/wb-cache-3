5|$|Historian George Ostrogorsky {{believed}} that volunteers were gathered through {{the reorganization of}} Anatolia into four themes, where the volunteers were given inalienable grants of land {{on the condition of}} hereditary military service. However, modern scholars generally discredit this theory, placing the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> later, under Heraclius' successor Constans II.|$|E
5|$|In January 1748, Adams {{and some}} friends were {{inflamed}} by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> that characterized his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example of what could happen to New England if it were to abandon its Puritan values.|$|E
5|$|Last Night in Twisted River took 20 {{years to}} {{conceive}} and write, {{and is a}} story within a story that shows {{the development of a}} novelist and the writing process. It uses many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> and plot devices that have already seen treatment in other works by the author. The career of the novelist in the book closely tracks the career of Irving himself, making it Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel.|$|E
50|$|Under Roman rule, Argos {{was part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{province}} <b>of</b> Achaea province. Under Byzantine rule {{it was part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> Hellas, and later <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnese.|$|R
50|$|Brahms {{also took}} into careful account <b>the</b> {{character}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme,</b> and its historical context. Unlike <b>the</b> great model <b>of</b> Beethoven's Diabelli Variations, where the variations departed widely from <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme,</b> Brahms's variations expressed and developed <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme.</b> Because <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> for <b>the</b> Handel variations {{originated in the}} Baroque era, Brahms included forms such as a siciliana, a musette, a canon and, of course, a fugue.|$|R
25|$|Raven-Symoné {{performs}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme,</b> while Brown {{performs a}} rap near <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> and some scattered vocals in <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme.</b> Anneliese van der Pol sings the show's {{title in the}} chorus. A full-length version of this theme was heard in a music video which aired {{a few months before}} the show's U.S. premiere and also can be heard on the show's first soundtrack, released in 2004.|$|R
5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> of Hemming's {{work is the}} depredations {{suffered}} by his monastery {{at the hands of}} royal officials. One such notorious official from the last decade of King Æthelred's reign is Eadric Streona ("Grasper"), ealdorman of Mercia, blamed for having appropriated land held by the church in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire and for having incorporated the ancient county of Winchcombeshire into Gloucestershire. Hemming may have invented Eadric's byname of Streona, as it is not attested before appearing in Hemming's work.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, botanical gardens, as {{cultural}} and scientific organisations, {{have responded to}} the interests of botany and horticulture. Nowadays, most botanical gardens display a mix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> mentioned and more; having a strong connection with the general public, there is the opportunity to provide visitors with information relating to the environmental issues being faced {{at the start of the}} 21st century, especially those relating to plant conservation and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|The Chumscrubber is a 2005 American-German comedy-drama film, {{directed}} by Arie Posin, starring an ensemble cast led by Jamie Bell. The plot, written by Posin and Zac Stanford, {{focuses on the}} {{chain of events that}} follow the suicide of a teenage drug dealer in an idealistic but superficial town. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> addressed in the film are the lack of communication between teenagers and their parents and the inauthenticity of suburbia. The titular Chumscrubber is a character in a fictional video game that represents the town and its inhabitants.|$|E
50|$|The second movement, Andantino in B-flat major, gives <b>the</b> ornamented version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> first, in <b>the</b> strings. The {{trumpets}} in thirds, {{reinforced by}} the other winds, then give <b>the</b> unadorned version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme.</b> Horns are B-flat basso and trumpets are in B-flat.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme,</b> if any, will {{be applied}} {{consistently}} throughout the puzzle. e.g., if one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> entries is a particular variety <b>of</b> pun, all <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> entries will be of that type.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{arrangement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> {{was once}} again revisited in 2014 to mark <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> Peter Capaldi as <b>the</b> twelfth incarnation <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Doctor. This version removed <b>the</b> opening fanfare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2010-12 and 2012-13 versions, returning to the traditional opening bars with a prominent bassline, accompanied by bells {{and a variety of}} futuristic sound effects, as well as a new sting as <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> opens. This leads into the main melody, now more electronic and screech-like in homage to the Howell and Glynn <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s. [...] "The Chase" [...] counter-melody is completely absent from this version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme.</b> <b>The</b> 'middle eight' is absent from any broadcast version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme,</b> and as such the closing credits cut straight to the main melody as they did in Series 7 Part 2. However, it was reinstated for an extended version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> released on <b>the</b> series 8 soundtrack album in May 2015.|$|R
5|$|The HBO cable {{television}} channel aired David's 1-hour special, , on October 17, 1999. This {{was followed by}} Curb Your Enthusiasm, a television series on HBO that aired its first episode on October 15, 2000. The show revisits many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> of Seinfeld, and is improvised from a story outline only several pages long that David writes (as of the 5th season, additional writers were hired).|$|E
5|$|The album's cover art was {{directed}} by John Gillespie. John Holmstrom and guitarist Johnny Ramone both worked on illustration, with the entire back cover contemplating a military theme, while the inner sleeve artwork depicted many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> portrayed in songs. The subject matter of songs varied throughout the album, though nearly all the tracks on the album incorporated humor into the lyrics. The musical style showed more of a surf rock influence, and many songs had minimal structuring.|$|E
5|$|The long orchestral prelude (166 bars) is in E minor and, in {{the manner}} of an operatic overture, anticipates several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> which will be heard later in the movement. The {{exposition}} begins in near-silence; the scene depicted is that of a rocky, wooded mountainside, the dwelling place of anchorites whose utterances are heard in an atmospheric chorus complete with whispers and echoes.|$|E
50|$|Mid-1980s—A big-band version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> was used.|$|R
5000|$|... "Embryo" [...] and [...] "Cymbaline" [...] {{were the}} first Pink Floyd songs to contain an excerpt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme,</b> {{appearing}} in live performances in 1971, although in Embryo only the first two bars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> would play, {{as opposed to a}} much longer segment in Cymbaline. Oddly, these two songs were often performed at the same concerts. [...] "One <b>of</b> These Days", <b>the</b> opening track <b>of</b> Pink Floyd's 1971 album Meddle, echoes <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> about 3 minutes into the track. The reference was made more explicit in live performances. In addition, their song Sheep has a bassline very similar to <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> song's bassline and the opening 3 notes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>theme</b> are played at 06.47, whilst live performances featured a much longer excerpt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> {{music for}} Home Improvement was {{composed}} by Dan Foliart. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> song is unique for its sampling of power tools, most notably {{an electric drill}} and jackhammer, which is heard during theme song. Tim's grunting was also sampled for <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> song. <b>The</b> flute and organ parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> music were also used. From Season 7 until <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, a remixed version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> song was used.|$|R
5|$|Mustaine is the band's primary songwriter. He {{develops}} songs {{starting with}} a particular riff that, with modifications, becomes {{the central part of}} the song. He has said that song fragments are composed separately, and then the band makes a compact structure from them. Drummer Shawn Drover stated that Mustaine had saved many riffs over the years and that some recent material is based on those demo recordings. Ellefson stated that the band constantly creates new material, and that making a recording begins with exchanging ideas after which the band enters the studio and discusses the concept, direction, artwork, and song titles. The lyrics are usually written after the music is arranged. Discussing the band's lyrics, Mustaine said that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> are derived from literature, such as the novels of George Orwell.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 2013, Webb {{announced}} that Hans Zimmer would be composing {{the music for}} the film, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film. On October 25, 2013, Pharrell Williams revealed to Billboard that he would co-compose the score with Zimmer. Webb and Zimmer formed a supergroup with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and former Eurythmic, David A. Stewart, to create the music for the sequel. Eventually, Stewart {{did not participate in}} the film's music, and the supergroup, credited as The Magnificent Six (a reference to the Sinister Six) was composed of Williams, Marr, Einziger, Junkie XL, Steve Mazzaro and Andrew Kawczynski assisting Zimmer. The soundtrack for the film was released on April 22, 2014 by Columbia Records and Madison Gate Records. Hans Zimmer described his work for this film as different from previous works by him, thus revealing one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> for the film, which was first heard on the website.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{striking}} in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to musical form. As purely musical structures, {{they do not}} follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifsrecurring melodies associated with a subjectare thematically transformed {{in a manner similar}} to that later made famous by Richard Wagner. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are foreshortened, while codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes.</b> Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.|$|E
50|$|An English-translated pop version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> was {{recorded}} by Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, <b>the</b> voices <b>of</b> Sōsuke and Ponyo in the North American dub, {{to tie in}} with the films English release. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> plays over <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English versions closing credits; the first half is merely a translated version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> rather than remix.|$|R

5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack in MediEvil: Resurrection is orchestrated, {{unlike the}} first instalment. Approximately half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> from the {{original}} were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. The music is split into two halves; the cues from the first half are largely reminiscent of a select number of cues {{from the original}} game {{with the addition of}} extra thematic elements to strengthen them. The other half of the music is original and composed exclusively for Resurrection. The new soundtrack was composed by Bob & Barn and features performances from members of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra that was recorded in the Czech Republic. The orchestra, headed by Nic Raine, consisted of approximately 80 performers and in addition benefits from a 32 piece choir, also recorded in the same venue. This was in similar vain to SCE Cambridge Studio's previous orchestral game Primal, which was also recorded in Prague by the same performers.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{thematic}} material presented in the orchestral and solo expositions poses a challenge for the recapitulation. Mozart manages to recapitulate all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> in the home key of C minor. The themes are necessarily compressed, are presented in a different order, and in their restated form contain few virtuosic moments for the soloist. The last theme to be recapitulated is the secondary theme of the orchestral exposition, {{which has not been}} heard for some 400 measures and is now adorned by a passage of triplets from the piano. The recapitulation concludes with the piano playing arpeggiated sixteenths before a cadential trill leads into a ritornello. The ritornello in turn leads into a fermata that prompts the soloist's cadenza.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{achievement}} <b>of</b> breakthrough by <b>the</b> skilful innovation <b>of</b> dexterously initiated path-breaking ideas was <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme.</b> <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> resonated <b>the</b> harmonious jingles <b>of</b> {{development of}} scientific temperament.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> {{song was}} a [...] "Whistled" [...] remix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> {{previously}} used in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Theme {{restaurants}} are restaurants in which <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant takes priority over everything else, influencing the architecture, food, music, and overall 'feel' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant. The food usually takes {{a backseat to}} <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme,</b> and these restaurants attract customers solely on <b>the</b> premise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> itself.|$|R
5|$|They {{followed}} {{next with}} Tenure in 2002, the double album Dilapidated Beauty in 2003, and The Road to Ellenside in 2006. In a review for Molinos, {{it was noted}} that The Paperboys consistently write pop songs with melodic hooks, which other prior Irish-rock inspired bands such as The Pogues and Oysterband, and others were not always successful at. Postcards, which has songs that range musically from bluegrass, zydeco, flamenco, Irish traditional, country, to Celtic-new-age-Native, and with songs that mix some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes,</b> was described as a satisfying example of how far the versatile scope of The Paperboys' music extends.|$|E
5|$|Alexios was of humble origin, and {{was born}} in the late 13th century somewhere in Bithynia. He {{nevertheless}} studied under the scholar Theodore Hyrtakenos, and became a tax official. By 1320 he was director of the salt pans, from which he later advanced to the position of domestikos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> of the West. He rose in the bureaucratic hierarchy until, in 1321, he was appointed the imperial parakoimōmenos (chamberlain). His position made him useful to John Kantakouzenos, who included him in a conspiracy, together with Syrgiannes Palaiologos and the prōtostratōr Theodore Synadenos, which aimed to depose the aging Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos in favour of his grandson Andronikos III. Under the threat of war, the Emperor surrendered Thrace and some districts in Macedonia to the rule of his grandson. When Andronikos III became sole emperor in 1328, his close friend Kantakouzenos became his chief minister, and Alexios was awarded with the positions that Kantakouzenos himself had formerly held: head of the imperial secretariat (mesazōn) and in charge of the state's finances. These positions allowed him to amass a considerable personal fortune, which he used to construct a personal refuge, a fortified tower-house at the site of Epibatai near Selymbria, at the coast of the Sea of Marmara. In early 1341, shortly before Andronikos's death, he was rewarded with the high office of megas doux, giving him the high command over the Byzantine navy. He re-equipped the fleet, paying from his own pocket 100,000 hyperpyra.|$|E
5|$|An {{army officer}} of Slavic origin from the Pontus region (now {{north-eastern}} Turkey), Thomas rose to prominence, {{along with the}} future emperors Michael II and Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820), {{under the protection of}} general Bardanes Tourkos. After Bardanes's failed rebellion in 803, Thomas fell into obscurity until Leo V's rise to the throne, when Thomas was raised to a senior military command in central Asia Minor. After the murder of Leo and usurpation of the throne by Michael the Amorian, Thomas revolted, claiming the throne for himself. Thomas quickly secured support from most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> (provinces) and troops in Asia Minor, defeated Michael's initial counter-attack and concluded an alliance with the Abbasid Caliphate. After winning over the maritime themes and their ships as well, he crossed with his army to Europe and laid siege to Constantinople. The imperial capital withstood Thomas's attacks by land and sea, while Michael II called for help from the Bulgarian ruler khan Omurtag. Omurtag attacked Thomas's army, but although repelled, the Bulgarians inflicted heavy casualties on Thomas's men, who broke and fled when Michael took to the field a few months later. Thomas and his supporters sought refuge in Arcadiopolis, where he was soon blockaded by Michael's troops. In the end, Thomas's supporters surrendered him in exchange for a pardon, and he was executed.|$|E
