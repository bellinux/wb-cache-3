500|$|Since its signing, the State of Florida {{reports that}} it {{has spent more than}} $2billion on the various projects.

An STA spanning [...] was constructed in 2004, making it the largest manmade wetland in the world. Fifty-five percent of the land necessary to acquire for restoration has been purchased by the State of Florida, totaling [...] A plan to hasten the construction and funding of projects was put into place, named [...] "Acceler8", spurring the start of six of eight large construction projects, including that of three large reservoirs. However, federal funds have not been forthcoming; CERP was signed when the U.S. government had a budget surplus, but since then deficits have renewed, and two of CERP's major supporters in Congress retired. According to a story in The New York Times, state <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> restoration is lost in a maze of [...] "federal bureaucracy, a victim of 'analysis paralysis'". CERP still remains controversial as the projects slated for Acceler8, environmental activists note, are those that benefit urban areas, and regions in the Everglades in desperate need of water are still being neglected, suggesting that water is being diverted to make room for more people in an already overtaxed environment.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{bipartisan}} goodwill and declarations {{of the importance}} of the Everglades, the region still remains in danger. Political maneuvering continues to impede CERP: sugar lobbyists promoted a bill in the Florida legislature in 2003 that increased the acceptable amount of phosphorus in Everglades waterways from 10ppb to 15ppb and extended the deadline for the mandated decrease by 20years. A compromise of 2016 was eventually reached. Environmental organizations express concern that attempts to speed up some of the construction through Acceler8 are politically motivated; the six projects Acceler8 focuses on do not provide more water to natural areas in desperate need of it, but rather to projects in populated areas bordering the Everglades, suggesting that water is being diverted to make room for more people in an already overtaxed environment. Though Congress promised half the funds for restoration, after the War in Iraq began and two of CERP's major supporters in Congress retired, the federal role in CERP was [...] left unfulfilled. According to a story in The New York Times, state <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> restoration is lost in a maze of [...] "federal bureaucracy, a victim of 'analysis paralysis' [...] ". In 2007, the release of $2billion for Everglades restoration was approved by Congress, overriding President George W. Bush's veto of the entire Water Development Project the money was a part of. [...] Bush's rare veto went against the wishes of Florida Republicans, including his brother, Governor Jeb Bush. A lack of subsequent action by the Congress prompted Governor Charlie Crist to travel to Washington D.C. in February 2008 and inquire about the promised funds. By June 2008, the federal government had spent only $400million of the $7.8billion legislated. Carl Hiaasen characterized George W. Bush's attitude toward the environment as [...] "long-standing indifference" [...] in June 2008, exemplified when Bush stated he would not intervene to change the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) policy allowing the release of water polluted with fertilizers and phosphorus into the Everglades.|$|E

The US military handed control of the prison housing more than 3,000 Taliban fighters and terrorism suspects to the Afghan authorities in small ceremony on September 10, 2012, at which 16 prisoners, all wearing matching gray sweaters, were released. Army Col. Robert M. Taradash, who has overseen the prison, represented coalition forces. [...] "We transferred more than 3,000 Afghan detainees into your custody... and ensured that those who would threaten the partnership of Afghanistan and coalition forces will {{not return to the}} battlefield," [...] said Col Robert Taradash, the only US official at the ceremony. [...] "Our Afghan security forces are well trained and we are happy that today they are exercising their capability in taking the responsibility of prisoners independently and guarding the prisoners," [...] said acting Defence Minister Enayatullah Nazari. [...] "We are taking the responsibility from foreign forces." [...] "Now, the Bagram prison is converted to one of Afghanistan's regular prisons where the innocents will be freed {{and the rest of the}} prisoners will be sentenced according to the laws of Afghanistan," [...] a statement by Afghan President Hamid Karzai said, who didn't attend the ceremony.
