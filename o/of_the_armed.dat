5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers.

In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration.
