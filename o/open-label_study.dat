In August 1998, Dr. Fuad Lechin and colleagues at the Central University of Venezuela Institute of Experimental Medicine in Caracas published the results of a 52-week randomized controlled trial of asthmatic children; the children in the groups that received tianeptine had a sharp decrease in clinical rating and increased lung function. Two years earlier, they had found a close, positive association between free serotonin in plasma and severity of asthma in symptomatic persons. As tianeptine was the only agent known to both reduce free serotonin in plasma and enhance uptake in platelets, they decided to use it to see if reducing free serotonin levels in plasma would help. By November 2004, there had been two double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials and a >25,000 person <b>open-label</b> <b>study</b> lasting over seven years, all showing effectiveness. A 2005 study in Egypt demonstrated tianeptine to be effective in men with depression and erectile dysfunction. Tianeptine also has anticonvulsant and analgesic effects, and a clinical trial in Spain that ended in January 2007 has shown that tianeptine is effective in treating pain due to fibromyalgia. Tianeptine has been shown to have efficacy with minimal side effects in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.|$|E

40|$|Psychosis (delusions and/or hallucinations) is {{a common}} nonmotor feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Use of the older ‘typical’ {{antipsychotic}} drugs led to worsening of motor symptoms. The introduction of ‘atypical’ antipsychotics opened up a range of therapeutic options. These agents include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole and quetiapine. All {{have been used to}} treat psychosis in PD with varying success. Clozapine is the only drug with proven efficacy. We review the evidence for the efficacy of quetiapine. Eight <b>open-label</b> <b>studies</b> have assessed quetiapine use in 191 patients, with improvement in psychosis recorded in 152 (80 %). In addition to the <b>open-label</b> <b>studies,</b> there have been two single-blind, randomized trials comparing quetiapine and clozapine. These studies suggest that quetiapine has similar efficacy to clozapine in controlling psychosis. Following the promising results of the open-label and clozapine comparison studies, five randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed to further establish the efficacy of quetiapine. Unfortunately, the results have been disappointing. The only positive placebo-controlled study excluded patients with delusions, which seem to be harder to treat than hallucinations. The four negative RCTs discussed seriously undermine the evidence from the <b>open-label</b> <b>studies.</b> The differences in design and interpretation of the RCTs emphasizes the need for further large, well-controlled trials, using strict inclusion criteria, appropriate psychosis rating scales, carer input and clinical significance. Currently, many physicians continue to cautiously offer a trial of low-dose quetiapine empirically. Clozapine should be considered in patients who can tolerate the required blood monitoring...|$|R

40|$|Impulse {{regulation}} {{disorders and}} substance abuse disorders have considerable consequences for treatment and prognosis of comorbid psychiatric disorders. Second generation antipsychotics (SGA) are frequently prescribed off-label for these disorders. This off label use of SGA entails some systematic problems, such as {{lack of knowledge about}} their long-term efficacy and effects, including side-effects, and unclarity about doses in certain disorders and patient groups, for example children and adolescents. In this review we describe the evidence that supports off-label use of the second generation antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole in impulse regulation disorders {{and substance abuse}} disorders. We discuss these disorders together since we argue that the central feature of impulsivity in both disorders is a possible target for antipsychotic medication. Subsequently we discuss the adverse effects of these agents and we consider some hypotheses about the mechanism of action in these disorders. Several double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials have proven that risperidone is effective in attention-deficit and disruptive behavior disorders in children and adolescents, in behavioral problems and subaverage intelligence and in tic disorders. Some double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials, <b>open-label</b> <b>studies</b> and case reports find efficacy of olanzapine in tic disorders and pervasive developmental disorder. Risperidone and olanzapine are found to be ineffective in substance use disorders. In tic disorders two double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials show inefficacy of clozapine and efficacy of ziprasidone. Some <b>open-label</b> <b>studies</b> found no benefit of quetiapine in pervasive developmental disorder. Single-blind and <b>open-label</b> <b>studies</b> argue the benefit of clozapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole in substance abuse and dependence. A few <b>open-label</b> <b>studies</b> and case reports suggest efficacy of quetiapine, aripiprazole and ziprasidone in attention-deficit and disruptive behavior disorders in children and adolescents and in tic disorders. Metabolic side effects such as hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus, weight gain and hyperlipidaemia are reported in all SGA, but especially in clozapine and olanzapine. In children they seem to be more pronounced than in adults. The most reported side effect in off-label SGA use in children, adolescents and adults is sedation. More double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials into the long-term efficacy and safety of second generation antipsychotics are needed. Moreover head to head comparison of SGA against each other and against first-generation antipsychotic medication is still needed to determine the superiority of specific agents in treatment of specific disorder...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This review has {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} pharmacological treatment of apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on published clinical trials assessing the effects of pharmacological treatment on apathy in AD over the last 10 years. RESULTS: Fourteen studies considered of good quality {{were included in the}} analysis (4 randomized controlled trials, 9 <b>open-label</b> <b>studies,</b> and 1 retrospective analysis). Cholinesterase inhibitors were investigated in 9 studies, monoaminergic compounds such as methylphenidate and modafinil in two trials and one trial, respectively, and Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761 extract) and citalopram in one study each. Cholinesterase inhibitors did not show statistical significant effect in 1 RCT study but were associated to improvement in 3 <b>open-label</b> <b>studies.</b> Methylphenidate elicited a small but significant activity accompanied by relevant side effects such as high blood pressure, cough, and osteoarticular pain. EGb 761 was well tolerated and countered apathy. Other treatments induced modest improvements or were ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy treatment remains a challenge and there is no evident advantage of any specific pharmacotherapy tested so far. The development of controlled studies according to updated guidelines for the diagnosis of apathy in patients with AD is desirable...|$|R

40|$|We {{aimed to}} provide a {{descriptive}} review of treatment studies of atypical antipsychotics in paediatric psychiatric disorders. A systematic {{review of the literature}} used Medline and EMBASE databases to identify clinical trials of atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents between 1994 and 2006. Trials were limited to double-blind <b>studies</b> and <b>open-label</b> <b>studies</b> of > or = 8 weeks duration that included > or = 20 patients. Nineteen double-blind and 22 <b>open-label</b> <b>studies</b> were identified. Studies included use of clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone in the treatment of disruptive behavioural disorders (DBDs), pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), tic disorder, psychotic disorders, and mania. These medications generally reduced the severity of a variety of psychiatric symptoms in children and adolescents. Less frequent adverse events included extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperglycaemia and diabetes, and endocrine effects. The review of published scientific data suggests that most of the atypical antipsychotics, excluding clozapine, have a favourable risk/benefit profile and effectively reduce disabling behaviours in paediatric psychiatric patients.

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 401 - 405 Objective: To {{review the}} {{literature}} about {{the efficacy of}} antidepressant prophylaxis during interferon-alpha (IFN-α) therapy. Method: We have performed a database search in PUBMED and ISI Web of Knowledge (1980 –August 2009) for the available literature. The keywords “prevention” or “prophylaxis”, and “depression”, and “interferon”, and “antidepressant” or “antidepressive agents” were used. Results: The six eligible studies comprise three randomized controlled trials, two in hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients and one in individuals with melanoma, and three <b>open-label</b> <b>studies</b> with HCV patients. The results of the randomized controlled trials suggest that antidepressant prophylaxis may blunt the magnitude of depressive symptoms in HCV patients and raise the rates of treatment completion.

In addition, the <b>open-label</b> <b>studies</b> with HCV patients suggest that this strategy may reduce the onset of major depression in specific samples (current psychiatric diagnosis, major depression in remission, past history of IFN-α-induced depression) on IFN-α (re-) treatment.
