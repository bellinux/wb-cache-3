40|$|In {{accordance}} with 10 CFR 30 we hereby submit our {{application for renewal}} of Byproduct Material License No. 4 - 698 - 1. By this application we request specific license authorization to demonstrate a prototype Radiation <b>Oil</b> <b>Gage</b> (ROG) by flight test at Edwards Air Force Base. This gage utilizes approximately thirty (30) Co- 60 sources of 38 microcuries strength each. Each source is hermetically sealed in a stainless steel tube (type 3140), manufactured by U. S. Nuclear, Inc., Burbank, California. These sources will be mounted on an oil tank provided by the General Electric Company for use on its J- 79 jet engine. It is our intention to perform the instrumentation of the gage at Atomics International, Canoga Park, California, including the mounting of the sources on the tank. The tank will then be delivered to Edwards Air Force Base by Atomics International and installed on an aircraft which has been designated for the flight test. It has been established through discussions with Edwards Air Force Base personnel that the aircraft will be maintained in a hanger which is located in Township 10 N, Range 10 W, Section 36 of the Base. The installation of the tank and gage and removal after the flight test will be performed by qualified Atomics International personnel...|$|E
40|$|Early {{research}} into the stable hydrogen isotopic compositions (δD) of petroleum involved bulk deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) measurements which, while providing some useful information, {{had to contend with}} the analysis of complex mixtures of hydrocarbons, and alteration resulting from the rapid exchange of nitrogen-, oxygen- and sulphur-bound hydrogen. The use of gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-irMS) overcomes these problems by allowing the analysis of individual compounds containing only the most isotopically conservative aliphatic carbon-bound (C-bound) hydrogen. This project investigates the geochemical utility and reliability of compound-specific δD values, with the aim to better understand and exploit this analytical capability. To demonstrate the source diagnostic potential of compound-specific δD values, normal and branched alkanes extracted from series of immature bog-head coals (torbanites) were analysed. The torbanites contain immature organic matter predominantly from a single, freshwater algal source, i. e. Botryococcus braunii (B. braunii). The δD values of n-alkanes reflect the climate regime at the time of deposition of the torbanites, and vary mainly in response to the δD values of the source meteoric waters in their depositional environments. n-Alkanes from torbanites deposited at high latitude in a glacial climate are depleted in D by up to 70 % relative to those from a torbanite deposited at low latitude under a tropical climate regime. Torbanites deposited in a mid-latitude region under cool-temperate conditions contain n-alkanes with δD values falling in between those of n-alkanes from tropical and glacial torbanites. The δD values of the n-alkanes also reflect their multiple source inputs. For example, a saw-toothed profile of n-alkane δD values in Australian torbanites is attributed to a dual-source system: a predominant B. braunii input, with a minor terrestrial plant input to odd-carbon-numbered n-alkanes in the range n-C 20 [subscript] to n-C 29 [subscript]. The δD values of n-alkanes and isoprenoids (pristane and phytane) differ significantly in two Permian torbanites from Australia, thought to be reflective of the offset between the δD values of their precursors in extant organisms. The torbanite data indicate that a biological δD signal has been preserved for at least 260 – 280 million years, extending the utility of δD values for palaeoclimate studies. To elucidate the effect of sedimentary processes on the δD values of petroleum hydrocarbons, three sedimentary sequences have been studied. These comprise one from the Perth Basin (Western Australia) and two from the Vulcan Sub-basin (northern Australia) covering a wide range of maturities, i. e. 0. 53 – 1. 6 % vitrinite reflectance (Ro). The δD values of n-alkanes extracted from immature-early mature sediments (marine shales/siltstones and mudstones) are consistent with that expected of marine-derived n-alkyl lipids. The hydrocarbons become enriched in D with increasing maturity. The large (ca. 115 %) biologically-derived offset between the δD values of n-alkanes and acyclic isoprenoids from immature sediments gradually decreases with increasing maturity, as the isoprenoids become enriched in D more rapidly than the n-alkanes. The D-enrichment in isoprenoids correlates strongly with Ro and traditional molecular maturity parameters. This suggests that H/D exchange during maturation occurs via a mechanism involving carbocation-like intermediates, which proceeds more rapidly with compounds containing tertiary carbon centres. Significant epimerisation of pristane and phytane coincides with their D-enrichment, suggesting that hydrogen exchange occurs at their tertiary carbons. A mechanism is proposed which can account for both H/D exchange and the epimerisation of pristane and phytane in the sedimentary environment. Pristane and phytane extracted from a post-mature sediment from the Paqualin- 1 sequence are significantly enriched in D (ca. 40 %) relative to the n-alkanes, indicating that D-enrichment persists at very high maturity, and is more pronounced for the regular isoprenoids than the n-alkanes. This supports the notion that H/D exchange causes the observed shift in δD values, rather than free-radical hydrogen transfer. The differences between the δD values of pristane and phytane show opposite trends in the Perth Basin and Vulcan Sub-basin sediments. In the Perth Basin, phytane is enriched in D relative to pristane, likely due to a dominant algal source. In the Vulcan Sub-basin, pristane is enriched in D relative to phytane, and thus is attributed to a lower relative input of algal organic matter. The variance of the δD values of pristane and phytane is generally consistent throughout the maturity range and provides evidence that pristane and phytane exchange hydrogen at similar rates. δD analysis of crude oils and condensates reservoired in the Perth Basin and Vulcan Sub-basin has been carried out to evaluate potential applications in oil-source correlation. The n-alkanes from crude oils and condensates are often more enriched in D than n-alkanes extracted from their supposed source rocks, and the oils also show relatively small differences between the δD values of n-alkanes and isoprenoids. These results suggest significant H/D exchange has occurred, implying that the liquids were generated from mature source rocks. A Perth Basin crude <b>oil</b> (<b>Gage</b> Roads- 1) thought to be derived from a lacustrine/terrestrial source contains hydrocarbons that are significantly depleted in D relative to Perth Basin oils derived from a marine source, attributed to variability in the isotopic composition of marine and terrestrial source waters. δD values of n-alkanes from Vulcan Sub-basin crude oils and condensates are largely consistent with their prior classification into two groups: Group A, having a marine source affinity; and Group B, having a terrigenous source affinity. Some oils and condensates are suggested to be mixtures of Group A and Group B hydrocarbons, or Group A hydrocarbons and other as yet unknown sources. An exception is a former Group A oil (Tenacious- 1) containing n-alkanes that are enriched in D relative to those from other Group A oils and condensates, attributed to mixing with another source of more mature hydrocarbons. The n-alkane δD profile appears to be indicative of source and sedimentary processes. One Perth Basin crude oil (Dongara- 14) contains lower-molecular-weight n-alkanes that are depleted in D relative to higher-molecular-weight n-alkanes, attributed to a mixed marine/terrestrial source. Group A crude oils and condensates from the Vulcan Sub-basin display a ‘bowl-shaped’ profile of n-alkane δD values. An upward inflection in the n-alkane δD profile from n-C 11 [subscript] to n-C 15 [subscript] is suggested to represent the addition of D-enriched lower-molecular-weight n-alkanes from a more mature wet gas/condensate to an initial charge of lower maturity oil. Ultimately, this project has demonstrated that the δD values of individual petroleum hydrocarbons can be used to elucidate the nature of source organic matter and depositional environments. The preservation potential of lipid δD values is greater than previously thought, although it is clear that H/D exchange accompanying maturation can {{have a significant effect on}} the δD values of certain hydrocarbons. Thus, great care must be taken when interpreting δD values of individual hydrocarbons, particularly those derived from sediments of high thermal maturity...|$|E
40|$|A new, compact {{oil film}} skin {{friction}} meter capable of measuring skin friction {{in two directions}} has been designed and constructed. The instrument allows the thin liquid film technique to now be applied in flight and in {{a wider variety of}} laboratory conditions. The instrument was tested by comparing measurements with those given by a floating element gage in laminar, transitional, and turbulent boundary layers with zero pressure gradient. Both instruments agreed satisfactorily {{with each other and with}} the expected curves for the laminar and turbulent boundary layers. Significant differences were at first seen between the oil film meter and two floating element gages in the case of a favorable pressure gradient, but when a correction is applied to account for the normal force acting on the pendulum-type gage, the three instruents are much closer. The directional sensitivity of the <b>oil</b> film <b>gage</b> is also demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{pressure}} sensor {{used in the}} Common Rail System is designed to monitor the oil pressure changing form 0 to 200 MPa in the temperature from- 40 to 130 ℃. It is composed of elastic cell, strain gage and signal processing circuit. Elastic cell produces liner strain with the <b>oil</b> pressure; strain <b>gage</b> transforms this strain into electrical signal that is enlarged and processed by signal processing circuit. To describe the relation of oil pressure with the strain, the stress distribution and strain of elastic cell with different shape is simulated, applying ANSYS tool in the 200 MPa pressure. Then, an acceptable shape is produced and tested. It has the similar features with simulated result and works well...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{the late}} Miocene-Pliocene climate of West Antarctica, {{recorded}} by sedimentary units within the James Ross Island Volcanic Group, is still fragmentary. Late Miocene glacio-marine deposits {{at the base of}} the group in eastern James Ross Island (Hobbs Glacier Formation) and Late Pliocene (3 Ma) interglacial strata at its local top on Cockburn Island (Cockburn Island Formation) have been studied extensively, but other Neogene sedimentary rocks on James Ross Island have thus far not been considered in great detail. Here, we document two further occurrences of glaciomarine strata, included in an expanded Hobbs Glacier Formation, which demonstrate the stratigraphic complexity of the James Ross Island Volcanic Group: reworked diamictites intercalated within the volcanic sequence at Fiordo Belen, northern James Ross Island, are dated by Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 and Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 at c. 7 Ma (Late Miocene), but massive diamictites which underlie volcanic rocks near Cape <b>Gage,</b> <b>oil</b> eastern James Ross Island, yielded an Ar-Ar age of < 3. 1 Ma (Late Pliocene). These age assignments are confirmed by benthic foraminiferal index species of the genus Ammoelphidiella. The geological setting and Cassididina-dominated foraminiferal biofacies of the rocks at Fiordo Belen suggest deposition in water depths of 150 - 200 m. The periglacial deposits and waterlain tills at Cape Gage were deposited at shallower depths (< 100 in), as indicated by all abundance of the pectinid bivalve 'Zygochlamys' anderssoni and the epibiotic foram Cibicides lobatulus. Macrofaunal and foraminiferal biofacies of glaciomarine and interglacial deposits share many similarities, which suggests that temperature is not the dominant factor in the distribution of late Neogene Antarctic biota. Approximately 10 m. y. of Miocene-Pliocene climatic record is preserved within the rock sequence of the James Ross Island Volcanic Group. Prevailing glacial conditions were punctuated by interglacial conditions around 3 Ma...|$|R
40|$|Increased fuel costs, {{heightened}} {{environmental protection}} requirements, and noise abatement continue to place drag reduction {{at the forefront}} of aerospace research priorities. Unfortunately, shortfalls still exist in the fundamental understanding of boundary-layer airflow over aerodynamic surfaces, especially regarding drag arising from skin friction. For example, there is insufficient availability of instrumentation to adequately characterize complex flows with strong pressure gradients, heat transfer, wall mass flux, three-dimensionality, separation, shock waves, and transient phenomena. One example is the acoustic liner efficacy on aircraft engine nacelle walls. Active measurement of shear stress in boundary layer airflow would enable {{a better understanding of how}} aircraft structure and flight dynamics affect skin friction. Current shear stress measurement techniques suffer from reliability, complexity, and airflow disruption, thereby compromising resultant shear stress data. The state-of-the-art for shear stress sensing uses indirect or direct measurement techniques. Indirect measurements (e. g., hot-wire, heat flux <b>gages,</b> <b>oil</b> interferometry, laser Doppler anemometry, small scale pressure drag surfaces, i. e., fences) require intricate knowledge of the studied flow, restrictive instrument arrangements, large surface areas, flow disruption, or seeding material; with smaller, higher bandwidth probes under development. Direct measurements involve strain displacement of a sensor element and require no prior knowledge of the flow. Unfortunately, conventional "floating" recessed components for direct measurements are mm to cm in size. Whispering gallery mode devices and Fiber Bragg Gratings are examples of recent additions to this type of sensor with much smaller (m) sensor components. Direct detection techniques are often single point measurements and difficult to calibrate and implement in wind tunnel experiments. In addition, the wiring, packaging, and installation of delicate micro-electromechanical devices impede the use of most direct shear sensors. Similarly, the cavity required for sensing element displacement is sensitive to particulate obstruction. This work was focused on developing a shear stress sensor for use in subsonic wind tunnel test facilities applicable to an array of test configurations. The non-displacement shear sensors described here have minimal packaging requirements resulting in minimal or no disturbance of boundary layer flow. Compared to previous concepts, device installation could be simple with reduced cost and down-time. The novelty lies in the creation of low profile (nanoscale to 100 m) micropost arrays that stay within the viscous sub-layer of the airflow. Aerodynamic forces, which are related to the surface shear stress, cause post deflection and optical property changes. Ultimately, a reliable, accurate shear stress sensor that does not disrupt the airflow has the potential to provide high value data for flow physics researchers, aerodynamicists, and aircraft manufacturers leading to greater flight efficiency arising from more in-depth knowledge on how aircraft design impacts near surface properties...|$|R
