See Fairlie (2005) and Jann (2008) for the detailed discussion of the decomposition method for nonlinear response models.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Oaxaca-Blinder</b> <b>technique</b> was {{originally}} used in labor economics to decompose earnings gaps and {{to estimate the}} level of discrimination. It has been applied since in other social issues, including education, {{where it can be}} used to assess how much of a gap is due to differences in characteristics (explained variation) and how much is due to policy or system changes (unexplained variation). We apply the decomposition technique in an effort to analyze the increase in Indonesia’s score in PISA mathematics. Between 2003 and 2006, Indonesia’s score increased by 30 points, or 0. 3 of a standard deviation. The test score increase is assessed in relation to family, student, school and institutional characteristics. The gap over time is decomposed into its constituent components based on the estimation of cognitive achievement production functions. The decomposition results suggest that almost the entire test score increase is explained by the returns to characteristics, mostly related to student age. However, we find that the adequate supply of teachers also plays a role in test score changes. PISA, education, test scores, Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|Economics of {{discrimination}} {{has been the}} topic of interest of many {{in the last decade}} or two. Human capital theory describes wage determination as a function of labour human capital and should be determined based on marginal productivity theorem of labour economics. Islamic theology also dictates paying labour well in time and equal to their productivity not based on his colour, race, gender, nationality health status and other non-economic factors. The current study analyses the immigrants-natives wage gap to find the extent of potential discrimination against the immigrants. Using employees' level data from the Enterprise Surveys by the World Bank in 2007, standard <b>Oaxaca-Blinder</b> <b>technique</b> and Machado-Mata counterfactual decomposition is applied. Findings indicate an existence of earning's differential in favour of natives or the Malaysian citizens and immigrants have a disadvantage. On the other hand, the differential increases until the middle of income distribution and the start declining. It suggests higher-income groups have a low level of discriminatory disadvantage. Labour market productivity could be increased if this differential is reduced, which motivates the employees.

40|$|Using {{data from}} 1998, {{we show that}} the gender log wage gap in Sweden {{increases}} throughout the wage distribution and accelerates in the upper tail of the distribution, which we interpret as a glass ceiling effect. Using earlier data, we show that the same pattern held {{at the beginning of}} the 1990 ?s but not in the prior two decades. Further, we do not find this pattern either for the log wage gap between immigrants and non-immigrants in the Swedish labor market or for the gender gap in the U. S. labor market. Our findings suggest that a gender-specific mechanism in the Swedish labor market hinders women from reaching the top of the wage distribution. Using quantile regressions, we examine whether this pattern can be ascribed primarily to gender differences in labor market characteristics or to gender differences in rewards to those characteristics. We estimate pooled quantile regressions with gender dummies, as well as separate quantile regressions by gender, and we carry out a decomposition analysis in the spirit of the <b>Oaxaca-Blinder</b> <b>technique.</b> Even after extensive controls for gender differences in age, education (both level and field), sector, industry, and occupation, we find that the glass ceiling effect we see in the raw data persists to a considerable extent...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the wage differentials and wage discrimination among {{employees in the}} chemical and petrochemical industries in Saudi Arabia. The context of segmentation is discussed through a detailed examination of the distinct features of the Saudi labour market, with a special emphasis on the Saudisation labour policy that reflects government intervention in the labour market. Under the Saudisation labour policy, the government compelled private firms to attract Saudi nationals to join their services and to secure them permanent jobs. The present study discusses how this policy has distorted the structure and function of the Saudi labour market from both the demand and supply side perspectives. Due {{to the lack of}} official data on the Saudi labour market and the restrictions by the Statistics Law in Saudi Arabia on access to any cross-sectional data, a purpose designed cross-sectional survey was conducted among a sample of six hundred Saudi and non-Saudi workers in these industries. Simple statistical analyses of the survey returns have revealed substantial differences in the pay and working conditions between Saudi and non-Saudi workers across a number of personal characteristics, such as levels of education, occupation, years of working experience and marital status. Regression analyses have further confirmed the significant differences in the effects of supply side factors on the monthly earnings on Saudi and non-Saudi workers. Using the <b>Oaxaca-Blinder</b> <b>technique</b> to measure and to decompose differences in average monthly earnings between Saudis and non-Saudis in the chemical and petrochemical industries, the study reveals that the aggregate earnings differentials between the two groups of workers is 62. 6...|$|E
40|$|In Peru, {{indigenous}} children obtain {{lower scores}} on academic tests, on average, than nonindigenous children. In this study, we investigate whether a test score achievement gap is {{found by the}} age of 5 and whether this gap increases {{by the age of}} 8. While the literature has focused on the underlying family and children determinants of achievement gaps, we use an extension of the <b>Oaxaca-Blinder</b> <b>technique</b> to include community sorting effects and heterogeneity in community impact effects. Using the 2001 cohort of the Young Lives longitudinal survey for Peru, our results show that at the age of 5, indigenous children are far behind their non-indigenous counterparts in Spanish vocabulary (as measured by the PPVT), but less far behind in maths. Over {{the first three years of}} school, however, indigenous children lose substantial ground relative to non-indigenous children, increasing the average gap to 0. 49 standard deviations (of the distribution of test scores) in maths and 0. 66 in vocabulary. Our results suggest not only that parental education and a child’s health are important determinants of the gap for maths and vocabulary, as previously found in the literature; but also that the vocabulary gap is due in part to community effects. The pathways considered yield valuable information for policymakers who are interested in developing policies to improve student learning among indigenous groups. These pathways are important for human capital formation and could potentially have long-term impacts on educational attainment and poverty in Peru. © Young Lives 2014 All rights reserved.
