5|$|Between 1996 and 2010 Buckton Castle was {{investigated}} by archaeologists, first the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit then the University of Salford's Centre for Applied Archaeology {{as part of}} the Tameside Archaeology Survey. More than 60 volunteers were involved in the project. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and close to the Buckton Vale Quarry. The castle is <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> heather and peat, and there are no above-ground ruins.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then {{partially}} roofless and <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.|$|E
5|$|In 1722 Sir Thomas Webster {{bought the}} castle. For over a century, Bodiam Castle and its {{associated}} manor descended through the Webster family. It was in this period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period. The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid-18th century, when it was depicted as a ruin <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> ivy. Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the revival in Gothic architecture and the renovation of old structures.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two centuries, the castle was {{involved}} in many conflicts. It was attacked and burnt, probably in the Welsh uprising of 1151, and was captured {{by the forces of}} Llywelyn the Great in 1215. John de Braose acquired the castle in 1220 and repaired it, constructing a stone curtain wall to replace the older defences. Attacked again in 1251, the castle was reinforced with a stone tower {{in the second half of}} the 13th century. It declined in importance during the late-medieval period, and by the 19th century, the castle was ruinous and <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> ivy.|$|E
5|$|Original to the house, and occupying its {{northwest}} terrace {{against its}} service wing, was an Italian garden with vine-clad pergolas on each side, symmetrical gravel paths, marble benches, and long stone balustrades, giving it {{characteristics of a}} hanging garden. The garden was below the house's first floor, and was built against the hillside, occupying {{a portion of the}} slope that falls far below it. The lower walls of the house were screened with a row of large cedars planted on the highest part of the garden. The garden formed an immense rectangular space, and on the four sides of the terrace there were pergolas thickly <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> vines. In the center was a pool and a carved stone fountain imported from Rome. Walks and beds of flowers and shrubbery occupied the rest, visible from the west-facing windows of the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of Rewrites story {{takes place in the}} fictional city of Kazamatsuri in Japan, where treeplanting and {{afforestation}} have caused the city to become <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> trees and vegetation. The protagonist Kotarou and his friends in the occult research society attend a high school in Kazamatsuri, and the characters also spend time in the society's clubroom. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the forest around Kazamatsuri and Kotarou's house. Throughout the story, Kotarou encounters an alternate dimension of Kazamatsuri where everything is silent and the sky is gray. There are many entrances to this dimension throughout the city. In this secret world developed by Gaia, a sustainable environment exists to support life. When on the Moon, a hill where daisies grow is prominently shown amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where the night is eternal. This hill appears again later on Earth in the forest of Kazamatsuri.|$|E

2500|$|With {{no one to}} {{look after}} it, the {{cemetery}} reverted to the Town of Ramapo, which includes Sloatsburg. Some families continued to maintain their plots, but as a whole the cemetery fell into <b>overgrown</b> disrepair, <b>with</b> some headstones ...|$|R
50|$|Ute Cemetery, {{known as}} Evergreen Cemetery in the 19th century, {{is located on}} Ute Avenue in Aspen, Colorado, United States. It is a small, <b>overgrown</b> parcel <b>with</b> {{approximately}} 200 burials. In 2002 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
5|$|The sites {{began to}} pass into varied private ownership. Lord Thomas Bulkeley bought Beaumaris from the Crown in 1807, {{incorporating}} {{it into the}} park that surrounded his local residence. Conwy Castle was leased by {{the descendants of the}} Conways to the Holland family. In the late 18th and 19th centuries, the ruined castles started to be considered picturesque and sublime, attracting visitors and artists from across a wide area. The fashion was encouraged by the events of the Napoleonic Wars {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, which made it difficult for British artists to visit the continent, leading many to travel to North Wales instead. These artists included John Cotman, Henry Gastineau, Thomas Girtin, Moses Griffith, Julius Ibbetson, Paul Sandby, J. M. W. Turner and John Varley. The sites became heavily <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> ivy and other vegetation. In the 1830s the stonework of Caenarfon Castle began to collapse, and the Crown employed Anthony Salvin to conduct emergency repairs.|$|E
5|$|The species grows only on {{slightly}} to heavily rotten and barkless deadwood in coniferous forests in cool, moist areas. The wood is about 40 to 100% <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> Marchantiophyta, {{especially of the}} genera Nowellia or Cephalozia. B.minutissima has been found growing on the liverwort Lepidozia reptans, although Nowellia curvifolia is the main indicator for the slime mould. In addition to liverworts, Barbeyella is found socialised with monocellular algae. It is assumed that the protoplasmodium phagocytises either the algae or the bacteria on their surface. Other Myxogastria species are often found together with Barbeyella, especially Lepidoderma tigrinum, Lamproderma columbinum and Colloderma oculatum. Aphanocladium album is a myxomyceticolous fungus (i.e., living on or within the fruit bodies of myxomycetes) that has been reported growing on specimens of B.minutissima collected from North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The 19thcentury saw {{efforts to}} {{preserve}} the castle. In 1826 repairs {{were made to the}} well in the keep. At the same time a survey was carried out by A. W. N. Pugin and he excavated around the keep, investigating how it was built. He descended into the well in a bucket in an unsuccessful search for treasure. Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, leased the castle to the Corporation of Rochester in 1870 for use as a public park; when it opened to the public in 1872, Rochester Castle was presented as a picturesque ruin, with trees planted in the enclosure and the walls <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> ivy. In 1884 the Corporation bought the castle for £6,572 (equivalent to £3.4million in 2009 terms). Between 1896 and 1904, George Payne carried out repairs. In {{the first quarter of the}} century the gardens acquired a German field gun and a tank from the First World War, and a bandstand, though they were removed by 1961. Ivy was removed from the keep between 1919 and 1931 and the planting in the castles scaled back. In 1960 the origin of Boley Hill was investigated archaeologically, but the excavations failed to provide firm dating evidence.|$|E

5|$|The tomb of Archimedes {{carried a}} {{sculpture}} illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, {{consisting of a}} sphere and a cylinder of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman orator Cicero was serving as quaestor in Sicily. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, {{but none of the}} locals were able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown.|$|E

25|$|The Fort d'Andoy is {{on private}} {{property}} and is not open to the public. It was never repaired or rehabilitated after World War II. It {{is used as a}} hunting ground and is in poor condition, <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Bezuljak is {{the site}} of a mass grave {{associated}} with the Second World War. The Matevž Shaft Mass Grave (Grobišče Matevževo brezno) lies northwest of the village, in the Ravnik Valley, in an <b>overgrown</b> area <b>with</b> many sinkholes. It contains the remains of an unknown number of victims at a depth of two meters.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of buildings are located behind {{the first row}} of dunes, with the exception being the northern searchlight which now stands exposed on the beach within reach of the high tide.

Although the lot is <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> weeds, Collier {{continues}} to sell whole cars and parts, {{although many of}} them are in poor shape as they have been sitting on the lot since the early 1980s. They include 1970s and 1980-model AMCs, such as Gremlins, Pacers, Matadors, Javelins, Eagles, and Concords. Many retain their original window stickers. Everything is for sale, but an appointment is needed.|$|E
25|$|Mr Pilkington – The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do {{owner of}} Foxwood, a large {{neighbouring}} farm <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> weeds. Unlike Frederick, Pilkington is wealthier and owns more land, but his farm {{is in need}} of care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently-run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones, and worried that this could also happen to him.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{survey technique}} is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes {{with the use}} of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as augers, corers, and shovel test pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed sterile.|$|E
50|$|From the saltworks a track, <b>overgrown</b> mildly <b>with</b> bitou bush, though easy to follow, goes {{just west}} of the dunes and then joins the main track about halfway up the reserve. Several short tracks join the main track to the beach and are marked by posts. Much of the dunes have been {{protected}} with signs declaring a restabilisation project.|$|R

He wrote, [...] "since I have been here, I have had enough work <b>with</b> the <b>overgrown</b> garden <b>with</b> its large pine trees, under which there grows tall and poorly-tended grass, mixed with all kinds of periwinkle." [...] The paintings are of growth below ivy covered trees.|$|R

25|$|Where the sea meets higher {{parts of}} the sloping landscape, {{dramatic}} cliffs emerge very suddenly. Such cliffs are white if the soil has a high content of chalk. Typically like White Cliffs of Dover, but in Scania and parts of Denmark the soil is usually more sandy, and the cliffs then becomes yellow instead. Good examples of such coastlines exists at the southern side of Ven in Øresund, and also between the towns Helsingborg and Landskrona, as well as {{parts of the}} Scanian south and south-east coast. Where the cliffs aren't steep enough, they may become <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> grass.|$|E
25|$|The Mausoleum of James Thomas Law (1790–1876) {{chancellor}} of the Lichfield diocese is built at {{the northern edge of}} the churchyard. Initially built for his wife who died in 1864, it resembles a canopied medieval tomb. The structure was surmounted by a clock with two dials which were illuminated at night by gas. Built {{on the side of the}} Trent Valley Road it served as a reminder of the time to travellers on their way to the station. The clock is now missing and the mausoleum is <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> vegetation. The Mausoleum is a Grade II Listed Building.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Passarowitz, {{by which}} Serbia {{north of the}} West Morava was ceded from the Ottoman Empire to the Habsburg Monarchy, was signed on 21July 1718. At that time, {{only one of the}} {{original}} Ravanica monks who had left their monastery 28 years ago, was still alive. His name was Stefan. Shortly before the treaty was signed, Stefan returned to Ravanica and renovated the monastery, which had been half-ruined and <b>overgrown</b> <b>with</b> vegetation when he came. In 1733, there were only five monks in Ravanica. Serbia was returned to the Ottoman Empire in 1739, but the monastery was not completely abandoned this time.|$|E

50|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 20th century, the dyke had become <b>overgrown</b> mainly <b>with</b> elms and since 11 March 1927 it has been a {{protected}} natural monument called the Effenkranz (“Elm Wreath”), or sometimes the Allee. Dutch elm disease, however, did not spare the Effenkranz, and between 1976 and 1981, all elms had to be felled, and they were replaced with 550 other trees.|$|R
