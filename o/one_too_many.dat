Horton directed Pfeiffer in a 1985 ABC TV special, <b>One</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Many,</b> in which she played the high school girlfriend of an alcoholic student (Val Kilmer); and in 1987, the real-life couple played an on-screen couple in the 'Hospital' segment of John Landis's comedy skit compilation, Amazon Women on the Moon. However, they decided to separate in 1988, and were divorced two years later; Horton later blamed the split on their devotion to their work rather than on their marriage.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, {{while at}} Juilliard, Kilmer co-authored {{and starred in}} the play How It All Began, which was {{performed}} at the Public Theater at the New York Shakespeare Festival. Kilmer turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film The Outsiders, as he had prior theatre commitments. In 1983 he appeared off Broadway in The Slab Boys with Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn. That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) {{came in the form}} of an episode of ABC Afterschool Special called <b>One</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Many,</b> which was an educational drama on drinking and driving; it also starred a young Michelle Pfeiffer.

25|$|In the semi-finals India {{faced the}} English cricket team. Kapil helped curtail the lower-order after England lost regular wickets to Roger Binny and Mohinder Amarnath. He took 3 wickets as India limited England to 213 {{and the middle}} order of Mohinder Amarnath (46 runs), Yashpal Sharma (61), Sandeep Patil (51*) ensured victory and entry into the finals {{to take on the}} mighty West Indies cricket team who were looking for a hat-trick of World Cup titles. West Indies {{restricted}} India for 183 runs, with only Kris Srikkanth (38 runs) providing some scoring relief. Despite losing Gordon Greenidge, West Indies steadied their innings to 57/2 on the back of quick scoring by Viv Richards and looked comfortable. Richards played <b>one</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> aggressive shots when he skied a pull shot from Madan Lal that Kapil caught at deep square leg after running for over 20 yards running backwards. The catch is attributed as the turning point in the 1983 WC Final and is {{regarded as one of the}} finest in ODI Cricket. West Indies collapsed from 50/1 to 76/6 and finally were bowled out for 140 with Kapil picking up the wicket of Andy Roberts. Kapil Dev had upset Clive Lloyd's West Indies to win India's maiden World Cup and he led from the front with 303 runs (Average: 60.6), 12 wickets (Average: 20.41) and 7 catches in 8 matches – a truly all-round performance.|$|E

500|$|Piller {{drafted the}} first version of the script and asked Ira Steven Behr, {{executive}} producer of , to review it. Behr was critical of the script, describing the Son'a as [...] "paper tigers". Piller said that [...] "I knew he was right. There's no question that first draft was trying to tell two stories, and that's <b>one</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> for a movie." [...] Piller re-drafted the script, adding a romantic subplot for Picard in the shape of Anij, a Ba'ku woman. He added gravitas to the Son'a to make them more menacing, and the ending was changed to include a massive Son'a collector ship and a confrontation between Picard and Ru'afo aboard the ship. A version of the script was subsequently leaked onto the internet. At the same time, Piller and Berman were exploring titles for the filmincluding Prime Directive, The Directive, The Resignation, The Enemy Within, Breach of Promise, Dereliction of Duty and Apostasybecause they reasoned that they could not submit it to the studio under the title of Stardust. They could not settle on a title so they submitted it as Star Trek IX.|$|E
500|$|Acknowledging {{the failure}} of the ongoing Anarky series, Grant has conceeded that its themes, in {{particular}} his interest in exploring esoteric concepts such as philosophy of mind, likely resulted in [...] "plummeting" [...] sales. Breyfogle claimed the difficulty of combining escapist entertainment with social commentary as his explanation for the series' failure. Breyfogle wrote at the time: [...] "Anarky is a hybrid of the mainstream and the not-quite-so-mainstream. This title may have experienced exactly what every 'half-breed' suffers: rejection by both groups with which it claims identity." [...] Besides the themes, commentators have also found the escalation of Anarky's skills and special heroics as a source of criticism among readers. [...] "I liked the original concept behind Anarky: a teenage geek who reads The Will to Power <b>one</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> times and decides to go out and fix the world," [...] wrote a critic for Fanzing, an online newsletter produced by comic book fans and professionals. [...] "But the minute he wound up getting $100 million in a Swiss Bank account, owning a building, impressing Darksied, getting a Boom Tube and was shown as being able to outsmart Batman, outhack Oracle and generally be invincible, I lost all interest I had in the character." ...|$|E

Meera Srinivasan, another critic from The Hindu praised the film for the [...] "music score and songs by the inimitable Viswanathan-Ramamoorthy duo with Kannadasan's striking lyrics".

Vijayan of The New Straits Times said, [...] "Instead of trooping out, the audience sat through the 14 songs composed by the Viswanathan-Ramamoorty pair. They are that famous and many can sing along to the lyrics as the songs have been heard countless times on the radio". Writing for The Hindu, C. V.

[...] Matt Smith of SF Weekly compared Blinky to a type of fish found in San Francisco Bay, which, {{according to a study by}} the University of California, Davis, had a shrunken brain and misshapen body that had been caused by the dumping of toxic chemicals into the bay. In an article about the now closed nuclear weapons production facility Rocky Flats Plant, Brian Park of The Rocky Mountain Collegian joked that after its closure, [...] "years of clean up ensued and now the area is a wildlife refuge; no word yet if Blinky has been spotted." [...] Barbara Taormina of the North Shore Sunday wrote in her article about the new liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipeline in Massachusetts Bay: [...] "Will Blinky, the mutant three-eyed fish from The Simpsons be showing up in Massachusetts Bay? Probably not, but local environmentalists are worried that digging for the new LNG pipeline may stir up radioactive waste dumped decades ago." [...] In his article about the nuclear power plant operator Exelon, Thomas M. Anderson of Kiplinger wrote: [...] "The thought of more nuclear power may conjure up images of the Three Mile Island accident or Blinky , but a growing number of policymakers and even environmentalists are coming to appreciate the advantages of atomic energy." ...|$|E
500|$|Giving a {{partially}} negative {{review of the}} film was Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York, who said the [...] "movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into Twilight-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act" [...] and that [...] "Cody throws <b>one</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through. But for a while, this has real fangs". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said, [...] "There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with Jennifer's Body" [...] but that [...] "dmittedly, this {{is the stuff of}} lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema" [...] and [...] "is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to Drag Me to Hell on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on". San Francisco Chronicle Peter Hartlaub stated, [...] "Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of Murder, She Wrote has more thrills." [...] Hartlaub felt the film is not bad, is [...] "almost always pleasing" [...] and that Fox [...] "proves that she has some [...] range" [...] but [...] "the chances that it will be somebody else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none". Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News said, [...] "Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the Transformers boy-toy does spookily well" [...] but [...] "ords and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a pretty bad actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all". He reasoned the [...] "movie's partially redeemed by Seyfried, who makes her character more than a repository for audience sympathy" [...] and [...] "her make-out scene with Fox is handled with more suspense and care than anything else in the movie".|$|E
