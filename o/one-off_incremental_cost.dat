Examination of these methods was done to determine if the Navy was able to properly and completely capture <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> to receive full reimbursement from the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF). The thesis begins with an overview of the OCOTF and its intended purpose, and continues with an in depth analysis of the processes implemented by both services to identify and report <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> for aircraft platforms to OSD. It further compares the methodologies, highlighting the advantages and pitfalls of each, and assesses the possibility of lost funding to the Navy based on the processes employed. This research concludes that the Navy did not suffer any loss of funds based on inequity in disbursements from the OCOTF based on the methodologies it exercised. However, key factors which potentially prevented greater reimbursement were identified to be: 1) The interpretation of vague guidance for determining <b>incremental</b> <b>costs,</b> 2) Poor record-keeping and accountability of operational missions flown, 3) The use of different methodologies for capturing <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> by both services and within the Navy, and 4) The impact of the Navy's forward deployed status on <b>incremental</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

This analysis reviews the cost estimates and methodologies developed for that purpose by DoD, CBO and GAO. It considers the budget climate and the role of foreign cash and in-kind contributions. Finally, it reviews the budgeting innovations used to provide and monitor DS/DS defense spending. At the outset of the crisis, costs were estimated to determine the defense funding requirements for DS/DS. Because of the specific provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, these estimates focused on the incremental impact on DoD's budget. This was difficult because <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> were not defined and DoD's accounting structure does not measure <b>incremental</b> <b>costs.</b> As allied financial support for U.

The major challenge confronting radiology practices is to demonstrate cost savings and productivity gains when a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) is established. Aim: To undertake an <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> analysis of PACS compared with conventional radiology to determine productivity gains, if any, at two private hospitals in Durban. Method: An <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> analysis for chest radiographs, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging brain scans with and without contrast were performed. The overall <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> for PACS in comparison with a conventional radiology site was determined.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} continuous flows of minimum cost {{in a network}} with convex cost functions is considered. The approach used is that of finding, for any given feasible flow, circuit flows of negative <b>incremental</b> <b>costs.</b> In the main theoretical result of this paper, it is proved that if at each stage, given a feasible nonoptimal flow X, the circuit flow with most negative <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> is added to X, linear convergence to the optimal solution will be obtained. In addition, this most negative <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> determines an upper bound on the difference in cost between the given feasible solution and the optimal. Based on these concepts, an algorithm, which preserves linear convergence, is presented to determine minimum cost flows in networks with convex costs in the arcs. Results of computer runs made for this algorithm are given. The special case of networks with linear costs is also considered. ...|$|R
40|$|The Convention on Biological Diversity {{stipulates}} {{the principle}} of <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> for the international financing of biodiversity conservation. The international debate about the exact meaning of the concept and about its practical application focuses {{on the issues of}} baseline determination and treatment of incremental domestic benefits. This paper uses some standard tools of partial equilibrium demand analysis to illustrate theoretical solutions to the indeterminacy of the Convention. The allocation of resources resulting from an <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> scheme is compared with a 'domestic optimum', and with a hypothetical 'global optimum'. Regarding the behaviour of the country hosting biodiversity, a distinction is proposed between 'quantity-' and 'transfer-' taking behaviour. The issue of price distortions in the baseline is also addressed. It is shown that both the host country (H) and the Rest of the World (ROW) will have incentives for agreeing on a transfer of resources that entails only partial deduction of domestic incremental benefits. This transfer, despite failing to reach the utilitarian global optimum, still represents a Pareto improvement over the pre-convention status quo. By imposing a particular multiplicative functional form on the utility of both host and ROW, additional results can be obtained. In particular, the optimal transfer implies a clawback factor decreasing with relative income differentials, and <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> financing dominates the domestic optimum even when price distortions are present in the host country. If removal of price distortions is a precondition for <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> funding, the analysis illustrates the magnitude of incentives necessary for the host to give up the distorted baseline.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theory for price-setting in public utilities, of which public goods {{will be considered}} a special case. Both public goods and utilities are cases of joint supplies and costs, where a good is to be supplied to and paid for by several users, and any increase in the quantity of the good is equally available to all users. The pricing system proposed {{will be based on}} the idea of each user's paying the social <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> due to his demands. To a certain extent, Coase proposed a similar idea, but it was not worked out except in special cases. The concept has been difficult to apply due to problems in defining <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> when there are joint costs. A meaningful definition of social <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> will be given here. Where the classical assumptions hold, our theory reduces to marginal-cost pricing; however, in the case of decreasing costs, results different from marginal-cost pricing are obtained. Since users may have quite different demands, incremental-cost charges will not be uniform. However, the incremental-cost system does posses certain equity properties. Furthermore, this system of charges will cover the complete costs of supplying a public service. Finally, the concept of <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> implies that, at the optimum investment, the marginal unit should be charged marginal cost, which is the condition necessary for welfare maximization. ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{calculate}} the <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> of nosocomial bacteremia {{caused by the}} most common organisms, classified by their antimicrobial susceptibility. METHODS: We selected patients who developed nosocomial bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These microorganisms were analyzed because of their high prevalence and they frequently present multidrug resistance. A control group consisted of patients classified within the same all-patient refined-diagnosis related group without bacteremia. Our hospital has an established cost accounting system (full-costing) that uses activity-based criteria to analyze cost distribution. A logistic regression model was fitted to estimate the probability of developing bacteremia for each admission (propensity score) and was used for propensity score matching adjustment. Subsequently, the propensity score was included in an econometric model to adjust the <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> of patients who developed bacteremia, as well as differences in this cost, {{depending on whether the}} microorganism was multidrug-resistant or multidrug-sensitive. RESULTS: A total of 571 admissions with bacteremia matched the inclusion criteria and 82, 022 were included in the control group. The mean cost was € 25, 891 for admissions with bacteremia and € 6, 750 for those without bacteremia. The mean <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> was estimated at € 15, 151 (CI, € 11, 570 to € 18, 733). Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa bacteremia had the highest mean <b>incremental</b> <b>cost,</b> € 44, 709 (CI, € 34, 559 to € 54, 859).

The recent introduction of entecavir in Australia {{for the treatment of}} CHB patients in the naive treatment setting has triggered significant optimism with regards to improved clinical outcomes for CHB patients. Abstract: Objective: To estimate, from an Australian healthcare perspective, the cost effectiveness of entecavir 0. 5 mg/day versus lamivudine 100 mg/day in the treatment of CHB patients naive to nucleos(t) ide therapy. Abstract: Methods: A cost-utility analysis to project the clinical and economic outcomes associated with CHB disease and treatment was conducted by developing two decision-tree models specific to hepatitis B e antigen-positive (HBeAg+ve) and HBeAg-ve CHB patient subsets. This analysis was constructed using the Australian payer perspective of direct costs and outcomes, with indirect medical costs and lost productivity not being included. The study population comprised a hypothetical cohort of 1000 antiviral treatment-naive CHB patients who received either entecavir 0. 5 mg/day or lamivudine 100 mg/day at model entry. The population of patients used in this analysis was representative of those patients likely to receive initial antiviral therapy in clinical practice in Australia. The long-term cost effectiveness of entecavir compared with lamivudine in the first-line treatment of CHB patients was expressed as an <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> per life-year gained (LYG) or QALY gained. Abstract: Results: Results revealed that the availability of entecavir 0. 5 mg/day as part of the Australian hepatologist's treatment armamentarium should result in significantly lower future rates of compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) events (i. e. 54 fewer cases of CC, seven fewer cases of DC, and 20 fewer cases of HCC over the model's timeframe for HBeAg+ve CHB patients, and 69 fewer cases of CC, eight fewer cases of DC and 25 fewer cases of HCC over the model's timeframe for HBeAg-ve CHB patients). Compared with lamivudine 100 mg/day, entecavir 0. 5 mg/day generated an estimated <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> per LYG of Australian dollars ($A, year 2006 values) 5046 and an estimated <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> per QALY of $A 5952 in the HBeAg+ve CHB patient population, an estimated <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> per LYG of $A 7063 and an estimated <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> per QALY of $A 8003 in the HBeAg-ve CHB patient population, and an overall estimated <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> per LYG of $A 5853 and an estimated <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> per QALY of $A 6772 in the general CHB population. Abstract: Conclusion: The availability of entecavir in Australian clinical practice should make long-term suppression of hepatitis B virus replication increasingly attainable, resulting in fewer CHB sequelae, at an acceptable financial cost. ...|$|R
