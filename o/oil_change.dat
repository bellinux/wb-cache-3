25|$|Following the season, Tom Renney {{replaced}} Quinn as the Oilers head coach. The {{one advantage}} {{to such a}} bad season was that the Oilers {{were able to make}} the first pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. The Oilers selected two-time Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy winner Taylor Hall, from the Windsor Spitfires with their pick. They used the off-season to begin the rebuild of the club around their young talent. Patrick O'Sullivan was traded to Phoenix, in exchange for Jim Vandermeer, Robert Nilsson was bought out of his contract and Oilers captain Ethan Moreau was placed on waivers and claimed by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Along with these players, several others were allowed to enter free agency including Mike Comrie, Marc-Antoine Pouliot and Ryan Potulny. Also during the off-season, radio announcer Rod Phillips announced his retirement. Phillips had been the Oilers' play-by-play announcer since 1973–74. Phillips would call ten specific games in 2010–11 before calling it quits. The 2010–11 Oilers season would be documented in the series <b>Oil</b> <b>Change.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} day of production, Cyrus and Hemsworth filmed a kiss in the ocean. Other scenes which took place in June {{included}} the carnival and volleyball tournament, both of which were filmed on the beach near the Tybee Island pier. Filming at the pier wrapped up on June 23, 2009 after shooting the scene in which Kim drops off Ronnie and Jonah to live with Steve. Scenes of the church fire were shot on July 10, 2009. Filming at the Georgia Tech Savannah campus began on July 16. Kinnear finished taping on July 17, 2009. Wedding scenes and a key driving scene were filmed at the Wormsloe Historic Site between July 20 and July 23 for twelve hours each day. Driving scenes in Isle of Hope, Georgia continued to the 28. By July 30, the movie had returned to Tybee Island for more beach scenes. Chaikin's character framed Cyrus' for stealing a watch on August 6. On August 10, Hemsworth performed an <b>oil</b> <b>change</b> and Cyrus browsed an upscale boutique in downtown Savannah for the movie. The funeral was filmed from August 11, 2009 to August 13, 2009 at the church set in Tybee Island. On August 15, further church burning scenes took place. The wrap party was held on the 16, and the cast and crew arrived in Atlanta, Georgia the following day to spend the last days of filming at the Georgia Aquarium. After analyzing the area on the 17th, the movie began shooting in public areas at dawn on the 18th to avoid crowds. Once the aquarium opened to the public at 10:00, filming shifted to behind-the-scenes areas.|$|E

30|$|The {{relationship}} between TFP environment {{change over time}} and changes in energy factors is analyzed to investigate the determinant of environmental productivity. As economic growth and the manufacturing sector are highly dependent on energy, the increase of oil prices has affected the economic growth of many emerging economies. The number of studies investigating the impact of <b>oil</b> price <b>changes</b> on economic activities has significantly grown since Hamilton [28] suggested a negative {{relationship between}} <b>oil</b> price <b>changes</b> and economic activities. This finding is also supported by Hooker [29], who argued that <b>oil</b> price <b>changes</b> significantly caused US inflation and productivity, and Hamilton [30], who analyzed the impact of <b>oil</b> price <b>changes</b> on US macroeconomic components during 2007 to 2008. In particular, Aye et al. [31] analyzed the effect of <b>oil</b> price <b>changes</b> on manufacturing production in South Africa. The analysis results suggested that <b>oil</b> price <b>changes</b> significantly and negatively impact South Africa’s manufacturing production and that manufacturing production responded asymmetrically to increasing and decreasing <b>oil</b> price <b>changes.</b> Unexpected increases in oil prices directly trigger a production cost increase and hence lead to declining productivity. If high oil costs persist, energy shifts or energy savings might be required for long-term productivity growth.|$|R
