5|$|A German {{victory on}} the Battle of Britain Day was unlikely. It could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{possible}} if Park had made crass errors {{and had been}} caught on the ground. Stephen Bungay postulates that had the loss rates been reversed, Dowding could have replaced those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on. Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It {{would have been able}} to meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E
5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> produced by demosponges.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E

5|$|IAU {{protocol}} is that discovery {{credit for}} a minor planet goes to whoever first submits {{a report to the}} MPC with enough positional data for a decent orbit determination, and that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it. This was Ortiz et al., and they proposed the name Ataecina, an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She is the equivalent of the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers. However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not.|$|E
5|$|Whale vocalization {{is likely}} to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the {{humpback}} whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. Humpback whales <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> heard making clicks, while toothed whales use sonar that may generate up to 20,000 watts of sound (+73dBm or +43dBw) and be heard for many miles.|$|E
5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and {{it may not have been}} in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E

5|$|A vast {{marshland}} could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> formed due to {{the underlying}} rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25million and 2million {{years ago when the}} Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|In Amenhotep I's ninth regnal year, a heliacal rise of Sothis was {{observed}} {{on the ninth}} day of the third month of summer. Modern astronomers have calculated that, if the observation was made from Memphis or Heliopolis, such an observation could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made on that day in 1537 BC. If the observation was made in Thebes, however, it could only {{have taken place in}} 1517 BC. The latter choice is usually accepted as correct since Thebes was the capital during the early 18th dynasty; hence, Amenhotep I is usually given an accession date in 1526 BC, although the possibility of 1546 BC is not entirely dismissed.|$|E

5|$|In Germany, the Crusade {{was seen}} as a huge debacle with many monks writing that it could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the work of the Devil. The {{anonymous}} monk who wrote the Annales Herbipolenses chronicle in Würzburg mentioned that for decades afterwards, noble families in Germany were ransoming back knights who had been taken prisoner in Anatolia using Armenian middle-men. The camp followers who had been taken prisoner and sold into slavery by the Turks were not so lucky. Of the 113 individuals known by name to {{have been involved in the}} Crusade, 22 died, 42 returned home while the fate of the last 49 is a mystery. Despite the distaste for the memory of the Second Crusade, the experience of the crusade had notable impact on German literature, with many epic poems of the late 12th century featuring battle scenes clearly inspired by the fighting in the crusade.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamian {{religion}} recognizes {{literally thousands}} of deities, and distinct iconographies have been identified for about a dozen. Less frequently, gods are identified by a written label or dedication; such labels would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> intended for the literate elites. In creating a religious object, the sculptor was not free to create novel images: the representation of deities, their attributes and context were as much part of the religion as the rituals and the mythology. Indeed, innovation and deviation from an accepted canon {{could be considered a}} cultic offense. The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques and seals suggests that detailed iconographies could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual tradition for such derivative works but have now been lost. It appears, though, that the Burney Relief was the product of such a tradition, not its source, since its composition is unique.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{historian}} Alex Woolf {{has suggested that}} the expedition originally may <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> intended for Orkney, and that in search for plunder it was followed by an expedition into the Irish Sea that by mere luck presented Magnus with the opportunity of raiding with Earl Ælfgar. The exact year that Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney died is not recorded anywhere, other than that it is stated in the Orkneyinga saga that it was in the later days of Harald Hardrada. Thus, it may be that his death provoked Magnus's expedition, and that the expedition was the occasion on which Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson, Thorfinn's successors as earls, submitted to Harald. Woolf has also proposed that Magnus may have played some part in the war in Scotland in 1057–1058, perhaps supporting Máel Coluim mac Donnchada against Lulach.|$|E

5|$|Quiriguá {{traditionally}} {{had been}} subordinate to its southern neighbour, Copán, and in 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, king of Copán, installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat upon Quiriguá's throne as his vassal. As early as 734, however, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat {{had shown that}} he was no longer an obedient subordinate of Copán when he started to refer to himself as k'ul ahaw, holy lord, instead of using the lesser term ahaw, subordinate lord; {{at the same time he}} began to use his own Quiriguá emblem glyph. These early assertions of independence can <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made if Quiriguá had managed to form an external alliance.|$|E
5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{wrote of}} another {{tradition}} which {{stated that the}} flag was waved at a battle in Waternish, in about 1580; and of another which told of how it was waved {{during a time when}} a cattle plague was raging, and that it stopped the murrain. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds {{believes}} The Sun Also Rises could <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{written in}} 1925: it perfectly captured {{the period between}} World WarI and the Great Depression, and immortalized a group of characters. In the years since its publication, the novel {{has been criticized for}} its anti-Semitism, as expressed in the characterization of Robert Cohn. Reynolds explains that although the publishers complained to Hemingway about his description of bulls, they allowed his use of Jewish epithets, which showed the degree to which anti-Semitism was accepted in the US after World WarI. Cohn represented the Jewish establishment and contemporary readers would have understood this from his description. Hemingway clearly makes Cohn unlikeable not only as a character but as a character who is Jewish. Critics of the 1970s and 1980s considered Hemingway to be misogynistic and homophobic; by the 1990s his work, including The Sun Also Rises, began to receive critical reconsideration by female scholars.|$|E

5|$|Several Einsatzgruppen leaders, {{including}} Ohlendorf, claimed at {{the trial}} to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews. To date no evidence {{has been found that}} such an order was ever issued. German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to convict the Einsatzgruppen leaders as accomplices to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the Einsatzgruppen had committed mass murder without orders, then they could have been convicted as perpetrators of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.|$|E
5|$|Though an {{absentee}} landlord, Leicester, who {{was also}} Baron of Denbigh, regarded the lordship {{as an integral part}} of a territorial base for a revived House of Dudley. He set about developing the town of Denbigh with large building projects; the church he planned, though, was never finished, being too ambitious. It would not <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the largest, but also the first post-Reformation church in England and Wales built according to a plan where the preacher was to take the centre instead of the altar, thus stressing the importance of preaching in the Protestant Church. In vain Leicester tried to have the nearby episcopal see of St. Asaph transferred to Denbigh. He also encouraged and supported the translation of the Bible and the Common Prayer Book into Welsh.|$|E
5|$|After {{determining}} the ranges of {{motion in the}} joints of the forelimb, the study went on to hypothesize about the predatory habits of Acrocanthosaurus. The forelimbs could not swing forward very far, unable even to scratch the animal's own neck. Therefore, they were not {{likely to have been}} used in the initial capture of prey and Acrocanthosaurus probably led with its mouth when hunting. On the other hand, the forelimbs were able to retract towards the body very strongly. Once prey had been seized in the jaws, the heavily muscled forelimbs may have retracted, holding the prey tightly against the body and preventing escape. As the prey animal attempted to pull away, it would <b>only</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> further impaled on the permanently flexed claws of the first two digits. The extreme hyperextensibility of the digits may have been an adaptation allowing Acrocanthosaurus to hold struggling prey without fear of dislocation. Once the prey was trapped against the body, Acrocanthosaurus may have dispatched it with its jaws. Another possibility is that Acrocanthosaurus held its prey in its jaws, while repeatedly retracting its forelimbs, tearing large gashes with its claws.|$|E
