5|$|In {{the second}} step, the crystal {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystal.</b> Multiple data sets {{may have to be}} collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E

40|$|Dye {{inclusion}} crystals {{have attracted}} researchers in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>crystal</b> growth for applications in solid state lasers. Attempt to grow tris glycine cadmium chloride (TGCC) crystals yielded bis glycine cadmium chloride crystals. Single crystals of bis glycine cadmium chloride (BGCC) and organic dye, namely xylenol orange tetra sodium salt (XO) doped BGCC crystals, were grown from aqueous solutions by slow evaporation technique from <b>the</b> mixture <b>of</b> an aqueous solution of glycine and cadmium chloride in 3 : 1 molar ratio {{at a constant}} temperature <b>of</b> 35 °C. <b>The</b> grown <b>crystals</b> are up to <b>the</b> dimension <b>of</b> 20 × 20 × 5 mm 3. Characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystals</b> was made using a single crystal X-ray diffractometer for obtaining <b>the</b> structure. <b>The</b> <b>crystal</b> is monoclinic with P 21 /n space group. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) {{was used to evaluate}} crystalline perfection. Perfection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> undoped <b>crystals</b> is higher than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dye doped <b>crystals.</b> Thermal stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystals</b> is tested from differential scanning calorimetry.

Dale said his script for Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crystal</b> Skull was printed on tin foil so {{it was impossible to}} replicate, {{in order to keep the}} film's plot a secret.

5|$|When {{a crystal}} is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it {{scatters}} the X-rays into {{a pattern of}} spots or reflections that can be observed on a screen behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a laser pointer at a compact disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector or with a charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.|$|E

5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystal.</b> The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E

5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the Bragg model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence Bragg proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
