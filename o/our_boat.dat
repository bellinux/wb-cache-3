500|$|On 5 May {{the worst}} of the weather returned, and brought them close to {{disaster}} in the largest seas so far. Shackleton later wrote: [...] "We felt <b>our</b> <b>boat</b> lifted and flung forward like a cork in breaking surf". The crew bailed frantically to keep afloat. Nevertheless, they were still moving towards their goal, and a dead reckoning calculation by Worsley on the next day, 6 May, suggested that they were now [...] from the western point of South Georgia. The strains of the past two weeks were by now taking their toll on the men. Shackleton observed that Vincent had collapsed and ceased to be {{an active member of the}} crew, McCarthy was [...] "weak, but happy", McNish was weakening but still showing [...] "grit and spirit".|$|E
500|$|The Oxford crew weighed {{an average}} of nearly [...] more per rower than their opponents. [...] Oxford's Matthew Pinsent was the {{heaviest}} rower while Cambridge's Sinclair Gore was the youngest, aged 19. Cambridge's crew featured three returning Blues in Dirk Bangert, David Gillard and James Behrens, while Oxford saw five former Boat Race rowers return. Overall, half of the rowers were non-British (six nationalities representing Oxford, three representing Cambridge) and the same number were postgraduates. [...] The Cambridge boat club president Behrens claimed: [...] "All <b>our</b> <b>boat</b> are at Cambridge on academic merit. [...] They came for a particular course... and they also row." [...] In contrast, an editorial in The Times claimed: [...] "The performers are no longer ingenuous native undergraduates but supercharged, international, professional rowing machines." [...] Oxford's Bruce Robertson (men's eight) and Pinsent (coxless pair) were both gold medallists at the Barcelona Olympics.|$|E
2500|$|... "The boat I was in {{was picked}} up by the Carpathia at 7 a.m. on Monday, we having rowed three miles to her, as we could not wait for her to come up on account of <b>our</b> <b>boat</b> taking in so much water that we would not have stayed afloat much longer." ...|$|E

50|$|We landed to cook {{breakfast on}} the {{opposite}} shore to them (Breakfast Pt.). We made signs to them {{to come over and}} waved green boughs. Soon after which 7 of them came over in 2 canoes and landed near <b>our</b> <b>boats.</b> They left their spears in the canoes and came to us. We tied beads etc. about them and left them our fire to dress their muscles which they went about as soon as <b>our</b> <b>boats</b> put off.|$|R

2500|$|... "We {{pulled back}} to where the vessel had sunk and on our way picked up six men who were {{swimming}} – two of whom were drunk and gave us much trouble all the time. The six men we picked up were hauled into the boat by the women. Two of these men died in the boat. The boat we were in started to take in water; I do not know how. We had to bail. I was standing in ice cold water {{up to the top}} of my boots all the time, and rowing continuously for nearly five hours. We took off about fifteen more people who were standing on a capsized boat. In all, <b>our</b> <b>boat</b> had by that time sixty-five or sixty-six people. There was no room to sit down in <b>our</b> <b>boat,</b> so we all stood, except some sitting along the side.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{started from}} 10 March 2012 in Chennai and the {{director}} revealed on 12 March 2012 {{that he is going}} to croon a song and the movie contains only 3 songs. The unit of Haridas had a narrow escape as their boat capsized in the high seas of Dhanushkodi, during a shoot on 27-June-2012. After shooting in the sea one of the boats that they were traveling capsized due to the high tide around the area. Director Kumarvelan said, [...] "I was filming a song sequence on the lead pair when there was a sudden rise in tide. A killer tide hit <b>our</b> <b>boat</b> and it capsized. We immediately sent Sneha safely to the shores in another life boat. My cameraman R. Rathnavelu started swimming, but I don't know how to swim. So, I was forced to hold on to the boat for a while till some local fishermen rescued us. It was a horrifying experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from <b>our</b> <b>boat,</b> and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I {{could see she was}} going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and it seemed as if she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E
6000|$|... “Why, <b>our</b> <b>boat’s</b> gone off!” they {{replied in}} an indignant tone. “We {{just got out}} to {{disentangle}} the tow-line, and when we looked round, it was gone!” ...|$|R

6000|$|We had a {{good time}} on the island, and stayed nearly all day. Toward the end of the afternoon, we started back for the creek and <b>our</b> <b>boat.</b> We had a long walk, for we had been {{exploring}} the island pretty well, and when, at last, we reached the creek, we saw that <b>our</b> <b>boat</b> was gone! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{other is}} not a channel at all; it is a mere bay that leads to nothing; so none of <b>our</b> <b>boats</b> or people can be there. The savages, as I am your husband, Bridget!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you coming}} back with <b>our</b> <b>boat</b> or not?" [...] demanded Ham Spink, after an awkward pause, during which our friends {{remained}} silent.|$|E
60|$|Our first anxiety, of course, was <b>our</b> <b>boat,</b> towards {{which we}} ran {{as if by}} one impulse, the instant the wind had subsided.|$|E
60|$|HAROLD. Friends, in {{that last}} inhospitable plunge <b>Our</b> <b>boat</b> hath burst her ribs; but ours are whole; I have but bark'd my hands.|$|E
5000|$|We withdrew to <b>our</b> <b>boats,</b> {{not without}} {{a great number of}} the said people, a part of which, that when they saw our people tired, took them upon themselves, as on a horse, and carried them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Send this {{on board}} the {{schooner}} at once, Mr. Carter. Wait a moment. When <b>our</b> <b>boats</b> shove off for the sandbank have the forecastle gun fired. I want to know when that dead man has left the ship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. Oliver. [...] "Still, I think there's a {{means of}} getting over the difficulty. Shove the canoe in. They'll have to carry their <b>boat</b> down, and <b>our</b> <b>boat's</b> lying nearer the head yonder than theirs is." ...|$|R

60|$|I gave a wild shout; Walkirk dashed {{out of his}} bunk; {{there was}} a call from above; then I felt a shock, and <b>our</b> <b>boat</b> keeled over on her {{starboard}} side. In a moment, however, she receded from the other vessel, and righted herself. I {{do not know that}} Walkirk had ever read in a book what he ought to do in such an emergency, but he seized a boat hook and pushed <b>our</b> <b>boat</b> away from the larger vessel.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{notice of}} this, we stood in, and came all to an anchor {{in the very}} creek; and, sending <b>our</b> <b>boats</b> up the creek, found the water {{perfectly}} fresh and very good upon the ebb, about a league up the river.|$|R
60|$|For {{one more}} day we floated {{downward}} {{on the face of}} the waters between the forest walls of the wilderness, and at length we landed in a little gully on the north shore of the river, and there we hid <b>our</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s no square” Wolf Larsen said. “Old Mother Nature’s {{going to}} get up on her hind legs and howl for all that’s in her, and it’ll keep us jumping, Hump, to pull through with half <b>our</b> <b>boats.</b> You’d better run up and loosen the topsails.” ...|$|R
