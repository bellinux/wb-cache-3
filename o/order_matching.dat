50|$|AOM trading {{performs}} the <b>order</b> <b>matching</b> process without human intervention. After brokerage houses electronically send {{buy or sell}} orders from their offices to the SET mainframe computer, the ASSET system queues the orders and arranges them according to a price-then-time priority. This means orders are first grouped according to price, with the best price taking precedence. Then, within each price group, orders are arranged according to time. In terms of the matching process, there are two methods: continuous <b>order</b> <b>matching</b> and call market method.Continuous <b>Order</b> <b>Matching</b> procedures operate during the regular trading sessions. The ASSET continuously matches the first buy and sell orders in the queue, {{and at the same}} time, confirms each executed transaction via the member (broker's) terminal.Call market matching is used in calculating the opening and closing prices of a security at the opening and closing of trading. This method allows brokers to enter their orders to be queued for matching at a specified time at a single price that generates the greatest trading volumes for that particular stock.|$|E
