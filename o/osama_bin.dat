5|$|In June the ISI {{arrested the}} owner of a safe house rented to the CIA to observe <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's {{compound}} and five CIA informants.|$|E
5|$|In a May 2, 2011, {{interview}} with ABC News, Cheney praised the Obama administration {{for the operation}} {{that resulted in the}} killing of <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden.|$|E
5|$|Omar bin Laden, son of <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden, {{published}} a complaint on May 10, 2011, that the burial at sea deprived {{the family of}} a proper burial.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Bush—along with Hector Ruiz, Charles Matthews, Melinda Perrin, Julius Glickman and Admiral William H. McRaven, the Navy Seal {{who oversaw}} the raid that killed <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden—was named a Distinguished Alumnus of the University of Texas at Austin.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013, a non-custom factory-made Emerson CQC-7 knife {{carried by}} Matt Bissonnette {{who served as}} point man on the mission to kill or capture <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden was {{auctioned}} off for charity, netting over $35,400.|$|E
5|$|Media {{accounts}} {{had reported}} that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner courtyard and to clear the main house from the ground floor up. The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls {{and then into the}} house. As a result, <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house, that <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden {{was killed}} in the raid and initial {{versions}} said three other men and a woman were killed as well: bin Laden's adult son Khalid, bin Laden's courier Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, al-Kuwaiti's brother Abrar and Abrar's wife Bushra.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's {{image is}} {{featured}} on {{a target for}} Casey's shooting range. Coincidentally, bin Laden {{was killed in a}} raid on May 1, 2011, around 16:00 Eastern Daylight Time, one day before the episode was aired.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States {{responded by}} {{launching}} the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda. Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded {{the powers of}} law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Although al-Qaeda's leader, <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks. Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq as motives. After evading capture for almost a decade, <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden was located and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. Navy in May 2011.|$|E
5|$|Two SEALs {{broke through}} the bedroom door. Bin Laden's wife Amal was {{on the edge of}} the bed {{shouting}} in Arabic at the SEALs, and <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an AKS-74U kept by the headboard. The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Alec Station, the CIA's unit {{dedicated}} to tracking <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden, {{had discovered that}} two of the other hijackers, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar, had multiple-entry visas to the United States well before 9/11. Two FBI agents inside the unit tried to alert FBI headquarters, but CIA officers rebuffed them.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, snipers in the {{hovering}} Razor 2 helicopter {{shot and killed}} Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{when he came to}} the door of the guest house firing an AK-47. One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was standing behind him. The Razor 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into the main house with explosives. As the Razor 2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots. The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and al-Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's wife Amal al-Sadah.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{persuaded the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to allow bases for U.S. ground troops and war {{planes in the}} nation. This was an {{important}} element {{of the success of the}} Gulf War, as well as a lightning-rod for Islamists, such as <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden, who opposed having non-Muslim armies near their holy sites.|$|E
5|$|Saleh has {{repeatedly}} stated that Afghan intelligence believed and had shared information about <b>Osama</b> <b>Bin</b> Laden hiding {{in an area}} close to Abbottabad, Pakistan, four years before he (Bin Laden) was killed there. Saleh had shared the information with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf who had angrily brushed off the claim taking no action.|$|E
5|$|In November 1999, Jarrah left Hamburg for Afghanistan, {{where he}} spent three months. While there, he met with al-Qaeda leader <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden in January 2000. Jarrah {{returned}} to Hamburg {{at the end of}} January and in February obtained a new passport containing no stamped records of his travels by reporting his passport as stolen.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Zardari and Karzai met in Islamabad {{and both}} {{advocated}} fighting insurgents {{rather than trying}} to end the war with diplomacy. Zardari went to the United States in January 2011 to attend Special Envoy Holbrooke's funeral. Following <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's death in a compound in Abbottabad in May 2011, Obama called Zardari and collaborated on the events.|$|E
5|$|The United States Department of Justice {{released}} a further eleven documents in March 2015. The documents {{were part of}} the trial against Abid Naseer, who was convicted of plotting to bomb a Manchester shopping mall in 2009. They included letters to and from <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden in the year before his death, and showed the extent of the damage the CIA drone program had done to Al-Qaeda.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who first {{presented}} it to <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden in 1996. At that time, bin Laden and al-Qaeda were {{in a period of}} transition, having just relocated back to Afghanistan from Sudan. The 1998 African Embassy bombings and bin Laden's 1998 fatwā marked a turning point, as bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} al-Qaeda {{can be traced}} to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden {{traveled}} to Afghanistan and helped organize Arab mujahideen to resist the Soviets. Under the guidance of Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden became more radical. In 1996, bin Laden issued his first fatwā, calling for American soldiers to leave Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|As Peter {{exits the}} {{abortion}} clinic, he notices a pro-life rally nearby. At the rally, a protester shows Peter a video tape discouraging abortion (as {{a reference to}} the cult classic 1936 American propaganda exploitation film Reefer Madness), portraying it as murder, larceny, jaywalking and securities fraud. The tape claims that abortion prevented Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's would-be assassin, a fourth Stooge brother, of The Three Stooges, and Islamic extremist <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's America-loving brother from being born.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{sits on the}} House Homeland Security Committee {{as well as the}} Foreign Affairs Committee, {{where he}} is the ranking member of the Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats Subcommittee. He joined a Congressional {{delegation}} to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, shortly after the 2011 execution of <b>Osama</b> <b>Bin</b> Laden. After TSA officers in Boston were accused of racial profiling in 2012, he requested a Homeland Security Committee hearing into the accusations.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, {{who was at}} a {{restaurant}} with his wife, to inform him that <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden had been killed. The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At the Ground Zero memorial, Bush read a letter that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to a widow who lost five sons during the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2012, American {{officials}} {{claimed that}} they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253. American officials stated that the attack would have involved a more sophisticated bomb, also planted in undergarments, {{and would have been}} deployed near the anniversary of the killing of <b>Osama</b> <b>Bin</b> Laden. Officials did not state whether any persons had been arrested or charged in their operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{plaintiff}} was Salim Ahmed Hamdan, {{a citizen}} of Yemen {{who worked as a}} bodyguard and chauffeur for <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden. Hamdan had formerly worked in Afghanistan on an agricultural project that Bin Laden had developed. Hamdan was captured by militia forces during the invasion of Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 and turned over to the United States. In 2002, he was sent by the US to its new Guantanamo Bay detention camp at its naval base in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|By midday, the U.S. National Security Agency and German {{intelligence}} agencies had intercepted communications pointing to <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden. Two {{of the hijackers}} were known to have travelled with a bin Laden associate to Malaysia in 2000 and hijacker Mohammed Atta had previously gone to Afghanistan. He and others {{were part of a}} terrorist cell in Hamburg. One {{of the members of the}} Hamburg cell was discovered to have been in communication with Khalid Sheik Mohammed who was identified as a member of al-Qaeda.|$|E
5|$|Carney was {{appointed}} U.S. Ambassador to Sudan on 27 June 1995 {{during a period}} of turmoil in U.S.-Sudan relations. <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden had fled Saudi Arabia for the safe confines of Khartoum a few years earlier, and Sudan's alleged harboring and abetting of Muslim extremists on its soil was attracting attention of counterterrorism experts in the United States and abroad. Carney's tenure as ambassador followed a tumultuous period during which his predecessor, Donald K. Petterson, had been forced to draw down embassy staff by half and send their families back to America when terrorist threats were made against U.S. diplomats stationed in Khartoum.|$|E
5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body of Lies, opined that the CIA had become careless out of desperation. According to Ignatius, it would be obvious that the CIA would have been so eager to acquire knowledge about the location of <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden that it would take every available opportunity to get information. Shoshana Bryen, a U.S. security expert, said that the bombing would make Israel and the U.S. wary in their future dealings with Jordan.|$|E
5|$|In {{pursuing}} the Clinton administration's energy objectives through {{construction of the}} $4.5 billion Afghanistan Oil Pipeline, Raphel created ill will with Afghanistan's Northern Alliance, then {{under the command of}} Ahmad Shah Massoud. Massoud-controlled militias blocked the pipeline's northern access route due to the longstanding civil war with Taliban forces. After Massoud was killed September 9, 2001 in a Taliban bombing, Raphel's critics accused her of collaborating with the Taliban to advance American commercial interests even as the group gave refuge to <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other senior al-Qaeda leaders in the time leading up to the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna {{gets into}} trouble after she is misquoted in Maxim magazine, {{allegedly}} {{saying that she}} hates the troops. This happened due to Jenna mishearing the interviewer and thinking he meant theater troupes. The resulting outrage prompts Jack to get her an interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews to clear up the confusion over her comments. During the interview, Jenna confuses <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden and then-Senator Barack Obama, who was running for the Democratic Party nomination for President. A further attempt to clear Jenna's name backfires when swastikas are accidentally brandished on the TGS with Tracy Jordan stage.|$|E
5|$|The Chaser APEC pranks were {{a series}} of comic stunts that {{targeted}} the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Summit (2–9 September 2007), in Sydney, Australia. They were coordinated and performed by the Australian satire group The Chaser for the television series The Chaser's War on Everything. The most prominent prank was the breach of an APEC restricted zone {{in the heart of}} Sydney central business district on 6 September. Julian Morrow directed a fake Canadian motorcade, which was allowed through the restricted zone by police and not detected until Chas Licciardello alighted, dressed as <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{officials}} {{said there were}} 22 people in the compound. Five were killed, including <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden. Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors. The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents. The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound. Because {{of a lack of}} verifiable information, some of what follows is thinly sourced.|$|E
5|$|During April 2011 {{internal}} deliberations of the president's innermost {{circle of}} advisors {{over whether to}} order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden, Clinton {{was among those who}} argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan. Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden's death, Clinton {{played a key role in}} the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader. During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).|$|E
5|$|During {{high school}} and college, Shehri was deeply {{religious}} and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many {{young people in the}} region idolized <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden, who had family ties to the area. Wail's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.|$|E
5|$|Mihdhar {{was born}} in Saudi Arabia and fought in the Bosnian War during the 1990s. In early 1999, he {{traveled}} to Afghanistan where, as an experienced and respected jihadist, he was selected by <b>Osama</b> <b>bin</b> Laden {{to participate in the}} attacks. Mihdhar arrived in California with fellow hijacker Nawaf al-Hazmi in January 2000, after traveling to Malaysia for the Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit. At this point, the CIA was aware of Mihdhar, and he was photographed in Malaysia with another al-Qaeda member who was involved in the USS Cole bombing. The CIA did not inform the FBI when it learned that Mihdhar and Hazmi had entered the United States, and Mihdhar was not placed on any watchlists until late August 2001.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (<b>Osama</b> <b>Bin</b> Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
