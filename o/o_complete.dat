40|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgery (MIS) {{has become very}} common in recent years, thanks to the many advantages it provides for patients. Since {{it is difficult for}} surgeons to learn and master this technique, several training methods and metrics have been proposed, both to improve the surgeon's abilities and also to assess his/her skills. This paper presents the use of the WB- 1 R (Waseda Bioinstrumentation system no. 1. Refined), which was developed at Waseda University, Tokyo, to investigate and analyze a surgeon's movements and performance. Specifically, the system can measure the movements of the head, the arms, and the hands, as well as several physiological parameters. In this paper we present our experiment to evaluate a surgeon's ability to handle surgical instruments and his/her depth perception using a laparoscopic view. Our preliminary analysis of a subset of the acquired data (i. e. comfort of the subjects; the amount of time it took <b>o</b> <b>complete</b> each exercise; and respiration) clearly shows that the expert surgeon and the group of medical students perform very differently. Therefore, WB- 1 R (or, better, a newer version tailored specifically for use in the operating room) could provide important additional information to help assess the experience and performance of surgeons, thus leading {{to the development of a}} Global Performance Index for surgeons during MIS. These analyses and modeling, moreover, are an important step towards the automatization and the robotic assistance of the surgical gesture...|$|E

In this contribution, we use the GRACE orbit and range measurements to recover the Earth’s gravity field model, thus we only need to integrate the position vectors. We use the range differences between two adjacent epochs to eliminate the range ambiguities. Using GRACE Level- 1 B RL 02 data released by Jet Propulsion laboratory, the gravity field model TJGRACE 02 <b>O</b> <b>complete</b> to degree and order 90 is developed from 7 years of reduced dynamic orbits covering the period 2004 – 2010, and the gravity field model TJGRACE 02 K complete to degree and order 120 is computed from 1 month of kinematic orbits and K-band range data of January. Comparing the degree geoid errors of our new models with recent gravity field models such as the CHAMP-only models EIGEN-CHAMP 05 S, AIUB-CHAMP 03 S, ULUX-CHAMP 2013 S and the GRACE-only models GGM 05 S, Tongji-GRACE 01 {{as well as a}} monthly model from the ITG-GRACE 2010 time series, and validating these models with GPS-leveling data sets in the USA, we can conclude that the TJGRACE 02 O model is more accurate than all the CHAMP-only models and TJGRACE 02 K is comparable in quality to the corresponding GRACE monthly model from ITG-GRACE 2010.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} how to optimize parameters {{in order to}} maximize the amount of coaxial air that can be provided to a nonpremixed jet flame without causing the flame to blow out. Maximizing the coaxial air velocity is important in the effort to reduce the flame length and the oxides of nitrogen emitted from gas turbines and industrial burners, a majority of which use coaxial air. Previous measurements by the latter two authors have shown that a sixfold reduction in the NO x emission index of a jet flame is possible if sufficient coaxial air can be provided without blowing the flame out. The coaxial air shortens the flame and forces the reaction zone to overlap regions of higher gas velocity, which reduces the residence time for NO x formation. The present work concentrates on demonstrating ways to prevent flame blowout when the following two constraints are imposed: (1) the coaxial air velocities must be sufficient o shorten the flame to a specified length (in order to reduce NO x emissions) and (2) the coaxial air flow rate must be sufficient <b>o</b> <b>complete</b> combustion without he need for ambient air, which is a common practical constraint. The zero swirl case is considered first, and the effects of adding swirl are measured and directly compared. The following were systematically varied: fuel velocity, air velocity, fuel tube diameter, air tube diameter, fuel type, and swirl number. Measurements demonstrate that coaxial air alone (with zero swirl) can cause up to a twofold reduction in flame length. However, the flame is stable only if the velocity-to-diameter ratio of the fuel jet does not exceed a critica...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{attention in the}} literature being given to the desorption behaviour of smaller volatiles, the thermal properties of complex organics, such as ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH), which are predicted to be formed within interstellar ices, {{have yet to be}} characterized. With this in mind, reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) have been used to probe the adsorption and desorption of C 2 H 5 OH deposited on top of water (H 2 O) films of various thicknesses grown on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) at 98 K. Unlike many other molecules detected within interstellar ices, C 2 H 5 OH has a comparable sublimation temperature to H 2 O and therefore gives rise to a complicated desorption pro. le. RAIRS and TPD show that C 2 H 5 OH is incorporated into the underlying ASW film during heating, due to a morphology change in both the C 2 H 5 OH and H 2 O ices. Desorption peaks assigned to C 2 H 5 OH co-desorption with amorphous, crystalline (CI) and hexagonal H 2 O-ice phases, in addition to C 2 H 5 OH multilayer desorption are observed in the TPD. When C 2 H 5 OH is deposited beneath ASW films, or is co-deposited as a mixture with H 2 <b>O,</b> <b>complete</b> co-desorption is observed, providing further evidence of thermally induced mixing between the ices. C 2 H 5 OH is also shown to modify the desorption of H 2 O at the ASW-CI phase transition. This behaviour has not been previously reported for more commonly studied volatiles found within astrophysical ices. These results are consistent with astronomical observations, which suggest that gas-phase C 2 H 5 OH is localized in hotter regions of the ISM, such as hot cores...|$|E

After {{an overview of the}} current nuclear power plant situation in the United States following TMI and Chernobyl accidents, the result of the U. S.

This project is synthetically described, with the methodology developed for system analysis, and the technological and plant design innovations that are in conformity with the revolutionary requirements of Generation IV nuclear power plants. A summary of the RELAP 5 nodalization and {{a detailed description of the}} procedures and assumptions used in the definition of the main components of the IRIS system at March 2003 are then presented. The attention is focused on the contributes that has been provided in this thesis: the IRIS integral reactor coolant system residence time calculation, and the development of a methodology to generate IRIS initial steady state conditions to assist the safety assessment procedure. The previous section provides the basis to the preliminary study of some of the main design basis accidents of IRIS reactor presented in the final part of this work, and performed following the guidelines of the NRC Standard Review Plan and AP 600 safety analysis report.
