During {{the financial}} crisis, however, the performance premium <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> becomes negative, which may be because of the slower decision times <b>of</b> <b>teams,</b> which are especially costly during times of rapidly changing market conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this contribution, {{we try to}} investigate, {{based on}} a simple {{theoretical}} model, what the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> in a league is, {{taking into account the}} most important determinants of club revenue and fans utility. The number <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> fixed by a monopoly league representing the interests of the participating clubs is clearly smaller than the number <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> in the competitive free-entry market equilibrium. We have also tested, using European football data, whether the long-term equilibrium number <b>of</b> <b>teams</b> in the national top divisions has been determined by the market or by the insiders of the monopoly leagues...|$|R
