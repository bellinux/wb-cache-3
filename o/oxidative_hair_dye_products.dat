40|$|Background: Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} to <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products</b> {{is an important}} health care issue since the practice of hair dyeing is increasing worldwide and the sensitization rate to the mainly used ingredient, para-phenylenediamine (PPD), is relatively high. Immunologic cross-reactivity to chemicals structurally related to PPD is a common issue and complicates the development of alternative hair dye ingredients. Objective: To determine the rate of cross-reactivity to the newly developed PPD derivative F 000175918 by means of patch testing previously PPD-sensitized individuals, using an oxidative hair dye simulation. Methods: Previously PPD-sensitized individuals (+, ++ or +++ reactions at diagnostic patch testing) {{with a history of}} allergic {{contact dermatitis}} after using hair dye products, were patch tested with PPD derivative F 000175918. The oxidative hair dyeing process was simulated using a regular hair dye solution containing the PPD derivative and mixing this in a 1 : 1 ratio with hydrogen peroxide. Application times were 30, 45 and 60 minutes. The patch-tested skin areas were assessed after 48 and 72 hours. After 7 days an assessment for eventual late reactions was performed. Results: Cross-reactivity to PPD derivative F 000175918 occurred in 11 out of 29 of subjects (38 %). Depending on the individual PPD sensitization status, extremely sensitized subjects (+++) reacted in 2 out of 3 cases (67 %), strongly sensitized subjects (++) in 6 out of 11 cases (55 %) and weakly sensitized subjects (+) in 3 out of 15 cases (20 %). No late reactions, indicative for active sensitization, occurred in the negative responders. Conclusion: Although PPD derivative F 000175918 is a hair dye ingredient with a lower sensitizing potential than the commonly used ones, it is still likely to give cross-reactions in previously PPD-sensitized individuals, especially in those with a high sensitization status (++ and +++). ...|$|E
40|$|Background Chemical products, {{cosmetics}} {{and other products}} handled by consumers and workers frequently contain contact allergens (skin sensitizers). Contact allergens are low-molecular substances which may induce contact allergy (Type IV allergy) after contact with skin. 15 - 20 % of adults are allergic {{to one or more}} of the most common contact allergens, which can cause allergic contact dermatitis (eczema) on any part of the body, although the hands and face are the most common sites. Contact allergy is a lifelong condition, requiring avoidance of further skin exposure to the allergen, in order to minimize the risk of developing contact dermatitis. Aim The main aim of this thesis project was to contribute to a scientific basis for preventive measures to reduce contact allergy and dermatitis. Skin sensitizing hair dye substances and preservatives in products frequently used by consumers were of special concern. Methods In study I and II, we assessed the occurrence and use pattern of skin sensitizing hair dye substances in hair dye products available to consumers in one Northern European country and one Southern European country, based on ingredient labeling. In study III, we examined if typographical design and the order of the list of ingredients could improve the readability of product ingredient labels. This was done by comparing the readability of original product labels versus alternative formats we developed, using several quantitative and qualitative measures. Study IV was an experimental clinical study, repeated open application test (ROAT), in which we examined whether permissible concentrations of the preservative methylisothiazolinone (MI) in cosmetic rinse-off products had the potential to elicit allergic contact dermatitis. Main findings In study I and II we showed that many different potent skin sensitizing hair dye substances are commonly used in <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products</b> on the market and the products contain a “cocktail” of these sensitizers. In study III we showed that rather simple adjustments in the design of cosmetic product ingredient labels would improve their readability and understanding significantly. In study IV we showed that cosmetic rinse-off products preserved with 100 ppm or 50 ppm MI elicited allergic reactions in the majority of previously sensitized individuals...|$|E

40|$|<b>Oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> <b>products</b> {{consist of}} a mixture of a broad {{spectrum}} of organic compounds including the <b>hair</b> <b>dye's</b> so-called active compounds and the matrix-forming compounds. Forty-seven dye intermedi-ates commonly used in cosmetic formulations have thus been analyzed by RP-HPLC, and their chromato-graphic characteristics have been recorded. Since the matrix compounds could interfere with the quantitative analysis of the active compounds, eighteen matrix compounds commonly used in cosmetic formulations have been tested for their influence on dye intermediate determination. Since some of them do affect the chromatographic behavior of the dye intermediates, an isolation procedure, for separating matrix compo-nents from the dye-forming compounds, consisting of a liquid-liquid extraction by n-heptane, has been set up. In most cases, this procedure is effective for the extraction of the matrix <b>products.</b> Moreover, the <b>dye</b> intermediates are not extracted by n-heptane, and their chromatographic behavior is not altered by the extraction procedure. In summary, this study has shown that a reference method for the analysis of <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> should include a compulsory extraction step before submission of samples to RP-HPLC...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to review data {{about the safety of}} the hair {{colorant}} product toward both occupational and individual users. Most current studies indicate that consumers should feel safe in concluding that there is no risk of cancer from the professional or individual use of hair colorant products. My methodology includes reading pertinent articles and summarizing the studies into the tables which separate categories regarding to study types, samples sizes, genders, ethnicities, ages, allergies, risk of specific cancer types, and the conclusions of each study. Once I have collected data from all relevant recent studies, I will analyze the findings, draw conclusions, and suggest areas where additional research is needed. Hair dying is an ancient cosmetic practice that {{can be traced back to}} about 4000 years ago. However, <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> has become very widely used since the beginning of 20 th century.

40|$|The hairdresser {{occupation}} {{is classified}} as probably carcinogenic to humans based on an excess risk for urinary bladder cancer, but it is unclear if current work as a hairdresser entails such a risk. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate if hairdressers have an ongoing exposure to selected carcinogenic aromatic amines. We recruited 295 hairdressers, 32 consumers of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> and 60 controls. All participants were non-smoking females, 18 - 55 years of age. Exposure over the past 4 months was determined for eight aromatic amines measured as haemoglobin (Hb) adducts. Hb adduct concentrations for hairdressers and consumers were not significantly {{higher than those of}} the controls for any of the eight aromatic amines. However, within the hairdresser group, ortho (o) and meta (m) -toluidine adduct concentrations tended to increase with the number of performed treatments with light-colour <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> Furthermore, Hb adduct concentrations of o-toluidine increased significantly with the number of performed treatments of hair waving and m-toluidine adducts with the number of performed treatments with other <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye.</b> Professional <b>hair</b> <b>products,</b> mainly <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> were collected from hairdressing salons and analysed for o-toluidine content. o-Toluidine was found in most of the analysed <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> but with a wide range in concentrations, even for the same colours. For semi-permanent (non-oxidative) <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> oxidizing agents, <b>hair</b> waving products, and bleaching products, the content of o-toluidine was low or below limit of quantitation. To explore the effect of exposure to o- and m-toluidine among hairdressers, we determined telomere length and methylation of genes related to bladder or lung cancer. Hairdressers had a modest shortening of telomere length compared to non-hairdressers. No overall associations between telomere length and any of the Hb adducts were found, and no clear patterns between exposure as a hairdresser and hypermethylation of the selected genes. In conclusion hairdressers seem to have an ongoing occupational exposure to o- and m-toluidine as indicated by the associations with performed treatments with light-colour <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye,</b> other <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> and <b>hair</b> waving. This is further supported by our finding of o-toluidine in most of the analysed <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> However, no clear patterns were found between exposure as a hairdressers and hypermethylation of genes associated with bladder cancer and lung cancer. We observed a modest shortening of telomere length among the hairdressers, but the causality of the observation is uncertain since no overall exposure-response association was observed...|$|R

However, little is known about immune responses to PTD-containing <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> Objectives To study immune responses induced by PTD-containing <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> in mice. Methods Immune responses against two different permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products</b> containing 1 · 60 % (w/w) and 0 · 48 % (w/w) PTD within the colour gel, and various concentrations of pure PTD were studied. The local inflammatory response was measured by ear swelling and cell infiltration, and T- and B-cell infiltration and proliferation was determined in the draining lymph nodes. Results Concentration-dependent immune responses were seen to PTD both in the skin and draining lymph nodes. The <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> containing 1 · 60 % PTD induced strong local inflammation and caused T- and B-cell infiltration and proliferation as well as an increased number of regulatory T cells in the draining lymph nodes. In contrast, the <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> containing 0 · 48 % PTD induced skin inflammation but only minor responses in the draining lymph nodes. Conclusions Consumer-available PTD-containing permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> can be potent immune activators inducing both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{examined}} the methodology of observational studies that explored an association between personal use of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products</b> {{and the risk of}} bladder cancer. METHODS: Data were pooled from epidemiological studies using a general variance-based meta-analytic method that employed confidence intervals. The outcome of interest was a summary relative risk (RRs) reflecting the risk of bladder cancer development associated with use of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products</b> vs. non-use. Sensitivity analyses were performed to explain any observed statistical heterogeneity and to explore the influence of specific study characteristics of the summary estimate of effect. RESULTS: Initially combining homogenous data from six case-control and one cohort study yielded a non-significant RR of 1. 01 (0. 92, 1. 11), suggesting no association between <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use and bladder cancer development. Sensitivity analyses examining the influence of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> type, color, and study design on this suspected association showed that uncontrolled confounding and design limitations contributed to a spurious non-significant summary RR. The sensitivity analyses yielded statistically significant RRs ranging from 1. 22 (1. 11, 1. 51) to 1. 50 (1. 30, 1. 98), indicating that personal use of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products</b> increases bladder cancer risk by 22 % to 50 % vs. non-use.

40|$|<b>Oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} hair dying products. Hairdressers are exposed to the allergens found in <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> during the process of applying <b>dyes</b> to the <b>hair,</b> when cutting freshly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair,</b> or as a consequence of prior contamination of the working environment. pphenylenediamine, toluene- 2, 5 -diamine and its sulphate {{are the most}} common ingredients in <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> that cause allergic contact dermatitis in hairdressers. Cross-reactivity of p-phenylenediamine with para-amino benzoic acid, sulphonamides, sulphonylurea, dapsone, azo dyes, benzocaine, procaine, and black henna temporary tattoos is possible. Allergic contact dermatitis is classified as delayed-type hypersensitivity, according to Coombs and Gell. Skin changes typically appear on the hands after previous sensitization to causative allergens. Combined with the patient’s overall medical and work history and clinical picture, epicutaneous testing is the basic diagnostic procedure for confirming the diagnosis and identifying the causative allergens. The simplest and most effective measure for preventing the occurrence of allergic contact dermatitis in hairdressers is prevention. Preventive measures should be applied as early as in the beginning stage of vocational guidance for this profession. It is important to include health education in the process of professional training and to implement general technical safety measures, in order to reduce sensitization to allergens in hairdressing. Here, special emphasis must be given to the correct use of protective gloves. Legislation must limit the concentration of allergenic substances in <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> based on their potential hazards documented by scientific research...|$|R

Eighteen professional hairdressers (3 /day) coloured hairdresser's training heads bearing natural human hair (hair length: approximately 30 cm) for 6 h/working day with a dark-shade <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> containing 2 % [14 C]-para-phenylenediamine (PPD). Three separate phases of <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> were monitored: (A) dye preparation/hair dyeing, (B) rinsing/shampooing/conditioning and (C) cutting/drying/styling. Ambient air and personal monitoring samples (vapours and particles), nasal and hand rinses were collected during all study phases. Urine (pre-exposure, quantitative samples for the 0 - 12, 12 - 24, 24 - 48 h periods after start of exposure) and blood samples (blank, 4, 8 or 24 h) were collected from all exposed subjects. Radioactivity was determined in all biological samples and study materials, tools and washing liquids, and a [14 C]-mass balance was performed daily. No adverse events were noted during the study. Waste, equipment, gloves and coveralls contained 0. 41 ± 0. 16 %, dye mixing bowls 2. 88 ± 0. 54 %, hair wash 45. 47 ± 2. 95 %, hair + scalp 53. 46 ± 4. 06 % of the applied radioactivity, respectively. Plasma levels were below the limit of quantification (≤ 10 ng PPDeq/mL). Total urinary 0 - 48 h excretion of [14 C] levels ranged from a total of < 2 - 18 μg PPDeq and was similar in subjects exposed during the different phases of <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing.</b> Minimal air levels at or slightly above the limit of quantification were found in a few personal air monitoring samples during the phases of <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> and <b>hair</b> cutting, but not during the rinsing phase. Air area monitoring samples or nasal rinses contained no measurable radioactivity. Hand residues ranged from 0. 006 to 0. 15 μg PPDeq/cm 2, and were found predominantly after the cutting/drying phase. The mean mass balance of [14 C] across the six study days was 102. 50 ± 2. 20 %. Overall, the mean, total systemic exposure of hairdressers to <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> during a working day including 6 <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> processes {{was estimated to be}} < 0. 36 μg PPDeq/kg body weight/working day.

40|$|In the {{organism}} of mammals, important detoxification pathways of arylamines are catalysed by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT 2). A recent case-control epidemiology study suggested that human NAT 2 slow acetylators exposed to <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> {{may be at}} greater risk to develop bladder cancer. We therefore profiled urinary [14 C]-metabolites and NAT 2 genotype in eight human subjects following treatment with a dark-shade <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> containing [14 C]-para-phenylenediamine (PPD). Genotyping identified three subjects as slow, and five subjects as intermediate NAT 2 acetylators. Within 24 h after treatment, the study subjects excreted a mean total of 0. 43 ± 0. 24 % of the applied [14 C] in the urine, where five different metabolites were found. The major urinary metabolites were concluded to be N-mono-acetylated and N,N′-diacetylated PPD. They were present in all urine samples and amounted to 80 - 95 % of the total urinary [14 C]. Another metabolite, possibly a glucuronic acid conjugate, was found in 6 / 8 urine samples at 5 - 13 % of the total urinary [14 C]. All metabolites appeared {{to be related to}} PPD, no evidence of the presence of high-molecular weight dye-intermediates or corresponding metabolites was found. The metabolite profile in the study subjects showed {{no significant differences between the}} NAT 2 intermediate and NAT 2 slow acetylator subgroups. Urine of NAT 2 slow acetylators contained N-mono-acetylated-PPD at 42. 2 ± 10. 2 % and N,N′-di- acetylated-PPD at 54. 1 ± 7. 6 % of total urinary radioactivity, while the corresponding values of intermediate acetylators were 46. 0 ± 8. 9 % and 45. 7 ± 9. 9 %, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that the human acetylation rate of PPD after topical application is independent of the NAT 2 genotype status, most likely due to metabolism by epidermal NAT 1 prior to systemic absorption. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Restricted until 16 May. 2011. Study Aim: There {{have been}} {{inconsistent}} reports regarding personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use and B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) risk. This study aims {{to evaluate the}} relationship between women’s personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use {{and the risk of}} B-cell NHL. Methods: A 1 : 1 matched population-based case-control study of women conducted in Los Angeles County recruited 986 case-control pairs. Case participants were diagnosed with histologic confirmed primary B-cell NHL between 2004 and 2008. Control participants were individually matched to the index cases by age, gender, race, and neighborhood of residence. Exposure information was obtained by in-person interviews. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of B-cell NHL associated with personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use overall, by race, and by NHL subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders (alcohol status, smoking status, and education levels).; Results: Compared to women who had never used any <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products,</b> those who had ever used personal <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> had a 38 % greater risk for B-cell NHL (OR= 1. 38, 95 %CI= 1. 05 - 1. 31). A younger age at first <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use, a longer duration of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use, and a greater number of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> applications were all associated with an elevated risk of B-cell NHL (p-values for trend= 0. 007, 0. 006, 0. 025, respectively). Relative risk estimates were higher for those who had ever used permanent dyes (OR= 1. 46, 95 %CI= 1. 11 - 1. 93), black <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> (OR= 1. 76, 95 %CI= 1. 18 - 2. 63), and also higher for those who initiated <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use prior to 1980 (OR= 1. 45, 95 %CI= 1. 08 - 1. 96). The influence patterns were similar across different racial/ethnic groups. Increased risk of follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) were observed in this study.; Conclusion: The results from this study support the hypothesis that <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use, and particularly using permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> using black <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> and year of initiation of use prior to 1980 increase the risk of B-cell NHL, especially the follicular lymphoma and CLL/SLL subtypes. Further research is warranted to address the effects of specific types, colors, or components of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products,</b> as well as the underlying biological mechanisms which mediate the increase in B-cell NHL risk...|$|R
40|$|This article {{gives the}} results of contact {{allergic}} reactions to cosmetics seen between 1985 and 1990 (462 patients investigated) and between 1991 and 1996 (486 patients investigated). Perfume components remain the most frequently occurring allergens in cosmetics. They are followed by preservative agents, a class within which important shifts have occurred over time (e. g. as with the isothiazolinone mixture). Excipients and certainly emulsifiers (e. g. cocamidopropylbetaine) are potentially not only irritants but also allergens. Among the "active" or category-specific ingredients, <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> based on paraphenylenediamine and derivatives, and nail care products, based on (meth) acrylates are particularly apt to cause professional dermatoses. Finally, the share of sunscreens as cosmetic allergens remains limited, which may well be because a contact or photocontactallergy is often not recognized since the differential diagnosis with a primary sun intolerance is not always obvious. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the absorption of}} a commercial [14 C]-PPD- containing <b>oxidative</b> dark-shade <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> in human volunteers {{as well as in}} vitro using human or pig ear skin. The hair of eight male volunteers was cut to a standard length, dyed, washed, dried, clipped and collected. Hair, washing water, materials used in the study and a 24 -h scalp wash were collected for determination of radioactivity. Blood, urine and faeces were analysed up to 120 h after <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing.</b> An identical [14 C]-PPD-containing <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> formulation was applied in vitro for 0. 5 h to human and pig ear skin, and radioactivity was determined in skin compartments after 24 h. In humans, the recovery rate was 95. 7 ± 1. 5 % of the applied radioactivity. Washing water, cut hair, gloves, paper towels, caps or scalp wash contained a total of 95. 16 ± 1. 46 % of the applied [14 C]. Absorbed radioactivity amounted to 0. 50 ± 0. 24 % in the urine and 0. 04 ± 0. 04 % in the faeces, corresponding to a mean of 7. 0 ± 3. 4 mg [14 C]-PPD-equivalents absorbed. Within 24 h after application, most of the radioactivity was eliminated. The Cmax of [14 C]-PPD-equivalents in the plasma was 0. 087 μgeq/ml, the Tmax was approximately 2 h, and the mean the AUC 0 - 12 h was 0. 67 μgeqh/ml. In vitro tests in human or pig skin found total absorbed amounts of 2. 4 ± 1. 6 % (10. 6 ± 6. 7 μgeq/cm 2) or 3. 4 ± 1. 7 % (14. 6 ± 6. 9 μgeq/cm 2), respectively. Percentage-based in vitro results were considerably higher than corresponding in vivo data, whereas, in units of μg/cm 2, they corresponded to a total absorbed amount of 7. 40 or 10. 22 mgeq for human or pig skin, respectively. All results suggested that <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> with <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> produces minimal systemic exposure that is unlikely to pose a risk to human health. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to develop <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products</b> that give more natural-looking colors, {{some of the basic}} steps from the natural biosynthetic pathway to melanin have been imitated chemically. Our hair {{coloring}} process starts with 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa). By careful selection of oxidant and oxidation conditions, dopa is converted on hair to 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole in high yield. This indole has been known for many years to be the immediate precursor to the black eumelanins, and it can be readily polymerized in situ to <b>dye</b> the <b>hair</b> an intense black color. Additionally, the natural process produces the red and yellow pheomelanins by incorporating sulfur-containing nucleophiles uch as cysteine into the melanogenic process. We have also found that significant color changes can be produced by adding a variety of nucleophiles to the system, including cysteine and other thiols. By these means, a wide range of shades can be produced on hair under conditions acceptable to the user of the <b>hair</b> <b>dye.</b> Performance of the <b>dyed</b> <b>hair</b> appears to be comparable to that of current permanent dyes and is clearly superior in both application technique and performance to the alternative natural <b>dye</b> <b>products</b> available today...|$|R
40|$|The Food and Drug Administration in Taiwan is {{responsible}} for the quality regulation and control of cosmetics. In order to have a clear understanding of the trends in the product quality monitoring outcomes and the regulatory control measures over the past years, this study has put together the reports of nine cosmetic surveillance projects conducted between 1982 and 2012. The findings {{can be used as a}} reference in developing a more solid quality monitoring plan and management system for cosmetic products. Results show that permanent wave <b>products,</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products,</b> and phthalate esters in cosmetic products have the highest average noncompliance rates at 39. 2 %, 14. 2 %, and 11. 2 %, respectively. These are followed by the average noncompliance rates of mercury in products, sunscreen products, and microorganisms in products, at 8. 5 %, 7. 1 %, and 5. 5 %, respectively, and the remaining three projects averaging below 4. 1 %. Since 1997, when new standards were announced and assistance to manufacturers was reinforced, the noncompliance rates of permanent wave products decreased annually, until 2007, when it was fully qualified for the standards. Overall, the study showed that the noncompliance rates of permanent wave products and for levels of phthalate esters, mercury, and hydroquinone in cosmetic products have all decreased in the previous years. The results of surveillance projects conducted after 2005 revealed only one noncompliance sample with lead, arsenic, and cadmium, whereas the surveillance projects on permanent wave products and chloroform- and 1, 4 -dioxane-containing products revealed full compliance with regulation standards. However, the noncompliance rates for microorganisms in cosmetics and the ingredients in <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products</b> and sunscreen products were still high. These high-risk products must be monitored. These surveillance projects are conducted to ensure the safety of cosmetics in the market...|$|R
40|$|Hair {{color change}} by dye {{application}} {{is a common}} procedure among women. <b>Hair</b> <b>dyes</b> are classified, according to color resistance, into temporary, semipermanent, demipermanent and permanent. The first two are based on molecules which are already colored. Temporary dyes act through dye deposition on cuticles, but semipermanent may penetrate a little into the cortex and so the color resists up to six washes. Demipermanent and permanent dyes are based on color precursors, called oxidation dyes, and the final shade is developed by their interactions with an oxidizing agent, but they differ from the alkalizing agent used. In oxidation systems, there is an intense diffusion of the molecules into the cortex, what promotes a longer color resistance. Dyes and color precursors present differences related to chromophore groups, hair fiber affinity, water solubility, and photo stability. The aim of this review is to discuss the differences among <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> <b>products</b> available {{in the market and}} their action mechanisms, molecular structures, application methods, and some aspects of formulations...|$|R
40|$|HAIRCARECUBE TM (HCC) {{is a new}} {{additive}} {{for hair}} products that allows the active ingredient to penetrate into the hair. During the course of percutaneous absorption studies, we discovered that lyotropic liquid crystal promotes the skin’s absorptiveness to medicines. We conducted a study {{to determine whether or}} not lyotropic liquid crystal could be applied as a penetration-enhancing agent in hair, and as a result we have succeeded in developing HCC. In place of <b>hair</b> <b>dye,</b> we used fluorescein-HCC to evaluate hair permeability, and strong fluorescence was observed as deep as the core of the hair. Moreover, the strength of the fluorescence was dependent on HCC concentration. This result did not change under acidic or basic conditions. In addition, the same trends were observed when using an <b>oxidative</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye.</b> Further more, when HCC was used together with hydrolyzed keratin, which repairs hair damage, a stronger restorative effect was observed. These results confirmed that HCC has the effect of promoting the permeation of pigments and other ac tive ingredients into hair.
