He {{showed me}} that one could attack {{difficult}} problems without {{a clear idea of}} their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in <b>our</b> <b>science.</b> I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E

Critics objected to the timing of the report, claiming it was hastily prepared and published despite what they perceived as its poor quality in order to sway the U.S. electorate. On this topic, Les Roberts stated [...] "I emailed it in on Sept. 30 under the condition that it came out before the election. My motive in doing that was not to skew the election. My motive was that if this came out during the campaign, both candidates would be forced to pledge to protect civilian lives in Iraq.

2500|$|In November 1948, {{following}} {{the establishment of}} a Communist regime, {{he was elected to the}} Romanian Academy subsequent to the purge of a large number of members. Roller was part of a wave of new academicians, most of whom were of peripheral importance in their fields but were staunch adherents of communism and ready to act as ideological enforcers. Elected the Academy's Vice President (seconding Traian Săvulescu), he also headed the Section for History, Philosophy, Economics and Law from 1949 to 1955. Roller believed the academy should shift from its former position of [...] "a feudal caste, a closed circle, isolated from the masses and the people's needs" [...] into [...] "a living and active factor in the development of <b>our</b> <b>science</b> and culture". Moreover, he exhorted members, regardless of their specialty, to apply Marxist-Leninist teaching on society and its development, proletarian revolutions, the building of socialism and the victory of communism. When Săvulescu suggested that Academy publications should go uncensored, Roller intervened and reimposed [...] "control", noting: [...] "I am here to supervise and cut out those bits that catch my eye." [...] Even the more traditionalist members of the communist academic establishment were irritated by Roller's interventions.

2500|$|Maimonides wrote The Guide for the Perplexed - {{his most}} {{influential}} philosophic work. [...] He {{was a student}} of his father, Rabbi Maimon ben Yosef (a student of Joseph ibn Migash) in Cordoba, Spain. [...] When his family fled Spain, for Fez, Maimonides enrolled in the Academy of Fez and studied under Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Kohen Ibn Soussan - a student of Isaac Alfasi. [...] Maimonides strove to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy and science with the teachings of Torah. [...] In some ways his position was parallel to that of Averroes; {{in reaction to the}} attacks on Avicennian Aristotelism, Maimonides embraced and defended a stricter Aristotelism without Neoplatonic additions. [...] The principles which inspired all of Maimonides' philosophical activity was identical those of Abraham Ibn Daud: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human intellect in science and philosophy. Maimonides departed from the teachings of Aristotle by suggesting that the world is not eternal, as Aristotle taught, but was created ex nihilo. [...] In [...] "Guide for the Perplexed" [...] (1:17 & 2:11)" [...] Maimonides explains that Israel lost its Mesorah in exile, and with it [...] "we lost <b>our</b> <b>science</b> and philosophy - only to be rejuvenated in Al Andalus within the context of interaction and intellectual investigation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim texts.|$|E
2500|$|Although Arnold's poetry {{received}} only mixed reviews and attention during his lifetime, his forays into literary criticism were more successful. [...] Arnold {{is famous for}} introducing a methodology of literary criticism somewhere between the historicist approach common to many critics {{at the time and}} the personal essay; he often moved quickly and easily from literary subjects to political and social issues. [...] His Essays in Criticism (1865, 1888), remains a significant influence on critics to this day, and his prefatory essay to that collection, [...] "The Function of Criticism at the Present Time", {{is one of the most}} influential essays written on the role of the critic in identifying and elevating literature — even while admitting, [...] "The critical power is of lower rank than the creative." [...] In one of his most famous essays on the topic, [...] "The Study of Poetry", Arnold wrote that, [...] "Without poetry, <b>our</b> <b>science</b> will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry". He considered the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were [...] "high truth" [...] and [...] "high seriousness". By this standard, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales did not merit Arnold's approval. Further, Arnold thought the works that had been proven to possess both [...] "high truth" [...] and [...] "high seriousness", such as those of Shakespeare and Milton, could be used as a basis of comparison to determine the merit of other works of poetry. He also sought for literary criticism to remain disinterested, and said that the appreciation should be of [...] "the object as in itself it really is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Days {{after the}} Nye video was posted, the YEC {{ministry}} Answers in Genesis (AiG) posted a video response featuring AiG scientists David Menton and Georgia Purdom. AiG founder {{and executive director}} Ken Ham also objected to the claims in Nye's video in a post on his blog, Answers with Ken Ham. Soon after, Ham began trying to convince Nye to visit AiG's Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, which presents a YEC viewpoint that the Earth was created by God approximately 6,000 years ago and dinosaurs and humans once co-existed, {{in contrast to the}} scientific consensus that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old and the existence of dinosaurs and humans is separated by about 60 million years. On January 2, 2014, Ham announced on his Facebook page that Nye had accepted his invitation to a debate at the museum. AiG agreed to pay Nye's travel expenses, and the date [...] February 4, 2014 [...] was close to one of Nye's previously-scheduled speaking engagements at Kentucky's Murray State University. In an AiG press release, Ham commented that [...] "having the opportunity to hold a cordial but spirited debate with such a well-known personality who is admired by so many young people will help bring the creation-evolution issue to the attention of many more people, including youngsters." [...] Of Ham and AiG, Nye said, [...] "This guy and his beliefs are in their midst, and we can't have this way of thinking for <b>our</b> <b>science</b> students, to have people like this organization try to insinuate themselves in our schools is not appropriate and a formula for a darker future."

I have nothing to say against <b>our</b> <b>science.</b> It is perfect as far as it goes.

Yet <b>our</b> <b>science</b> is true, within its limits, though very far from being exhaustive of the truth.

6000|$|IMPORTANCE OF LITERATURE. It is {{a curious}} and {{prevalent}} opinion that literature, like all art, is a mere play of imagination, pleasing enough, like a new novel, but without any serious or practical importance. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Literature preserves the ideals of a people; and ideals--love, faith, duty, friendship, freedom, reverence--are the part of human life most worthy of preservation. The Greeks were a marvelous people; yet of all their mighty works we cherish only a few ideals,--ideals of beauty in perishable stone, and ideals of truth in imperishable prose and poetry. It was simply {{the ideals of the}} Greeks and Hebrews and Romans, preserved in their literature, which made them what they were, and which determined their value to future generations. Our democracy, the boast of all English-speaking nations, is a dream; not the doubtful and sometimes disheartening spectacle presented in our legislative halls, but the lovely and immortal ideal of a free and equal manhood, preserved as a most precious heritage in every great literature from the Greeks to the Anglo-Saxons. All <b>our</b> arts, <b>our</b> <b>sciences,</b> even <b>our</b> inventions are founded squarely upon ideals; for under every invention is still the dream of Beowulf, that man may overcome the forces of nature; and the foundation of all <b>our</b> <b>sciences</b> and discoveries is the immortal dream that men [...] "shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." ...|$|R
