5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become {{so much a part of}} the national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive.

5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn to abortion. Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E

The agreement, an attempt to end a civil war between the Communist-dominated (and Hanoi-directed) Pathet Lao, neutralists, and American-backed rightists, included provisions that required the removal of all foreign military forces and precluded the use of Lao territory for interfering {{in the internal affairs}} of another country – a blatant effort to shut down North Vietnam's growing logistical corridor through southeastern Laos that would become known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E

In late 1944, in order to free up American troops for operations in the Philippines, Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility for operations around Aitape in New Guinea. The 6th Division returned to New Guinea in November 1944, with the final brigade arriving on 31 December 1944. Although basically cut off from resupply, there were around 35,000 Japanese troops in the area, holding the coast past Wewak and into the interior. Supported by food supplies from native gardens in the Torricelli Mountains, the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the Australians' primary tactic of aggressive patrolling.|$|E

5|$|From its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained {{international}} renown for its lavish {{dinner parties}} and galas, {{often at the}} center <b>of</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it {{played a significant role}} in world politics and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold.

5|$|In 1885, the North-West Rebellion {{broke out}} along the North Saskatchewan River valley.

There had been worries among the police about potential instability since the previous fall, and the force had increased its presence in the area over the winter. As tensions rose, Commissioner Irvine, who had replaced Macleod in 1880 after accusations of financial mismanagement, began to mobilise any spare police manpower in Regina, bringing the force up to an operational strength of 562.|$|E

40|$|The current {{literature}} {{has failed to}} differentiate between the collapse of democratic and authoritarian rules or whether democratic regimes collapse {{for the same reasons}} as do authoritarian regimes. Therefore, the {{current literature}} is silent on whether democracies are more fragile or less susceptible to economic <b>and</b> <b>political</b> breakdowns. Using a multitude <b>of</b> <b>political</b> instability variables, this paper explores empirically, whether <b>political</b> freedom <b>and</b> civil liberty (a proxy for democracy) has any effect on the stability <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> order. The empirical results of the paper confirm the hypothesis that democracy is conducive to political stability; the higher the level <b>of</b> <b>political</b> freedom <b>and</b> civil liberty, the more stable countries are. The paper also presented a Granger-causality test <b>of</b> <b>political</b> instability <b>and</b> the level <b>of</b> <b>political</b> freedom <b>and</b> civil liberty. The test results indicate that the level <b>of</b> <b>political</b> freedom <b>and</b> civil liberty Granger-cause the level <b>of</b> <b>political</b> instability, while the level <b>of</b> <b>political</b> instability does not Granger-cause the level <b>of</b> <b>political</b> freedom <b>and</b> civil liberty. The test results indicate that Granger-causality runs one-way from <b>political</b> freedom <b>and</b> civil liberty to <b>political</b> instability <b>and</b> not the other way. A further comprehensive research is needed on the multi-layered and the complex relationship among democracy and the resilience <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> order.
