Urea, ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate were applied in two different nitrogen doses: 100 kg N⋅ha- 1 and 200 kg N⋅ha- 1. The bulbs were planted in field {{at the beginning of}} April. The planting density was 30 x 5 cm (<b>onion)</b> <b>and</b> 30 x 10 cm (top <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>shallot</b> <b>onion).</b> During the growing season, the soil tillage and plant cultivation treatments were conducted according to standard methods. <b>Onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>shallot</b> <b>onion</b> were harvested during the last days of July or the first days of August, after 75 % of the plants had bent leaves. Top onion was harvested at the end of September. The content of microelements in dry matter of the analyzed plants was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, after wet mineralization of the samples in a mi-xture of concentrated nitric and perchloric acids mixed in a 3 : 1 ratio. The applied nitrogen fertilization significantly affected microelements in all the tested onions. The content of iron <b>and</b> manganese in <b>onion</b> bulbs increased with the increasing nitrogen doses, while that of copper and zinc decreased. The analysis of the results led to a conclusion that a significant effect on the chemical composition of yield produced by <b>onion,</b> top <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>shallot</b> <b>onion</b> was produced by the applied nitrogen dose but not its form.

5000|$|In most Indian cuisines, the {{distinction}} between <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>shallots</b> is weak; larger varieties of shallot are sometimes confused with small red onions and used interchangeably. Indeed, most parts of India use the regional name for onion interchangeably with shallot (Maharashtra, for instance, where both are called kanda). The southern regions of India distinguish shallots from onions in recipes more often, especially the much loved tiny varieties (about {{the width of a}} finger); these are widely used in curries and different types of sambar, a lentil-based dish. Shallots pickled in red vinegar are common in many Indian restaurants, served along with sauces and papad on the condiments tray. Indians also use it [...] as a home remedy for sore throats, mixed with jaggery or sugar. In Nepal, shallots are used as one of the ingredients for making momo. In Kashmir shallots are widely used in preparation of Wazwan Kashmiri cuisine, as they add distinct flavor and prevent curry from getting black which is a common problem with onions.|$|E

40|$|A {{proposal}} is presented for a model programme of ecological horticulture which {{could contribute to}} improved vegetable crop production and biodiversity in tropical agroecosystems. Each step of the model “Aurora Tropical” was successfully applied for producing pesticide-free <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>shallots</b> in semiarid conditions of Venezuela and for comparing simultaneously growth and productivity of 11 cultivars.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a reliable transformation protocol for <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>shallot</b> (Allium cepa L.) which can be used year-round. It is based on Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a vector, with three-week old callus, induced from mature zygotic embryos, as target tissue. For the development of the protocol a large number of parameters were studied. The expression of the uidA gene coding for -glucuronidase was used as an indicator in the optimization of the protocol. Subspecies (<b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>shallot)</b> <b>and</b> cultivar were important factors for a successful transformation: shallot was better than <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> for <b>shallot</b> cv. Kuning the best results were obtained. Also, it was found that constantly reducing the size of the calli during subculturing and selection by chopping, thus enhancing exposure to the selective agent hygromycin, improved the selection efficiency significantly. Furthermore, callus induction medium and co-cultivation period showed a significant effect on successful stable transformation. The usage of different Agrobacterium strains, callus ages, callus sources and osmotic treatments during co-cultivation did not influence transformation efficiency. The highest transformation frequency (1. 95 %), was obtained with shallot cv. Kuning. A total of 11 independent transformed callus lines derived from zygotic embryos were produced: seven lines from <b>shallot</b> <b>and</b> four lines from onion. Large differences in plantlet production were observed among these lines. The best line produced over 90 plantlets. Via PCR the presence of the uidA and hpt (hygromycin phosphotransferase) genes could be demonstrated in these putative transformed plants. Southern hybridization showed that most lines originated from one transformation event. However, in one line plants were obtained indicating the occurrence and rescue of at least three independent transformation events. This suggested that T-DNA integration occurred in different cells within the callus. Most transgenic plants only had one copy of T-DNA integrated into their genomes. FISH performed on 12 plants from two different lines representing two integration events showed that original T-DNA integration had taken place on the distal end of chromosomes 1 or 5. A total of 83 transgenic plants were transferred to the greenhouse and these plants appeared to be diploid and normal in morpholog...|$|R

40|$|After having {{reviewed}} the international {{history of the}} genus Allium and the economic importance of the onion crop in the Netherlands the author described and compared the situations before and after a 12 years' period (1939 - 1951) of research on <b>onions</b> <b>and</b> <b>shallots.</b> In this period research was started on practical problems on choice of variety, manuring, cultural methods, control of diseases, and storage. This period of 12 years saw an increase in productivity of 6 % of the onion selections, an economy of N fertilizer and a yield increase of 2. 5 % by correct rates of N. Labour and seed were saved and crop care was better by sowing in rows instead of broadcast. There was much less infestation by yellow dwarf of the onion seed crop and shallot crop and onion maggot was under control. Storage losses were limited by preventing frost injury. Growing of onions from sets was entirely a result of research. Finally prospects were outlined on choice of variety, mechanization and storage.

5000|$|The allium {{subfamily}} of the Amaryllidaceae {{sensu lato}} is treated in some systems {{as a separate}} family, the Alliaceae. Members of the subfamily are found worldwide, in temperate, subtropical and tropical regions. They are herbaceous perennials, usually with bulbs, although {{in some cases they}} have short rhizomes. The subfamily can be easily recognized by its characteristic smell (the smell of garlic <b>and</b> <b>onions,</b> singular enough to be called [...] "garlic odour"), by the very soft, fleshy leaves and the umbel-like inflorescence {{at the end of a}} stem (scape), which has small to medium flowers with a superior ovary. The subfamily is of considerable economic importance, being grown as vegetables and seasoning, medicinal plants and ornamentals. The genus Allium includes some of the most widely used edible plants, such as <b>onion</b> <b>and</b> <b>shallot</b> (varieties of Allium cepa), garlic (A. sativum and A. scordoprasum), leek (Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum), and various flavourings such as chives (Allium schoenoprasum). The organosulphur compounds responsible for the characteristic odour are believed to have antioxidant, antibiotic and anticarcinogenic properties, to stimulate the immune system and to be protective of liver functioning. The family also has important ornamentals, mainly from the dominant genus Allium, but also including genera such as Ipheion.|$|R

PARTICIPANTS: 125 Chinese patients with prior ISS due to athero-thrombotic disease were recruited from the outpatient clinics during July 2005 to December 2006. MEASUREMENTS: Daily allium vegetable intake (including garlic, <b>onions,</b> Chinese chives <b>and</b> <b>shallots)</b> was ascertained {{by means of a}} validated food frequency questionnaire for Chinese and brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was measured using high-resolution ultrasound in all subjects. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 65. 9 +/- 11. 1 years and 69 % were males. Mean allium vegetable intake and garlic intake of the study population was 7. 5 +/- 12. 7 g/day and 2. 9 +/- 8. 8 g/day respectively. Their mean FMD was 2. 6 +/- 2. 3 %. Daily intake of total allium vegetable (r= 0. 36, P< 0. 01) and garlic (r= 0. 34, P< 0. 01) significantly correlated with FMD. Using the median daily allium intake as cut-off (3. 37 g/day), patients with a low allium intake < 3. 37 g/day was noted to have a lower FMD compared to those with a normal allium intake (2. 1 +/- 2. 1 % versus 3. 0 +/- 2. 4 %, P< 0. 05). After adjusting for confounding factors, multi-variate analysis identified that daily allium vegetable (B= 0. 05, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 02, 0. 09, P< 0. 01) and garlic (B= 0. 07, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 02, 0. 12, P< 0. 01) intake, but not <b>onions,</b> Chinese chives <b>and</b> <b>shallots</b> were independent predictors for changes in FMD in patients with ISS.
