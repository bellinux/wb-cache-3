Even so, his political and philosophical views have often been analyzed through his work with Rush and through other sources. In October 1993, shortly before that year's Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic. In that interview, Peart stated he was an undecided voter who supported Quebec federalism.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rick's {{ultimate}} origin was {{a tropical}} wave that left Africa on October 15.

Organization and a circulation developed, and satellite tracking began on November 6. The disturbance became better organized and formed into Tropical Depression Nineteen-E on November 7.|$|E

5|$|The tournament {{featured}} several international wrestlers alongside several TNA wrestlers. The {{theme of}} the contest was four competing teams, each representing a specific country <b>or</b> <b>organization.</b> However, the 2008 competition featured the debut of Team International, which represented several countries and cultures.

5|$|For several hours, steady {{strengthening}} {{continued as}} the depression maintained a westward track. Operationally, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Julia early on September13, though post-analysis confirmed {{the storm had}} reached winds of 40mph (65km/h) twelve hours after formation. For several hours, no significant change occurred in its intensity <b>or</b> <b>organization</b> as Julia passed near Cape Verde, though the storm gradually retraced to the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a deep-layer ridge. Slow intensification resumed as the storm bypassed the Cape Verde islands; by early September14, it displayed a ragged, banded eye-like feature in satellite imagery. Due to locally high sea surface temperatures of about 28°C (82°F), a period of rapid intensification subsequently commenced; within hours, Julia attained Category 1 hurricane status. Though located over an area with relatively low oceanic heat content, Julia continued to intensify rapidly under low vertical wind shear and over favorable sea surface temperatures; as such, the hurricane was upgraded to Category2 status on September 15. In less than two hours, the hurricane deepened to reach Category3 intensity, becoming the fourth major hurricane of the season. The rapid intensification trend continued, and Julia eventually strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane six hours later. Based on satellite estimates, its winds peaked at 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 948mbar (hPa; 27.99inHg), though operationally estimated at 135mph (215km/h) and 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), respectively.|$|E
