5|$|Skuas and jaegers are {{medium to}} large seabirds, {{typically}} with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, {{but have a}} fleshy cere above the upper mandible. They are strong, acrobatic fliers.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2016, Boeing is {{to upgrade}} the {{internal}} rotary launchers to the MIL-STD-1760 interface to enable the internal carriage of smart bombs, which can currently only be carried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The NTSB sent {{a team to}} {{the crash}} site to {{investigate}} the accident. They concluded that, unknown to the crew, ice had collected <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> which disrupted airflow and reduced lift.The inquiry lasted just under one year.|$|E

5|$|The family Stercorariidae {{are large}} birds, {{typically}} with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> They have longish bills with hooked tips and webbed feet with sharp claws.

5|$|The family Stercorariidae are, in general, {{medium to}} large birds, {{typically}} with gray or brown plumage, often with white markings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> They nest {{on the ground}} in temperate and arctic regions and are long-distance migrants.|$|E
5|$|But <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> the {{situation}} was different. Qanatir, commanding the Byzantine left flank which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim base camp.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for gust load alleviation (GLA) flight testing that will approximate a turbulence-like excitation of <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> has been devised. An artificial excitation {{is produced by}} randomly deflecting inboard control surfaces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing,</b> thereby producing incremental loads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing.</b> This presentation covers the background {{and development of the}} flight test technique and analyses performed to date...|$|R

5|$|Charles Martel was {{the first}} member of a group of five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship , but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel , which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E
5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing ice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> of aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially in the male, large white patches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b> The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.|$|E

5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the European nightjar include {{a single species}} of biting louse found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.|$|E

5|$|The F-105 was {{designed}} primarily for low-level interdiction and its low-altitude speed was its greatest asset {{when dealing with}} enemy fighters such as the MiG-17/J-5s and MiG-21. The F-105 managed 27.5 air-to-air victories. Based on combat experience, the F-105D was updated with a better ejection seat, additional armor, improved gun sights, and Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) pods <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{feathers}} are outgrowths of the epidermis and {{are found}} in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near {{the base of the}} tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspection}} robot of the European project Robair, funded from 2001 to 2003, {{is designed}} to mount <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> and fuselage of an aircraft to inspect rows of rivets. To move, the robot uses a flexible network of pneumatic suction cups that are adjustable to the surface. It can inspect the lines of rivets with ultrasonic waves, eddy current and thermographic techniques. It detects loose rivets and cracks.|$|E
