Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of <b>oxidative</b> <b>metabolism.</b>|$|E

The {{chemical}} equation of photosynthesis is 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) and 6 H2O (water), which in the presence of sunlight makes C6H12O6 (glucose) and 6 O2 (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses electrons on the carbon atoms as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight. Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. It reclaims the energy to power chemical reactions in cells. In so doing the carbon atoms and their electrons are combined with oxygen forming CO2 which is easily removed from both the cells and the organism.

ATP binds to the myosin head and causes the ‘ratchetting’ {{that results in}} contraction according to the sliding filament model. Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5–7 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of glucose, used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted, producing lactic acid as a metabolic byproduct. Contrary to common belief, lactic acid accumulation doesn't actually cause the burning sensation we feel when we exhaust our oxygen and <b>oxidative</b> <b>metabolism,</b> but in actuality, lactic acid in presence of oxygen recycles to produce pyruvate in the liver, which {{is known as the}} Cori cycle.|$|E

25|$|The {{malnutrition}} many alcoholics suffer deprives them {{of important}} cofactors for the <b>oxidative</b> <b>metabolism</b> of glucose. Neural tissues depend on this process for energy, and {{disruption of the}} cycle would impair cell growth and function. Schwann cells produce myelin that wraps around the sensory and motor nerve axons to enhance action potential conduction in the periphery. An energy deficiency in Schwann cells would account for the disappearance of myelin on peripheral nerves, which may result in damage to axons or loss of nerve function altogether. In peripheral nerves, oxidative enzyme activity is most concentrated around the nodes of Ranvier, making these locations most vulnerable to cofactor deprivation. Lacking essential cofactors reduces myelin impedance, increases current leakage, and slows signal transmission. Disruptions in conductance first affect the peripheral ends of the longest and largest peripheral nerve fibers because they suffer most from decreased action potential propagation. Thus, neural deterioration occurs in an accelerating cycle: myelin damage reduces conductance, and reduced conductance contributes to myelin degradation. The slowed conduction of action potentials in axons causes segmental demyelination extending proximally; this {{is also known as}} retrograde degeneration.|$|E

[...] In an effort to restore ion balance, the sodium-potassium ion pumps increase activity, which results in excessive ATP (adenosine triphosphate) consumption and glucose utilization. Lactate accumulates but, paradoxically, cerebral blood flow decreases, which leads to a proposed [...] "energy crisis." [...] After this increase in glucose metabolism, there is a subsequent lower metabolic state which may persist for up to 4 weeks after injury.

Electrochemically generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Chapter 2, electrochemical oxidation by square-wave potential pulses in Chapters 3 and 4, as well as electrocatalytic activation of hydrogen peroxide on a platinum electrode in Chapter 5 are among the electrochemical techniques developed throughout my research. Chapter 1 presents Cytochrome P 450 s (CYP), their discovery, structure, and role in in vivo <b>oxidative</b> drug <b>metabolism</b> by catalytic activation of molecular oxygen and the generation of ROS, mainly oxo-ferryl radical cations. Chapter 1 further reviews different electrochemical techniques that have been developed so far, including direct electrochemical oxidation (in combination with mass spectrometry), oxidation by electrochemically generated ROS, and oxidation with modified electrodes containing metalloporphyrines and enzymes. Direct electrochemical oxidation in combination with mass spectrometry, introduced in Chapter 1, has been used widely to imitate in vivo <b>oxidative</b> drug <b>metabolism.</b> The oxidation mechanisms were discussed in relation to in vivo <b>oxidative</b> drug <b>metabolism.</b> Direct electrochemical oxidation, accordingly, is capable of imitating oxidative reactions that are initiated by electron transfer, such as N-dealkylation and hydroxylation of substituted aromatic rings, whereas oxidation reactions which are initiated by hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or oxygen atom insertion are difficult to imitate.

Metabolic optimization requires integration. While glycolysis and glutaminolysis can cooperate to support cellular proliferation, <b>oxidative</b> lactate <b>metabolism</b> opposes glycolysis in oxidative cancer cells engaged in a symbiotic relation with their hypoxic/glycolytic neighbors. However, little is known concerning the relationship between <b>oxidative</b> lactate <b>metabolism</b> and glutamine metabolism. Using SiHa and HeLa human cancer cells, this study reports that intracellular lactate signaling promotes glutamine uptake and <b>metabolism</b> in <b>oxidative</b> cancer cells. It depends on the uptake of extracellular lactate by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT 1). Lactate first stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor- 2 α (HIF- 2 α), and HIF- 2 α then transactivates c-Myc in a pathway that mimics a response to hypoxia. Consequently, lactate-induced c-Myc activation triggers the expression of glutamine transporter ASCT 2 and of glutaminase 1 (GLS 1), resulting in improved glutamine uptake and catabolism. Elucidation of this metabolic dependence could be of therapeutic interest. First, inhibitors of lactate uptake targeting MCT 1 are currently entering clinical trials.
