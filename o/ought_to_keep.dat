500|$|Throughout Churchill's {{second term}} as Prime Minister (1951–55) Home {{remained}} at the Scottish Office, although both Eden at the Foreign Office and Lord Salisbury at the Commonwealth Relations Office invited him to join their ministerial teams. Among the Scottish matters with which he dealt were hydro-electric projects, hill farming, sea transport, road transport, forestry, and the welfare of crofters in the Highlands and the Western Isles. These matters went largely unreported in the British press, {{but the question of}} the royal cypher on Post Office pillar boxes became front-page news. Because Elizabeth I of England was never queen of Scotland, some nationalists maintained when Elizabeth II came to the British throne in 1952 that in Scotland she should be styled [...] "Elizabeth I". Churchill said in the House of Commons that considering the [...] "greatness and splendour of Scotland", and the contribution of the Scots to British and world history, [...] "they <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their silliest people in order". Home nevertheless arranged that in Scotland new pillar boxes were decorated with the royal crown instead of the full cypher.|$|E
2500|$|In 1915, {{under the}} shadow of the First World War, Chelsea reached their first FA Cup final, the {{so-called}} [...] "Khaki" [...] cup final, owing to the large number of uniformed soldiers in attendance. The match against Sheffield United was played in a sombre atmosphere and staged at Old Trafford in Manchester to avoid disruption in London. Chelsea, minus their top amateur striker, Vivian Woodward, who had sportingly insisted that the team who reached the final <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their places, were seemingly unnerved by the occasion and outplayed for much of the match. Goalkeeper Jim Molyneux's mistake allowed United to score before half-time, but the Blues held out until the final six minutes, when their opponents added two more to win 3–0.|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't {{make much}} of your Dutch friend, Sen," [...] cried this buoyant young lady; [...] "he says you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on paying rent!" ...|$|E
60|$|GRACE. It is {{you who are}} too kind--to your patients. You {{sacrifice}} yourself. Have {{a little}} rest. Come and talk to me--tell me all about the latest scientific discoveries, and what I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> read <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> myself up <b>to</b> date. But perhaps you're busy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you <b>ought</b> n't <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{reminding}} {{me all the}} time that I'm sick. That's what starts my mind to preying upon itself; and when it gets going once I can't stop it. I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> treat myself just like a well person; that's what the doctor said." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{and other}} letters {{indicate}} that they discussed politics. Sand also apparently decided Arthur looked ill as she also remarked [...] "You <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> your malaria a secret and endure it so patiently." ...|$|R
60|$|BUILDER. D'you realise that you're {{encouraging}} {{me to go}} wrong? That's {{a pretty}} thing for a wife to do. You <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> your husband straight.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{both eyes}} tight shut so that I may be {{contented}} in that station {{to which it}} has pleased God to call me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Promised to wait!' said Anne indignantly. 'As if one <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> such {{a promise}} to drunken men as that. You can do as you like, I shall go.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{commander}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have a {{regard for}} those under him," [...] continued Jonas, [...] "and deal justly by them. If {{a number of}} boys were going to ride a wagon, and their father put {{one of them in}} charge, he <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the best seat in the wagon for himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it isn't true {{that this}} poor man, Galligan--isn't that his name?--was cheated {{out of the}} damages he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{himself and his family}} alive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I declare, when we overtook {{you in the}} street, {{she looked}} a perfect Spanish princess, in her black robes and great shady hat. You <b>ought</b> always <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her in black. Ha! Emily, what are you smiling at?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lecks smiled. [...] "You're awful tender of the feelin's {{of other}} people, Barb'ry," [...] she said, [...] "and a heart as warm as yourn <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> from freezin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'And it's my {{business}} as office deputy,' says I, 'to see that business {{is carried on}} according to law. Between us both we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> things pretty well cleaned up.' ...|$|E
60|$|LEO. The wife <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{an eye on}} him, and {{see that}} he is {{comfortable}} and takes care of himself properly. The other man wont want her all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you are thinking," [...] she laughed gaily. [...] "That if I were a man you'd wring my neck for me. And I deserve it, too. I'm so sorry. I <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on hurting your feelings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, indeed, not again, Miss May!' said Averil. 'Leonard asked once, and was refused, and cannot ask again. No, {{the only}} {{difficulty}} {{is whether he}} <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> his word, {{and go to the}} mill if he does not get the Randall.' ...|$|R
60|$|ATHENE. We left Guy {{with mother}} at the studio. She still thinks she <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> come. She <b>keeps</b> on saying she must, now father's in a hole.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's too unselfish of her," [...] he pronounced, {{not caring}} {{at all for}} Grace. [...] "Cousin Agnes <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her near her always, if Grace is so obliging and devoted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One of us <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> watch," [...] he said, as Stobell, after a heavy supper {{followed}} by a satisfying pipe, rolled himself in a blanket and composed himself for slumber.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rachel--you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> an eye upon Rachel," [...] he {{observed}} significantly, and Helen, though {{she went on}} brushing her hair, looked at him. His observations were apt to be true.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here comes my dear father," [...] {{interrupted}} Mabel. [...] "Let us look {{cheerful and}} happy, Pathfinder, as such good friends <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> look, and <b>keep</b> each other's secrets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not fair," [...] said he. [...] "I <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the book}} so long. I now {{give it up}} for a while. You may let her have it when she comes." [...] And he put the [...] "Dormstock" [...] on the counter, and went and sat down by the stove.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hitting {{the trail}} for parts unknown," [...] replied Pat. [...] "We'll {{tell you about}} it later. Meanwhile here are some friends of mine you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> know and <b>keep</b> an eye on, Bill. They'll bear watching." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> well," [...] said Mr. Keller, {{speaking}} from his {{place at the}} top of the table. [...] "It's old wine, and good wine. Let me taste what is left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{you waiting}} {{such a long}} time," [...] she murmured, [...] "because I had to ask you first--for your friendship, and you weren't very kind to die. But I can't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear! You really <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the conventions. The proper line is {{to argue}} I oughtn't {{to let the}} young man bother me. However, it's obvious you don't mean to be nice." ...|$|E
6000|$|She hardly heard him. She felt a keen remorse for {{something}} she had meant to do and to say when he came home. Now she put it far from her; she thought she <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> even an extinct suspicion in her heart against him, and she asked, [...] "Brice, {{did you know that}} woman was living in this house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, if {{you come}} here out of duty--" [...] she said archly, and with her merry laugh. [...] "There, is not that a nice {{occasion}} for picking a quarrel? And seriously," [...] she continued, [...] "perhaps it might {{be good for you}} if we did. I am beginning to fear that I <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> you lingering here without purpose or occupation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't 'elp that," [...] {{said the}} {{guardian}} of the peace phlegmatically. [...] "A gen'elman like you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be ashamed. <b>Keep</b> quiet now! Would yer, then!" [...] This last at some specially energetic {{effort on the part}} of the prisoner to recover his freedom.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{away from}} that garden," [...] said Peter very meekly, [...] "but {{you have no idea}} what a temptation it is. The things in that garden do taste so good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it; {{and they}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the very best}} time--that I've always heard. My poor Mr. Budd had two, and they were as large as compasses, and sold for {{hundreds}} after his lamented decease." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's the use?" [...] {{returned}} Upton. [...] "I couldn't sleep a wink until Pat and Alec get back. We <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the fire}} going and have something hot {{ready for them}} when they get in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the girl}} replied; [...] "if I {{thought there were}} any danger of the natives {{fighting}} {{their way into the}} house, of course I should do my best to help defend it; but I do not think that there is the least fear of such a thing, so I am quite content to leave it to you. It does not seem to me that a woman has any business to fight unless absolutely driven to do so in defence of her life. If the natives really do come on and get up close to the house, I think that I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> help <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them out; but it is a dreadful thing to have to shoot anyone--at least it seems so to me." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{assured her}} that nothing would please me better, and we talked {{a little about the}} minutes, after which I thought I <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her {{standing}} at the gate any longer. So I took leave of her, and we shook hands over the gate. This was the first time I had ever shaken hands with the doctor's daughter, for she was a reserved girl, and hitherto I had merely bowed to her.|$|R
60|$|After getting {{upon the}} horse, Mr. George took care <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> behind Rollo and the guide. He {{knew very well}} {{that if he were}} to go on in advance Rollo would exert himself more than he {{otherwise}} would do, under the influence of a sort of feeling that he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up. While Rollo was on the horse himself, having the guide with him too, Mr. George knew that there was no danger from this source, as any one who is on horseback or in a carriage never has the feeling of being left behind when a companion who is on foot by chance gets before him. Consequently, while they were coming up the steep part of the mountain, Mr. George went on as fast as he pleased, leaving Rollo and Henry to come on at their leisure. But now his kind consideration for Rollo induced him <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> carefully behind.|$|R
