50|$|The {{structural}} overprint of the ultramafics and orebody by deformation during prograde metamorphism is {{a matter}} of debate, however the ductile nature of the deformation has affected the ultramafic CUU heterogenously and contrasts with the felsic footwall. The felsic footwall is subject to a pronounced stretching lineation which increases in intensity to the north. The lineation orientation is a uniform 65 degrees toward 120 degrees. Approaching the CUU body, the lineation breaks down into a zone of heavy boudinage and <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> with a pronounced C-S shear fabric, especially in the remobilised massive sulfides and at {{the leading edge of the}} keel structure. This is interpreted to occur due to competency contrast between the felsic footwall and the ultramafic unit.|$|E
5000|$|In geology, transpression {{is a type}} of strike-slip {{deformation}} that deviates {{from simple}} shear because of a simultaneous component of shortening perpendicular to the fault plane. This movement ends up resulting in <b>oblique</b> <b>shear.</b> It is generally very unlikely that a deforming body will experience [...] "pure" [...] shortening or [...] "pure" [...] strike-slip. The relative amounts of shortening and strike-slip can be expressed in the convergence angle alpha which ranges from zero (ideal strike-slip) to 90 degrees (ideal convergence). During shortening, unless material is lost, transpression produces vertical thickening in the crust. Transpression that occurs on a regional scale along plate boundaries is characterized by oblique convergence. [...] More locally, transpression occurs within restraining bends in strike-slip fault zones.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGPS {{measurements}} indicate rapid {{lateral extrusion}} of the NE Tibetan Plateau, which causes active NE-directed crustal shortening and has initiated <b>oblique</b> <b>shearing</b> along {{the margins of}} NE Tibet. However, the Tibetan highlands terminate around 103 °E longitude and topographic relief disappears to the northeast. The exact reasons for this drop in elevation remain obscure due to widespread Tertiary sediments and Quaternary loess, which obscure details of the lithospheric structure. This study describes a new 310 km-long deep seismic reflection line striking NE-SW across the interior of NE Tibet. Integrating its data with a previously described 165 km-long deep seismic profile of the Tibet–Ordos transition zone together, these datasets provide a complete picture of the crustal architecture of the north-easternmost Tibetan Plateau. Gravity anomaly and previous geological evidence also help constrain complex deformation pattern in the region. Interpretations of these patterns indicate {{the importance of the}} large-scale sinistral Haiyuan fault zone and inherited vertical variation in mechanical properties of the lithosphere in the overall tectonic evolution of the NE Tibetan Plateau. The overall crustal architecture obtained in this study provides spatial context for the neotectonic evolution of NE Tibet and helps constrain the interplay of geologic and geodynamic processes affecting NE Tibet and adjacent regions...|$|R
40|$|The Niğde Massif, at the {{southern}} tip of the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex, consists of two structural units. Foliations in the lower unit define a dome cored by migmatites. The contact between the two units bears all the elements of a ductile to brittle extensional detachment. Hence the Niğde Massif represents an extensional metamorphic core complex. Top-to-NE/ENE shearing at higher levels of the lower unit relates to displacement along the detachment. Deeper levels of the lower unit display high-temperature top-to-SSW ductile shearing. The two shearing deformations show a difference in the mean trend of stretching lineations of up to 58 °. New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages combined with previously published data enable us to infer that the two shears were contemporaneous. In our favored interpretation, <b>oblique</b> <b>shearing</b> in the core of the dome reflects lateral underflow, i. e., horizontal flowing of the lower crust in a direction highly oblique to the direction of extension. As a result of the interaction between lateral underflow and down-dip shearing along the overlying detachment, distinct structural domains are expected to exist within the migmatitic part of the core complex, with observed counterparts in the Niğde dome. Lateral underflow may reflect “inward ” flow on the scale of the core complex. Regional-scal...|$|R

50|$|Bitmap fonts look best {{at their}} native pixel size. Some systems using bitmap fonts can create some font {{variants}} algorithmically.

At non-native sizes, many text rendering systems perform nearest-neighbor resampling, introducing rough jagged edges. More advanced systems perform anti-aliasing on bitmap fonts whose size {{does not match}} the size that the application requests. This technique works well for making the font smaller but not as well for increasing the size, as it tends to blur the edges. Some graphics systems that use bitmap fonts, especially those of emulators, apply curve-sensitive nonlinear resampling algorithms such as 2xSaI or hq3x on fonts and other bitmaps, which avoids blurring the font while introducing little objectionable distortion at moderate increases in size.|$|R

40|$|This {{work is a}} small {{extension}} of NACA studies of the early fifties that predicted amplification of turbulence on passing through a shock wave (observed for turbulent boundary layers), {{as well as the}} generation of intense noise (observed for supersonic jets). The first solved the basic gasdynamics problem of the interaction of an infinite planar shock with a single three-dimensional spectrum component of turbulence (an <b>oblique</b> sinusoidal <b>shear</b> wave). The second developed the comprehensive 3 D spectrum analysis necessary to generalize the scenario to the interaction of a shock wave with convected homogeneous turbulence. Numerical calculations were carried out to yield curves (vs. Mach number) of rms sound pressure, temperature fluctuation, and two components of turbulent velocity downstream of the shock, for two cases of preshock turbulence. The present numerical study reproduces these for one case and provides in addition their one-dimensional power spectra (vs. wavenumber of frequency). Ratios of the several postshock spectra to the longitudinal preshock turbulence spectrum (4 D) have been computed {{for a wide range of}} Mach numbers; curves vs. wavenumber are presented for two scenarios of preshock turbulence: isotropy and axisymmetry, both based on the von Karman 3 D spectrum...|$|R

These vector fields are characterized by their origin (i. e., the singular point) and by four elementary components that combine linearly: expansion (or compression), rotation, longitudinal shear, and <b>oblique</b> <b>shear.</b> All motoneurons can be classified and recognized according to the components of the deformations they elicit: longitudinal motoneurons give rise almost exclusively to longitudinal negative shear, whereas circular motoneurons give rise to both positive longitudinal shear and significant negative expansion. Oblique motoneurons induce strong <b>oblique</b> <b>shear,</b> in addition to longitudinal shear and negative expansion. Vector fields induced by the contraction of longitudinal, circular, and oblique fibers superimpose linearly. Skin deformations can therefore be attributed rather reliably to the contraction of distinct longitudinal, circular, and oblique muscle fibers. We compared the deformation patterns produced by touching the skin with those produced by intracellular stimulation of P, T, and N cells: vector fields resulting from the activation of P cells were almost identical to those produced by mechanical stimulation. Therefore, motor responses triggered by light or moderate touch are almost entirely mediated by excitation of P cells, with minor contributions from T and N cells...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{traverses}} have been undertaken across a ca. 45 km {{section of the}} north-south oriented eastern margin of the Tanzanian Craton between Dodoma and Mpwapwa, Central Tanzania. The boundary is a SE-dipping zone of high strain between about 1 and 2 km wide. The rocks of the eastern craton are uniformly composed of coarse-grained, grey, migmatised granodiorite gneisses which are heterogeneous at outcrop scale but are regionally homogeneous. The orthogneisses have no regionally consistent fabric and foliations are variably oriented at outcrop scale. However, there is a gradual increase in strain eastwards towards {{the edge of the}} craton, manifest as an increasingly strong, regionally consistent, E to SE-dipping foliation. This strain increase eventually leads to mylonitic and porphyroclastic planar fabrics and strong, uniformly SE-plunging, linear fabrics. In most structural domains planar fabrics are predominant, but these alternate with minor domains dominated by linear fabrics, with fold mullions locally developed. The kinematics of the high-strain mylonites show a consistent, top-to-the-NW (oblique) sense of movement. The frontal thrust zone grades laterally into steep sinistral and dextral <b>oblique</b> strike-slip <b>shear</b> zones to the north and south respectively.

40|$|Meta-sedimentary and {{igneous rocks}} {{preserved}} in the hanging wall of the Paralana Fault, northern Mount Painter Province, record a protracted (ca. 1600 Myr) multi-staged metamorphic and poly-deformational evolution related to Mesoproterozoic and Palaeozoic orogenic events. The Mount Painter Province was located near the margin of both the South Australian Craton and the North Australian Craton, which allows comparisons of the tectonic evolution of these margins and provides context {{for the evolution of}} the eastern Proterozoic Australia for both the Columbia and Gondwana supercontinents. Within the Mount Painter Province meta-sedimentary rocks form part of a basin system developed adjacent to the margins of the Gawler Craton and Curnamona Province following the Olarian-Wartakan orogenic system. Sedimentation was followed by ca. 1590 - 1552 Ma ductile deformation (D₁-D₃) at mid to upper crustal levels preserving a rapid (ca 6 Myr) burial and exhumation cycle. Initial deformation is characterised by the development of a layer parallel fabric (S₁). S₁ is overprinted by recumbent north-verging folds (F₂) formed during mid to upper amphibolite facies peak metamorphism (M₂), which are overprinted by tight, upright shallow NE-SW plunging folds (F₃). D₃ folds developed contemporaneous with sinistral <b>oblique</b> <b>shearing</b> and the development of proto-mylonitic to ultra-mylonitic fabrics along the Paralana Fault Zone. The timing of D₃ deformation is constrained by the development of a penetrative steeply dipping foliation (S₃) in the ca. 1585 - 1569 Ma shallowly emplaced Mount Neill Granite and relatively undeformed granites dated at ca. 1552 Ma. Further constraint on the absolute timing of Mesoproterozoic tectonism is provided through the dating of zircon growth from samples of the meta-sedimentary Radium Creek Metamorphics. This dating reveals a 1555 ± 16 Ma metamorphic event, interpreted to be the consequence of M₃ amphibolite facies, regional metamorphism and accompanying metasomatism. The transition between D₂ and D₃ is interpreted to reflect a shift from ca. 1591 - 1585 Ma N-S shortening to ca. 1585 - 1552 Ma NW-SE shortening. This episode of orogenesis is correlated with the ca. 1585 - 1540 Ma Kararan Orogeny in the northern Gawler Craton, which distinctly postdates the ca 1600 - 1590 Ma Olarian Orogeny as previously interpreted. The Mesoproterozoic structural architecture was reactivated during Neoproterozoic extension (D₄) and the ca. 500 Ma Delamerian Orogeny. Delamerian structures are formed in a predominantly brittle regime. Early thin-skinned thrusting was followed by thick-skinned deformation (D₅-D₆); during which open F₅ folds developed above oblique lateral ramps, and produced type 0 overprinting patterns with F₃ Mesoproterozoic folds. Steeply plunging F₆ buckle folds with SE-trending axial traces are the last phase of deformation recorded. Both Mesoproterozoic ductile deformation phases and the Palaeozoic ductile-brittle to brittle overprints were focussed along the Paralana Fault, emphasising the repeated long-lived evolution of this crustal scale fault system. 20 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{focus on}} the Iberian-European plate {{boundary}} (IEPB), whose nature, age, and evolution are strongly debated. In contrast to previous interpretations of the IEPB as a major lithospheric-scale left-lateral strike-slip fault, we propose a more complex deformation history. The mapping of rift domains at the transition between Iberia and Europe emphasizes the existence of spatially disconnected rift systems. Based on their restoration, we suggest that the deformation was partitioned between a set of distinct left-lateral transtensional rift systems from the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. A plate kinematic reorganization at Aptian-Albian time resulted in the onset of sea-floor spreading in the western Bay of Biscay and extreme crustal and lithosphere thinning in intra-continental rift basins to the east. The formation and reactivation of the IEPB is interpreted {{as the result of}} the polyphase evolution of a diffuse transient plate boundary that failed to localize. The results of this work may provide new insights on (1) processes preceding breakup and the initiation of segmented and strongly <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> margins, (2) the deformation history of nascent divergent plate boundaries, and (3) the kinematics of the southern North Atlantic and Alpine domain in western Europe...|$|E
30|$|We thus {{conclude}} that slip partitioning {{occurred during the}} 2016 Kumamoto earthquake. The term “slip partitioning” is used to describe oblique motion along a fault system that is accommodated on two or more faults with different mechanisms (Fitch 1972; McCaffrey 1992; Jones and Wesnousky 1992; Bowman et al. 2003). Slip partitioning is observed {{at a variety of}} scales. For example, Fitch (1972) observed that larger-scale (over 100  km) slip partitioning occurs along subduction systems. As shown in Fig.  1 a, an oblique subduction of the Philippine Sea plate underneath southwest Japan is accommodated not only by the megathrust earthquakes along the Nankai Trough but also by right-lateral slip along the Median Tectonic Line (MTL) active fault system. The separation distance between the Nankai Trough and the MTL is over 100  km, which is comparable with depth of the upper mantle and the thickness of the plate. Partitioned slip separated by several tens of kilometer distance was explained by deeper oblique driving motion in viscous lower crust (Bowman et al. 2003). Slip partitioning could be explained as a result of upward propagation of <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> at depth. The authors validated the model by applying it to parts of the San Andreas and Haiyuan faults.|$|E
40|$|The Separation Point Batholith is a late Cretaceous {{granitic}} intrusion outcropping in the north-west Nelson {{region of}} New Zealand. The batholith is elongate, oriented north / south, and stitches the Paleozoic Takaka Terrane to the arc-derived Median Tectonic Zone. It {{has been found}} to be related geochemically to high-Al trondhjemite-tonalite-dacite suites, and hence to be related to the Western Fiordland Orthogneiss. This study investigates the structural features of the northern segment of the Separation Point Batholith where they are exposed along the coastline of the Abel Tasman National Park. Extensive measurements of the pervasive foliation and lineation indicate a consistent planar structure dipping moderately to steeply to the east, and a linear structure plunging gently to the north-east. Jointing systems are approximately consistent with this structure. The western margin is marked by a zone of intense strain, also producing structures dipping steeply to the east, and by the mixing of granitic and dioritic magmas. A model for the emplacement of the Separation Point Batholith has been developed based upon tectonic reconstructions for magma genesis and later post-compressional events. The batholith was emplaced in an active tectonic environment under a transpressional regime, along a major north-south striking <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> zone with dextral strike-slip and east-over-west thrusting.

Feature mapping is a powerful technique that covers a wide area of data acquisition and analysis techniques applying both physically and statistically based principles. This procedure, beyond standard normal beam applications, employs many seldom used but interesting data collection procedures such as critical angles, surface waves, plate waves and backscattering techniques. It forms these into an extremely versatile data acquisition protocol, followed by detailed analysis through a state of the technology signal processing, pattern recognition and expert system and /or artificial intelligence implementation practice. This Paper explains the various existing possibilities for clever physically based data collection, and the types of feature domains and features available for anomaly representation in materials.

The composite’s unit cell may consist of any number of layers of any variable (with large discontinuities) mass-densities and elastic shear moduli. Explicit series expressions are given for displacement, velocity, strain and stress components, and energy-flux vector fields. The approach {{is based on a}} mixed variational principle where the displacement and stress components are viewed as independent fields subject to arbitrary variations. These fields are hence approximated independently, thereby ensuring the necessary conti-nuity conditions. The resulting computational method yields the composite’s frequency bands in terms of the wave-vector components. The calculations are direct and require no iteration, accurately and efficiently producing the entire band structure of the composite. This also allows for direct calcula-tion of the components of the group velocity and the energy-flux vectors as functions of frequency and wave-vector components over an entire frequency band. The general results are illustrated using a two-phase and a three-phase unit cell with piecewise constant properties. It is shown that the directions of the group-velocity and energy-flux vectors are essentially indistinguishable for this class of problems, and that both the two-phase and the three-phase unit cells can display negative refraction on their second frequency pass-band, where the phase and group velocities are antiparallel (backward waves).

40|$|The Belluno {{syncline}} is {{a structure}} {{located in the}} Venetian fold-and-thrust belt in the Italian Southern Alps. This SSE-vergent chain mainly developed during the Neogene as a back-thrust belt of the Alps deforming the northern margin of the Adria plate. The syncline is asymmetric in shape, with a steep backlimb, as the forelimb of the paired Monte Coppolo Anticline; it {{is the result of}} fault-propagation folding during the development of the underlying Belluno thrust. In plan view the Belluno thrust shows a prominent curvature interpreted as reactivation of inherited Mesozoic extensional structures. The hinge of the Belluno syncline presents a similar curvature. Rocks cropping out in the syncline core are Upper Chattian to Langhian fine-grained molassic sediments, mainly siltstones and marls. Most fractures on the Belluno syncline have formed at high angles to bedding. The dominant fracture trends are subparaUel and orthogonal to the fold hinge. Sometimes these fractures show plumose structures revealing extension (Mode I) fracture mechanism and therefore they are referred to as longitudinal (bc) joints and cross (ac) joints respectively. Other fracture trends oblique to the hinge line are found in measurement stations located on limbs distant from the fold hinge. They are referred to as <b>oblique</b> (<b>shear)</b> fractures.

40|$|The Cenozoic Dali Basin, {{located at}} the {{northeast}} of Diancang Shan {{and south of the}} first bend of Yangtze River, is tectonically controlled by the Dali fault system in the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The basin is filled with late Miocene to Pleistocene fluviolacustrine sediments, which provide invaluable information about the tectonic deformation and drainage network reorganization in this area. In this study, we discuss the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) of the Dasongping section in the Dali Basin, which spans an interval from 7. 6 to 1. 8 Ma. Although rock magnetic experiments indicate that magnetite and hematite are the main remanence carriers, hysteresis loops, low values of bulk susceptibility and low temperature susceptibility suggest that paramagnetic minerals are major contributors to low-field AMS. The rock magnetic parameters indicate that the Dali Basin experienced four stages of infilling and the sediment sources may have changed at 4. 2 Ma. The clustering of the minimum principle axes (Kmin) nearly perpendicular to the bedding plane and the pronounced N–S magnetic lineation parallel to the bedding plane indicate that the AMS of the Dali Basin is a superimposed fabric consisting of a sedimentary-compaction and a mild initial deformation overprint. The well-defined N–S magnetic lineation is likely due to the NNW and NNE <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> caused by the Heqing and Red River faults...|$|E

A {{sample of the}} oldest syntectonic granitic orthogneisses of the Mzumbe Terrane, the Mzimlilo Granite, gave a date of 1147 ± 8 Ma. This is interpreted to represent the crystallisation age and thus gives a reliable minimum estimate {{of the age of}} the first, collision-related tectono-metamorphic episode (D 1) in the Mzumbe Terrane. The date is younger than the earliest foliation in the Tugela Terrane to the north, but is in accordance with previous Ar-Ar dating of shear zones in that terrane. This implies that the early fabrics in the Tugela Terrane were rejuvenated at this time. Magmatic zircons from melanorite of the Equeefa Suite provided a SHRIMP crystallisation date of 1083 ± 6 Ma. The Equeefa Suite comprises a large mafic-ultramafic body west of Scottburgh, associated with a swarm of deformed mafic (amphibolitic) dykes. The suite forms a valuable time marker, having been emplaced after D 1 but during {{the early stages of the}} major, long-lived <b>oblique</b> sinistral <b>shearing</b> episode, which led to the final juxtaposition of the Mzumbe and Margate Terranes. This event has been dated between ca. 1. 05 and 1. 0 Ga from previous studies.

The composite's unit cell may consist of any number of layers of any variable mass-density and elastic shear modulus (with large discontinuities). Explicit series expressions for displacement, velocity, strain and stress components, and energy-flux fields are given, and group-velocity vector is calculated. The approach is based on a mixed variational principle where the displacement and stress components are viewed as independent fields subject to arbitrary variation. These fields are hence approximated independently, thereby ensuring the necessary continuity conditions. The resulting computational method yields the composite's frequency band structure and the associated mode shapes, in terms of the wave-vector components for any desired number of frequency bands. The general results are illustrated using a two-phase and a three-phase unit cell with piecewise constant properties. It is shown that on their second frequency pass-bands, only the components of the phase and group velocities normal to the layers are antiparallel, while the components along the layers are parallel. Therefore, both the two-phase and the three-phase composites display negative energy refraction with positive phase-velocity refraction and positive phase-velocity refraction with negative energy refraction, depending on how the composite is interfaced with a homogeneous solid.

These rocks preserve the deformational and metamorphic effects of the Kimban Orogeny and the later Wartakan Event. Within the Fishery Bay area, five separate ductile deformation events (D 1 -D 5) are recognised, the dominant of which (D 2 -D 3) are associated with granulite facies metamorphism. The effects of the D 3 event are pervasive throughout the Fishery Bay region, with D 1 and D 2 preserved only in regions of low-D 3 strain. The overprinting nature of D 3 is recognised in the reorientation of D 2 structures. The dominant response of the area to D 3 strain {{is a series of}} westerly-dipping dextral <b>oblique</b> reverse <b>shears</b> with west block-up movement. Much of the strain is localised within the paragneisses and along the margins of mafic dykes recognised {{in the development of a}} NNE-trending D 3 high-strain zone termed the Cape Wiles Shear Zone. D 3 observations from the Fishery Bay region correlate well with previous studies conducted on southern Eyre Peninsula which lead to the inference that D 3 west block-up exhumation is responsible for the positive pressure gradient that exists from west to east across the Kalinjala Shear Zone. The pressure-temperature conditions preserved in the mineral assemblages of the paragneiss units and mafic dykes record two granulite facies metamorphic events, M 2 and M 3.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{inspections}} of buildings, {{it is common}} to find structures that, well before reaching its useful life longer require repairs and reinforcements. This study examined the bond strength between concrete of different ages and between steel and concrete, focusing on the recovery of reinforced concrete structures. To analyze the bond between concrete of different ages, trials with specimens receiving three different types of treatments at the interface between the concrete were performed: brushing; brushing and mortar equal to concrete of substrate and brushing and epoxy layer. Indirect tensile tests and oblique and vertical shear tests at the interface were made. The bond stress between steel and concrete was evaluated by pull out test under the conditions of the bar inserted in the still fresh concrete and when inserted in the hardened concrete with epoxy. Results showed increased bond strength by indirect tensile stress of 15 % and 37 %; 4 % and 12 % for the adherence test by <b>oblique</b> <b>shear,</b> and 108 % and 178 %, for the testing of vertical shear, respectively, for the specimens whose interfaces have received, in addition to brushing, layer of mortar and epoxy bridge, compared to those who received only brushing. Insignificant loss (about 0. 52 %) of bond stress was noticed for pull out test of steel bar when compared with test results of the specimens that had steel bar inserted in the concrete in the hardened state with epoxy adhesion bridge, with those who had inserted steel bar in fresh concrete...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the shear stress presented in glass fiber posts with parallel fiber (0) and different coronal diameters under fatigue, fracture resistance and PEA. 160 glass-fiber posts (N= 160) with eight different coronal diameters were used (DT = double tapered, {{number of the}} post = coronal diameter and W=Wider - fiber post with coronal diameter wider than the conventional) : DT 1. 4; DT 1. 8 W; DT 1. 6; DT 2 W; DT 1. 8; DT 2. 2 W; DT 2; DT 2. 2. Eighty posts were submitted to mechanical cycling (3 x 10 (6) cycles; inclination: 45 degrees; load: 50 N; frequency: 4 Hz; temperature: 37 degrees C) to assess the surviving under intermittent loading and other eighty posts were submitted to fracture resistance testing (resistance [N] and shear-stress [MPa] values were obtained). The eight posts types were 3 D modeled (Rhinoceros 4. 0) and the shear-stress (MPa) evaluated using FEA (Ansys 13. 0). One-way ANOVA showed statistically differences to fracture resistance (DT 2. 2 W and DT 2. 2 showed higher values) and shear stress values (DT 1. 4 showed lower values). Only the DT 1. 4 fiber posts failed after mechanical cycling. FEA showed similar values of shear stress between the groups and these values {{were similar to those}} obtained by shear stress testing. The failure analysis showed that 95 % of specimens failed by shear. Posts with parallel fiber (0 degrees) may suffer fractures when an <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> load is applied on the structure; except the thinner group, greater coronal diameters promoted the same shear stresses.

40|$|A newly {{discovered}} northeast-trending subvertical shear zone, up to 3 kilometers wide, forms {{the backbone of}} the Virgin Mountains in southern Nevada. This zone, named for excellent exposure in Cabin Canyon, contains a well-developed mylonitic foliation that records a complex history of movement and strain within the Virgin Mountains. The overall movement history is interpreted to involve a combination of northwest shortening deformation and dextral, northwest-side-up, <b>oblique</b> <b>shear.</b> The mylonites within the zone are comprised of amphibolites, granodiorites, a variety of meta-sedimentary rocks, and leuco-pegmatite dikes. The oldest rocks involved in shearing are similar to ~ 1. 7 Ga of the Grand Canyon, but mylonitization is inferred to be ~ 1. 4 Ga based on relatively low temperature microstructures and similarity to other partitioned dextral/transpressive shear zones in northwestern Arizona. Mapping and microstructural analysis show that the dominant northeast-striking foliation (S 2) developed under relatively high temperatures within the upper amphibolite facies, likely at 1. 7 Ga. At a later time, likely 1. 4 Ga, these rocks underwent further shortening and oblique dextral shear, which boudinaged the amphibolites and original pegmatites causing dramatic grain size reduction (mylonitization). This transpressional deformation created sub-horizontal lineations and shear sense indicators such as delta and sigma porphyroclasts, shear bands, C-S fabrics, and bookshelf sliding. Pegmatites were intruded at various stages during mylonitization as shown by field relationships of folded pegmatites that have been cut by later pegmatite veins. These pegmatites were folded into tight and isoclinal folds via inhomogeneous shortening at a low metamorphic grade (< 500 degrees Celsius). Ultra-mylonites within the shear zone, which may represent high strain zones, have also been folded following shearing indicating continued transpression or a younger deformational event.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The {{accuracy}} of two-phase flow simulations is mainly {{determined by the}} mathematical formulations and resolution of the computational mesh used in the numerical model. Selective mesh refinement improves the {{accuracy of}} results while maintaining low resource requirements. This study introduces arbitrees, a new recursive grid design that allows hierarchical refinement and coarsening to be applied on uniform and arbitrary grids. An object-oriented simulation framework was developed that allows the mathematical equations to be written directly in the code, providing direct control over the behaviour of the flow model. Two-fluid models based on the volume of fluid method are implemented and coupled to the arbitree grid to investigate adaptive refinement in two-fluid simulations. Test cases for shape advection in <b>oblique,</b> rotating and <b>shear</b> flow were used to validate the interface tracking capabilities of the adaptive system. The adaptive two-fluid methodology was tested by modelling {{the collapse of a}} liquid column. In all cases, the predicted results exhibited encouraging agreement with analytical solutions or experimental measurements. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|The colliding flows (CF) {{model is}} a well-supported {{mechanism}} for generating molecular clouds. However, to-date most CF simulations {{have focused on the}} formation of clouds in the normal-shock layer between head-on colliding flows. We performed simulations of magnetized colliding flows that instead meet at an oblique-shock layer. <b>Oblique</b> shocks generate <b>shear</b> in the post-shock environment, and this shear creates inhospitable environments for star formation. As the degree of shear increases (i. e. the obliquity of the shock increases), we find that it takes longer for sink particles to form, they form in lower numbers, and they tend to be less massive. With regard to magnetic fields, we find that even a weak field stalls gravitational collapse within forming clouds. Additionally, an initially oblique collision interface tends to reorient over time {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field, so that it becomes normal to the oncoming flows. This was demonstrated by our most oblique shock interface, which became fully normal by the end of the simulation.

40|$|Integrated structural, {{metamorphic}} and geochronological data {{demonstrate the}} existence of a contractional orogen preserved in the ca 1850 Ma Donington Suite batholith along the eastern margin of the Gawler Craton, South Australia. The earliest structures are a pervasive gneissic foliation developed in the Donington Suite and interleaved metasedimentary rocks. This has been overprinted by isoclinal and non-cylindrical folding, and zones of pervasive non-coaxial shear with north-directed transport, suggesting that deformation was the result of orogenic contraction. SHRIMP U - Pb zircon data indicate that a syn-contractional granitic dyke was emplaced at 1846 ± 4 Ma. Overprinting the contractional structures are a series of discrete, migmatitic high-strain zones that show a normal geometry with a component of <b>oblique</b> dextral <b>shear.</b> U - Pb zircon data from a weakly foliated microgranite in one such shear zone give an emplacement age of 1843 ± 5 Ma. Rare aluminous metasedimentary rocks in the belt preserve a granulite-grade assemblage of garnet + biotite + plagioclase + K-feldspar + silicate melt that formed at ∼ 600 MPa and ∼ 750 °C. Peak metamorphic garnets are partially replaced by biotite + sillimanite+ cordierite assemblages suggesting post-thermal peak cooling and decompression, and are indicative of a clockwise P - T evolution. Chemical U - Th - Pb electron microprobe ages from monazites in retrograde biotite yield a minimum estimate for the timing of retrogression of ca 1830 Ma, indicating that decompression may be linked {{to the development of the}} broadly extensional shear zones and that the clockwise P - T path occurred during a single tectonothermal cycle. We define this ca 1850 Ma phase of crustal evolution in the eastern Gawler Craton as the Cornian Orogeny. A. Reid, M. Hand, E. Jagodzinski, D. Kelsey, N. Pearso...|$|R
