5|$|Despite this move, {{disputes}} {{regarding the}} shape of land reform continued inside the Government. On July 21, 1848, Nicolae Bălcescu obtained the issuing of a decree to create Comisia proprietății (the Commission <b>on</b> <b>Property),</b> comprising 34 delegates, two for each Wallachian county, representing respectively peasants and landlords. The new institution was presided over by the landowner Alexandru Racoviță, and had the Moldavian-born Ion Ionescu de la Brad for its vice president.|$|E

5|$|The last carucage {{was imposed}} in 1224, after {{which most of}} the medieval government's revenue was raised by levying taxes on {{moveable}} or personal property, instead of on land; taxes on moveable property were first assessed in 1207. A probable reason for the abandonment of land taxes was the greater revenues raised by taxes <b>on</b> <b>property</b> and income.|$|E
5|$|Adkins {{was born}} in Boone County, West Virginia on April 29, 1937, where he spent his entire life. He was the {{youngest}} of ten children of Wid Adkins, a coal miner, and Alice Adkins, raised in a tarpaper shack <b>on</b> <b>property</b> rented from a local coal company. Born {{at the time of the}} Great Depression, Adkins' early life was stricken by poverty. His parents were unable to provide him shoes until he was four or five years old. Some reports say he attended school for a very brief time, as few as two days of first grade.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, Mayor Daley {{nominated}} Chico {{as chairman}} of the board of trustees of the City Colleges of Chicago and the board elected Chico chairman. Along with Chancellor Cheryl Hyman, Chico reformed the City Colleges budget by laying off 225 employees, removing unfilled jobs, and reducing executive spending to increase spending on technology and training for students. Furthermore, Chico and Hyman reduced taxation <b>on</b> <b>property</b> for two straight years, and cancelled nursing programs. He resigned 8 months later to run for Mayor of Chicago.|$|E

5|$|The West Pier was {{constructed}} during {{a boom in}} pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain. It was designed by architect Eugenius Birch as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air. Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, complaining that the planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil {{the view of the}} sea from their homes. It was felt that the pier would have a positive effect <b>on</b> <b>property</b> values in the town, so the pier was approved. Construction began in 1863 and the pier opened to the public on 6 October 1866.|$|E
5|$|The {{architect}} Norman Shaw, then aged 73, {{was brought}} in to draw up proposals for the Circus and the Quadrant after early plans were felt to be unsatisfactory. His scheme was approved in principle but subject to indecision and dispute, both <b>on</b> <b>property</b> acquisition and retailers' demand for bigger display windows. Shaw's design for the Piccadilly Hotel was completed in 1908 with modifications, while the Quadrant was rebuilt by Blomfield, adapting Shaw's designs. The work started in 1923 and was completed by 1928. Significantly, no accommodation was built above any of the retail properties, contributing to the demise of the West End as a place of residence. A limited number of architects were responsible for the redesigned street, including Sir John James Burnet, Arthur Joseph Davis and Henry Tanner.|$|E

5|$|The protests {{reached a}} new level of {{visibility}} during 1993 as part of a grassroots campaign where protesters came from outside the area to support local opposition to the road. The initial focus was on the removal of a tree on George Green, east of Wanstead, that attracted the attention of local, then national media. The activity peaked in 1994 with several high-profile protesters setting up micronations <b>on</b> <b>property</b> scheduled for demolition, most notably on Claremont Road in Leyton. The final stage of the protest was a single building on Fillebrook Road in Leytonstone, which, due to a security blunder, became occupied by squatters.|$|E
5|$|When the Civil War began, Tubman {{worked for}} the Union Army, first as a cook and nurse, and then as an armed scout and spy. The first woman to lead an armed {{expedition}} in the war, she guided the raid at Combahee Ferry, which liberated more than 700 slaves. After the war, she retired to the family home <b>on</b> <b>property</b> she had purchased in 1859 in Auburn, New York, where she cared for her aging parents. She {{was active in the}} women's suffrage movement until illness overtook her and she had to be admitted to a home for elderly African Americans that she had helped to establish years earlier. After she died in 1913, she became an icon of American courage and freedom.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a year of}} Albert Wise's death, Martha Wise, {{though not}} {{considered}} a particularly good or attractive catch, found new male companionship {{in the form of}} Walter Johns, who worked as a farmhand <b>on</b> <b>property</b> adjacent to her farm. The relationship was frowned upon by Wise's family, and both Wise's mother, Sophie Hasel, and her aunt, Lily Gienke, made no secret of their desire for Wise to end the relationship. By the end of 1924, Wise had acquiesced, and the relationship ended. Johns moved to Cleveland and the couple lost contact.|$|E

5|$|Caudy {{never learned}} to write in English; he signed his last will and {{testament}} with an X mark in 1784. Caudy died on March 15, 1784, and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him. Another tradition says he was buried with his horse. The site of Caudy's interment is located <b>on</b> <b>property</b> now known as Hartford Bealer farm. In the 1930s, Caudy's burial site was attended to by a local Boy Scouts troop, who landscaped the site and planted shrubbery. By 1976, Caudy's burial place was marked with four posts. In 2002, the Capon Bridge Ruritan Club removed the overgrown shrubs and erected a white fence around Caudy's interment site. The project was initiated by Capon Bridge area residents Roy Giffin, Ken Edmonds, and Roberta Munske. The Ruritans purchased a marble marker and erected it on the site at 9 a.m. on November 15, 2003. The burial site is accessible and visible from Christian Church Road, West Virginia Secondary Route 13.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan pursued similar reforms {{with respect}} to Indigenous Australians. In 1962, the Aboriginal Affairs Bill was {{introduced}} to liberalise constraints that had been placed on Indigenous Australians {{in the past and}} had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aborigines. Dunstan was prominent in Labor's opposition to the double standards, and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes. He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls <b>on</b> <b>property</b> and the confinement of Indigenous Australians to reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aborigines failed, as did his proposal to ensure that {{at least half of the}} members of the Aboriginal Affairs Board be Indigenous Australians. Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy of assimilation of Aborigines, which he saw as the diluting of their distinctive cultures.|$|E
5|$|Flooding and {{landslides}} in Jamaica {{took their}} toll <b>on</b> <b>property,</b> agricultural interests, and infrastructure; fruit growers {{on the island}} sustained about $2.5 million (1935 USD) in losses. Just off the coast, an unidentified vessel went down with her entire crew in the hostile conditions. Strong winds buffeted coastal sections of Cuba, notably in and around Santiago de Cuba. There, the hurricane demolished 100 homes and filled streets with debris. Only four {{people died in the}} country, thanks to the extensive pre-storm preparations. The storm did the most damage along the Tiburon Peninsula of southwestern Haiti, where catastrophic river flooding took the lives of up to 2,000 individuals, razed hundreds of native houses, and destroyed crops and livestock. The heaviest destruction took place around the towns of Jacmel and Jérémie; one early report estimated that 1,500 had been killed at the latter. Entire swaths of countryside were isolated for days, delaying both reconnaissance and relief efforts.|$|E

5|$|Following Jones's {{death in}} 1806, his widow Margaret Morton Jones {{continued}} to reside at Bogota until her own death in 1822. Jaquelin Harvie, {{the son of}} Jones's daughter Margaret Jones Harvie and her husband John Harvie, purchased the Bogota estate {{after the death of}} Jones's wife, and Harvie subsequently sold the property in 1830 to Jacob Strayer, who built the current house in 1845–1847. The original house erected and occupied by Jones was demolished shortly after the construction of the current house. The site of Jones's house is presently located <b>on</b> <b>property</b> no longer part of the Bogota estate, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 2009. A log tenant house estimated to have been built during the mid-18th century during the ownership of the Jones family is extant, and remains part of the current Bogota estate, as of 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, White was a {{shareholder}} in two corporations operating in Romney.

Walker on March 11, 1890. White was one of six corporators, with two shares ($35 each), of the Romney Manufacturing, Land and Improvement Company, which was created for the acquisition of land near Romney {{for the establishment of a}} hotel or summer resort and the development of residential real estate. The Romney Manufacturing, Land and Improvement Company was incorporated by Walker's successor, William A. Ohley, on July 10, 1890.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Dammasch State Hospital {{was closed}} {{by the state}} of Oregon, and the site was then {{proposed}} as a location for what became the Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, which opened in 2001 at a different site {{to the north of the}} old hospital grounds. In protest of the construction of the prison, specifically the effect <b>on</b> <b>property</b> values, Larry Eaton began erecting school buses on his property. The former grounds of the state hospital are, as of 2009, under development as Villebois, a primarily residential complex. Also in 1995, Wilsonville High School opened as part of the West Linn-Wilsonville School District, the first high school in the city's history. In 1998, lack of an adequate long-term water supply forced the city to suspend adding any new developments to the city. A new water treatment plant on the Willamette River opened in 2002 to address this need.|$|E
