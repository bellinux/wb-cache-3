They visited night clubs and were able to provide her with news about up-and-coming music and artists, helping to create the sounds she gravitated towards for the album.|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>cultures.</b> Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.|$|E

The author explores this issue, recognizing that many people today are culturally sheltered, having no desire to open their minds {{beyond the boundaries of}} our great nation. Several journal articles are drawn upon in an attempt to pinpoint the cause of this distancing, describe the psychological aspects <b>of</b> encountering <b>other</b> <b>cultures</b> (expounding upon the term "culture shock " and describing its four phases), and state ways in which the anxiety and uncertainty inherent in encountering <b>other</b> <b>cultures</b> may be reduced. The author next delves further into the issue, relating findings to personal experience as a IIstranger in strange land. " Changed perceptions and realizations regarding kinship are discussed, as well as the way in which a changed view <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>culture...</b>|$|R
