5|$|In the {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>Guys</b> and Dollss success, Feuer and Martin {{were interested in}} adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row into a musical.

Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions for the story line by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E

Performances have included comedies, tragedies, classics, and musicals.

In 1963, the Children's Show was instituted and continues each spring. Between 1968 and 1998, the Guild produced Theatre in the Park. Since 2002, the Players' Guild of Leonia has produced a Playwright's Showcase featuring original scripts. The Guild operates out of the historic Civil War Drill Hall Theatre on Grand Avenue which is leased from the borough.

25|$|The {{first series}} was won by Will Young, with Gareth Gates coming second. Michelle McManus won the second series. All {{of the top}} three contestants from series 1 had number-one singles in the UK. Young {{continues}} to be a recording artist. Gates initially had great success as a recording artist, releasing three studio albums and seven top 5 singles. He has since moved on to a successful career in musical theatre appearing as lead in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, as Marius in Les Miserables, on tour and in the West End and as Claude in Hair. In 2013, he {{became a member of the}} supergroup 5th Story. Darius Danesh had two hit albums and has appeared in the West End musicals Chicago, playing the role of Billy Flynn, and Gone with the Wind, originating the role of Rhett Butler. He also appeared in the touring version <b>of</b> <b>Guys</b> and Dolls as Sky Masterson. Finalists Rosie Ribbons and Zoe Birkett have both scored chart hits, Birkett also moving on to a career in musical theatre whilst Jessica Garlick represented the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. Semi-finalist Sarah Whatmore had two chart hits, despite failing to be voted into the top 10. Series 2 contestants enjoyed significantly less chart success, which many believe damaged the credibility of the show and helped hasten its demise in its home country.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to provide a}} {{detailed}} study of the texts and manuscripts of the Middle English <b>Guy</b> <b>of</b> Warwick, such as is not presently available. The agenda of this investigation is essentially interdisciplinary. Each chapter considers a different set of evidence (literary, historical, manuscript and linguistic). In addition to which, this study benefits from the opportunities offered by new media, incorporating the results of exhaustive and highly accurate computer-enabled searches of a range of late medieval texts. Through this approach it has been possible to integrate and identify links between different areas of research in a way which has been crucial to dispelling various myths and misconceptions which have, in the past, dominated the critical perception <b>of</b> <b>Guy</b> <b>of</b> Warwick. This thesis encourages a view which emphasises the complexity of the textual tradition <b>of</b> <b>Guy</b> <b>of</b> Warwick and rejects past assumptions which over simplify the circumstances of its production and circulation. Chapter 1 considers the place <b>of</b> <b>Guy</b> <b>of</b> Warwick in late medieval literature and culture, assembling the evidence for sources, relations, transmission and reception. This chapter emphasises the protean nature of the romance, its adaptation and regeneration for different contexts and the evidence for a range of responses. Chapter 2 provides, for the first time, a comprehensive account of all <b>of</b> the <b>Guy</b> <b>of</b> Warwick manuscripts, including full codicological descriptions and giving special consideration to the presentation <b>of</b> <b>Guy</b> <b>of</b> Warwick in each. By combining this codicological data with the linguistic findings of Chapter 3, it has here been possible to review and reject a number of theories, most notably concerning the Auchinleck MS, which misinterpret the significance of the manuscript presentation <b>of</b> <b>Guy</b> <b>of</b> Warwick. Chapter 3 uses linguistic data to clarify the relationship between the manuscript texts and the different versions <b>of</b> <b>Guy</b> <b>of</b> Warwick. Traditional dialect analysis is combined with computer-enabled searches to provide detailed information which establishes the origin and circulation of the texts and their literary and stylistic affiliations, including evidence which rejects the traditional Warwickshire origin for the A-version. The thesis is supplemented on CD ROM by new, accurate transcriptions of all the complete texts <b>of</b> <b>Guy</b> <b>of</b> Warwick and a review of Zupitza's 1875 - 91 edition, including a list of errors...|$|R
