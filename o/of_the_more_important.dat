5|$|On December 9, 1943, {{the central}} {{committee}} of the separatist movement held a secret meeting in Palermo. Vizzini's presence suggested the Mafia’s support for independence, and aided the conservative wing {{in their attempt to}} control the movement. Vizzini shared common views with baron Lucio Tasca – one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> leaders of the movement – and despite protests by the more progressive wing, Vizzini remained at the meeting representing the province of Caltanissetta.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Cardiff Castle {{escaped the}} slighting, or {{deliberate}} damage and destruction, that affected many other castles. Probably {{because of the}} threat of a pro-Royalist invasion by the Presbyterian Scots, a Parliamentary garrison was installed instead and the castle remained intact. The Herberts continued to own the castle as the Earls of Pembroke, both during the interregnum and after the restoration of Charles II. The castle's constable continued to act as mayor of the town of Cardiff, controlling the meetings of the town's burgesses, bailffs and aldermen; the Herberts usually appointed members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> local gentry to this position during the period.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1818, Jennings began {{promoting}} a large-scale plan for internal {{improvements in the}} state. Most of the projects were directed toward construction of roads, canals, and other projects to enhance the commercial appeal and economic viability of the state. During Jennings's second term the state government continued to support public improvements, with new road construction and expanded settlement into central Indiana. After Indianapolis became {{the site for the}} state's permanent capital in 1821 and new settlers arrived in the area, the Indiana General Assembly appropriated $100,000 for new road construction and improvements to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> routes, but it was considerably short of the amount needed.|$|E

40|$|Most investors look at {{the initial}} return (or yield) that they will receive from an {{investment}} property, but this is only part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> issue is what capital appreciation will be achieved.

5|$|The {{efficiency}} of the British blockade was such that communication and reinforcement between France and her colonies was dangerous for the ships involved and so was severely limited. This led to shortages and disaffection among the French colonists, especially in the Caribbean, where they were surrounded by hostile British harbours and constantly raided and blockaded by British ships. The island of Martinique was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> French islands in the West Indies, but by late 1808 the island's economy had been crippled by the British blockade, and food stocks, military supplies and morale were all running low. In the summer a French dispatch vessel was intercepted by British warships, warning of the desperate state of the island's defences; similar messages that did reach France safely prompted an urgent response by the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|When Geta died in 211, her {{responsibilities}} increased because Caracalla found {{administrative tasks}} to be mundane. She {{may have taken}} upon one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> civil functions of the emperor; receiving petitions and answering correspondence. The extent of her role in this position, however, is probably overstated. She may have represented her son and {{played a role in}} meetings and answering queries; however, the final authority on legal matters was Caracalla. When Caracalla was murdered, Julia was in Antioch sorting out correspondence, removing unimportant messages from the bunch so that when Caracalla returned, he would not be overburdened with duties. The emperor filled all of the roles in the legal system as judge, legislator, and administrator.|$|E
5|$|With {{the defeat}} of these German drives, I Corps {{conducted}} its first offensive mission, participating in the Second Battle of the Marne from 18 July until 6 August, {{which resulted in the}} reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> salients driven into Allied lines by the German offensives. After a brief period in the defensive sectors of Champagne and Lorraine between 7 August and 11 September, the corps took part in the St. Mihiel attack on 12 September, which reduced the German salient there during the next four days. Then followed another period on the defense in Lorraine as preparations advanced for what was to be the final Allied offensive of the war. On 26 September, I Corps troops began the attack northward that opened the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. From that day until 11 November 1918 when the war ended, I Corps was constantly moving forward.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, private turnpike {{companies}} {{constructed and}} improved a few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> roadways in the state. Turnpikes were chartered {{by the state}} and privately financed, with tolls collected at toll houses every few miles along the road. The first turnpike in Delaware was the Newport Gap Pike, which was built in 1808 and completed to Wilmington in 1811. Many other turnpikes were constructed in northern New Castle County radiating from Wilmington and connected the industrial city to agricultural areas. The turnpikes were built as straight roads in order to reduce costs. Many of these roads were constructed with a macadam surface. During the course of the 19th century, new methods of transportation such as canals and railroads came about and there was less investment on roads. The revenues of the turnpike companies fell and roads became more of a local concern.|$|E
5|$|King and Jenner befriended American {{expatriate}} Joe Boyd, the {{promoter of}} the UFO Club, {{who was making}} {{a name for himself}} as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> entrepreneurs on the British music scene. The newly hired booking agent, Bryan Morrison, and Boyd had proposed sending in better quality recordings. From Morrison's agency the band played a gig outside London for the first time. In November, the band performed the first (of many) strangely named concerts: Philadelic Music for Simian Hominids, a multimedia event arranged by the group's former landlord, Mike Leonard, at Hornsey College of Art. They performed at the Free School for the following two weeks, before performing at the Psychodelphia Versus Ian Smith event at the Roundhouse in December, arranged by the Majority Rule for Rhodesia Campaign, and an Oxfam benefit at the Albert Hall (the band's biggest venue up to this point).|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Wessex, which {{eventually}} laid claim to England as a whole, evolved a centralised royal administration. One {{part of this}} was the king's council, the witenagemot, comprising the senior clergy, ealdormen, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> thegns; the council met to advise the king on policy and legal issues. The royal household included officials, thegns and a secretariat of clergy which travelled with the king, conducting the affairs of government as it went. Under the Danish kings, a bodyguard of housecarls also accompanied the court. At a regional level, ealdormen played {{an important part in}} government, defence and taxation, and the post of sheriff emerged in the 10th century, administering local shires on behalf of an ealdorman. Anglo-Saxon mints were tightly controlled by the kings, providing a high quality currency, and the whole country was taxed using a system called hidage.|$|E

5|$|While {{the rates}} of the leading causes of death, {{cardiovascular}} disease, cancer and lung disease, are similar in women and men, women have different experiences. Lung cancer has overtaken all other types of cancer as {{the leading cause of}} cancer death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men. Despite this, breast cancer remains the commonest cancer in women in developed countries, and is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> chronic diseases of women, while cervical cancer remains one of the commonest cancers in developing countries, associated with human papilloma virus (HPV), an important sexually transmitted disease. HPV vaccine together with screening offers the promise of controlling these diseases. Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia. A major impediment to advancing women's health has been their underrepresentation in research studies, an inequity being addressed in the United States and other western nations by the establishment of centers of excellence in women's health research and large scale clinical trials such as the Women's Health Initiative.|$|E
