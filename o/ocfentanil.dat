50|$|In human volunteers <b>ocfentanil</b> induces {{effective}} analgesia at 1 μg/kg, {{while in}} doses up to 3 μg/kg, analgesia and respiratory depression {{occurred in a}} dose-dependent manner. While a further study suggests that <b>ocfentanil</b> may {{be as effective as}} morphine in post-operative relief, <b>Ocfentanil</b> was also studied as a supplement to general anaesthesia, in which the researchers concluded that it appears to be similar in action to fentanyl, with 3 μg/kg of <b>ocfentanil</b> approximately equivalent to 5 μg/kg of fentanyl.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ocfentanil</b> (INN) (also called A-3217) is {{a potent}} {{synthetic}} opioid structurally related to fentanyl that {{was developed in the}} early 1990s as {{one of a series of}} potent naloxone-reversible opioids in an attempt to obtain an opioid that had better therapeutic indices in terms of cardiovascular effects and respiratory depression as compared to fentanyl.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The popularization of {{anonymous}} markets such as Silk Road is challenging current drug policy and {{may provide a}} new context for old issues, such as adulteration of heroin with fentanyl derivatives. The aims of this paper are to report the presence of <b>ocfentanil,</b> a novel, potent, non-controlled fentanyl analog, in samples sold as heroin in the hidden web, and to summarize the effects reported by users. METHODS: In 2015, four samples allegedly bought as heroin in cryptomarkets of the hidden web were sent to Energy Control for analysis. Energy Control is a Spanish harm reduction NGO that offers anonymous drug checking {{with the purpose of}} adapting counselling to the specific substances present in the drug and monitor the drug market. Identification was performed by GC/MS and LC/MS/MS. We contacted the submitters of the samples and performed an Internet search to retrieve additional information. RESULTS: One sample contained <b>ocfentanil,</b> caffeine and heroin. Three samples contained the aforementioned substances plus paracetamol. Two out of the four contacted users reported distinct short acting, opioid-like effects. No fora discussion could be found about the effects of <b>ocfentanil,</b> neither web pages nor individuals advertising the substance. CONCLUSION: We report the presence of a new substance detected in the hidden web as an adulterant of heroin, <b>ocfentanil.</b> It has short acting opioid-like effects, roughly the same potency as fentanyl, and can be injected, snorted or smoked. Severe side effects have been associated with its use, including one death. No discussion about this substance could be found in the Internet, which suggests this substance has not been sold as such. Available data about purities of drugs purchased in cryptomarkets suggest that adulteration is not a severe problem and this agrees with users' perceptions. However, this study suggests that adulteration is a real threat not only at the street level, but also for users that buy substances in cryptomarkets, and suggest the need for harm reduction initiatives in this setting...|$|E
40|$|The {{abuse of}} novel psychoactive {{substances}} (NPS) {{has been increasing}} dramatically worldwide since late 2000 s. By the end of 2015, more than 560 NPS had been reported to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Although the most popular compounds are synthetic cannabinoids and psychostimulatory derivatives of cathinone (so-called β-keto-amphetamines), novel synthetic opioids have recently emerged on the recreational drug market. They include fentanyl (a potent narcotic analgesic) and its analogs (e. g., acetylfentanyl, acryloylfentanyl, carfentanil, α-methylfentanyl, 3 -methylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, 4 -fluorobutyrylfentanyl, 4 -methoxybutyrylfentanyl, 4 -chloroisobutyrylfentanyl, 4 -fluoroisobutyrylfentanyl, tetrahydrofuranylfentanyl, cyclopentylfentanyl, and <b>ocfentanil)</b> and compounds with different chemical structures, such as AH- 7921, MT- 45, and U- 47700. This survey {{provides an overview of}} the pharmacological properties, pattern of use, and desired and unwanted effects of the above-listed novel opioids. Special emphasis is given to cases of non-fatal and lethal intoxication involving these compounds...|$|E
