40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} the field of intrusion detection is the management <b>of</b> <b>alerts.</b> Intrusion Detection Systems tend to produce a high number <b>of</b> <b>alerts,</b> most <b>of</b> them being false positives.

In order to increase the detection rate, the use of multiple IDSs based on heterogeneous detection techniques is a solution but in return it increases the number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> to process. Aggregating the alerts coming from multiple heterogeneous IDSs and fusing them is a necessary step before processing the content and the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>alerts.</b> We propose in this paper to define a similarity operator that takes two IDMEF alerts and outputs a similarity value between 0 and 1. We then propose some algorithms to process the alerts in a on-line or off-line approach using this operator. The article ends up with experimentations made with the Nmap tool and th...|$|R
5|$|Flooding {{was also}} {{reported}} in Hispaniola and eastern Cuba. In Cuba, a state <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> was declared for Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, Granma, and Holguin provinces, and 7,500people were evacuated. Heavy rainfall caused landslides and isolated several towns after roads and rails were blocked. Some areas lost power or telephone services. Five {{people were killed}} in Cuba, four of whom from drowning and one from electrocution. In nearby Haiti, flooding was worst in Les Cayes, where the Ravine River destroyed many homes and left 1,300homeless. Throughout the country, flooding severely damaged crops and wrecked bridges and roads. There were 21deaths in the Les Cayes area. In the Dominican Republic, there were 12deaths around Santo Domingo after mudslides buried people. Four towns were isolated after rivers exceeded their banks, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. Overall, the system caused 94deaths and $25million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the operation, {{a raid on}} the French {{coastal town}} of Dieppe had placed the German occupying forces on a high state <b>of</b> <b>alert,</b> and this {{ultimately}} contributed to Aquatint's failure. The commandos were also unable to identify their correct landing place due to the darkness. Within minutes of landing, the raiding party was ambushed by a German patrol and forced {{to try to reach}} their Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) transport. The MTB was located and engaged by the German shore batteries, which damaged one of its engines. It was forced to withdraw, leaving the commandos behind. At the end of the raid those commandos who had not been killed all became prisoners of war. Only five of the raiding force would survive the war; one was killed in captivity and the fate of the other two is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Some {{countries}} have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels <b>of</b> <b>alert</b> {{of a possible}} tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far {{to the side of}} the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next best option. Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.|$|E

A public announcement was made that day as well, warning residents that the typhoon would likely strike the island. At 9:00p.m. on November10 (11:00UTC), a level two TCOR was put in place for Guam and a typhoon emergency was declared. Buildings were boarded up and emergency supplies were distributed. By 8:00a.m. (22:00UTC on November10), this was raised to level one, the highest level of warning. At this time, the USS Haverfield, USS Brister, USS Wandank, and USS Banner sought refuge from the storm over open waters. All personnel on the island were ordered to evacuate to typhoon-proof shelters and emergency rations were prepared. Strategic air command planes stationed on the island were relocated to avoid damage. Many residents on the island sought refuge in government buildings designed to withstand powerful storms while others evacuated to Wake Island.

40|$|Abstract – Protecting {{data from}} the intruders on {{internet}} or on the host systems is a very tedious task. The Intrusion Detection System is a technology for detecting suspicious actions or malicious behavior in a system from the unauthorized users or so called intruders. Alerts are produced during the intrusion activity, but when more number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> is produced then handling <b>of</b> these <b>alerts</b> becomes difficult on IDS. In this paper, we propose a layered approach for IDS where the alert information is represented dynamically {{in the form of}} layers and we propose an alert aggregation algorithm where an attack instance is created for similar type <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> produced and this is clustered to form a meta-alert which can reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> produced without losing any information. This technique has approaches like generative modeling, in this case the beginning as well as the completion of attack properties and details can be detected and it is a data stream approach, where duplicate or the alerts which are observed many number of times are processed only a few times. By applying these techniques and alert aggregation we can reduce the number <b>of</b> false <b>alert</b> rate and number <b>of</b> <b>alerts.</b> The goal <b>of</b> the project is to generate meta-alerts from the proposed alert aggregation algorithm and represent all the alert information or the intruder activity on a dynamically representing model. The alert produced and the details <b>of</b> the <b>alert</b> and the action taken are represented in the form of layers on a distinctive layered model. The details <b>of</b> the <b>alert</b> are represented using these layers and further to form a meta-alert. Meta-alerts contain all the relevant information but the amount of data can be reduced progressively. Using the data sets, it is possible to reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> produced while number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low and represent all the alert information in the form of layers on a model...|$|R

40|$|Anomaly {{detection}} {{systems are}} usually employed to monitor database activities {{in order to}} detect security incidents. These systems raise an alert when anomalous activities are detected. The raised alerts have to be analyzed to timely respond to the security incidents. Their analysis, however, is time-consuming and costly. This problem increases with the large number <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> often raised by anomaly detection systems. To timely and effectively handle security incidents, alerts should be accompanied by information which allows the understanding of incidents and their context (e. g., root causes, attack type) and their prioritization (e. g., criticality level). Unfortunately, {{the current state of}} affairs regarding the information about alerts provided by existing anomaly detection systems is not very satisfactory. This work presents an anomaly analysis framework that facilitates the analysis <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> raised by an anomaly detection system monitoring a database system. The framework provides an approach to assess the criticality <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> with respect to the disclosure of sensitive information and a feature-based classification <b>of</b> <b>alerts</b> according to their associated type of attack. The framework has been deployed as a web-based alert audit tool that provides alert classification and risk-based ranking capabilities, significantly easing the analysis <b>of</b> <b>alerts.</b> We validate the classification and ranking approaches using synthetic data generated through an existing healthcare management system.
