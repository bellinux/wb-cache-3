Additionally, these systems use a magnetic gradient field that varies in time. These gradient fields are created by means of a so-called gradient coil, in which electrical currents are used in the order of a few hundred amperes. Acoustic noise is generated due to the Lorentz forces acting upon the gradient coil and the main <b>magnet</b> <b>outer</b> vacuum chamber. The Lorentz forces on the main <b>magnet</b> <b>outer</b> vacuum chamber are generated by the eddy currents which are developed in the main <b>magnet</b> <b>outer</b> vacuum chamber {{as a result of the}} varying magnetic stray fields of the gradient coil.

This study applies an advanced design methodology combining a modified power distribution calculation and evolutionary algorithms assisted by surrogate modeling to a multi-objective design optimization for the performance optimization and characterization of the CFT. Optimization is performed for maximization of performance defined by five design parameters (i. e., anode voltage, anode current, mass flow rate, and magnet radii), simultaneously aiming to maximize three objectives; that is, thrust, efficiency and specific impulse. Statistical methods based on global sensitivity analysis are employed to assess the optimization results in conjunction with surrogate models to identify key design factors with respect to the three design objectives and additional performance measures.

40|$|Abstract: A field-modulated {{asynchronous}} {{magnetic coupling}} {{is a new}} type of composite magnetic transmission mechanism, which is based on the principles of magnetic field modulation and electromagnetic induction. The rotational velocity and direction of the inner conductor rotor could be changed, since the magnetic field generated by permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>outer</b> rotor is modulated by ferromagnetic pole-pieces. Therefore, the couplings can meet special conditions with special requirements for load and speed. The formula of the modulated magnetic flux density of inner air gap is analyzed through magnetic field analytic approaches, and then the formula of transmission ratio is also deduced by introducing slip ratio in the mean time. Finally, experimental research of the coupling is conducted. The results show that the transmission ratio of the coupling is not only related to the ratio of the number of pole pairs on <b>outer</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> rotor and the number of pole pairs of magnetic field flux density harmonic, but also related to the slip ratio. Besides, the transmission ratio of the coupling increases non-linearly with the slip ratio...|$|R

Their main function is to house the lattice two-in-one superconducting quadrupole and various correction magnets, all operating at 1. 9 K in a superfluid helium bath. The magnetic and powering schemes of the arcs {{and the fact that}} the two proton beams alternate between the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>magnet</b> channels impose 24 different combinations of magnet assemblies, all housed in an identical helium enclosure. The cryogenic architecture of the LHC machine is based on cryogenic loops spanning over one half-cell (53 m) for the 4. 6 - 20 K circuit, over a full cell (107 m) for the 1. 9 K circuits, up to the full arc (about 2. 3 km) for the shield cooling line. This cryogenic layout, when superimposed to the magnetic scheme, further complicated by the cryostat insulation vacuum sectorisation every 2 cells, creates additional assembly variants, up to a total number of 56.
