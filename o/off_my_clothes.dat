500|$|Waugh did not query his friend's judgement, {{but took}} his {{manuscript}} to the school's furnaces and unceremoniously burnt it. Immediately afterwards {{he received the}} news that the job with Scott Moncrieff had fallen through. The double blow affected Waugh severely; he wrote in his diary in July: [...] "The phrase 'the end of the tether' besets me with unshakeable persistence". In his biography Waugh writes: [...] "I went down alone to the beach with my thoughts full of death. I took <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> and began swimming out to sea. Did I really intend to drown myself? That was certainly in my mind". He left a note with his clothes, a quotation from Euripides about the sea washing away all human ills. A short way out, after being stung by jellyfish, he abandoned the attempt, turned round and swam back to the shore. He did not, however, withdraw his resignation from the school, returning instead to London.|$|E
500|$|For {{the final}} scene with Daenerys Targaryen {{emerging}} from the great fire of the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, the filming took place in two different locations, with the close ups of Emilia Clarke taking place on a closed set in Belfast, and the large-scale set shots taking place in Spain. In an interview, Clarke had previously indicated she had become reluctant to do nude scenes unless it served the plot. After the episode aired, Clarke made a point to indicate {{that it was not}} a body double in {{the final scene}} of the episode, stating, [...] "I'd like to remind people the last time I took my clothes off was season 3. That was awhile ago. It's now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I'm just feeling genuinely happy I said 'Yes.' That ain't no body double!" [...] She continued, [...] "Taking <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> is not the easiest thing, but with the magic of the effects, I don't have to do a season 1 and go on a cliff and do it, I'm in control of it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{paid for}} it. I was sick {{for a couple}} of days, meanly sick, and my arms were painfully {{poisoned}} from the barnacle scratches. For a week I could not use them, and it was a torture to put on and take <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes.</b>|$|E

60|$|I {{particularly}} mark this night, for it {{was that}} which has hurried on the last scene of my tragedy, which else might have dwindled on through long years of listless sorrow. I was very ill when I arrived and quite incapable of taking <b>off</b> <b>my</b> wet <b>clothes</b> that clung about me.

60|$|It {{was early}} morning {{when we arrived}} at the wayside station where we were to alight. From here we walked {{to the edge of the}} woods. Arrived at this point we halted.

Then, taking a pot of brown stain from my valise, I proceeded to dye my face and hands and my union suit itself a deep butternut brown.|$|E

60|$|I bade the {{reluctant}} Madame Gravois good night, gained my room, threw <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes,</b> and covered {{myself with the}} mosquito bar. There was no question of sleep, for {{the events of the}} day and surmises for the morrow tortured me as I tossed in the heat. Had the man been Gignoux? If so, he was in league with Carondelet's police. I believed him fully capable of this. And if he knew Nick's whereabouts and St. Gre's, they would both be behind the iron gateway of the calabozo in the morning. Monsieur Vigo had pointed out to me that day the gloomy, heavy-walled prison in the rear of the Cabildo,--ay, and he had spoken of its instruments of torture.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} how long we were travelling, but after the first day there was only the man who carried me, and another. I was brought here, and there were many people, and I was very much frightened. Then I found myself only among women, and they took <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> and dressed me in their fashion. I think I was very happy, when I once got {{accustomed}} to it. The ladies made a sort of pet of me, and I was taught to dance and to sing little native songs. There were other white girls here, and they were all very kind to me, though they always seemed very sad, and I could not make out why they cried so often, especially when they were beaten for crying.|$|E

So I opened my clasp-knife {{and put it in}} my mouth, and took <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> and waded in. As soon as I was in the water I lost sight of the canoe, but I aimed, as I judged, to head it off.

The afterglow of sunset was well over now and the dim of night creeping up. The stars were coming through the blue. I swum like a champion, though my legs and arms were soon aching.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{the next}} {{afternoon}} I experienced my first pleasure. The thieves caught me, stripped <b>off</b> all <b>my</b> fine <b>clothes</b> and jewels and beat me well.

60|$|How {{was this}} vile nervous fit, for such I now persuaded myself it was, to be conquered? I {{determined}} to force myself {{not to look}} at the painting but to undress quickly and get into bed. I began to undress, but in spite of every effort I could not keep myself from stealing a glance every now and then at the picture; and a glance was now sufficient to distress me. Even when my back was turned to it, the idea of this strange face behind me, peering over my shoulder, was insufferable. I threw <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> and hurried into bed; but still this visage gazed upon me. I had a full view of it from my bed, and for some time could not take my eyes from it. I had grown nervous to a dismal degree.|$|E
60|$|Glad and {{grateful}} at having escaped with unbroken bones {{from such a}} dangerous accident, I set out walking {{along the edge of}} the ravine, which soon broadened to a valley running between two steep hills; and then, seeing water at the bottom and feeling very dry, I ran down the slope to get a drink. Lying flat on my chest to slake my thirst animal fashion, I was amazed at the reflection the water gave back of my face: it was, skin and hair, thickly encrusted with clay and rootlets! Having taken a long drink, I threw <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> to have a bath; and after splashing about for half an hour managed to rid my skin of its accumulations of dirt. While drying in the wind I shook the loose sand and clay from my garments, then dressed, and, feeling greatly refreshed, proceeded on my walk.|$|E
60|$|And when I write thus of our selves I mean {{our bodies}} {{quite as much}} as our imaginations; {{the two sides of}} us are covered up alike and put alike into disguises and unnatural shapes, we are taught and forced to hide them for the same reasons, from a fear of {{ourselves}} and a fear of the people about us. The sense of beauty, the sense of one's body, the freedom of thought and of desire and the wonder of life, are all interwoven strands. I remember that in the Park of Burnmore one great craving I had was to take <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> there altogether, and bathe in a clear place among loosestrife and meadowsweet, and afterwards lie wet and naked upon the soft green turf with the sun shining upon me. But I thought also that that was a very wicked and shameful craving to have, and I never dared give way to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't {{thinking}} {{of such a}} thing," [...] said Mr. Dix, hastily; [...] "twenty strokes is about <b>my</b> mark--with <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>off.</b> <b>My</b> idea was to pull you out." ...|$|R
6000|$|This duty performed, I {{started to}} walk across the bridge over the Susquehanna to the west shore. I forget {{the name of the}} {{railroad}} that ran down that side, but while lying in the grass in the morning the idea had come to me to go to Baltimore; so to Baltimore I was going on that railroad, whatever its name was. It was a warm afternoon, and part way across the bridge I came to a lot of fellows who were in swimming off one of the piers. <b>Off</b> went <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> and in went I. The water was fine; but when I came out and dressed, I found I had been robbed. Some one had gone through <b>my</b> <b>clothes.</b> Now I leave it to you if being robbed isn't in itself adventure enough for one day. I have known men who have been robbed and who have talked all {{the rest of their lives}} about it. True, the thief that went through <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> didn't get much--some thirty or forty cents in nickels and pennies, and my tobacco and cigarette papers; but it was all I had, which is more than most men can be robbed of, for they have something left at home, while I had no home. It was a pretty tough gang in swimming there. I sized up, and knew better than to squeal. So I begged [...] "the makings," [...] and I could have sworn it was one of my own papers I rolled the tobacco in.|$|R
60|$|I was tired. The thin, sweet air of spring, wafted in at {{my window}} after the {{precocious}} {{heat of the}} day, breathed a faint, reviving fragrance. A curious excitement was in me. Yet her words, or perhaps the tone of her voice, coloured my fancy with vague forebodings. I pushed aside <b>my</b> supper, slipped <b>off</b> <b>my</b> fine visiting <b>clothes,</b> and put on my dressing-gown. With lights extinguished, I drew the blind, and strove {{for a while to}} puzzle out life's riddle for myself. Not for the first or the last time did wandering wits cheat me of the goal, for presently in the quiet out of my thoughts, stole into my imagination the vision of that dreaming head my eyes had sheltered on.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It {{happened}} that, as I {{was watching}} {{some of the}} little people bathing in a shallow, {{one of them was}} seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedly slipped <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes,</b> and, wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you may guess, I {{was on the}} top of the berg at daybreak, and saw we {{had drifted}} into a big bay, and had {{grounded}} about midway. The cliffs in most places rose sheer up out of the water, but here and there there were breaks, and I could see that the land beyond was rough and desolate-looking. I ate my last half-biscuit, and then made my way down to the water's edge. The shore seemed to me about half a mile away--a longish swim in cold water; but I was a good swimmer, and the sea between the berg and the land was as smooth as a pond. I took <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes,</b> put them in the middle of my oil-skin and wrapped it round them, tying one of my stockings round the neck of the bag to keep it all together. I had bought the oil-skin just before I started on that voyage, and knew that it would keep out the water tidy. I could not get down nearer than twenty feet of the sea, so I dropped the bag in and then jumped.|$|E
60|$|For {{the rest}} of the night I was only out once, when I succeeded in {{reaching}} the hen-house and brought all my fowls safely to the kitchen, except a hen which would not rise off her young. Between us we had the kitchen floor, a pool of water; and the rain had put out my fires already, as effectually as if it had been an overturned broth-pot. That I never took <b>off</b> <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> that night I need not say, though of what was happening in the glen I could only guess. A flutter against my window now and again, when the rain had abated, told me of another bird that had flown there to die; and with Waster Lunny, I kept up communication by waving a light, to which he replied in a similar manner. Before morning, however, he ceased to answer my signals, and I feared some catastrophe had occurred at the farm. As it turned out, the family was fighting with the flood for the year's shearing of wool, half of which eventually went down the waters, with the wool-shed on top of it.|$|E

5000|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. At the musical cue, [...] "they stood naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. They chanted of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into <b>my</b> bathroom, took <b>off</b> all <b>my</b> <b>clothes,</b> and looked at myself in the full-length mirror.

60|$|The Indian now {{got along}} {{much faster than}} we, and waited for us from time to time. I found here the only cool spring that I drank at {{anywhere}} on this excursion, a little water filling a hollow in the sandy bank. It was a quite memorable event, and due to the elevation of the country, for wherever else we had been {{the water in the}} rivers and the streams emptying in was dead and warm, compared with that of a mountainous region. It was very bad walking along the shore over fallen and drifted trees and bushes, and rocks, from time to time swinging ourselves round over the water, or else taking to a gravel bar or going inland. At one place, the Indian being ahead, I was obliged to take <b>off</b> all <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> in order to ford a small but deep stream emptying in, while my companion, who was inland, found a rude bridge, high up in the woods, and I saw no more of him for some time. I saw there very fresh moose tracks, and I passed one white pine log, lodged in the forest {{near the edge of the}} stream, which was quite five feet in diameter at the butt.|$|R
