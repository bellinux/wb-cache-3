50|$|Surfactants reduce {{oil-water}} interfacial tension, {{which helps}} waves break oil into small droplets. A mixture {{of oil and}} water is normally unstable, but can be stabilized {{with the addition of}} surfactants; these surfactants can prevent coalescence of dispersed oil droplets. The effectiveness of the dispersant depends on the weathering of the <b>oil,</b> <b>sea</b> energy (waves), salinity of the water, temperature and the type of oil. Dispersion is unlikely to occur if the oil spreads into a thin layer, because the dispersant requires a particular thickness to work; otherwise, the dispersant will interact with both the water and the oil. More dispersant may be required if the sea energy is low. The salinity of the water is more important for ionic-surfactant dispersants, as salt screens electrostatic interactions between molecules. The viscosity of the oil is another important factor; viscosity can retard dispersant migration to the oil-water interface and also increase the energy required to shear a drop from the slick. Viscosities below 2,000 centipoise are optimal for dispersants. If the viscosity is above 10,000 centipoise, no dispersion is possible.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHypothetical {{cases of}} oil spills, caused by ship {{failure in the}} {{northern}} Adriatic, are analysed {{with the aim of}} producing three-dimensional models of sea circulation and oil contaminant transport. Sea surface elevations, sea temperature and salinity fields are applied as a forcing argument on the model’s open boundaries. The Aladin-HR model with a spatial resolution of 8 km and a time interval of 3 hours is used for atmospheric forcing. River discharges along the coastline in question are introduced as point source terms and are assumed to have zero salinity at their respective locations. The results of the numerical modelling of physical oceanography parameters are validated by measurements carried out in the ‘Adriatic Sea monitoring programme’ in a series of current meter and CTD stations in the period from 1 January 2008 to 15 November 2008. The oil spill model uses the current field obtained from a circulation model. Besides the convective dispersive transport of oil pollution (Lagrangian model of discrete particles), the model takes into account a number of reactive processes such as emulsification, dissolution, evaporation and heat balance between the <b>oil,</b> <b>sea</b> and atmosphere. An actual event took place on 6 February 2008, when the ship ‘Und Adriyatik’ caught fire {{in the vicinity of the}} town of Rovinj (Croatia) en route from Istanbul (Turkey) to Trieste (Italy). At the time the fire broke out, the ship was carrying around 800 tons of oil. Thanks to the rapid intervention of the fire department, the fire was extinguished during the following 12 hours, preventing possible catastrophic environmental consequences. Based on this occurrence, five hypothetical scenarios of ship failure with a consequent spill of 800 tons of oil over 12 hours were analysed. The main distinction between the simulated scenarios is the time of the start of the oil spill, corresponding to the times when stronger winds were blowing (> 7 ms− 1) with a minimum duration of 24 h within the timeframe. Each scenario includes a simulation of oil transport for a period of two months after the beginning of the oil spill. The results show that the coastal belt between the towns of Poreč and Rovinj is seriously exposed to an oil pollution load, especially a few days after a strong and persistent bora (NE wind) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master in Disaster Management, 2006. Cataloged from PDF version of Dissertation. Includes bibliographical references (page 132 - 134). The natural disasters have been regularly taking toll on {{the people and the}} resources of Bangladesh. Natural disaster causes inexpressible damage to lives, properties, livestock, life support systems and infrastructures. The coast of Bangladesh is known as a zone of multiple vulnerabilities as well as opportunities. It is prone to severe natural disasters such as cyclones, storm surges, floods, erosion, soil salinity etc. In combination with other natural hazards various forms of man made pollution made the coastal dwellers very vulnerable and ultimately slowed down their socio-economic development. This study will seek to analyze the vulnerabilities and risk of coastal water and suggest adopting appropriate measures for mitigation and management of coastal environmental pollution to the extent of generating environmental awareness among people. The coastal region gets polluted as the pollutants are carried through different rivers and canals to the sea. Water channels are used for dumping industrial wastes that ultimately end up in the sea. There is no facility for waste treatment in densely populated urban areas. As a result, water pollution is increasing. About three thousand ships including oil tankers come to our ports every year. There are several thousand mechanized trawlers and boats that spill <b>oil.</b> <b>Sea</b> is also polluted by oil spill because of accidents in ships. The authority fails to check pollution as they have no receiving or collecting vessels to face the emergency situation during oil spillage. Even our Port Authority has no laboratory to measure the extent of the pollution. Foreign and local ships find the Chittagong Port and its outer anchorage a safe dumping area for their waste, taking advantage of poor laws and their lax implementation due to logistic support. The authority fails to take action against the ships as they flee very quickly after dumping waste in the sea. Besides, ship¬breaking industry is located in Chittagong. Incidents like dumping of wastes into the sea by foreign vessels are also happening. A number of industries namely fertilizers, cement, pulp and paper, food processing, pharmaceuticals, metal, textile, chemical, petroleum and lubricant plants, etc, discharge heavy metals into the coastal water. The use of antibiotics and other chemicals used in shrimp fields is causing pollution in the water, which may harm other aquatic lives. Plastic bottles and other plastic products are most common forms of litter in the coastal water. The rapid and unplanned increase in shrimp culture is also becoming a concern. Shrimp culture in Cox's Bazar uses 620 tons of urea annually. It also generates 15 tons of waste daily, which comes into sea. The government has already signed a number of international treaties and conventions to check environmental degradation. Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) activities in Bangladesh were initiated first in the year 1999; thereafter on 17 January 2005 the Coastal Zone Policy has been approved by the Government. This ICZM policy would be followed by its implementing strategy. The proper implementation of this strategy would lead the Coastal Zone Management in a sustainable way. Under the objectives of the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (ICZM project), Priority Investment Programs (PIP) are being developed as the operational arms of this strategy. It is possible to address the pollution in the coast through development of partnerships. Pollution in the coast may not be arrested in short term approaches, like experiences from other countries showed that {{it is a matter of}} time. Long term vision would be considered in designing the PIP, where the pollution issues to be addressed and its severity would be minimized. Priority actions may include in district development plan as a basis to start a long term investment program to limit the pollution level in the coast. Mohammad Mizanur RahmanM.

40|$|Basic {{piece of}} {{knowledge}} about nutrition and its need should be integral to every mans general knowledge. One of the vital nutritions ensuring a full-functioning organism are vitamins. Vitamins are essential ingredients, which {{play an important role}} in the human body and also in the processes of absorption and the exchange of substances between the external environment and living organism. They were discovered recently during the 20 th century. The researches on their effects on the human body are still ongoing. The vitamins are divided into two basic groups, water soluble vitamins, the so called hydrophilic (vitamins B and C), and fat soluble vitamins, the so called lipophilic (vitamins A, D, E and K). The vitamin A is important to ensure good vision and recognizing colors. It support the quality and growth of bones, affects the egg and sperm and is needed for proper fetal development. Vitamin A is found in foods of animal origin, such as dairy products, milk, meat and liver. In the food of plant origin, the vitamin A is replaced with many provitamins, of which most important is the beta carotene. A very rich source of these provitamins are leafy greens such as spinach or cabbage. The recommended daily intake of vitamin A is 800 microgram, according to the standards of Czech republic. This need depends on the gender and age of each individual. The lack of vitamins A causes photophobia and impaired vision. The excess of vitamin A may be toxic for the organism. The interesting fact is that the beta carotene is not considered to be toxic. Vitamin A is one of the labile vitamins. It is sensitive to heat, light and oxygen. At a gentle meal preparation and usual diet, the losses are around 20 %. The vitamin D is consisted of group of several biologically active substances, of which the most important are vitamin D 2, ergokalciferol, to be found in foods of plant origin, and vitamin D 3, cholekalciferol, to be found in foods of animal origin. In the human body, vitamin D acts as a hormone, it is formed at one point of the organism, but affects a different part of the body. The vitamin D ensures the intake and absorption of calcium and phosphorus and maintain their balance. It supports the immune system and may help in the psoriasis treatment. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D is about 2, 5 to 10 microgram. Pregnant and lactating women have a greater need for it, as well as infants and children. The lack of vitamin D disturbs the homeostasis of calcium and phosphate metabolism. The excess of vitamin D causes hypercalcaemia. The most important foods source of vitamin D are liver, oil from fish liver, <b>oil</b> <b>sea</b> fish, fortified margarine and milk. Vitamin D is sensitive to oxygen and light, its activity is not significantly affected by food storage or preparation. Vitamin E is a major antioxidant. It is important to maintain the healthy cell wall and skin, muscles, nerves, erythrocytes, heart, and it is also responsible for the proper function of blood circulation. The recommended daily intake of vitamin E is 8 to 20 mg. Its need is increased during exposure to sunlight and harmful influences, during increased physical exertion and when receiving large amounts of unsaturated fatty acids. The lack of vitamin E almost does not occur in healthy people, since it is present in nearly all basic kind of foods. The hypervitaminosis of vitamin E occurs only rarely, because there is no risk of overdose when receiving a normal diet. The most important foods source of vitamin E are vegetal oils (such as sunflower and rapeseed), nuts, corn, pea, corn products, dark green leaf vegetables, eggs, liver and viscera. Vitamin E is considered the most stable lipophilic vitamin. There is only a minimal loss of tocopherol during food processing, these losses are approximately 10 %. The vitamin K supports blood clotting in the human body and, along with the vitamin D, is involved in the constant bone development and remodeling. Both foods of plant and animal origin are sources of vitamin K, such as meat, liver, milk, vegetables and fruit. The recommended daily intake of vitamin K is around 0, 01 to 0, 14 mg. The infants and children up to three years have lower need of vitamin K intake. The most common cause of vitamin K hypovitaminosis is disruption of intestinal microflora caused by various drugs, e. g. antibiotics. Too high doses of vitamin K can accumulate in the body and lead to the breakdown of erythrocytes, damage the liver and cause jaundice in children. There is not much information known about the stability of vitamin K yet. It has been found that vitamin K decomposes rapidly in the light, however its losses during food processing are minimal...|$|E

We first discuss measurements of the Earth gravity field at different spatial scales and the recovery of seafloor topography from satellite altimetry. We briefly mention precise positioning results based on GPS and other space techniques, and applications to tectonic motions and crustal deformations. Next we discuss recent advances in ocean dynamics based on high-precision satellite altimetry missions, and focus <b>oil</b> <b>sea</b> level rise. We also discuss how remote sensing techniques, including space gravimetry, inform oil the mass balance of the ice sheets and corresponding contribution to sea level rise. As a final example, we report on the monitoring of surface water levels (lakes, rivers, floodplains) by satellite altimetry and oil total laud water storage change at river basin scale, using space gravimetry observations...|$|E
