25|$|Wild Seed is {{a science}} fiction novel by American writer Octavia Butler. Although {{published}} in 1980 as the fourth book of the Patternist series, it is the earliest book in the chronology of the Patternist world. The other books in the series are, in order within the Patternist chronology: Mind <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> (1977), Clay's Ark (1984), Survivor (1978), and Patternmaster (1976).|$|E
25|$|Next came Mind <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> (1977), a prequel to Patternmaster set in {{the twentieth}} century. The story follows the {{development}} of Mary, {{the creator of the}} psionic chain and the first Patternmaster to bind all Patternists, and her inevitable struggle for power with her father Doro, a parapsychological vampire who seeks to retain control over the psionic children he has bred over the centuries.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} five years, Butler worked on the series of novels that later {{become known as the}} Patternist series: Patternmaster (1976), Mind <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> (1977), and Survivor (1978). In 1978, she was finally able to stop working at {{temporary}} jobs and live on her writing. She took a break from the Patternist series to research and write Kindred (1979), and then finished the series with Wild Seed (1980) and Clay's Ark (1984).|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{across a}} variety of media, Richard {{explored}} social responsibility for businesses in the 21st Century. This led to keynote addresses at national conferences and the essay collection Out <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> (Penguin). He also published his memoir Hippie Hippie Shake, which has been adapted as a film by Working Title. The film was not released for unknown reasons. Neville had sent the manuscript of his autobiography for Greer to check but she did not read it. When the book was published, however, she took offence.|$|E
25|$|I {{have written}} this letter {{to you on}} a happy day to me, {{which is also the}} last day of my life. For I have been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And I beg you {{to take care of the}} children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man to me, and to philosophy.|$|E

25|$|After the songwriting trio Holland–Dozier–Holland {{left the}} label in 1967 over royalty-payment disputes, Norman Whitfield became the company's top producer, turning out hits for The Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight & the Pips and Rare Earth. In the {{meantime}} Berry Gordy established Motown Productions, a television subsidiary which produced TV specials for the Motown artists, including TCB, with Diana Ross & the Supremes and the Temptations, Diana! with Diana Ross, and Goin' Back to Indiana with the Jackson 5. The company loosened its production rules, allowing {{some of its}} longtime artists the opportunity to write and produce more of their own material. This resulted in the recordings of successful and critically acclaimed albums such as Marvin Gaye's What's Going On (1971) and Let's Get it On (1973), and Stevie Wonder's Music <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> (1972), Talking Book (1972), and Innervisions (1973).|$|E
25|$|Although {{generally}} {{associated with}} the West Coast with individuals and groups such as Blue Scholars and Native Guns, Filipino American hip hop is increasingly represented by emcees in other regions, from East Coast performers such as Q-York hailing from Queens, New York, (currently residing in the Philippines) to Midwestern groups such as Chicago's The Pacifics. Maryland's Gagong Rapper crew gained fame in the early 2000s by flooding the internet with their home-recordings and heading the underground sub-label Sandamukal Records. L.A.'s Grupo ni Berdugo and Sunog Baga, under F.O.B Entertainment, has recently been making names for themselves, the latter being signed by Andrew E's Dongalo Wreckordz and opening up for Gloc-9's L.A. show. Hailing from San Jose, California, Yung Rizzo of Fly High Records, {{is one of the}} hottest up and coming rappers from his region. Currently he is working on projects that include singles featuring mainstream artists The Jacka from Mob Figaz and Mistah F.A.B., as well as his first studio album, Back <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> which is planned for release in 2014.|$|E

500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained in the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman wrote [...] "The Way We Were" [...] while Marty Paich handled its production. In particular, {{the lyrics}} detail the {{personal}} life of Katie Morosky, the character she portrays in the film. Specifically, her troubling relationship with Robert Redford's Hubbell Gardiner is explained, [...] "Memories light the corners <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> / Misty watercolor {{memories of the}} way we were" [...] and [...] "Memories may be beautiful and yet". Streisand sings, [...] "What's too painful to remember / We quickly choose to forget", where she longs for nostalgia, which Rolling Stones Stephen Holden described as an implication that [...] "resonate in the current social malaise". In the beginning of {{what seems to be a}} bridge, she whispers, [...] "If we had the chance to do it all again / Tell me would we? Could we?".|$|E
500|$|On July 1, 1951, Feller {{recorded}} his third career no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. [...] "I was depending on my slider and I didn't {{begin to think}} of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I tried to keep it in the back <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at a time", Feller said. Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters. He became the first pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout against the Washington Senators on August 21. Along with Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 1931. Feller was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year.|$|E

500|$|In 1976, {{speaking}} as The Thin White Duke, Bowie's persona at the time, and [...] "at least partially tongue-in-cheek", he made statements that {{expressed support for}} fascism and perceived admiration for Adolf Hitler in interviews with Playboy, NME and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: [...] "Britain is ready for a fascist leader... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership." [...] He was also quoted as saying: [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of the}} first rock stars" [...] and [...] "You've got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up." [...] Bowie later retracted these comments in an interview with Melody Maker in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems at the time, saying: [...] "I was out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> totally, completely crazed." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1921 Grainger {{moved with}} his mother to a large house in White Plains, New York. This was [...] his [...] home for the {{remainder}} of his life. From the beginning of 1922 Rose's health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from [...] delusions and nightmares, and became [...] fearful that her illness would harm her son's career. Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there had long been [...] rumours that [...] their relationship was incestuous; [...] in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough. From her last letter to Grainger, dated 29 April, it seems that this confrontation unbalanced Rose; on 30 April, while Grainger was touring on the West Coast, she jumped to her death from an office window [...] on the 18th floor of the Aeolian Building in New York City. The letter, which began [...] "I am out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> and cannot think properly", asked Grainger if he had ever spoken to Lotta of [...] "improper love". She signed the letter: [...] "Your poor insane mother".|$|E
500|$|Anne Carroll Moore, then {{in charge}} of the children's section at the New York Public Library, wrote an {{enthusiastic}} review in the Atlantic Monthly and invited Geisel to speak at the library. In her review she called the book [...] "so completely spontaneous that the American child can take it to his heart on sight", and [...] "as original in conception, as spontaneous in the rendering as it is true to the imagination of a small boy." [...] Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author Beatrix Potter, who wrote back, [...] "What an amusing picture book... I think it the cleverest book I have met with for many years. The swing and merriment of the pictures and the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions—and then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away. Dr. Seuss does it thoroughly!" [...] Geisel himself was later critical of the book, saying on its 25th anniversary, [...] "I think I was a little aloof, too outside there. It was written {{from the point of view}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> not the mind of a child." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
500|$|Monáe {{has noted}} that the album's musical {{influences}} encompass [...] "all the things I love, scores for films like Goldfinger mixed with albums like Stevie Wonder’s Music <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mind</b> and David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust, along with experimental hip hop influences from albums such as Outkast’s Stankonia". Huw Jones of Slant Magazine described her sound as [...] "a unique gray area between neo-soul, funk, and art-rock". Music writer Greg Kot noted that the album [...] "touches on" [...] musical genres such as funk, hip hop, folk, electro-pop, glam rock, big-band jazz, rock and classical music. Conceptually, Kot described the album as [...] "a self-empowerment manifesto couched inside a futuristic 'emotion-picture' about an android’s battle to overcome oppression. The notion of space travel and 'new worlds' becomes a metaphor for breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types – a theme that {{has a long tradition}} in African-American music, from Sun Ra and Parliament-Funkadelic to Cannibal Ox and OutKast". The Atlantics Brentin Mock called The ArchAndroid [...] "unique, forward-looking, and apoplectic... something of a jitterbug between Prince's 1986 movie Under the Cherry Moon and the 1977 Watts movie Killer of Sheep, and Daughters of the Dust". Seth Colter Walls of Newsweek described the album as [...] "rocking in parts like Dirty Mind–era Prince, unfolding in a suite form that recalls Abbey Roads side two, and bumping throughout with the best innovations of contemporary hip-hop".|$|E
