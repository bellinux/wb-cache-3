Because the efficiency of distributed file system has much effect on cloud storage The metadata <b>operation</b> <b>accounts</b> for more than 50 % of the total file operation. So the strategy of efficient metadata management is important. There are three parts in this paper. We start with a brief introduction of cloud storage. Then a metadata caching algorithm for cloud storage is proposed. An additional discussion of its performance is also provided. The prototype which incorporates the proposed metadata caching algorithm is realized on Luster to evaluate its performance. Comparing experimental results from this study conclude that the metadata caching subsystem can improve the performance of cloud storage...|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} some word order {{phenomena}} in Romanian and Sardinian {{are the result}} of a checking operation in the left periphery involving verum focus (i. e. focus on the polarity component of the sentence). In particular, this <b>operation</b> <b>accounts</b> for some word order patterns found in polar questions. In Romanian, polarity fronting is realized as head-movement of (V+) T to a higher peripheral head which bears a Focus-probe. This licenses VS orders for predications in which VS is not allowed as a neutral order (i-level predicates, iteratives, generics). In Sardinian, an entire phrase headed by the lexical predicate (verbal non-finite form or non-verbal predicate) is fronted before the auxiliary. We argue that this order is obtained by two movement operations, head-raising of Aux to Foc and movement of the predicate phrase to SpecFoc. We also present the semantics of polarity focus, distinguishing several types of focus (informational, emphatic, contrastive) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{generalized}} energy model of complex cells to describe modulatory contextual {{influences on the}} responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V 1). Many orientationselective cells in V 1 respond to contrast of orientation and motion of stimuli exciting the classical receptive field (CRF) and the non-CRF, or surround. In the proposed model, a central spatiotemporal filter, defining the CRF, is nonlinearly combined with a spatiotemporal filter extending into the non- CRF. These filters are assumed to describe simple-cell responses, while the nonlinear combination of their responses describes the responses of complex cells. This mathematical <b>operation</b> <b>accounts</b> for the inherent nonlinearity of complex cells, such as phase independence and frequency doubling, and for nonlinear interactions between stimuli in the CRF and surround of the cell, including sensitivity to feature contrast. If only the CRF of the generalized complex cell is stimulated by a drifting grating, the model reduces to the standard energy model.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [87]- 88). Inspection {{is one of}} {{the primary}} concerns in manufacturing industry. When the dimensional tolerance requirements of manufactured parts are tighter, inspection planning and execution becomes very important The inspection <b>operation</b> <b>accounts</b> for a fairly large portion of the manufacturing lead time of finished parts as well. In recent years, the coordinate measuring machines are widely used in industry to improve efficiency in inspection operation. For inspection planning, the strategy for measuring the dimensions of a part can be determined by considering the features that constitute a part In this research, an architecture for an automated inspection planning system with a feature-based representation is designed for automated inspection using coordinate measuring machines. A part is represented using a destructive solid geometry (DSG) tree structure with primitive geometric features. In the architecture, inspection primitives and datum planes are identified using the DSG data. It also includes a structure for generating necessary tolerance measures for a part The inspection plan for a given part is then generated by an expert system module. The generated inspection plan was demonstrated on a coordinate measuring machine for two test parts. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Modern {{techniques}} can yield the ordering and strandedness of genes on each chromosome of a genome; such data already exists {{for hundreds of}} organisms. The evolutionary mechanisms through which {{the set of the}} genes of an organism is altered and reordered are of great interest to systematists, evolutionary biologists, comparative genomicists and biomedical researchers. Perhaps the most basic concept in this area is that of evolutionary distance between two genomes: under a given model of genomic evolution, how many events most likely took place to account for {{the difference between the two}} genomes? Results: We present a method to estimate the true evolutionary distance between two genomes under the ‘double-cut-and-join' (DCJ) model of genome rearrangement, a model under which a single multichromosomal <b>operation</b> <b>accounts</b> for all genomic rearrangement events: inversion, transposition, translocation, block interchange and chromosomal fusion and fission. Our method relies on a simple structural characterization of a genome pair and is both analytically and computationally tractable. We provide analytical results to describe the asymptotic behavior of genomes under the DCJ model, as well as experimental results on a wide variety of genome structures to exemplify the very high accuracy (and low variance) of our estimator. Our results provide a tool for accurate phylogenetic reconstruction from multichromosomal gene rearrangement data as well as a theoretical basis for refinements of the DCJ model to account for biological constraints.

40|$|A {{net-zero}} energy {{office building}} with Building-integrated photovoltaics (BiPV), a heat pump with cooling functionality and TABS as a heat distribution system is simulated in dynamic thermohydraulic simulations in Dymola. The {{focus of the}} evaluation is the electricity exchange with the grid. The temporal mismatch between local electricity production and electricity consumption is evaluated using established indicators such as the autonomy and self-consumption. Moreover, it is analyzed during which times electricity is consumed from the grid, and how high the fraction of Wind and PV in the energy mix is {{during the time of}} consumption. The latter is quantitatively expressed using the Grid Support Coefficients GSCabs and GSCrel proposed by the authors. HVAC <b>operation</b> <b>accounts</b> for roughly 43 % of the total electricity consumption of the considered building. With a conventional HVAC control concept based on heating and cooling curves, an annual autonomy rate of 42 % and a self-consumption rate of 43 % are achieved. In an alternative control scheme, the trajectory of heat and cold delivery to the zones is altered such that the self-consumption of the locally produced electricity is maximized. The remaining electricity demand for HVAC operation, which has to be covered from the public grid, is shifted to times of a high availability of Wind and PV power in the energy system. With this energy management scheme, the autonomy and the selfconsumption rate are increased to 50 % and 53 %, respectively. The fraction of Renewables in the electricity consumed from the public grid is increased by 15 % (relative). Thermal comfort in the offices is only moderately affected by the shifting of the heating and cooling loads...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Environmental {{impact of}} the coal-fired, {{electrical}} power industry has led to increased regulatory requirements. For the industry to remain relevant, it is paramount that it maintains a trajectory of progress towards higher efficiencies and cleaner emissions. Research and development might lead to new technologies, but in the meantime, improvement of existing technology must also be a focus. One method being pursued for this is a benchmark study which can identify best practices and areas where performance might be improved. Over the last decade, the Council of Industrial Boiler Owners and certain faculty at West Virginia University have worked together to collect survey data from atmospheric fluidized bed combustion boiler industry members. However, this accounts for {{only a small portion}} of the total coal-fired, electrical power industry (~ 2 %). On the other hand, stoker/pulverized coal boiler <b>operation</b> <b>accounts</b> for most of the industry production (~ 92 %). This report gives the data gathered from stoker/pulverized coal industry members for the operational year 2012. From the applied survey methods, the resulting data pool was small due to a small number of respondents. In the future it is important that the number of survey respondents increases to better reflect the industry and allow more successful benchmarking of the industry. For this initial effort, comparisons are made against recent fluidized bed combustion data to show that, for the given survey responses, stoker/pulverized coal boilers operated at a lower average calcium/sulfur ratio, higher average efficiency, and on average, required more non-management staff per gross MW. This study and comparison serves to provide a good starting point for efforts in benchmarking the stoker/pulverized coal industry...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: {{aortic valve}} {{replacement}} (AVR) {{the most common}} heart valve <b>operation,</b> <b>accounts</b> {{for a majority of}} all valve surgery performed in the elderly. The Perceval S (P) is a new aortic valve which is implanted without suturing, which causes a significant reduction in cross-clamping times (CCTs), and makes valve implantation easier and faster thanks to its collapsed profile. These features potentially allow the pool of operable patients to be expanded, even with minimally invasive surgery in isolated AVRs. AIM: to predict costs and outcomes of AVR procedures associated with this new valve in 4 European countries (Italy, France, Germany, and UK), as compared to traditional (T) valve implants, from the cost perspective of the hospital. METHOD: a probabilistic, patient-level simulation model was fully coded in WinBugs, permitting a seamless integration of parameter estimation and outcomes prediction, which was entirely based on the associated CCTs and on the surgical technique (mini-invasive [MiS] vs. full sternotomy [FS]), through published correlations. Unit cost were retrieved from official and literature sources for all countries. Besides the incorporated probabilistic sensitivity analysis, a series of deterministic sensitivity analyses was performed. RESULTS: the model predicts the use of the Perceval S valve to be associated with less complications and with savings (valve cost excluded), mainly related to a reduction in surgery costs and ICU/hospital bed days. These savings range from € 3, 600 (Italy) to £ 3, 900 (UK) for PFS in isolated AVRs and from about € 6, 000 (Italy) to £ 6, 700 (UK) for PMiS in isolated AVRs, and for PFS in concomitants. Extensive sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of such findings. CONCLUSIONS: {{the results of the present}} analysis indicate that the hospital acquisition cost difference between the new sutureless Perceval S valve and traditional valves is offset by important savings in other cost items. </p...|$|E

Approved for public release; distribution is unlimitedThere is a great interest in the strength of fillet welds because the welding <b>operation</b> <b>accounts</b> for about 30 % of the labor cost in planning and constructing ship hulls. One way to reduce welding cost is to reduce the required weld size. Background information is obtained by reviewing the major experimental and theoretical work in the areas of static strength, fatigue strength, and shear strength of fillet welds. In order to appreciate the conditions in the real world, design considerations, fabrication considerations, and corrosion considerations are discussed. Typical joints from existing U. S. Navy ships are employed to obtain detailed geometry and local loading information to be used as input for a computer model which was developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology which uses the finite element method for determining the static strength for fillet welds. In one particular joint a reduction of 30 % in the required weld size is justified. A future system for analyzing fillet weld strength is proposed and explained by the use of an example, The economics of intermittent and continuous welds are examined, and the economic impact that a reduction in the required fillet weld size would have on ship construction cost is estimated.

40|$|Smart building, which {{delivers}} useful {{services to}} residents at lowest cost and maximum comfort, has {{gained increasing attention}} in recent years. A variety of emerging information technologies have been adopted in modern buildings, such as wireless sensor networks, internet of things, big data analytics, deep machine learning, etc. Most people agree that a smart building should be energy efficient, and consequently, much more affordable to building owners. Building <b>operation</b> <b>accounts</b> for major portion of energy consumption in the United States. HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) equipment is a particularly expensive and energy consuming of building operation. As a result, the concept of “demand-driven HVAC control” is currently a growing research topic for smart buildings. In this work, we investigated the issue of building occupancy estimation by using a wireless CO 2 sensor network. The concentration level of indoor CO 2 is a good indicator {{of the number of}} room occupants, while protecting the personal privacy of building residents. Once indoor CO 2 level is observed, HVAC equipment is aware of the number of room occupants. HVAC equipment can adjust its operation parameters to fit demands of these occupants. Thus, the desired quality of service is guaranteed with minimum energy dissipation. Excessive running of HVAC fans or pumps will be eliminated to conserve energy. Hence, the energy efficiency of smart building is improved significantly and the building operation becomes more intelligent. The wireless sensor network was selected for this study, because it is tiny, cost effective, non-intrusive, easy to install and flexible to configure. In this work, we integrated CO 2 and light senors with a wireless sensor platform from Texas Instruments. Compare with existing occupancy detection methods, our proposed hybrid scheme achieves higher accuracy, while keeping low cost and non-intrusiveness. Experimental results in an office environment show full functionality and validate benefits. This study paves the way for future research, where a wireless CO 2 sensor network is connected with HVAC systems to realize fine-grained, energy efficient smart building...|$|E
