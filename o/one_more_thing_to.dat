5|$|In {{contrast}} to his regular season, Ginóbili became {{an integral part of}} Gregg Popovich's rotational set up in the playoffs, playing in every game. The Spurs eliminated Phoenix and Los Angeles and in those games his scoring threat took opponents by surprise, giving them <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> cope with against the now highly favored Spurs. He helped guide them past the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals and then the New Jersey Nets in the Finals, securing San Antonio's second championship. After the win, Ginóbili won his first Olimpia de Oro ("Golden Olympia") as Argentina's sportsperson of the year, and met Argentine president Néstor Kirchner. A gym in Bahía Blanca was dedicated in Ginóbili's honor as well.|$|E

60|$|Now I {{have but}} <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> tell of my stay in Tobasco, {{and then let}} me on to Mexico, and to the tale of how Montezuma's {{daughter}} became my wife, and of my further dealings with de Garcia.|$|E
60|$|Captain. I {{have but}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> hint.--The world {{say you will}} run {{yourself}} out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} glad {{to believe that it}} was within my power to do so. I have not John's great fortune, but I have money, the {{accumulated}} savings of a lifetime, for which I have no better purpose. There is <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing,</b> too, <b>to</b> be said." ...|$|R
60|$|There was <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do, {{and he did}} it. He {{wrote to}} Campbell a short note.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> ask," [...] she said. [...] "Since {{my husband}} must die, suffer that I die with him. Will you refuse this also, and cause {{the cup of}} your crimes to flow over, and the last angel of God's mercy to flee away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Eh bien, vicomte,” {{says the}} young prince, {{who was a}} boy, and a French boy, “il ne nous reste qu’une chose à faire:” he placed his sword upon the table, and {{the fingers of his}} two hands upon his breast:—“We have <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do,” says he; “you do not divine it?” He {{stretched}} out his arms:—“Embrassons nous!” ...|$|E

6000|$|Again, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> is <b>to</b> be {{observed}} from these words, Let him 'testify to them, LEST THEY ALSO COME INTO THIS PLACE OF TORMENT.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She has <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> say,' added Honor. 'Do {{you think}} that {{throwing}} aside Phoebe's little services will make you fitter to go among the little children?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> wanted <b>to</b> make me happy,' {{continued}} the new- comer. 'And {{that is a}} little baccy, which I am sorry to say I am out of.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> see to. In time those fellows at {{the door}} will be getting impatient, and will begin to suspect that all is not right. We must get them inside, and then tie them up with the others. Stand back behind the door as they enter and, as I close it, throw yourselves upon them. One of you grip each of them by the throat, and another seize his musket and wrench it from him. The rest will be easy." ...|$|E
6000|$|AUSTIN. Dorothy, you misjudge me cruelly; I have {{deserved}} it. You {{will not}} take me for your husband; why should I wonder? You are right. I have indeed filled your life with calamity: the wages, ay, the wages, of my sin are heavy upon you. But I have <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> ask of your pity; and O remember, child, who it is that asks it: a man guilty in your sight, void of excuse, but old, and very proud, and most unused to supplication. Dorothy Musgrave, will you forgive George Austin? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Father John, I've only <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> say, and you'll {{answer me}} {{that as a}} priest and a Christian. God knows, I wouldn't believe any ill-natured story against any poor girl {{situated}} as Feemy is; but you know, such things will get about:--people say Ussher speaks of her as his mistress, instead of as his wife. Now, Father John, if this unfortunate girl, whom I'm {{ready and willing to}} help, has done anything really wrong, you would not be the means of bringing her into the house with my own dear girls! Have you, Father John, told me all you know about her attachment to this man?" ...|$|E
60|$|However, this {{confession}} of Aunt Emma's rendered <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> certain <b>to</b> me than ever before. I was sure I {{was on the}} right track now, after Courtenay Ivor. The bicycle clinched the proof.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Carroll, I got my notice. Maybe it's no {{surprise}} to you. And there's <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> I want <b>to</b> say. You're 'it' on this team. You're the topnotch catcher in the Western League {{and one of the}} best ball players in the game--but you're a knocker!" ...|$|R
60|$|Only <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> {{comes back}} <b>to</b> {{me of that}} blissful hour. Foolishly I said what I had been thinking, namely, that I blessed Ragnar. At these words, of a sudden Iduna's face grew stern and the lovelight in her eyes was changed to such as gleams from swords.|$|R
60|$|There is <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> note in {{connection}} with Miss Austen's work; namely, her wholesome influence on the English novel. In Northanger Abbey and in Sense and Sensibility she satirizes the popular romances of the period, with their Byronic heroes, melodramatic horrors and perpetual harping on some pale heroine's sensibilities. Her satire is perhaps the best that has been written on the subject, so delicate, so flashing, so keen, that a critic compares it to the exploit of Saladin (in The Talisman) who could not with his sword hack through an iron mace, as Richard did, but who accomplished the more difficult feat of slicing a gossamer veil as it floated in the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Allan, my dearest, I have <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> say, though I {{must say}} it shortly, {{for the paper}} is nearly finished. I do not know, supposing that you are alive and well, whether you still care for me, who left you so long ago--it seems years and years--but my heart is where it was, and where I promised it should remain, in your keeping. Of course, Hernan has pressed me to marry him, and my father has wished it. But I have always said no, and now, in our wretchedness, {{there is no more}} talk of {{marriage}} at present, which is the one good thing that has happened to me. And, Allan, before so very long I shall be of age, if I live. Still I dare say you no longer think of marriage with me, who, perhaps, are already married to someone else, especially as now I and all of us are no better than wandering beggars. Yet I have thought it right to tell you these things, which you may like to know.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know not," [...] {{answered}} Saladin, [...] "though {{it is true}} the man {{seems to}} have been a Christian among the Franks, who here was a follower of the Prophet. At least, he is dead at your hands, and though he sinned against me and betrayed my niece to Sinan, peace be with his soul. Now I have <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> say to you. That Frank, Prince Arnat of Karak, whom you call Reginald de Chatillon--accursed be his name!--" [...] and he spat upon the ground, [...] "has once more broken the peace between me and the king of Jerusalem, slaughtering my merchants, and stealing my goods. I will suffer this shame no more, and very shortly I unfurl my standards, which shall not be folded up again until they float upon the mosque of Omar and from every tower top in Palestine. Your people are doomed. I, Yusuf Salah-ed-din," [...] and he rose as he said the words, his very beard bristling with wrath, [...] "declare the Holy War, and will sweep them to the sea. Choose now, you brethren. Do you fight for me or against me? Or will you give up your swords and bide here as my prisoners?" ...|$|E
60|$|Speaking of {{ceiling with}} cedar, I have <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> say. We Americans {{have a country}} abounding in {{beautiful}} timber, of whose beauties we know nothing, {{on account of the}} pernicious and stupid habit of covering it with white paint.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet! I've <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> say. I've to tell you, gentlemen, on my {{professional}} word of honor, that, besides being an old hypocrite, this same old Mat Nixon is the ungrateful, unnatural GRANDFATHER {{of the first}} boy born in the district." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Then, gentlemen,” {{said the}} wounded stranger, rising, and {{resuming}} his clothes, “it will be unnecessary {{for me to}} trespass longer on your time and patience. There remains but <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> be settled, and that is, our respective rights to the deer, Judge Temple.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suddenly {{you stood}} before me! You alone {{in all the}} world to whom I must confess. You fascinated me--you have freed me from the {{blindness}} of anger and hate--the truth shining in you drew the truth out of me. Now I have done it; and as I write here, I am in the depths depths of anguish, but there is air to breathe at last--air! And, by the by, that old man sprang up from somewhere as I was speaking to you, and raged at me like a disappointed devil. I suffer horribly, but I am not in despair. There is only <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do for me. After that--if they let me--I shall go away and bury myself in obscure misery. In giving Victor Haldin up, it was myself, after all, whom I have betrayed most basely. You must believe what I say now, you can't refuse to believe this. Most basely. It is through you that I came to feel this so deeply. After all, it is they and not I who have the right on their side?--theirs is the strength of invisible powers. So be it. Only don't be deceived, Natalia Victorovna, I am not converted. Have I then the soul of a slave? No! I am independent--and therefore perdition is my lot." ...|$|E
60|$|Now the door-keeper {{called a}} warning and the buyers flocked from the building. Outside, the auctioneer, a smooth-faced, glib-tongued man, was already {{mounting}} the rostrum. Calling for silence {{he began his}} speech. On this evening of festival, he said, he would be brief. The lots he had to offer to the select body of connoisseurs he saw before him, were {{the property of the}} Imperator Titus, and the proceeds of the sale, it was his duty to tell them, would not go into Cæsar's pocket, but were to be equally divided between the poor of Rome and deserving soldiers who had been wounded or had lost their health in the war, a fact which must cause every patriotic citizen to bid more briskly. These lots, he might say, were unique, being nothing else than the fifteen most beautiful girls, believed all of them to be of noble blood, among the many thousands who had been captured at the sack of Jerusalem, the city of the Jews, especially selected to adorn the great conqueror's Triumph. No true judge, who desired a charming memento of the victory of his country's arms, would wish to neglect such an opportunity, especially as he was informed that the Jewish women were affectionate, docile, well instructed in many arts, and very hard-working. He had only <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> say, or rather two things. He regretted that this important sale should be held at so unusual an hour. The reason was that there was really no place where these slaves could be comfortably kept without risk of their maltreatment or escape, so it was held to be best that they should be removed at once to the seclusion of their new homes, a decision, he was sure, that would meet the wishes of buyers. The second point was that among them was one lot of surpassing interest; namely, the girl who had come to be generally spoken of as Pearl-Maiden.|$|E

50|$|Falco {{suspects}} something, but {{the obvious}} suspect is his guest and claiming an injury. Yet Claudia is convinced {{it was not}} an accident, and she asks Falco to investigate.

6000|$|This {{interesting}} {{experiment was}} never {{destined to be}} tried. Right or wrong, Mrs. Presty's theory remained the only explanation of the judge's severity. Mr. Sarrazin attempted to change the subject. Mrs. Presty had not quite done with it yet. [...] "There is <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> I want <b>to</b> say," [...] she proceeded. [...] "Will his lordship's remarks appear in the newspapers?" ...|$|R

50|$|The {{season that}} followed, Lanaris played another {{thirteen}} matches in Football League as {{the club was}} saved by relegation.

Lanaris, played in seventeen games, while Veria finished second and returned to Superleague.|$|E
50|$|Heavy-duty {{transmissions}} {{are almost}} always non-synchromesh. One argument is synchromesh adds weight that could be payload, is <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> fail, and drivers spend thousands of hours driving so can {{take the time to}} learn to drive efficiently with a non-synchromesh transmission. Heavy-duty trucks driven frequently in city traffic, such as cement mixers, need to be shifted very often and in stop-and-go traffic. Since few heavy-duty transmissions have synchromesh, automatic transmissions are commonly used instead, despite their increased weight, cost, and loss of efficiency.|$|E
