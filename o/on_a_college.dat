25|$|Each {{college has}} {{residential}} rooms, lecture theatres, study rooms, computer rooms and social areas. The {{intention of the}} colleges was {{that they should not}} be just Halls of residence, but complete academic communities. Each college (except Woolf) has its own bar, all rebuilt on a larger scale, and originally its own dining hall (only Rutherford still has a functioning dining hall; Darwin's is hired out for conferences and events; Keynes's was closed in 2000 and converted into academic space, but in 2011 Dolche Vita was expanded and became the dining hall for Keynes students in catered accommodation after Keynes's expansion in 2011; and Eliot's was closed in 2006). It was expected that each college (more were planned) would have around 600 students as members, with an equivalent proportion of staff, with half the students living within the college itself and the rest coming onto campus to eat and study within their colleges. Many facilities, ranging from accommodation, tutorials and alumni relations, would be handled <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> basis. With no planned academic divisions below the Faculty level, the colleges would be main focus of students' lives {{and there would be no}} units of a similar or smaller size to provide a rival focus of loyalties.|$|E
