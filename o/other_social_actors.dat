5000|$|Although {{there was}} {{sometimes}} acrimonious debate between the constructivist and realist [...] "camps" [...] within environmental sociology in the 1990s, {{the two sides}} have found considerable common ground as both increasingly accept that while most environmental problems have a material reality they nonetheless become known only via human processes such as scientific knowledge, activists' efforts, and media attention. In other words, most environmental problems have a real ontological status despite our knowledge/awareness of them stemming from social processes, processes by which various conditions are constructed as problems by scientists, activists, media and <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>actors.</b> Correspondingly, environmental problems must all be understood via social processes, despite any material basis they may have external to humans. This interactiveness is now broadly accepted, but many aspects of the debate continue in contemporary research in the field.|$|E

Specific topics on building bridges with <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>actors,</b> and political perspectives and strategies. These main topics led to discussion {{on a variety of}} issues, including culture, daily life, education, economics, health, identity, labor, power, sexuality and other issues. One of the most central challenges addressed was violence against women and a march was held on September 24th supporting an anti-violence stance. Four days later, a second march with more than five thousand women participants mobilized to declare September 28th as the Day of the Right to Abortion. They called not only for the decriminalization of abortion, but also for abolishing laws which punished women who had abortions.|$|E

In 2009 in Mothers and Others, she explored cognitive and emotional implications for infants growing up in what was (for an ape) a novel developmental context. Instead of relying on the single-minded dedication of their mothers, youngsters had to monitor and engage multiple caretakers as well. Other apes possess cognitive wiring for rudimentary Theory of Mind, but with cooperative rearing, relevant potentials for mentalizing would have become more fully expressed, and thus rendered more visible to natural selection. Over generations, those youngsters better at inter-subjective engagement would have been best cared for and fed, leading to directional Darwinian selection favoring peculiarly human capacities for intersubjective engagement. In 2014, Mothers and Others, together with earlier work, earned Hrdy the National Academy's Award for Scientific Reviewing in honor of her [...] "insightful and visionary synthesis of {{a broad range of}} data and concepts from across the social and biological sciences to illuminate the importance of biosocial processes among mothers, infants, and <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> in forming the evolutionary crucible of human societies." ...|$|E

Many users seek an escape or a comfort zone in entering these virtual worlds, {{as well as a}} sense of acceptance and freedom. Virtual worlds allow users to freely explore many facets of their personalities in ways that are not easily available to them in real life. However, users {{may not be able to}} apply this new information outside of the virtual world. Thus, virtual worlds allow for users to flourish within the world and possibly become addicted to their new virtual life which may create a challenge as far as dealing with others and in emotionally surviving within their real lives. One reason for this freedom of exploration can be attributed to the anonymity that virtual worlds provide. It gives the individual the ability to be free from social norms, family pressures or expectations they may face in their personal real world lives. The avatar persona experiences an experience similar to an escape from reality like drug or alcohol usage for numbing pain or hiding behind it. The avatar no longer represents a simple tool or mechanism manipulated in cyberspace. Instead, it has become the individual’s bridge between the physical and virtual world, a conduit through which to express oneself among <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>actors.</b> The avatar becomes the person’s alter ego; the vehicle to which one utilizes to exist among others who are all seeking the same satisfaction.|$|E

When the out-group-tie centralization is low, no group member enjoys substantially more ties to <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> outside the group than does any other group member.

40|$|A note to readers: Although I had {{intended}} to write a narrower empirical piece, this has become an effort {{to work through the}} organizational/institutional dimension of the overall argument of my current book project on voluntarism in American political development. My apologies for the unfinished empirical analysis which I will attempt to sketch in my presentation at the meeting. 2 Two concepts have dominated contemporary theories of the state: state capacity and state autonomy. Both resonate with a fundamentally Weberian understanding of bureaucracy and rational-legal authority. States develop and become powerful as they gain capacity in relationship to <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> and become less dependent on those <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> for the practice of governance (Skocpol 1985; Skowronek 1982).

And yet, if we look more closely, public agencies are only half the story, at least {{in the case of the}} rising hegemon of the first half of the twentieth century, the United States.

40|$|This {{research}} report {{focuses on a}} Critical Discourse Analysis of the discursive strategies and related linguistic devices employed in the representation of Islamic militants in editorials and opinion editorials of the local mainstream newspapers. Regarding issues of the ongoing violence in the Muslim-dominated area of Southern Thailand, most researchers have conducted studies in the discipline of social science. On the other hand, a few studies pay attention to such an issue through {{an examination of the}} language use in the media reportage. Hence, this study points to a linguistic analysis of the construction of Muslim militants who are deemed as the real perpetrators of the southern disorder and <b>other</b> relevant <b>social</b> <b>actors.</b> The textual data consist of 28 editorials and opinion editorials collected over a period of seven months (April to December 2004 with the exception of June and July in which no acts of violence appeared), from the English language newspapers in Thailand, namely The Nation and Bangkok Post. Wodak‟s Discourse-Historical Approach (Wodak et al., 1999; Wodak, 2001; and Reisigl and Wodak, 2009) is adopted as a framework to examine the discursive construction of the positive self- presentation and negative other-presentation of Islamic militant and related <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> in the editorials discourses. Findings show that self-attributions of superiority and other- attributions of inferiority by the news media through the referential, predicational and argumentative strategies create the strong impacts on the stereotypical perception of the text receivers. In this respect, the negative portrayal of Islamic militant <b>social</b> <b>actor</b> as a threat to national security reinforces the racial and religious prejudices against not only Muslims but the religion of Islam as well among the readers...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Why have labor {{movements}} in New York City and Los Angeles changed so dramatically? And more specifically, why have the activist social coalitions that revitalized {{the labor movement}} in Los Angeles not played {{the same kind of}} role in New York? Our research persuades us that the relationship between. contrasting coalition types—political and social—is central to explaining the differences. Political coalitions refer to cooperation between unions and parties, politicians, and <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>actors,</b> focused largely on elections and policy-making processes. Social coalitions, by contrast, include labor and <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> such as community, religious, environmental, and immigrant rights groups, focused on a range of political, economic, and social campaigns. A comparison of the two metropolitan areas {{over the past two decades}} reveals distinct patterns of coalition building in New York and Los Angeles. In New York, the labor movement is dominated by several powerful local unions, often at odds with one another in contending political coalitions. New social coalitions have developed but are not central to organized labor 2 ̆ 7 s political action. The focus of most unions on narrow interest representation contributes to a disconnect between social and political coalitions in which the latter dominate. In Los Angeles, by contrast, the significance of social coalition building stands out as the labor movement has coalesced over the past fifteen years. To be sure, labor in Los Angeles participates actively in political coalitions. In contrast to New York, however, political coalitions move beyond narrow union interests, building on social coalitions that broaden the influence of labor as a whole...|$|E

The data presented are part of an ethnographic study carried out among a network of ecological farmers, Ecovida, in the west of Santa Catarina state. The current global patent regime, most prominently the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), has had direct effects on seed production and agricultural food crops. In a scenario of increasing creation of patents, patent regulations, provisions on cultivars (plant varieties and seed breeding) {{and a number of other}} global trade control mechanisms, family farmers and <b>other</b> related <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> have rejected the multilateral development agencies' notion of life as "resource". This study has a two-fold aim: first, it approaches the international context of the intellectual property regime on biodiversity and knowledge production; second, it examines the actions taken by farmers participating in the Ecovida network toward creating alternative ways of managing knowledge to produce "free" seeds. As an outcome, there is a parallel political action of criticism and resistance to the current narrowing of agriculture's genetic base, and organized efforts to multiply seeds, know-how and knowledge through networks, banks and centers of agro-biodiversity. Our central argument is that all these <b>social</b> <b>actors</b> - who make up the so-called ecological network and who seek, in their activities, to carry on the multiplication and variability of seeds and promote the diversity of knowledge to produce diverse seeds - are also creating collective strategies of social resistance vis-à-vis the prevailing global modes of controlling knowledge, seeds and food production...|$|R
