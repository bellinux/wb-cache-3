5|$|In 1841, {{following}} {{suggestions from}} the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly. The fountains were fed from two wells, <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, Bueno {{published}} the album A 2000, which he promoted {{with a series}} of four sold-out concerts at the Astral Theater on Corrientes Avenue, the city's entertainment and cultural center. Bueno began 2000 with a major tour of Argentina's main summer spots on its Atlantic Coast. He performed 49 concerts in nine days, including <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of more than 100,000 people in the tourist hotspot of Mar del Plata. Following the success of the show at the Astral Theater, Bueno presented a series of concerts called Cuarteto Característico Rodrigo A 2000 (Characteristic Cuarteto, Rodrigo to 2000) in the Luna Park Arena starting on April 5, 2000.|$|E
5|$|P. sibiricus is {{the largest}} known species of Psittacosaurus. The skull of the type {{specimen}} is 20.7centimetres long (8.25in), and the femur is 22.3cm (8.75in) in length. It is also distinguished by its neck frill, which is longer than any other species, at 15 to 18% of skull length. A very striking feature of P. sibiricus {{is the number of}} 'horns' around the eyes, with three prominences on each postorbital, and <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of each eye, on the palpebral bones. Similar horns found on the postorbital of P. sinensis are not as pronounced but may be homologous. The jugal has extremely prominent 'horns' and may contact the premaxilla, both features also seen in the possibly related P. sinensis. There is a flange on the dentary of the lower jaw, similar to P. mongoliensis, P. meileyingensis, and P. sattayaraki. It can be told apart from the other species of Psittacosaurus by a combination of 32 anatomical features, including six that are unique to the species. Most of these are skull details, but one unusual feature is the presence of 23 vertebrae between the skull and pelvis, unlike the 21 or 22 in the other species where the vertebrae are known.|$|E

5|$|The Molson Indy Toronto was {{confirmed}} {{as part of}} CART's 2001 series' schedule in August 2000. It was the sixteenth consecutive year the race {{was held in the}} series, and the first of two races that were held in Canada. The Molson Indy Toronto was the tenth of 21 scheduled races for 2001 by CART, and was held on July 15. Prior to the race, Team Rahal driver Kenny Bräck was the leader of the Drivers' Championship with 83 points, 13 ahead of his nearest championship rival Hélio Castroneves in second and Dario Franchitti was third. Gil de Ferran was fourth on 56 points, <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Cristiano da Matta. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Honda was leading with 136 points; Toyota was a close second with 132, followed by Ford Cosworth with 114.|$|E
5|$|The head of Scelidosaurus was small, {{about twenty}} {{centimetres}} long, and elongated. The skull was low {{in side view}} and triangular in top view, longer than it was wide, {{similar to that of}} earlier ornithischians. The snout, largely formed by the nasal bones, was flat on top. Scelidosaurus still had the five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) seen in basal ornithischians: apart from the nostrils and eye sockets which are present in all basal dinosaurs, the fenestra antorbitalis and the upper and lower temporal fenestrae were not closed or overgrown, as with many later armoured forms. In fact, the upper temporal fenestrae were very large, forming conspicuous round openings {{in the top of the}} rear skull, serving as attachment areas for the powerful muscles that closed the lower jaws. The eye socket was slightly overshadowed in its front part by the prefrontal bone. Behind it, the upper rim of the eye socket was formed by the supraorbital bone. A study by Susannah Maidment e.a. concluded that juvenile specimens show that this bone was a fusion of three elements, <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> the next in rear, and the third at the inner side.|$|E
5|$|To keep low {{frequency}} sound {{focused on the}} audience area {{and not on the}} stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing {{at the same time in}} different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theatres, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system. With a cardioid dispersion pattern, two end-fire subwoofers can be placed <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other. The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds The second subwoofer is delayed a precise amount corresponding to the time it takes sound to traverse the distance between speaker grilles.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a decided}} {{difference}} between {{the form of the}} modern pallium and that used in early Christian times, as portrayed in the Ravenna mosaics. The pallium of the sixth century was a long, moderately wide, white band of wool, ornamented at its extremity with a black or red cross, and finished off with tassels; it was draped around the neck, shoulders, and breast in such a manner that it formed a V in front, and the ends hung down from the left shoulder, <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> and one behind.|$|E
25|$|No {{suitable}} engines {{were available}} to give a sufficient advantage over the British Napier Lion, so the simplest possible chassis was constructed and three war-surplus Liberty aero engines were squeezed into it. The vehicle was simple, with no clutch or gearbox and only a single fixed ratio. Once running by a push start, it had to keep rolling. Driver comforts were minimal: the forward engine was sheathed in a crude attempt at streamlining, the two side-by-side behind it were bare, with the driver perched {{between them and the}} <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{vehicle was}} fitted with 7mm armour, was {{powered by a}} 20hp {{gasoline}} internal combustion engine, {{and was able to}} move both forward and backward, with two driver positions, one at the front and the other at the back. It was to be equipped with machine guns on raised platforms attached to the compactor chassis: <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> one in the rear, and two projecting from the sides for 360 degrees coverage. This armament was never actually fitted: the gun shields in the pictures are the result of retouching. The retouched photographs seem to indicate two cannon and six machine guns. Total length was 7 metres, width 2 metres, height 2.3 metres. It weighed a little under 10 tons. It would have been manned by a crew of nine: one commander, two mechanics and six gunners. Speed varied between 3 and 5km/h.|$|E

Porsche had so far dominated the championship, with Audi securing victory in the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps.

25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran.
