5|$|Bupropion is a {{medication}} primarily {{used as an}} antidepressant and smoking cessation aid. It is marketed as Wellbutrin and Zyban among other trade names. It {{is one of the}} most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the United States and Canada, although in many countries this is an <b>off-label</b> <b>use.</b> It is an effective antidepressant on its own, but is also popular as an add-on medication in cases of incomplete response to first-line SSRI antidepressants. Bupropion is taken in tablet form and is available only by prescription in most countries.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), regulates the promotion of prescription drugs to ensure that promotional materials are not false and misleading and that they comply with applicable laws and regulations. Among other things, FDA prohibits drug companies from promoting drugs for <b>off-label</b> <b>uses</b> [...] that is, for a condition or patient population for which the drug has not been approved or {{in a manner that}} is inconsistent with information found on the approved drug label. Although doctors may prescribe drugs off label, it is not permissible for drug companies to promote drugs for <b>off-label</b> <b>uses.</b> FDA may take regulatory actions for violations, and may also pursue enforcement action through the Department of Justice (DOJ). GAO was asked for information about the promotion of drugs for <b>off-label</b> <b>uses.</b> GAO reviewed (1) how FDA oversees the promotion of <b>off-label</b> <b>uses</b> of prescription drugs and (2) what actions have been taken to address off-label promotions. GAO examined documentation related to the promotion of drugs for <b>off-label</b> <b>uses</b> and FDA correspondence with drug companies on identified violations and obtained information from DOJ on relevant actions. GAO also interviewed officials at FDA and the HHS Office of Inspector General and representatives of national medical and pharmaceutical associations. ...|$|R

25|$|The <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> of rituximab, a {{chimeric}} {{monoclonal antibody}} against the B cell surface antigen CD20, may sometimes {{be an effective}} alternative to splenectomy. However, significant side-effects can occur, and randomized controlled trials are inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) {{a popular}} <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> in the US. It is {{approved by the}} Australian TGA and the United Kingdom MHRA for this indication. Some have suggested the possible superior efficacy of clomipramine compared to other antidepressants {{in the treatment of}} MDD, although at the current time the evidence is insufficient to adequately substantiate this claim.|$|E
25|$|There is {{increasing}} use of immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine because of their effectiveness. In chronic refractory cases, where immune pathogenesis has been confirmed, the <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> of the vinca alkaloid and chemotherapy agent vincristine may be attempted. However, vincristine has significant side effects and its use in treating ITP must be approached with caution, especially in children.|$|E

The USDA has not to date approved any rabies vaccine for use in wolf-dog hybrids, though they do recommend an <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> of the vaccine. Wolfdog owners and breeders purport that the lack of official approval is a political move to prevent condoning wolfdog ownership.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, in {{an attempt}} to {{restrict}} <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> of DES as a postcoital contraceptive (which had become prevalent at many university health services following publication of an influential study in 1971 in JAMA) to emergency situations such as rape, an FDA Drug Bulletin was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said the FDA had approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES.|$|E
25|$|Methylphenidate is a {{commonly}} prescribed psychostimulant and works {{by increasing the}} activity of the central nervous system. It produces such effects as increasing or maintaining alertness, combating fatigue, and improving attention. The short-term benefits and cost effectiveness of methylphenidate are well established. Methylphenidate is not approved for children under six years of age. Methylphenidate may also be prescribed for <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> in treatment-resistant cases of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.|$|E

25|$|GSK {{used the}} JAACAP article to promote {{paroxetine}} to doctors {{for use in}} their teenage patients. The drug had not been approved for use in children and adolescents. Drug companies are prohibited from promoting drugs for unapproved uses, but doctors are permitted to prescribe drugs for {{what is known as}} <b>off-label</b> <b>use.</b> In the UK 32,000 prescriptions of paroxetine were written for children and adolescents in 1999, and in the US that figure rose to 2.1 million in 2002, earning GSK $55million.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{estrogen}} (ethinylestradiol) and progestin (levonorgestrel or norgestrel) pills used to {{be available}} as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills under several brand names: Schering PC4, Tetragynon, Neoprimavlar, and Preven (in the United States) but were withdrawn after more effective dedicated progestin-only (levonorgestrel) emergency contraceptive pills with fewer side effects became available. If other more effective dedicated emergency contraceptive pills (levonorgestrel, ulipristal acetate, or mifepristone) are not available, specific combinations of regular combined oral contraceptive pills can be taken in split doses 12hours apart (the Yuzpe regimen), effective up to 72hours after intercourse. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> of certain brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills in 1997. As of 2014, there are 26brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills containing levonorgestrel or norgestrel available in the United States {{that can be used}} in the emergency contraceptive Yuzpe regimen.|$|E
25|$|Access to Wyeth {{internal}} documents {{has revealed}} marketing strategies {{used to promote}} Neurontin for <b>off-label</b> <b>use.</b> In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved gabapentin (Neurontin, Pfizer) only for treatment of seizures. Warner–Lambert, which merged with Pfizer in 2000, used activities not usually associated with sales promotion, including continuing medical education and research, sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results, to promote gabapentin. Within 5 years the drug was being widely used for the off-label treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions. Warner–Lambert admitted to charges that it violated FDA regulations by promoting the drug for pain, psychiatric conditions, migraine, and other unapproved uses, and paid $430million to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges. A recent Cochrane review concluded that gabapentin is ineffective in migraine prophylaxis. The American Academy of Neurology rates it as having unproven efficacy, while the Canadian Headache Society and the European Federation of Neurological Societies rate its use as being supported by moderate and low-quality evidence, respectively.|$|E

50|$|<b>Off-label</b> <b>uses</b> of atenolol, as {{with other}} {{cardioselective}} β-blockers, include symptomatic treatment of psychological issues such as anxiety. β-blockers are effective for some in treating the somatic (physical) effects of anxiety. In these instances, dosing is used as needed instead of regular daily dosing.|$|R
50|$|Lisdexamfetamine is used {{primarily}} {{as a treatment for}} attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and binge eating disorder; it has similar <b>off-label</b> <b>uses</b> as those of other pharmaceutical amphetamines.

2500|$|In 1975, the FDA {{said it had}} not {{actually}} given (and never did give) approval to any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would approve that indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provided patient labeling and special packaging {{as set out in}} a FDA final rule published in 1975. To discourage <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: [...] "This drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive" [...] in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label. In the 1980s, <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> of the Yuzpe regimen of certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills superseded <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> of DES as a postcoital contraceptive.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudoephedrine is {{also used}} as a {{first-line}} prophylactic for recurrent priapism.

2500|$|SmithKline Beecham {{acknowledged}} internally in 1998 {{that the}} study had failed to show efficacy for paroxetine in adolescent depression. In addition, more patients in the group taking paroxetine had experienced suicidal thinking and behaviour. Although the JAACAP article included these negative results, it did not account for them in its conclusion; on the contrary, it concluded that paroxetine was [...] "generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents". The company relied on the JAACAP article to promote paroxetine for <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> in teenagers.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{concern has}} been {{expressed}} about overzealous use of stents in general. Two studies found about half of patients received stents for unapproved reasons, with worse outcomes for the patients in both studies. [...] More recent data suggest <b>off-label</b> <b>use</b> of both bare-metal stents and drug-eluting stents have increased risks. [...] However, drug-eluting stents seemed to have similar or improved rates of death or MI compared with bare-metal stents, and consistently reduced need for target vessel revascularization. [...] Overall, the data {{support the use of}} [...] drug-eluting stents for off-label indications.|$|E
50|$|Lacosamide {{may have}} a variety of <b>off-label</b> <b>uses,</b> {{including}} for pain management and treatment of mental health disorders. Lacosamide and other AEDs have been <b>used</b> <b>off-label</b> in the management of bipolar disorder, cocaine addiction, dementia, depression, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, headache, hiccoughs, Huntington's disease, mania, migraine, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, restless leg syndrome, and tinnitus. Combinations of AEDs are often employed for seizure reduction. Studies are underway for the use of lacosamide as a monotherapy for partial onset seizures, diabetic neuropathy, and fibromyalgia.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{comments}} {{have called}} upon the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to exercise restraint in {{its treatment of}} the dissemination of “enduring materials” (e. g., textbooks, journal articles, etc.) that address <b>off-label</b> <b>uses</b> of drug or biological products. This article considers the constitutional protections that apply to enduring materials as examples of commercial speech, and questions whether such materials—even though distributed by manufacturers—might be viewed more properly as scientific speech. Four conclusions will be set forth: 1) enduring materials regarding <b>off-label</b> <b>uses</b> deserve {{at least as much}} protection as the Constitution affords commercial speech; 2) there are good reasons to think that such materials deserve a very high level of protection; 3) FDA restrictions on enduring materials are liable to be both constitutionally suspect and futile; and 4) FDA ought, therefore, to repudiate its prior restrictions on the dissemination of enduring materials...|$|R
40|$|<b>Off-label</b> drug <b>use,</b> {{defined as}} {{use of a}} drug {{in a manner that}} {{deviates}} from its approved use defined by the drug’s FDA label, is problematic because such uses have not been evaluated for safety and efficacy. Studies estimate that 21 % of prescriptions are off-label, and only 27 % of those have evidence of safety and efficacy. We describe a data-mining approach for systematically identifying <b>off-label</b> usages <b>using</b> features derived from free text clinical notes and features extracted from two databases on known usage (Medi-Span and DrugBank). We trained a highly accurate predictive model that detects novel <b>off-label</b> <b>uses</b> among 1, 602 unique drugs and 1, 472 unique indications. We validated 403 predicted uses across independent data sources. Finally, we prioritize well-supported novel usages for further investigation on the basis of drug safety and cost...|$|R
