40|$|In the world, the {{faba bean}} beetle Bruchidius incarnatus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) is an {{important}} insect-pest, especially on faba bean Vicia faba (Leguminosae) and it can infest field crops and cause severe damage in storage. Essential oils can be an alternative method to synthetic insecticides for pest management, due to their efficiency and environmental safety. The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the toxicity and repellent activity <b>of</b> essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> <b>camphor</b> (Eucalyptus globules), castor (Ricinus communis), cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), clove (Syzygium aromaticum) and mustard (Brassica rapa) against B. incarnatus adults. The treatments which contained essential oils at 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 % and acetone (control) were applied. All essential oils with 4 % concentration repelled the B. incarnatus adult except castor <b>oil.</b> The percentage <b>of</b> repellence was higher when used essential <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> cinnamon with 2 and 4 % concentration compared with other essential oils and concentrations. In residual film experiment, the cinnamon oil had the highest toxicity rate on B. incarnatus adult fallowed by clove, camphor, mustard and the lowest effect was by castor oil. Based on our results, I can conclude that essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> <b>camphor,</b> cinnamon, clove and mustard have potential for use in the integrated management of B. incarnatus adult...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{essential}} oils from eight plant species were tested for their insecticidal activities against the red imported fire ant,  Solenopsis invcita, {{by using a}} fumigation bioassay. This study reveals that the mortalities after treatment of the workers of red imported fire ants varied according to the classification <b>of</b> workers, <b>oil</b> type, dosage, and exposure time.

We investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>camphor</b> on the pituitary-gonadal hormonal axis and concentration of steroidal hormones.   Materials & Methods: The parameters investigated were concentrations of LH, FSH, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Forty adult female rats at a mean weight of 180 ± 20 grams were divided into five groups. Camphor solution was prepared in olive oil at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg doses, and 0. 2 cc injections were done intraperitoneally every day for 2 weeks. The control group received no injection. The sham group received olive <b>oil</b> (as solvent <b>of</b> <b>camphor)</b> and treatment groups of 1, 2, and 3 received doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg.

Materials and Methods: In this empirical study, plant samples were collected at the full blooming stage. Shoot essential oil was extracted using hydro-distillation technique and Clevenger apparatus. Components of the extract were identified using GC and GC/MS apparatus and its antimicrobial properties were evaluated using diffusion in Agar method (disk diffusion) and dilution in the well (Micro-broth dilution) 6 T.

The results show that the fluorescence of W 42 is greatly affected on binding <b>of</b> <b>camphor,</b> and supports dynamic fluctuations involved in the passage <b>of</b> <b>camphor</b> through the access channel as proposed earlier on the basis of crystallographic, molecular dynamics simulation and site-directed mutagenesis studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pressure}} on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reversible binding <b>of</b> <b>camphor</b> to cytochrome P 450 cam was studied {{as a function of the}} K+ concentration. The determination of the reaction and activation volumes enabled the construction of the first complete volume profile for the reversible binding <b>of</b> <b>camphor</b> to P 450 cam. Although the volume profiles constructed for the reactions conducted at low and high K+ concentrations are rather similar, and both show a drastic volume increase on going from the reactant to the transition state and a relatively small volume change on going from the transition to the product state, the position of the transition state is largely affected by the K+ concentration in solution. Similarly, the activation volume determined for the dissociation <b>of</b> <b>camphor</b> is influenced by the presence of K+, which reflects changes in the ease of water entering the active site of camphor−bound P 450 cam that depends on the K+ concentration. Careful analysis of the components that contribute to the observed volume changes allowed the estimation of the total number of water molecules expelled to the bulk solvent during the binding <b>of</b> <b>camphor</b> to P 450 cam and the subsequent spin transition. The results are discussed in reference to other studies reported in the literature that deal with the kinetics and thermodynamics of the binding <b>of</b> <b>camphor</b> to P 450 cam under various reaction condition...|$|R
