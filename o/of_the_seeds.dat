5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E

However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E
5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} {{continue}} its license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} dominate the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> from Monsanto's patent.|$|E

5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that when more pollen {{is applied to the}} stigma, as well as the fruit {{containing}} more seeds and being larger (the xenia effect mentioned above), the germination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> is also faster and more likely, and the seedlings are larger. Various combinations of mineral nutrients and light have a significant effect during the various stages of plant growth. These effects vary significantly between the different species of Cucurbita. A type of stored phosphorus called phytate forms in seed tissues as spherical crystalline intrusions in protein bodies called globoids. Along with other nutrients, phytate is used completely during seedling growth. Heavy metal contamination, including cadmium, has a significant negative impact on plant growth. Cucurbita plants grown in the spring tend to grow larger than those grown in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost all}} amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is a herbivore. Its diet {{consists}} of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar {{obtained from the}} forest's canopy. The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different materials, although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger range. Among the items it consumes are the pericarp <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> of sierra palm (Prestoea montana), tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), and negra lora (Matayba domingensis); the fruits of bejuco de rana (Marcgravia sintenisii), camasey (Miconia sintenisii), cupey de altura (Clusia gundlachii), and palo de cruz (Rheedia portoricensis); the flowers of bejuco de rana, achiotillo (Alchornea latifolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the leaves and twigs of cupeillo (Clusia grisebachiana), laurel sabino (Magnolia splendens), caimitillo verde (Micropholis garciniaefolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the bark of bejuco de rana, cupeillo, and cachimbo cumun (Psychotria berteriana); and the buds of cuaba (Inga vera). It normally selects the fruits positioned {{directly in front of}} its eyes, picking them one at a time with some rare exceptions. When feeding, it uses a foot to pick up the food. The amazon feeds in a slow, paused manner taking 8–60seconds to consume separate items.|$|E

5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up {{to a hundred}} years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (each plant produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently bare ground, or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} dormancy as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> fall within 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% fall within 5 m.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the storm, the Alligator Rivers Region Advisory Committee began {{planting}} seedlings in deforested areas. By August 2006, {{a review of the}} growth of the new plants found that 81% to 88% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> had survived and begun growing. To fully restore the South Alligator valley, environmentalists requested A$7.4million (US$6.6million) in funds. In a study at Magela Creek a year after the storm, it was determined that between 8% and 19% of the tree canopy lost due to the storm had begun to recover. Additional studies at the Gulungul Creek and the Alligator Rivers region revealed that suspended sediment values in flowing water had temporarily increased in the wake of Monica. The above-average values persisted for roughly a year before the streams returned to pre-cyclone sediment levels. In a study of the Arnhem forests which were devastated by the cyclone, environmentalists reported that it would take over 100years for the forest to recover. The storm's winds snapped numerous trees, estimated to have been over 200 years old and more than 60cm (23.6in) in diameter. It is estimated that it would take several hundred years before trees of similar sizes would flourish in the region.|$|E

5|$|The cabbage tree's year {{begins in}} autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves {{projecting}} from {{the centre of}} each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers {{on the outside of}} the tree, exposed to insects and birds. Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and terpenes, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major disperser <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seeds.</b> Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in linoleic acid as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years. Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.|$|E
