It is shown that this method also allows the determination of relative contribution of each geometric feature in a cross section to <b>mass</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the element. Common loading conditions and structural geometries are analyzed and it is shown that the <b>mass</b> <b>efficiencies</b> realized in practice offer great many opportunities for improvement. It is suggested that more efficient use of materials and energy is feasible by paying closer attention to <b>mass</b> <b>efficiency</b> considerations during mechanical design.

To meet the required protection against heavy machine gun ammunition fired {{from a distance of}} 50 m, different options were compared by IBD and ST Kinetics. A 30 mm thick plate of high-hardness armour (HHA) steel provides enough protection. This was indexed as reference to calculate the <b>mass</b> <b>efficiency</b> and thickness efficiency of different armour solutions. Utilizing only 23 mm HHA together with a 10 mm liner to absorb the fragments, the <b>mass</b> <b>efficiency</b> can be increased to 1.2 (the armour provides 1.2 times as much protection as HHA of the same weight). Using a 22 mm MEXAS armour panel on top of 7.3 mm HHA boosts the <b>mass</b> <b>efficiency</b> to 2.5 compared to the HHA reference.The best result was achieved by utilizing a 20 mm thick MEXAS armour panel on top of a 7.3 mm HHA plate fitted with a 10 mm liner on the interior — a <b>mass</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 3.5; however the higher thickness decreased the thickness efficiency to 0.8 compared to the other tested armour layouts.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the erosion {{capacity}} of a supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) jet, {{the influence of a}} nano-silica additive on the rock erosion characteristics was experimentally investigated. By impinging the SC-CO 2 jets with nano-silica mass fractions of 0 wt % (pure SC-CO 2 jet), 3 wt %, 6 wt %, 9 wt %, 12 wt %, 15 wt %, and 18 wt % on specimens of red sandstone, the erosion volumes under various operating conditions were measured and analyzed. Results show that an appropriate amount of nano-silica additive can greatly enhance the erosion ability of a SC-CO 2 jet. The effect on the erosion ability largely depends on the operating conditions. For instance, when the other conditions are fixed, 6 wt %, 9 wt %, 12 wt %, and 15 wt % were the <b>optimum</b> <b>mass</b> fractions, successively, with the inlet pressure increasing from 30 MPa to 60 MPa. With the increase in ambient pressure, the <b>optimum</b> <b>mass</b> fraction is unchanged under the constant inlet pressure, while it increases under the constant pressure drop. Additionally, the <b>optimum</b> <b>mass</b> fraction decreases when the fluid temperature increases. In addition, the optimal standoff distances are about five times the nozzle diameter of the nano-silica SC-CO 2 jet, and three times for the pure jet.
