30|$|To {{determine}} which tool is appropriate in a hospital’s environment {{it is important}} first to identify the specific processes to be reviewed. Second, {{through a series of}} preliminary interviews with clinicians and managers, one may identify various wastes and decide together which could and should be primarily targeted. In addition, it is useful to gain an economic understanding on the importance of the underlying industry structure, irrespective of the kind <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> to be removed. This may be especially true in complex scenarios such as hospital organizations: to conceive an external supplier {{as an integral part of}} a value stream map may be especially challenging to understand for clinicians. It may be useful to reword the classic seven wastes identified by Toyota (<b>waste</b> <b>of</b> overproducing, <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> waiting, <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> transport, <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> processing, <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> inventory, <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> motion, <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> defects and spoilage) in more appropriate terminology for clinical use. For instance, in the healthcare industry the concept of industrial overproduction may not be exactly transferable. However, in calling this potential waste “doing things too early” this may assist in getting clinicians to relate the concept to their specific situation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{problems}} of environmental pollutions and resources depletion {{have been growing}} issues in global construction recently. Efforts to reduce CO 2 emission have been also made in all sectors of construction industry these days. As {{one of the biggest}} industries that consume a huge amount of resources and generate complex construction wastes, the construction industry has significant impacts on environment issues. However, systematic approach to manage wastes has been rarely made, and most construction wastes from construction sites are being land-filled or incinerated. In this study, a system is proposed to predict the amount <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> in visual formats, and to control the process <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> management. The system’s main functions include: (1) to estimate the amount <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> to be generated in project schedule, (2) to categorize the types <b>of</b> <b>wastes,</b> (3) to determine the timing <b>of</b> taking out <b>wastes</b> from sites, and (4) to share information regarding wastes for recycling. A huge amount <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> are generated in construction process, but most <b>of</b> the <b>wastes</b> have been discharged in forms <b>of</b> mixed <b>wastes,</b> which make them hardly reused. The system not only provide information on wastes to be generated, but also prevent mixing various wastes by classifying them by types and schedules. This features of the system, along with functions to share wastes information with other agencies outside the site, are expected to enhance the level <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> recycling to a great extent.

40|$|AbstractWasting {{is a sign}} {{of various}} {{underlying}} disorders and is a common feature of cancer, sepsis, and AIDS. We have developed an in vivo model to study the various stages <b>of</b> <b>wasting</b> following infection <b>of</b> mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus cl- 13. Using this model we have identified four distinct stages <b>of</b> <b>wasting</b> and have discovered that all stages occur in the different groups of mice regardless of whether the virus is cleared or persists. However, the degree and extent <b>of</b> <b>wasting</b> vary between groups of mice, depending upon the dose of virus administered. Blocking IFNγ or TNFα, which are believed {{to take part in the}} wasting process, did not affect the wasting state.
