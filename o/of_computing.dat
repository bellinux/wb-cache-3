5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future <b>of</b> <b>computing.</b> Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Hill and his {{brothers}} {{had taken over the}} management of their father's school in Birmingham in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is to instill the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons <b>of</b> <b>computing</b> pioneer Charles Babbage.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, {{each of which is}} an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model <b>of</b> <b>computing</b> and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E

His final computer project was the MU5, {{which was designed to}} facilitate the running of programs in high-level programming languages. An analysis of code written for the Atlas gave an insight into the frequency of different operands and control structures. The project was assisted by a £630,000 Science Research Council (SRC) grant awarded over five-years. The design heavily influenced the successful ICL 2900 Series.|$|E

5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College <b>of</b> <b>Computing,</b> the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style. The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and the proposed changes passed with very slim margins. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E
