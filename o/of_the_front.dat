5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and rear wheels. For a given displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel, due to some disturbance, {{the angle of the}} resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and rear wheels.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E

40|$|An {{invariant}} is {{a quantity}} which remains unchanged under certain classes of transformations. A wave front (or a front) in a 3 -manifold is <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> a surface under a Legendrian map. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this thesis is <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> all local invariants of fronts in 3 -manifolds. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> invariants under consideration are those whose increments in generic homotopies are determined entirely by diffeomorphism types of local bifurcations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fronts.</b> Such invariants are dual to trivial codimension 1 cycles {{supported on the}} discriminant in <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> corresponding Legendrian maps. We describe <b>the</b> spaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discriminantal cycles (possibly non-trivial) for various orientation and co-orientation settings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fronts</b> in an arbitrary oriented 3 -manifold, both for the integer and mod 2 coefficients. For <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> these cycles we find homotopy-independent interpretations which guarantee the triviality required. In particular, in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> framed <b>fronts</b> we show that all integer local invariants of Legendrian maps without corank 2 points are essentially exhausted by <b>the</b> numbers <b>of</b> points of isolated singularity types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fronts...</b>|$|R

5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{wheel is}} too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way}} and eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
