5|$|David and Cowan {{finally left}} Antibes in May 1940, sailing to Corsica {{and then to}} Sicily. They had reached the Strait of Messina when Italy entered the war on 10 June. They were {{suspected}} of spying and were interned. After 19 days in custody {{in various parts of}} Italy, they were allowed to cross the border into Yugoslavia, which at that point remained neutral and non-combatant. They had lost almost everything they owned—the boat, money, manuscripts, notebooks, and David's cherished collection <b>of</b> <b>recipes.</b> With the help of the British Consul in Zagreb, they crossed into Greece, and arrived in Athens in July 1940. By this time, David was no longer in love with her partner but remained with him from necessity. Cowan found a job teaching English on the island of Syros, where David learnt to cook with the fresh ingredients available locally. When the Germans invaded Greece in April 1941, the couple managed to leave on a civilian convoy to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Paul Tremo (1733/34–1810) was {{the head}} chef at the court of King Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski of Poland. He was born in Berlin, {{in a family of}} French Huguenots. As the king's {{favourite}} cook, he was responsible for the culinary side of royal banquets, including Thursday Dinners to which Stanislaus Augustus invited Warsaw's leading intellectuals. He followed the king to Saint Petersburg after the latter's abdication in 1795, but returned to Warsaw after his death in 1798. His cooking style combined Polish, French and other west European influences. As a mentor to aspirant Polish chefs and author <b>of</b> <b>recipes</b> which circulated in handwritten copies, he was instrumental in the development of modern Polish cuisine that was more moderate and cosmopolitan than old Polish cookery.|$|E
40|$|Food {{consumption}} and purchase behaviour are highly habituated, with food marketers often attempting to interrupt routine behaviour and thought patterns {{at the point}} of sale (POS) through aggressive sales promotion. In the case <b>of</b> food products, <b>recipe</b> cards are a common POS tactic, yet little research has examined the impact <b>of</b> <b>recipe</b> cards at POS. This research explores the impact <b>of</b> <b>recipe</b> cards at POS specifically in relation to seafood with data gathered through 11 face to face depth interviews with fishmongers. Results highlight the positive impact <b>of</b> <b>recipe</b> cards as marketing stimuli for seafood through two key roles: (1) risk reduction for consumers who lack knowledge about how to prepare and serve seafood; and (2) facilitating variety seeking for consumers who are looking for something different. Regardless of the consumers’ motivation for taking recipe cards, the fishmongers perceive that the cards {{have a positive impact on}} seafood sales...|$|R

5|$|The recipes {{were often}} brief {{and did not}} give precise quantities. Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as {{the time it took}} to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, working their way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help <b>of</b> <b>recipes</b> or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the Ménagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E

40|$|The natural {{variance}} of agricultural product parameters complicates recipe planning for product treatment, i. e. {{the process of}} transforming a product batch from its initial state to a prespecified final state. For a specific product P, recipes are currently composed by human experts {{on the basis of}} heuristic matches between product state and recipe features. This approach makes use <b>of</b> standard <b>recipes,</b> that do not sufficiently reflect inherent differences between batches. Improvement <b>of</b> the <b>recipe</b> design process requires three problems to be solved: (1) assessment of the initial product state, (2) fixation <b>of</b> the <b>recipe</b> requirements and (3) design <b>of</b> a treatment <b>recipe.</b> To objectively assess the initial product state, additional measurement of a specific parameter is required. This parameter varies substantially between batches, requiring large measurement samples. Without objective assessment, however, automated determination <b>of</b> the <b>recipe</b> requirements and recipe design is not possible. This paper describes a procedure to get an objective initial state assessment, and presents a Product Treatment Support System that takes an initial state assessment, and performs the process <b>of</b> <b>recipe</b> design. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are applied at three points in the process. Induction of decision trees is used to determine rules that are understandable to experts and that select products most suitable for state assessment. Neural networks are applied to transform the assessment of the initial state into the overall requirements <b>of</b> the <b>recipe.</b> Finally, the actual recipe is derived by means of constraint satisfaction...|$|R
