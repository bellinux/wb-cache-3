Although the employer in this case breached a fiduciary duty, the harm suffered by the pension plans’ beneficiaries results not from that breach, but from the employer’s insolvency.|$|R
40|$|This {{is a study}} about bankruptcy, a {{procedure}} incorporated into Lower Canada's legal institutions in 1839. The object is to analyze from both a social and a legal perspectives the relations between insolvent traders and their creditors {{during the first half}} of the nineteenth century. This research is based on a source almost unexploited by historians up to now, the bankruptcy records located in the judicial archives in the district of Montreal. The economic difficulties of the 1820 's and the inefficiency of the existing legal means for debt recovery were among the main arguments invoqued by the traders of Montreal in their demands for the implementation of a bankruptcy procedure. The result of our research indicate that these demands were not mainly expressed by the wealthiest creditors. The bankruptcy procedure responded more to the needs of <b>ordinary</b> <b>creditors</b> such as artisans, tavernkeepers and bakers whose credit was central to the production and trade of goods. The bankruptcy procedure allowed <b>ordinary</b> <b>creditors</b> to audit and control debtor's transactions, and to constrain other creditors to accept re-payment compromise...|$|R

[...] Some legal systems operate a hybrid approach; in the United Kingdom preferential creditors have priority over secured creditors whose security is in the nature of a floating charge, but creditors with fixed security take ahead of the preferential creditors generally.|$|R
5|$|On 5 November, TPD was {{formally}} liquidated at a creditors' meeting. It was revealed, to {{the anger of}} the creditors, that Sinclair had taken out a £5 million debenture to cover the money that he had put into the company. <b>Ordinary</b> <b>creditors</b> faced little prospect of recovering the £1 million left outstanding. Primary Contact, the marketing agency used by Sinclair to promote the C5, was left with the biggest unpaid bill, of nearly £500,000. The last of the unsold C5s were bought for £75 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of them to an Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.|$|R
40|$|In a {{reorganization}} procedure, rescuing {{the company}} is key. That is why {{the rights of the}} creditors got limited in a reorganization plan. But what if the Weak are not adequately protected against the superior (starting) position of the Strong (which {{may or may not be}} obtained in an ugly way) ? The judgement of October 6, 2016 of the Constitutional Court will be used as a starting point in this presentation. Firstly, extraordinary creditors are better protected than <b>ordinary</b> <b>creditors.</b> That, however, means that economically Strong creditors are usually better protected than economically Weak creditors. Secondly, the Belgian legislation acts unwittingly as a catalyst for opportunistic behavior of the Strong shareholders to the detriment of the Weak creditors (shareholder loans whereby the Strong cloak themselves as the Weak, exclusive right of initiative, etc.). Thirdly, questions (inspired by law and economics) arise as to the (non-) discriminatory nature of certain “remedial” legal provisions: they protect Weak creditors while forgetting creditors who are (at least) as Weak. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{contribution}} aims at enriching {{the debate}} on the priority of unfunded pension rights {{in the case of a}} sponsoring firm's bankruptcy. Starting from the idea that pension promises in DB schemes are part of a financial contract between a sponsor and participants to a sponsored pension plan, we argue that plan participants are not <b>ordinary</b> <b>creditors</b> and should be given the same priority as other claimants in the event of underfunding and a sponsoring firm's bankruptcy. We build up a model consistent with this view, which gives room for more participants' involvement in pension fund management. We assume that the sponsoring firm chooses the optimal share of a pension fund deficit that it commits to cover in case of underfunding, while participants choose the contribution rates that maximize their expected utility. We show that two regimes govern the pattern of the relationship between the optimal level of funding chosen by the sponsor and the optimal contribution rates chosen by the plan participants. Allowing plan participants to determine their desired contribution rates gives the entrepreneur the proper incentive for funding the pension plan. In a certain way, our pension contract resembles a cash-balance contract and our model suggests that more security can be given to plan participants in their pension savings by offering them a cash-balance plan which states a priority of unfunded pension rights in case of a firm's bankruptcy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{dynamics}} of Chapter 11 turn dramatically {{on the size of}} the business. The vast majority of the assets administered in Chapter 11 are concentrated in a handful of large cases, but most of the businesses in Chapter 11 are small, and the smaller the business, the smaller the distribution to general unsecured creditors. For businesses with assets above $ 5 million, unsecured creditors typically collect half of what they are owed. Where the business’s assets are worth less than $ 200, 000, <b>ordinary</b> general <b>creditors</b> usually recover nothing. In the typical small Chapter 11 case, the tax collector is the central figure. In small business bankruptcies, priority tax liabilities are the largest unsecured liabilities of the business. Tax obligations are entitled to priority and are obligations of both the corporation and those who run it. Given the large shadow tax claims cast over small Chapter 11 reorganizations, accounts of small Chapter 11 must focus squarely on them. Baird, Bris & Zhu—Page 2 By common account, the Chapter 11 reorganization is run for the benefit of the business’s general creditors. The unsecured creditors cannot be paid in full and the...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{creditor}} conduct in a distressed firm—-for which policymakers {{ought to have}} the distressed firm’s economically sensible repositioning as a central goal—-has vexed courts for decades. Because courts have not come to coherent, stable doctrine to regulate creditor behavior and because they do not focus on building doctrinal structures that would facilitate the sensible repositioning of the distressed firm, social costs arise and those costs may be substantial. One can easily see why developing a good rule here has been hard to achieve: A rule that facilitates creditor intervention in the debtor’s operations beyond the <b>creditor’s</b> <b>ordinary</b> collection on a defaulted loan can induce creditors to intervene perniciously, to shift value to themselves even at the price of mismanaging the debtor. But a rule that confines creditors to no more than collecting their debt can allow failed managers to continue mismanaging the distressed firm, with the only real managerial alternative-—the creditor—-paralyzed by judicial doctrine. The doctrinal difficulty and the potential for creditor paralysis arise from unclear and inconsistent judicial doctrine. Some courts hold that it is the creditor’s inequitable control of the debtor that leads to creditor liability. Others rule that the creditor’s contract rights go beyond simply suing and collecting, fully allowing the creditor to condition its own forbearance from suing on the debtor complying with the creditor’s wishes-—even if the conditions are costly to the firm’s other creditors. Worse for encouraging positive creditor engagement, the doctrinal standard through which courts shift from protected contract rights to perniciously exercised control is obscure. Leading cases have the same basic facts—sometimes even the same court-—but sharply differing results. Creditor control is the key doctrinal metric, but the better metric for judicial focus is the creditor’s goal. Here we show, first, that there is often no on-the-ground, operational difference between these two standards-—pernicious control and free-wheeling contract enforcement—-and that this lack of sharp difference helps explain why the judicial results are vexing, contradictory, and costly. We next show how similar problems are dealt with differently in corporate law settings: courts evaluate the questioned transaction but defer to the business judgment of an unconflicted board of directors. Then we show how putting a layer of basic corporate duties—-entire fairness for conflicted transactions and business-judgment- rule deferential review for nonconflicted transactions-—atop the creditor-intervention doctrines clarifies the creditor-in-control problem and shows us a conceptual way out from the problem. A safe harbor for creditors is plausible—-if courts could reduce the extent of creditor conflict for critical decisions—-and would both encourage constructive creditor intervention and discourage detrimental, value-shifting creditor intervention. Finally, we show that modern financial markets yield a practical way out, using this corporate doctrine as the map: modern capital markets’ capacity to build options, credit default swaps, and contracts for equity calls provides new mechanisms that, when combined with the classic corporate doctrinal overlay, can better inform courts and parties on how to evaluate and structure creditor entry into managerial decisionmaking. The capital market and corporate doctrine combination can create a doctrinal conduit to better incentivize capital market players to improve distressed firms than the current doctrines regulating creditor conduct...|$|R
