5|$|This scheme {{can be seen}} as a {{mechanism}} for representation. First, MPs are chosen by the electorate to represent their concerns and needs in Parliament. Secondly, the Prime Minister, who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs, and the Cabinet which is made up of popularly elected MPs, effectively represent the views of the electorate as he heads the Government. The structure of the executive is therefore based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> political representation.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Lorentz more {{generally}} explained Fresnel's coefficient based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> local time. However, Lorentz's theory {{had the same}} fundamental problem as Fresnel's: a stationary aether contradicted the Michelson–Morley experiment. So in 1892 Lorentz proposed that moving bodies contract {{in the direction of}} motion (FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, since George FitzGerald had already arrived in 1889 at this conclusion). The equations that he used to describe these effects were further developed by him until 1904. These are now called the Lorentz transformations in his honor, and are identical in form to the equations that Einstein was later to derive from first principles. Unlike Einstein's equations, however, Lorentz's transformations were strictly ad hoc, their only justification being that they seemed to work.|$|E

Arguing against the Third Phase Campaign on December 7, PVA Commander Peng Dehuai telegraphed to Mao that the PVA would {{need at least}} three months to replace its casualties, while most of its troops were in critical need of resupply, rest and reorganization. The Chinese logistics system, which was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> People's War with the native population supplying the army, also ran into difficulties due to the indifferent, and sometimes hostile, Korean population near the 38th parallel. The Chinese were now suffering from hunger {{and the lack of}} winter clothing.|$|E

5|$|The Imperial War Museum North {{was opened}} in Trafford, Greater Manchester in 2002. It {{was the first}} branch of the museum outside {{southeast}} England, {{and the first to}} be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind’s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings, a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5 million.|$|E
5|$|The Re-Invention World Tour was {{the sixth}} concert tour by Madonna. It {{supported}} her ninth studio album American Life, and visited North America and Europe. Madonna {{was inspired to}} create the tour, after taking part in an art installation called X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS, directed by photographer Steven Klein. A number of songs were rehearsed for the tour, with twenty-four of them making the final setlist. The tour was divided into five segments: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal. The costumes were developed by designer Arianne Phillips based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> re-invention. The opening segment displayed performances with dance in general. Military segment displayed performances with the theme of warfare. Circus displayed light-hearted performances while the Acoustic segment performances were melancholy. The final Scottish segment had Madonna and her performers display energetic dance routines.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1970s, Australia's {{military}} strategy centred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> 'forward defence', {{in which the}} role of the Australian military was to co-operate with allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region. In 1969, when the United States began the Guam Doctrine and the British withdrew 'east of Suez', Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self-reliance of the Australian continent. This was known as the Defence of Australia Policy. Under this policy, the focus of Australian defence planning was to protect Australia's northern maritime approaches (the sea-air gap) against enemy attack. In line with this goal, the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. The ADF achieved this by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF and relocating regular Army units to northern Australia.|$|E

5|$|Needing {{material}} for the relatively new medium of television, producer Robert Maxwell sold Weatherwax <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> a Lassie television series with a boy and his dog theme. The two men developed a scenario about a struggling war widow, her young son, and her father-in-law set on a weather-beaten, modern day American farm. Two pilots were filmed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with the first {{telling the story of}} the bond forged between boy and dog, and the second filmed to give potential sponsors and network buyers an idea of a typical episode. After viewing the pilots, CBS put the show on its fall 1954 schedule. Campbell's Soup Company signed on early as the show's sole sponsor and remained so for the show's entire run. Filming for the series began in the summer of 1954, and Lassie made its début Sunday, September 12, 1954, at 7:00p.m. EST, a time slot the show would call home on CBS for the next seventeen years.|$|E

5|$|Unlike westernized instrumentation, {{there is}} no set tuning for kulintang sets {{throughout}} the Philippines. Great variation exist between each set {{due to differences in}} make, size and shape, alloy used giving each kulintang set a unique pitch level, intervals and timbre. Though the tuning varies greatly, there does exist some uniformity to contour when same melody heard on different kulintang sets. This common counter results in similar interval relationships of more or less equidistant steps between each of the gongs. This tuning system, not based upon equal temperament or upon a system of standard pitches but on a similar/certain pattern of large and small intervals, could also be found among the gamelan orchestras of western Indonesia. In fact, though the Maguindanao, Maranao and Tausug artists technically have no concept of scale (because emphasis placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> “rhythmic modes”), the Pelog and Slendro scales of Java were found to be most satisfactory to their own varying pentatonic/heptatonic scales.|$|E
