5|$|Accusations of Adi Da abusing {{his power}} as a spiritual leader {{attracted}} international attention in 1985. Adi Da and Adidam (then known as Da Free John and The Johannine Daist Communion) were subjects of almost daily coverage in the San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner, Mill Valley Record, <b>other</b> <b>newspapers,</b> and regional television news and talk shows over several weeks early in the year. The story gained national attention with a two-part exposé on The Today Show that aired May 9 and 10.|$|E
5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and <b>other</b> <b>newspapers</b> began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E

Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote {{a steady stream of}} articles for The Baltimore Sun and <b>other</b> <b>newspapers.</b> However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.|$|E
5|$|Bruce Copeland, sportswriter for the Rock Island Argus, {{compiled}} the All-Pro {{list for}} 1920.

5|$|By 1924, the {{newspaper}} {{had a good}} circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help if most authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two <b>other</b> <b>newspapers</b> that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Jasienica (then, Leon Beynar) {{fought in}} the Polish Army, and later, the Home Army resistance. Near {{the end of the}} war, he was also working with the anti-Soviet resistance, which later led to him taking up a new name, Paweł Jasienica, to hide from the {{communist}} government of the People's Republic of Poland. He was associated with the Tygodnik Powszechny weekly and several <b>other</b> <b>newspapers</b> and magazines. He {{is best known for his}} 1960s books on Polish historyon the Kingdom of Poland under the Piast Dynasty, the Jagiellon Dynasty, and the elected kings of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Those books, still popular, played an important role in popularizing Polish history among several generations of readers.|$|E

5|$|Less {{than three}} weeks before the primary, Comer's former girlfriend told the Courier-Journal in a letter that Comer had abused her {{physically}} and mentally in 1991 and that he had accompanied her to an abortion clinic. <b>Other</b> <b>newspapers,</b> including the Lexington Herald-Leader, which citied the Courier-Journal, then reported the allegations.

C. Crosbie.|$|E
5|$|Nouvelles Extraordinaires, like <b>other</b> <b>newspapers</b> of its time, gave {{primarily}} {{political and}} commercial information, classified by source and {{date of arrival}} (the oldest, from the most distant lands, coming first). It offered reports on international politics, such as wars and diplomatic relations, as well as coverage of major domestic affairs. The newspaper also contained trivia, editorials and advertising. Like many other early newspapers, it offered judgments and prognostications, {{and was in the}} main a juxtaposition of rumors and announcements from various sources, presented without much unification.|$|E
5|$|One of Snedden's first actions was to readdress the paper's {{stance on}} Alaska statehood. Lathrop and the News-Miner had been {{strongly}} opposed to statehood, but after Snedden took control, he analyzed {{the issue and}} came out strongly in favor of Alaska statehood. The News-Miner continually published editorials in favor of statehood, and encouraged <b>other</b> <b>newspapers</b> across the U.S. to do the same. In 1955 and 1956, when the Alaska Constitutional Convention {{took place at the}} University of Alaska Fairbanks, the News-Miner set up special telephone lines from the convention chambers to the newspaper's office. Daily reports were printed, recording the delegates' progress.|$|E

5|$|Though the Meridian Star is now {{the only}} {{newspaper}} printed in the city, {{there have been a}} few other historical newspapers. One such paper is the Memo Digest, a ten to twenty page publication published during the 1970s. The Digest focused on issues relevant to the African-American population of the region, gathering a circulation of about 5,000 people. <b>Other</b> <b>newspapers</b> in the city have included The Colored Messenger, The State, The Weekly Mercury, The Blade, Weekly Echo, Fair Play, Headlight, Meridian Morning Sun, Teacher and Preacher, and Clarion.|$|E
5|$|To help {{combat the}} {{negative}} press, Aberhart resolved {{to gain control}} of the Albertan, the one paper of note to show him any support. He formed a company that acquired an option to purchase it, and used his radio program to promote the purchase of shares by Social Credit supporters. The <b>other</b> <b>newspapers</b> criticized him for using what was nominally a gospel program to promote stock sales. The plan came to naught, as most Social Credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock, and the only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage, chiefly liquor interests. Even so, the Albertan became the official organ of Social Credit, an editorial decision that doubled its circulation.|$|E
5|$|Arbeideren ("The Worker") was a Norwegian newspaper, {{published}} in Hamar, Hedmark county. It {{was started in}} 1909 as the press organ of the Labour Party in Hedemarken and its adjoining regions, and was called Demokraten ("The Democrat") until 1923. It was issued {{three days a week}} between 1909 and 1913, six days a week in 1914, three days a week again between 1914 and 1918 before again increasing to six days a week. It was renamed to Arbeideren in 1923, and in the same year it was taken over by the Norwegian Communist Party. The Communist Party incorporated the newspaper Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad into Arbeideren in 1924, and until 1929 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad. After Arbeideren had gone defunct, the name was used by the Communist Party for <b>other</b> <b>newspapers</b> elsewhere.|$|E
