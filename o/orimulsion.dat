25|$|The {{skilled worker}} {{shortage}} {{was much more}} severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most of its heavy oil experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03, and wound down the production of <b>Orimulsion,</b> which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.|$|E
2500|$|No {{significant}} {{development of}} Venezuela's extra-heavy oil deposits was undertaken before 2000, {{except for the}} BITOR operation which produced somewhat less than 100,000 barrels of oil per day (16,000 m3/d) of 9°API oil by primary production. This was mostly shipped as an emulsion (<b>Orimulsion)</b> of 70% oil and 30% water with similar characteristics as heavy fuel oil for burning in thermal power plants. However, when a major strike hit the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, most of the engineers were fired as punishment. <b>Orimulsion</b> had been {{the pride of the}} PDVSA engineers, so <b>Orimulsion</b> fell out of favor with the key political leaders.

5000|$|<b>Orimulsion</b> is {{currently}} {{used as a}} commercial boiler fuel in power plants worldwide (e.g., Japan, Lithuania, Italy and China).

5000|$|As a {{fuel for}} {{electricity}} generation, <b>Orimulsion</b> {{has a number}} of attractive characteristics: ...|$|E
50|$|The plant burned <b>Orimulsion</b> oil, {{a product}} of PDVSA, and {{featured}} two boilers and two large chimneys, 168 m and 162 m in height. The plant consumed 0.8 million tons of <b>Orimulsion</b> per year and generated approximately {{ten percent of the}} province's electricity, while producing roughly eighteen percent of the province's air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions (among large industrial polluters).|$|E
5000|$|In 2004 the {{government}} of Venezuela announced that its state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PdVSA) would begin scaling down production of <b>Orimulsion</b> and not renew any existing supply contracts once they have ended. [...] This decision threw a wrench in plans by NB Power {{which was in the}} process of a $1 billion upgrade to the Coleson Cove Generating Station, converting that plant from heavy fuel oil to <b>Orimulsion</b> based on a signed MoU with PdVSA. The announcement of the PdVSA's cancellation of future <b>Orimulsion</b> production beginning in 2004, as well as the Government of Canada's decision to become the 99th country to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on 17 December 2002 cast a cloud over the future of the Dalhousie Generating Station and NB Power's other thermal generating units.|$|E
5000|$|Political {{instability}} in Venezuela in 2003 {{is believed to}} have contributed to PDVSA balking at formally signing a contract to implement an <b>orimulsion</b> deal with NB Power for Coleson Cove. [...] By winter 2004 it was apparent that the fuel supply agreement with PDVSA had fallen through and NB Power launched a $2.2 billion lawsuit that was filed simultaneously with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan and the Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick in Fredericton during the last week of February, naming both PDVSA and its United States subsidiary Bitumenes Orinoco S.A. (Bitor) as defendants and citing the companies' inability to negotiate and sign a contract to deliver <b>orimulsion</b> to Coleson Cove. [...] On March 16, 2004 PDVSA announced that it was phasing out all <b>orimulsion</b> production; since NB Power's Dalhousie Generating Station's fuel supply agreement ends in 2010, it is assumed that both plants will be forced to switch to an alternative.|$|E
50|$|It was {{converted}} to burn oil in summer 1971 and further converted in 1989 to burn a proprietary {{oil and water}} emulsion called <b>Orimulsion,</b> imported from Venezuela through Port Richborough.|$|E

50|$|The Richborough Power Station was opened, {{within the}} port, in 1962 burning coal as its fuel. Then in 1971 it was {{converted}} {{to run on}} oil before it was finally converted again to burn the controversial fuel <b>Orimulsion</b> during {{the final years of}} operation. <b>Orimulsion</b> is an emulsion originating from the Orinoco Basin, which was offloaded here. The plant closed down in 1996, but much of it remained in situ until the demolition of the three cooling towers on 11 March 2012. A new Energy Park is planned for the site, including a Diesel Peak Generator.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Richborough {{power station}} operated from 1962 to 1996, with final demolition being undertaken in 2012. It originally burnt coal, but later converted to oil {{and that to}} the burning of <b>Orimulsion.</b>|$|E
50|$|The drop in {{oil prices}} by the mid-1980s {{and the age of}} Dalhousie #1 saw NB Power examine options. The Dalhousie plant was {{particularly}} attractive for changing its fuel since it was situated on the shore of Chaleur Bay and had a ship-unloading pier at the nearby Port of Dalhousie to which it was connected by a pipeline (for fuel oil). In 1988, Dalhousie became the site of the world's first large-scale test of <b>orimulsion</b> fuel when 180,000 tons were burnt to produce 0.5 million MWh. This successful test saw NB Power and Bitor America enter into a long term supply agreement of 800,000 tons/year for both Dalhousie #1 and Dalhousie #2; the plant's conversion was completed in 1994 and began burning <b>Orimulsion</b> 100, switching to a different grade <b>Orimulsion</b> 400 in 1998, while still retaining the ability to burn coal. The 1994 upgrades saw the plant become the third in Canada to install Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) technology which saw the addition of scrubbers for removing particulate pollution.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orimulsion</b> is a {{registered}} trademark name for a bitumen-based fuel that was developed for industrial use by Intevep, the Research and Development Affiliate of Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), following earlier collaboration on oil emulsions with BP.|$|E
5000|$|After growing {{concerns}} over the environmental effects of the <b>Orimulsion</b> fuel in the main power station, court action was taken in two separate actions, with both cases settled out of court. [...] the 360MW station ceased generating in 1996.|$|E
50|$|After {{the sale}} of NB Power to Hydro Quebec was cancelled, the provincial {{government}} {{announced that it was}} placing the Dalhousie Generating Station under a strategic review, since the initial long-term supply contract for <b>Orimulsion</b> with PdVSA expired in June 2010 and was not expected to be renewed. The final delivery of <b>Orimulsion</b> took place in July 2010. The fuel supply lasted until spring 2011. Local residents in the Dalhousie area lobbied the provincial government to convert the Dalhousie Generating Station back to coal or heavy fuel oil, citing the loss of many major industrial employers in the region such as a pulp mill and chemical plant, but the plan was to no avail.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, NB Power signed a supply {{contract}} with PDVSA for <b>Orimulsion,</b> a cheap bitumen-based fuel, for its Coleson Cove and Dalhousie facilities. The utility then converted {{one of three}} units at the 1050 MW Coleson Cove plant, in Saint John, to burn the heavier grade while burning <b>Orimulsion</b> at Dalhousie. After investing hundreds of million dollars at Coleson Cove, NB Power learned of the Venezuelan supplier's decision to stop making the fuel, thus breaking the contract. After mixed success litigating the case and winning a settlement estimated at more than $200 million, the utility turned to a mix of petroleum coke, an oil refinery byproduct, and heavy oil, drawing opposition from environmentalists.|$|E
50|$|Bitumen-based fuel is {{currently}} {{used as a}} commercial boiler fuel in power plants in Canada, Japan, Lithuania, and China. Commonly available air pollutant control technology can limit emissions from <b>Orimulsion</b> to levels considered Best Available Control Technology, {{as defined by the}} United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} decade, the government-owned utility has faced {{problems}} with {{the failure of a}} plan to switch two of its large thermal facilities to <b>Orimulsion,</b> a heavy bitumen fuel produced by PDVSA, the Venezuelan government oil company, and a 2-year delay in the mid-life refit of the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station.|$|E
50|$|From 1968 until 2000, a CEGB 2,000 MW oil-fired {{power station}} existed {{on the site}} of the current power station. The plant was mothballed by National Power in 1996 when the company {{proposed}} to use the controversial fuel <b>Orimulsion.</b> The company changed its mind in the face of fierce opposition and the plant closed in 1997 with the loss of 300 jobs.|$|E
5000|$|The Pembroke Power Station was {{completed}} in 1968 for CEGB and together with Marchwood, near Southampton, was the largest oil fired power station to be built. Its maximum output was 2,000 MW and it was joined to Burry Port in Carmarthenship by two 400KVA power lines on 170 foot high pylons. It could emit 600 tons of sulphur dioxide and 3 tons of nitrogen oxides from a 500-foot chimney. The Power Station never managed to reach this maximum output. Initially it was using crude oil from the adjacent refineries but in 1992 National Power proposed changing this to <b>orimulsion,</b> a mixture of water and bitumen, which came from Venezuela. This would have quadrupled the potential output of sulphur dioxide {{as well as the}} possible risk of an <b>orimulsion</b> spill in Milford Haven. There was a local outcry when it was realised that the power station may already be causing a higher level of asthma and that there were other health risks from <b>orimulsion.</b> The Pembrokeshire Branch of CPRW joined with other local groups in opposing the scheme and eventually National Power suggested an additional desulphurisation plant. However, the Secretary of State decided to hold an inquiry, but a few weeks before it started National Power withdrew the proposals. The Power Station was mothballed in 1996 and demolished between 2000 and 2003. It was replaced by the Pembroke B Power Station on the same site which opened in 2012, which has turbines which run on natural gas and has a heat recovery steam generator ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1957 a 240MW station, Padiham [...] "B", was {{authorised}} {{with the}} first unit of 120MW commissioned in 1962. In 1964 a Padiham [...] "C" [...] was proposed but not built. Padiham [...] "A" [...] closed in 1969. In 1971 some oil firing and <b>orimulsion</b> was proposed at one stage but it seems only coal and petrocoke were ever used. By 1984 the station was generating 15 million MW hours.|$|E
50|$|Raw bitumen has an {{extremely}} high viscosity and specific gravity between 8 and 10 API gravity, at ambient temperatures and is unsuitable for direct use in conventional power stations. <b>Orimulsion</b> {{is made by}} mixing the bitumen with about 30% fresh water and {{a small amount of}} surfactant. The result behaves similarly to fuel oil. An alcohol-based surfactant recently replaced the original phenol-based version; improving the transport properties of the fuel and eliminating the health concerns associated with the phenol group of surfactants.|$|E
50|$|Most {{liquid fuels}} in {{widespread}} use {{are derived from}} the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth's crust. However, there are several types, such as hydrogen fuel (for automotive uses), ethanol, jet fuel and biodiesel which are all categorized as a liquid fuel. Emulsified fuels of oil-in-water such as <b>orimulsion</b> have been developed {{a way to make}} heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant was}} built in stages between 1960 and 1972. The Strėva River was dammed to supply it with cooling water, {{creating}} the Elektrėnai Reservoir. As of 2008 the plant comprised eight units fired with natural gas, heavy fuel oil, and a bitumen-based fuel known as <b>Orimulsion,</b> imported from Venezuela. It {{was designed as a}} base load plant, and generated about 10 TWh per year until 1992. Its operations were then reduced to about 5% of its capacity, since it acted only as a reserve in the Lithuanian power system. In 2012 9th block had been opened.|$|E
50|$|The {{skilled worker}} {{shortage}} {{was much more}} severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most of its heavy oil experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-03, and wound down the production of <b>Orimulsion,</b> which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.|$|E
5000|$|Another reason {{given by}} current PDVSA {{management}} {{is that with}} rising crude oil prices, {{it has been found}} that mixing or diluting Orinoco bitumen (extra-heavy oil) with a lighter crude oil can make this blend more profitable as a crude oil on the world market than by selling it as <b>Orimulsion.</b> An example of this is the popular Merey blend (Orinoco bitumen and Mesa crude oil). ConocoPhillips along with PDVSA operate the Merey Sweeny [...] (bpd) delayed coker, vacuum tower and related facilities at ConocoPhillips' refinery in Sweeny, Texas, U.S.A. for processing and upgrading heavy sour Merey crude oil.|$|E
50|$|In late 2001, NB Power {{announced}} {{its intention to}} refurbish Coleson Cove and convert its fuel source to <b>orimulsion,</b> which was sole-sourced from Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) in a $2 billion 20-year supply agreement. The $2.2 billion refurbishment project involved reconfiguring the boilers, as well as on-land storage tanks, Lorneville Pipeline, and some equipment at Irving Oil's Canaport unloading facility. The project was envisioned to be complete in November 2004 with a cost of $818 million. Part of this refurbishment saw Coleson Cove fitted with low NOx burners {{and the addition of}} six flue gas desulphurization (FGD) scrubbers which were designed to also remove hydrochloric acid.|$|E
50|$|The station {{occupied}} a 125 acre site. Its boiler house measured 102.5 m by 49.5 m and 61 m high. The turbine hall was 123 m by 60 m and 32 m high. It used two 500 MW Parsons generators, {{along with two}} 25 MW Avon gas turbines. However, in 1993, one of the station's two units, Unit 5, was converted to burn <b>orimulsion.</b> Its boilers were provided by Clarke Chapman Ltd. The station B had a single 152.5 m chimney, with a diameter of 12.5 m which tapered to 7.6 m. The station used a single hyperboloid induced draft cooling tower, which stood at 116.7 m tall.|$|E
50|$|Heavy {{oil sands}} and {{bituminous}} sands occur worldwide. The {{two most important}} deposits are the Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta, Canada and the Orinoco heavy oil belt in Venezuela. The hydrocarbon content of these deposits is either crude bitumen or extra-heavy crude oil, the former of which is often upgraded to synthetic crude (syncrude) and the latter of which the Venezuelan fuel <b>Orimulsion</b> is based. The Venezuelan extra heavy oil deposits differ from the Canadian bituminous sands in that they flow more readily at Venezuela's higher reservoir temperatures and could be produced by conventional techniques, but the recovery rates would be less than the unconventional Canadian techniques (about 8% versus up to 90% for surface mining and 60% for steam assisted gravity drainage).|$|E
50|$|Water {{continuous}} (oil-in-water) emulsified fuels are {{exemplified by}} the <b>Orimulsion</b> system and bitumen emulsions. These are often described as a high internal phase emulsions (hipe) because the continuous phase is around 30% of {{the composition of the}} fuel it is more usual for the dispersed phase to be the minor component. Water continuous emulsions of very heavy crudes, bitumen are easier to pump than the original fuel, which would require considerable heating and / or dilution with a distilled product (kerosene or light crude) in order to make them easy to handle. Water continuous emulsions of residual fuel, heavy fuel oils etc. which have a calorific value and are used in industrial applications can also be converted to emulsified fuels, thus reducing the need to use cutter fluids and improving the combustion emissions associated with the inferior fuels.|$|E
40|$|A bitumen-in-water {{emulsion}} (<b>Orimulsion)</b> {{is currently}} {{used as a}} fuel in several thermal power plants worldwide. <b>Orimulsion</b> combustion produces a fly ash rich in S, Mg, V and Ni, which is processed to recover metals. In order to assess the feasibility of a recycling in clay brick production, a characterization of the physico-chemical and thermal properties of ash was performed by ICP-OES, XRPD, SEM, BET and TGA-DTA techniques. <b>Orimulsion</b> ash resulted in fine-grained (aggregates of submicronic particles), highly hygroscopic, constituted mainly of magnesium sulphate, vanadyl sulphates and magnesium and nickel oxides, and thermally unstable in the usual brick firing conditions. These features can affect the brickmaking process, particularly the plasticity of the clay body and its drying and firing behaviour; furthermore, a mobilization of sulphates could occur, promoting the formation of efflorescence and/or the SOx release during firin...|$|E
40|$|Fuel oil # 6 is {{used for}} the {{production}} of electrical power in the United States. <b>Orimulsion</b> is being considered as an alternative fuel, but its value and risk compared to fuel oil # 6 need to be assessed. Our study examined the relative impact of accidental spills of the two hydrocarbons on the meiofaunal community. To do so, we maintained microcosms of the shallow, sandy, subtidal envi-ronment for three months. Treatment microcosms received a single application of hydrocarbon-coated sand. As indicators of effect, we used copepod and nematode abundance and copepod species diversity, sex ratio, fecundity, age structure, and neutral-lipid content. A comparison of the hydrocarbon treatments showed no significant differences. The tests had adequate power to detect ecologically significant changes. Our results indicate that a spill of <b>Orimulsion</b> would have approximately the same impact as a spill of fuel oil # 6 on the meiofauna...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{appraise}} the technological feasibility of the <b>Orimulsion</b> ash recycling in clay bricks, a laboratory simulation of the brickmaking process {{was carried out}} with various clay/ash mixtures up to 6 % waste. Two different clays were selected and mixes were characterized by XRF, XRPD, TGA-DTA, TDA and PSD analyses. Plasticity, extrusion and drying behaviour, and mechanical strength, were determined on unfired mixtures, while shrinkage, water absorption, bulk density, modulus of rupture, pore size distribution, microstructure and phase composition were measured on fired bricks. <b>Orimulsion</b> ash caused some detrimental changes of technological properties of both unfired and fired products, concerning particularly plasticity, drying rate and drying sensitivity, porosity and colour. These effects were slightly different on the two raw materials, the carbonate-rich clay being less sensitive {{to the presence of}} ash with respect to the carbonate-free clay. In all events, drawbacks appeared to be tolerable, in technological terms, for low waste additions, approximately 1 - 2 % ash...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} stability of clay bricks containing <b>Orimulsion</b> ash (up to 6 wt. %) was assessed with a laboratory simulation of the brickmaking process. The development of efflorescence, {{the amount of}} water soluble salts and their elution, the fraction of S, V, Ni, Mg, Ca, Na and K immobilized in the ceramic matrix, and the amount of volatile elements potentially released during firing were determined by ICP-OES, XRPD, TGA, SEM and EMP analyses. The stabilizing mechanism acts through the capture of metals into the crystalline structure of silicates formed at high temperature. However, the firing conditions adopted in the brick industry (about 900 degreesC) do not permit the complete reaction of sulphates; there is considerable efflorescence and soluble salts are formed, even with 1. 5 % of ash added, producing a risk of sulphate attack to the mortars. On the other hand, the decompostion of sulphates during firing could bring about remarkable SOx emissions, particularly in carbonate-free bodies. In conclusion, the disposal of <b>Orimulsion</b> ash in clay bricks must be practiced with caution and an amount of ash below I wt. % weight is strongly recommende...|$|E
40|$|Strains DBVPG 6662 and DBVPG 6739 of Rhodosporidium toruloides, a {{basidiomycete}} yeast, grew on thiosulfate as a sulfur {{source and}} glucose (2 g liter− 1 or 10. 75 mM) as a carbon source. DBVPG 6662 has a defective sulfate transport system, whereas DBVPG 6739 barely grew on sulfate. They were compared for {{the ability to}} use dibenzothiophene (DBT) and related organic sulfur compounds as sulfur sources. In the presence of glucose as a carbon source and DBT as a sulfur source, strain DBVPG 6662 grew better than DBVPG 6739. In the presence of thiosulfate as a sulfur source, the two yeast strains did not use DBT, DBT-sulfone, benzenesulfonic acid, biphenyl, and fluorene. When the two strains were grown in the presence of glucose, strain DBVPG 6662 transformed 27 % of the DBT present (10 μM) at a rate of 0. 023 μmol liter− 1 h− 1 in 36 h. Traces of 2, 2 ′-dihydroxylated biphenyl were transiently accumulated under these conditions. When the same strain was grown on glucose {{in the presence of a}} higher concentration of DBT (0. 5 g liter− 1), mainly in an insoluble form, the whole surface of the DBT crystals was colonized by a thick mycelium. This adherent structure was imaged by confocal microscopy with fluorescent concanavalin A, a lectin that specifically binds glucose and mannose residues. When DBVPG 6662 was grown on glucose in the presence of a commercial emulsion of bitumen, i. e., <b>orimulsion,</b> 68 % of the benzo- and dibenzothiophenes and DBTs was removed after 15 days of incubation. The fungus adhered by hyphae to <b>orimulsion</b> droplets. When cultivated in the presence of commercial emulsifier-free fuel oil containing alkylated benzothiophenes and DBTs and having a composition similar to that of <b>orimulsion,</b> strain DBVPG 6662 removed only 11 % of the total organic sulfur that occurs in the medium and did not adhere to the oil droplets. These results indicate that strain DBVPG 6662 is able to utilize the organic sulfur of DBT and a large variety of thiophenic compounds that occur extensively in commercial fuel oils by physically adhering to the organic sulfur source...|$|E
