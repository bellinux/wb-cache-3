5|$|The {{remaining}} settlers built a large two-story structure at {{the center}} of the settlement. The ground floor was divided into three rooms: one for La Salle, one for the priests, and one for the officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expedition.</b> The upper story consisted of a single room used to store supplies. Surrounding the fort were several smaller structures to provide shelter for the other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expedition.</b> The eight cannons, each weighing , had been salvaged from L'Aimable and were positioned around the colony for protection.|$|E
5|$|According to Gygax, {{both the}} {{scenario}} that became Expedition to the Barrier Peaks and Metamorphosis Alpha were successful at the convention. Although Metamorphosis Alpha became {{available to the}} general public in mid-1976, only a few copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Expedition</b> to the Barrier Peaks tournament adventure survived after the convention.|$|E
5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expedition</b> on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expedition</b> see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E

5|$|Four {{of the men}} deserted {{when they}} reached the Neches River. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for twomonths.

5|$|From {{thousands}} of applicants, Nansen selected {{a party of}} twelve. Otto Sverdrup from the Greenland expedition was appointed captain of Fram and second-in-command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expedition.</b> Competition for places on the voyage was such that reserve Army lieutenant and dog-driving expert Hjalmar Johansen signed on as ship's stoker, the only position available.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the chaos in Sparta, which effectively left Athens isolated, Darius decided to launch an amphibious expedition to finally punish Athens and Eretria.

5|$|The {{intervention}} was initially successful as Bolesław defeated Yaroslav's armies, and temporarily secured the throne for Sviatopolk.

5|$|To the {{surprise}} of the town, the surviving {{members of the group}} returned to San Antonio on December 6.

5|$|A last-minute gift of £4,000 from Shackleton's cousin William Bell {{still left}} the {{expedition}} {{far short of}} the required £30,000, but enabled Nimrods refit to be finished. Fundraising continued in Australia after the ship arrived there; a further £5,000 was provided as a gift from the Government of Australia, and the New Zealand Government gave £1,000. By these means, and with other smaller loans and donations, the £30,000 was raised, although by the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expedition</b> total costs had risen, by Shackleton's estimate, to £45,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{building}} boats, Lochry {{and his men}} set {{off from}} Wheeling, hoping {{to catch up with}} the main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expedition.</b> Meanwhile, Clark left Major Charles Cracraft with provisions and a small group of men on Camp Three Island to await Lochry's arrival. Further down the Ohio, Clark stopped at the mouth of the Kanawha River, but again he decided to keep moving in order to prevent desertion. Clark left a letter fastened to a pole which instructed Lochry to keep following.|$|E
5|$|After the expedition, the {{independent}} country of Darfur, and its inhabitants, {{became part of}} Sudan. The £500,000 bill for the cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>expedition</b> {{was sent to the}} Egyptian Government in Cairo for payment by the Egyptian taxpayers. The British commanders of the operation were also recognised. In 1917, Wingate became the British High Commissioner for Egypt. The commander of the Anglo-Egyptian expedition, Kelly, became the first Governor of the Darfur province with his office located in the Sultan's palace throne room until May 1917. He was then promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 5th Mounted Brigade, which was part of the Australian Mounted Division fighting in Palestine.|$|E
