5|$|One of {{the areas}} <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau {{created a}} tourist route {{that is a}} {{predecessor}} of the modern Great Lakes Circle Tours (GLCT). The Great Lakes Automobile Route {{was a series of}} roads on both the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan. It included US31 between Manistee and the Benton Harbor–St. Joseph area. The concept did not last a year; the American entry into World War I and a lack <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a single route consigned the idea into obscurity. The idea of a tourist route around the Great Lakes was revived in 1986 as a pet project of Michigan First Lady Paula Blanchard. MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario created the GLCT scheme which includes the LMCT that follows US31 from Lake Michigan Beach northward to Manistee and from Traverse City north to the terminus near Mackinaw City excluding locations where business loops run closer to the lake at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E

25|$|As climate change, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions and pollution have become a major issue for Australia, Sydney {{has in the past}} been criticised for its lack <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> reducing pollution, cutting back on emissions and maintaining water quality. Since 1995, there have been significant developments in the analysis of air pollution in the Sydney metropolitan region. The development led to the release of the Metropolitan Air Quality Scheme (MAQS), which led to a broader understanding of the causation of pollution in Sydney, allowing the government to form appropriate responses to the pollution.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} problems were cause {{by a lack}} <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> single market segments. ND had bought several software and hardware companies without a defined strategy, and often without adding new segments to the portfolio, as they often had overlapping products. The purchases {{were made in the}} hope that new software would bring new clients to choose ND hardware, which was the only product ND made profits from. Rolf Skår stated in 1988 that the company should focus on the banking industry, but this was never carried out. Sales had continued to fall during 1989, as customers were concerned that the Sintran-based product line would be discontinued.|$|E
25|$|As {{an early}} nineteenth century {{adventure}} novel, Percival Keene splits its focus between concerns of family and social connections and nautical action and seafaring. Percival narrates his story in first person, much like Marryat's stylistically similar Peter Simple, which also focuses {{on the life of}} a young midshipman in the Napoleonic Wars. Percival Keene was published a decade after Peter Simple, however, {{in the second half of}} Marryat's writing career which many critics regard as his transition into juvenile adventure fiction. Percival Keene could also be read as a form of bildungsroman novel; there is a great deal <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the titular protagonist's education and process of coming-of-age as he matures from age six to eighteen.|$|E

25|$|Beauty is a Wound is a {{novel by}} Indonesian author Eka Kurniawan, {{published}} in 2002. The novel weaves history into satire, tragedy and the supernatural to depict {{the state of the}} nation before, during and after the 1965 incidents. There is less focus on the military aspect of the coup, but a good deal <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the communists themselves through the form of interpersonal relationships and communist ghosts who could not find peace. Without meaning to, perhaps, the novel also gives readers a glimpse of the economy of Indonesia at the time using the example of a flourishing prostitute business and a temporary swimsuit business, among others. Kurniawan projects his feelings about the revolution and coup by constructing a story of theatrical characters around it and delivers a history of the nation all the way from Dutch occupation to Suharto.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 Mussolini was {{concerned}} that if Italian Fascism did not recognise Nordic heritage within Italians, that the Mediterranean inferiority complex would return to Italian society. Therefore, in summer 1938, the Fascist government officially recognised Italians as having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent and {{in a meeting with}} PNF members, and in June 1938 in a meeting with PNF members, Mussolini identified himself as Nordic and declared that previous policy <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> Mediterraneanism was {{to be replaced by a}} focus on Aryanism. Mussolini in July 1938 declared that Italians had strong Nordic heritage particularly through the heritage of the Germanic tribe of the Lombards who conquered Italy after the collapse of the Roman Empire and claimed that the intermixing of Mediterranean Romans with the Nordic Lombards was the last significant racial mixing that occurred in Italy and that none had occurred since.|$|E

25|$|The Passion of the Christ {{received}} enthusiastic {{support from}} the American evangelical community. Prior to the film's release, Gibson actively reached out to evangelical leaders seeking their support and feedback. With their help, Gibson organized and attended a series of prerelease screenings for evangelical audiences and discussed {{the making of the}} film and his personal faith. In June 2003 he screened the film for 800 pastors attending a leadership conference at New Life Church, pastored by Ted Haggard, then president of the National Association of Evangelicals. Gibson gave similar showings at Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church, Greg Laurie's Harvest Christian Fellowship, and to 3,600 pastors at a conference at Rick Warren's Saddleback Church in Lake Forest. From the summer of 2003 to the film's release in February 2004, portions or rough cuts of the film were shown to over eighty audiences—many of which were evangelical audiences. Gibson received numerous public endorsements from evangelical leaders, including Billy Graham, Robert Schuller, Darrell Bock, and David Neff, editor of Christianity Today. In an open letter published prior to the film's release, James Dobson, the founder and chairman <b>of</b> <b>Focus</b> <b>on</b> the Family, endorsed the film and defended it against its detractors. Similar public endorsements of the film were received from evangelical leaders Pat Robertson, Rick Warren, Lee Strobel, Jerry Falwell, Max Lucado, Tim LaHaye and Chuck Colson.|$|E
