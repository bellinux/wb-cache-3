40|$|International audienceThe {{coking process}} is {{composed}} of two main stages: drying process and pyrolysis of coal. A heat and mass transfer model was developed to simulate the drying process of coal. The mechanisms of heat and mass transfer described in the model are: conduction through the coal cake; conduction and convection through the gas in pores; generation, flux and condensation of water vapor. The model has been implemented in finite element software. It requires basic data on the coke oven charge properties and <b>oven</b> <b>dimensions</b> as input. These input data were obtained by experiments or from the literature. The proposed model includes condensation and evaporation allowing us to reproduce the temperature plateau observed experimentally...|$|E
50|$|Italian Community Bake Oven is a {{historic}} community bake oven located at Little Falls in Herkimer County, New York. It was built about 1891 and is abandoned. The utilitarian structure consists of a large rectangle of stone masonry outer walls enclosing the brick bake <b>oven.</b> The <b>dimensions</b> are approximately 16 feet wide, 20 feet deep, and 6 feet high. It was built to furnish large quantities of bread for Italian immigrant railroad workers in a work camp during 1891-1892.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{models of}} wood fired oven {{available}} today {{can be traced}} back to Ancient Greece. Staple cuisine of the Ancient Greeks included cereals for making bread, fruit, fish and meat. They built <b>ovens</b> in different <b>dimensions</b> according to what sort of bread they were baking.|$|R
30|$|The {{dimension}} of the specific gravity for each location was impossible to standardize due to the changing {{dimension of}} culm. Based on the paper reported by Ahmad [8], a 2.5 -cm section was used for specific gravity test, which {{was obtained from the}} middle portion of each internode at different culm heights. A total of 120 samples were prepared for specific gravity test. Volumetric shrinkage was estimated on green and <b>oven</b> dry volume <b>dimensions.</b> All of 120 samples for volumetric shrinkage studies were oven dried at 105  ±  2  °C until constant weight was obtained. The green volume of samples was determined using the water displacement method.|$|R
5000|$|Space-utilization. Since typical face-frames are 1+1/2 in {{wide and}} {{frameless}} side panels 3/4 in, {{access to the}} cabinet interior is 1+1/2 in wider for a typical frameless cabinet relative to a face-frame cabinet. A 12 in cabinet accommodates a 10 in drawer in frameless construction or a 8+1/2 in drawer in framed construction. The 1+1/2 in difference is most significant for narrower face-frame cabinets. Hence, the nomenclature [...] "full-access." [...] Custom (higher-cost) face-frame cabinets, which use one 1+1/2 in stile to frame two cabinet openings, can also accommodate wider drawers comparable to frameless cabinets. Frameless wall-oven cabinetry further saves 3 in of wall space {{as compared to the}} same wall-oven installed in a face-frame cabinet, Many, if not most, contemporary ovens (and other cabinet-front-mounted major appliances) have been designed with the space-utilization advantage of frameless cabinets installation in mind. The <b>oven</b> is <b>dimensioned,</b> and thermally insulated, to fit within an industry-standard external width 27 or 30 in cabinet cavity, less two standard 3/4 in cabinet side-wall thicknesses while providing for a small space between the oven box and the internal cabinet wall. In ovens, the bezel is sized to fit the full external cavity width and overlay the cabinet side wall. Such an installation avoids any unused lateral space around the oven. (While, hypothetically, ovens can be installed similarly in face-frame cabinets, such an installation may requires cutting away all but 3/4 in of each 1+1/2 in face-frame - specifically not recommended by vendors as it may weaken the joint between side-wall and face-frame - and buttressing face-frame cabinet side walls accordingly.) ...|$|R
40|$|Ever since Lucio Blandini {{developed}} a doubly curved synclastic shell with adhesively bonded glass components, {{the concept of}} building a self-supporting glass-only shell has almost become within reach. In the current contribution a small-scaled experimental concept is presented of a self-supporting anticlastic all-glass shell scale model, created {{by means of an}} adaptable mould. First, different manufacturing parameters of relatively small shells are investigated, such as mould type, glass supporting system and <b>dimensions,</b> <b>oven</b> temperature and shell curvature. Next, an adjustable mould for the bending of glass is developed, built and tested. With this mould it is possible to make glass panels synclastic and anticlastic in a great variety of forms. With this new moulding technique we were able to create different prototypes. They are forming the basis an intended larger shell, composed of smaller segments. The objective is to join the latter by using fusing techniques, which result is completely transparent monolithic all-glass shells. Therefore, additional experiments have been performed to explore different variants of glass fusion techniques to be applied for double curved glass shells...|$|R
