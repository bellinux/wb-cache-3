Should this occur, the wolves hold back, as they require the stimulus of a running animal {{to proceed with}} an attack. If the targeted animal stands its ground, the wolves either ignore it, <b>or</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> intimidate it into running.|$|E

Partly mentioned in the counter-suit included the notion that Slipknot were parodies of bands themselves, further citing the specific example of Mushroomhead, who wore near identical style masks and jumpsuits, and had been playing several years before Slipknot even formed, let alone went mainstream. Both suits were eventually dropped, and Burger King ended the campaign shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the film, Father John is {{warned that}} {{his role as}} a priest comes with boundaries, and that he should not become {{personally}} involved with the congregants <b>or</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> solve their problems except through counseling. However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on the lives of those in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life with meaning. He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her.|$|E

5|$|Violet Clay (1978) and A Mother and Two Daughters (1982) {{are each}} about an {{unmarried}} protagonist's career in a creative profession. In A Mother and Two Daughters {{the main character}} resists the temptation {{to get married and}} chooses instead to focus on her work. A Mother and Two Daughters and A Southern Family (1987) each depend heavily on a southern setting and employ themes traditionally associated with social problems in the South. Some of their themes include racial discrimination, social-economic class and the cultural differences between generations. Many characters struggle to reduce the gap between the rich and poor <b>or</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> break free from a dominant cultural tradition, with mixed success.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} {{for an average}} of 11days (range 10–16). Both adults incubate, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 11–12days after hatching, leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two or three weeks. If the nest is threatened, the non-incubating bird gives an alarm call so that the sitting parent and chicks stay still and quiet. A male blackcap may mob a potential predator, <b>or</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> lure it away with disjointed runs and flaps on the ground. The blackcap normally raises just one brood, but second nestings are sometimes recorded, particularly in the milder climate of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands; triple brooding has been observed once, the female laying a total of 23 eggs in the season.|$|E

25|$|Sampras was an all-court {{player who}} would often serve and volley. Possessing an {{all-around}} skill, {{in the early}} years of his career, when not serving, his strategy was to be offensive from the baseline, put opponents in a defensive position, and finish points at the net.

25|$|The housing {{cooperative}} {{is a special}} legal entity, regulated in Swedish law. It has the same obligations of bookkeeping and issuing annual reports as companies and it can take mortgages in the property if needed. In addition, each member may also take mortgages in his bostadsrätt in order to finance his acquisition of it. The monthly fee paid by the members to the cooperative is intended to cover the operational and financial expenditures of the cooperative. The financial situation of the Swedish cooperatives vary a lot, and on rare occasions cooperatives may go bankrupt. If bankruptcy occurs, the property is sold and the remaining assets are shifted out to the members (who may stay on as tenants <b>or</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> form a new cooperative).|$|E
25|$|As {{young males}} mature and leave their {{maternal}} groups, they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner {{and it is}} rare for serious fights to take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, roll their eyes, and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly {{pacing back and forth}} {{in front of the other}} male. They seek out females only during mating time. When they are with a herd of females, males do not coerce them <b>or</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.|$|E
25|$|Each play {{constitutes}} a down. The offence must advance {{the ball at}} least ten yards towards the opponents' goal line within three downs or forfeit the ball to their opponents. Once ten yards have been gained the offence gains {{a new set of}} three downs (rather than the four downs given in American football). Downs do not accumulate. If the offensive team completes 10 yards on their first play, they lose the other two downs and are granted another set of three. If a team fails to gain ten yards in two downs they usually punt the ball on third down <b>or</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> kick a field goal (see below), depending on their position on the field. The team may, however use its third down in an attempt to advance the ball and gain a cumulative 10 yards.|$|E

25|$|Having {{secured the}} coastal regions around the Jaba River, the {{squadron}} {{slowly began to}} move inland in order to strike into the enemy's rear, securing the many villages along the way. First they cleared to Sovele Mission, then the villages of Opai, Nihero and Morokaimoro, reaching Kilipaijino {{by the end of}} hostilities. As they went, each village taken became a patrol base and from there the squadron would gather topographical information such as track and terrain reports, and locate the enemy. Once sufficient information had been gathered and passed on to II Corps, the patrols would then attempt to ambush the enemy <b>or</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> take a prisoner. These raids were very effective in tying down the enemy and keeping them away from the 3rd Division's flanks, as they forced the Japanese to deploy troops to their rear areas, removing men from the front against which the larger infantry forces were then be able to engage.|$|E

A parent or legal guardian or custodian of a child younger than 18 years of age commits an offense if he/she consents to the participation by the child in a sexual performance. This crime requires proof of inducement.

25|$|However, when Apple {{contacted}} Revolution in 2009 {{to produce}} their {{games for the}} iOS, Revolution self-published Broken Sword - The Shadow of the Templars: Director's Cut and Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Remastered on the iPhone/iPad Store, and later on for PC and Mac on GoG.com, Steam and iTunes Store and for Android on Google Play; in the self-publishing model, Revolution was commissioned 70% of the revenue rather than 7%, meaning {{that the company was}} in a far stronger financial position than before. The commercial performance of the Broken Sword I and II reimaginations were also considerably stronger than the series' 3D entries, particularly on handheld platforms: The two remakes were purchased 500 thousand times, with downloads totaling five million through promotions, on the iOS in 2011 alone. Cecil credited Apple and digital distribution to saving indie developers such as Revolution, and reviving the adventure genre. This enabled the studio to partially self-fund their next title, The Serpent's Curse – 500 thousand dollars, earned with the success of the self-published releases, were spent on the game. Revolution then had to choose between making a shorter, more linear game with $500,000 with the length of the shortest Broken Sword, The Smoking Mirror, <b>or</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> raise money through crowd-funding to make an overall better game.|$|E
