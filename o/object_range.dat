50|$|The SMI {{microscope}} {{being developed}} at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics at Heidelberg University achieves this in the following manner: The illumination intensity within the <b>object</b> <b>range</b> is not uniform, unlike conventional wide field fluorescence microscopes, but is spatially modulated in a precise manner {{by the use of}} two opposing interfering laser beams along the axis. The principle of the spatially modulated wave field was developed in 1993 by Bailey et al. The SMI microscopy approach used in the Heidelberg application moves the object in high-precision steps through the wave field, or the wave field itself is moved relative to the object by phase shift. This results in an improved axial size and distance resolution.|$|E
5000|$|SARs {{produce a}} {{two-dimensional}} (2-D) image. One dimension {{in the image}} is called range and {{is a measure of}} the [...] "line-of-sight" [...] distance from the radar to the <b>object.</b> <b>Range</b> is determined by measuring the time from transmission of a pulse to receiving the echo from a target. Also, range resolution is determined by the transmitted pulse width.The other dimension is called azimuth and is perpendicular to range. The ability of SAR of producing relatively fine azimuth resolution makes it different from other radars.To obtain fine azimuth resolution, a physically large antenna is needed to focus the transmitted and received energy into a sharp beam. The sharpness of the beam defines the azimuth resolution. An airborne radar could collect data while flying this distance and process the data as if it came from a physically long antenna. The distance the aircraft flies in synthesizing the antenna is known as the synthetic aperture. A narrow synthetic beamwidth results from the relatively long synthetic aperture, which gets finer resolution than a smaller physical antenna.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a real-time model of terrain traversal by simulated human agents. Agent navigation includes {{a variety of}} simulated sensors, terrain reasoning with behavioral constraints, and detailed simulation {{of a variety of}} locomotion techniques. The path through the terrain is incrementally computed by a behavioral reasoning system configuring a behavioral feedback network.

The behavioral reasoner weighs this information along with collision avoidance, cost, danger minimization, locomotion types, and other behaviors available to the agent and incrementally attempts to reach a goal location. Since the system is reactive, it can respond to moving obstacles, changing terrain, or unexpected events due to hostile agents or the effects of limited perception.

In Gabor transform, a signal can be represented in terms of sinusoids that are modulated by translated Gaussian windows. The resulting time- frequency decomposition is a suite of local Fourier transforms which displays any nonstationary spectral trends.

40|$|A new {{hand-held}} laser range scanner is introduced that can capture multi-view range images {{of an object}} and integrate the images without registering them.
