40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of different strategies <b>of</b> <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in improving students' written accuracy. 20 students were recruited and divided into two groups, direct and indirect group. This {{study was conducted in}} 3 stages; pre-test, treatment, and post-test. Feedback was provided in treatment stage where group one students received direct corrective feedback while group two students received indirect corrective feedback. The errors made on each stage were marked and counted to be used to compare among each stage of their writings as well as between the two groups. The results showed that students who received direct corrective feedback outperformed students who received indirect corrective feedback in the post-test. In addition, the results also showed that although the mean number of errors made by indirect feedback group did not decrease in post-test, the mean number of errors made decrease in their revised texts. Thus, it can be concluded that indirect corrective feedback was an effective tool in helping students retaining their language learning over a period of time. Interviews were also conducted to gain insights on other factors that affect students’ writing performance. Based on the results gained, two themes which influence the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> on students’ writing are motivation and scaffolding. Three anecdotal findings were also collected through the interviews. They are related to students expressing their concern on content-related knowledge when writing an essay. In addition, students also stated that teachers should apply mix strategies when correcting different types of errors made by the students based on the severity. Last, but not least, the interview also revealed the impact of students’ exam-orientedness on their language learning. The results of the study suggest that to some extent, written corrective feedback is effective in reducing students’ error in their writing.

40|$|Most second {{language}} researchers {{agree that there}} is a role for <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in {{second language}} writing classes. However, many unanswered questions remain concerning which linguistic features to target and the type and amount of feedback to offer. This study examined two new pieces <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> by 151 learners of English as a Second Language (ESL), in order to investigate the effect of direct and metalinguistic written feedback on errors with the simple past tense, the present perfect tense, dropped pronouns, and pronominal duplication. This inquiry also considered the extent to which learner differences in language-analytic ability (LAA), as measured by the LLAMA F, mediated the effects of these two types <b>of</b> explicit <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback.</b> Learners in the feedback groups were provided with <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> on two essays, after which learners in all three groups completed two additional writing tasks {{to determine whether or not}} the provision of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> led to greater gains in accuracy compared to no feedback.

Subsequently, a synthesis of empirical arguments with respect to the effectiveness of WCF, the relative merits of various WCF options, and the amenability of different error categories to WCF are presented. Based on all the evidence, two common limitations: the focus on form-oriented WCF options and the narrow range of target errors are critically discussed in the final part. It concludes by suggesting that an integration between such learning enhancing variables as micro context and written feedback, and that an extension of target structure from learners ’ rule-governed errors to their non rule-governed errors should be investigated in future WCF studies so that fresh insights for WCF research could be achieved on one hand and pedagogical implications for L 2 classroom instruction could be offered on the other...|$|E

One experimental group received indirect focused written CF, and the other experimental group received indirect unfocused written CF for six weeks. The control group, nevertheless, received no particular feedback within this period. Results of performing ANOVA with post-hoc tests revealed the accuracy development of both experimental groups. However, unfocused group achieved the highest accuracy gain scores for simple past tense forms (copula past tense, regular past tense and irregular past tense) subject-verb agreement, articles, and prepositions. It was further found that unfocused feedback can contribute to grammatical accuracy but its long-term effectiveness {{is not quite as}} significant as its short-term effectiveness. The study also suggested that unfocused written CF reflects better teacher’s objective as it views writing correction as a whole rather than as a way of practicing grammar...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of research that has investigated the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> (WCF) on ESL student writing. In doing so, it highlights a number of shortcomings in the design of some studies and explains {{what needs to be done}} in future research so that answers to the issues that have been raised can be effectively addressed. The article reports on a two-month study (with 144 international and migrant ESL students in Auckland, New Zealand) that investigated the extent to which different WCF options (direct corrective feedback, written and oral meta-linguistic explanation; direct corrective feedback and written meta-linguistic explanation; direct corrective feedback only; no corrective feedback) help students improve their accuracy in the use of two functional uses of the English article system (referential indefinite ‘a ’ and referential definite ‘the’). The study found (1) that students who received all three WCF options outperformed those who did not receive WCF, (2) that their level of accuracy was retained over seven weeks and (3) that there was no difference in the extent to which migrant and international students improved the accuracy of their writing as a result of WCF...|$|E

This corrective practice seems to shape learner expectations of the type of feedback that is most effective or useful to them (Hedgcock and Lefkowitz 1996). In the context <b>of</b> teaching academic <b>writing,</b> this may easily pose a problem for allocating teacher resources away from teaching writing as a process to taking care of the learner language issues. Nowadays, e-platforms designed specifically to cater for academic writing offer a new range of feedback possibilities for teachers. Tasks pertaining particularly to language use can, for example, be created so that the feedback is fully automated. The easy and immediate access to such feedback is beneficial for learners with different proficiency levels (Brandl 1995). In our course, in order to free teacher resources for feedback on students’ critical thinking, treatment of sources, structure and context, we used automated feedback, i. e. direct corrections with metalinguistic comments generated within the e-platform, to feedback on skill building exercises pertaining to grammar, style and idiomaticity. Previous research indicates that direct <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> on mechanical errors is efficient in facilitating learning (see Sheen 2007 for an overview of the field). In a pilot study on student experience <b>of</b> the <b>writing</b> process, we noticed that the level of student satisfaction with this automated feedback was surprisingly high and valued as much as the extensive written teacher feedback on papers submitted for examination. In our current study, we explore the impact automated feedback has on student experience of learning skills pertaining to the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> as described above from beginner to advanced students <b>of</b> academic <b>writing.</b> Some <b>of</b> the factors we consider are the immediacy/remoteness of the feedback, the extent of the metalinguistic comment and the connection of the skill building exercises to the teaching materials.

Besides that, it also looked into how teacher direct <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> affecting students’ usage of grammatical forms in their writing. Furthermore, the study also aimed at finding the students’ perception towards teacher direct <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in their <b>writing.</b> The study employed quasi-experimental research design and the data was obtained from a set of pre-test and posttest and also interview. As indicated from the findings from twenty semester one Diploma in Hospitality and Management students from SEGi University, {{the results of the}} study showed that the students of this study bene fitted from teacher direct <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> and showed improvement in the usage of some grammatical forms which were articles, conjunction and pronoun. The findings also showed that the majority of the students of this study perceived teacher direct <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> as useful and helpful in helping them in improving their grammatical accuracy in their writing and they want the teacher to continue providing direct <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in their <b>writing.</b> The findings were hoped to shed light in the importance of the practice of giving feedback to students’ writing...|$|R
