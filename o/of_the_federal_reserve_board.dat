500|$|According to {{newspapers}} reporting Lane's death, it {{was said}} that had he been born in the United States he would have been elected President. Following Lane's death, a memorial committee was formed by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and former Lane assistant and member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>Board</b> Adolph C. Miller. The committee established a Franklin K. Lane Memorial Fund, initially dedicated to the support of Lane's widow, Anne Lane, and upon her death to be used to promote causes in which her husband believed. [...] The two future presidents, Miller, and National Park Service Director Mather were among the major contributors to the fund. [...] In 1939, after Mrs. Lane's death, the corpus of the trust (just over $100,000) was transferred to the former Secretary's alma mater, the University of California, to promote the understanding and improvement of the American system of democratic government. Fifty years later, the entrusted amount, still administered by the University, had grown to almost $1.9 million. In November 1921, Lane Peak in Mount Rainier National Park was named for the former Secretary. Other tributes to Lane included a World War II Liberty ship, a New York City high school, and a California redwood grove. Lane's patriotic essay [...] "Makers of the Flag" [...] adapted from a speech he delivered to Interior Department employees on Flag Day 1914, continues to be reprinted as a speech and in schoolbooks.|$|E
500|$|The Federal Reserve began operations... as a {{peculiar}} hybrid, a partly public, partly private institution, {{intended to be}} independent of political influence with principal officers of the government on its supervisory board, endowed with central banking functions, but not a central bank. [...] Each of the twelve semiautonomous reserve banks set its own discount rates, subject to the approval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>Board</b> in Washington, made its own policy decisions, and set its own standards for what was eligible for discounting.Reflecting this intellectual heritage, Meltzer emphasizes (in common with Friedman and Schwartz in their Monetary History of the United States) the influence on {{the founders of the}} Fed of: (i) the assumption, which was to prove unfounded, that the gold standard would continue to prevail, and (ii) the then widely held (and now discredited) real bills doctrine, which advocated restricting central bank credit to the discounting of commercial paper. [...] In Chapter 3, Meltzer covers the establishment of the Fed and its first decade of operations, a period when, as he shows, key issues such as the respective roles and powers of the Board and the (regional) Federal Reserve Banks were far from settled. [...] These were among the questions eventually addressed in the Banking Act of 1935, which made major changes to the 1913 framework, mainly in the direction of centralizing authority in the Board {{at the expense of the}} regional Federal Reserve Banks. [...] The 1935 Act also weakened the legislative mandate for the Fed to follow the dictates of the real bills doctrine (Meltzer, Chapter 6).|$|E

With its opening paragraph, the guidance provided one of the most fundamental principles in auditing, stating that [...] "the responsibility for the extent of the (audit) work required must be assumed by the auditor." [...] In 1936 the AICPA revised its prior pronouncements and issued Examination of Financial Statements by Independent Public Accountants, which contained more detailed guidance on performing audit procedures for audits of small and mid-sized companies, while still emphasizing the need to perform the audit based on the nature of the client, its size, and its internal control structure, among other attributes.|$|E

[...] Hawkins is known best of all for the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, which Hawkins sponsored in 1977 alongside the legendary Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota.

"Obama {{administration}} officials [...] regrouped to identify Fed candidates after Peter Diamond, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, withdrew his {{nomination to the}} board in June [...] {{in the face of}} Republican opposition. Richard Clarida, a potential nominee who was a Treasury official under George W. Bush, pulled out of consideration in August [...] ", one account of the December nominations noted. The two other Obama nominees in 2011, Yellen and Raskin, were confirmed in September. One of the vacancies was created in 2011 with the resignation of Kevin Warsh, who took office in 2006 to fill the unexpired term ending January 31, 2018, and resigned his position effective March 31, 2011. In March 2012, U.S. Senator David Vitter (R, LA) said he would oppose Obama's Stein and Powell nominations, dampening near-term hopes for approval. However Senate leaders reached a deal, paving the way for affirmative votes on the two nominees in May 2012 and bringing the board to full strength {{for the first time since}} 2006 with Duke's service after term end. [...] Later, on January 6, 2014, the United States Senate confirmed Yellen's nomination to be Chair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>Board</b> of Governors; she is slated to be the first woman to hold the position and will become Chair on February 1, 2014.

2500|$|Upon {{entering}} office, Obama {{focused on}} handling {{the global financial}} crisis and the subsequent Great Recession, which was generally regarded as the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. On February 17, 2009, Obama signed into law a $787 billion economic stimulus bill that included spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. The tax provisions of the law temporarily reduced taxes for 98 percent of taxpayers, bringing tax rates to their lowest levels in 60 years. The Obama administration would later argue that the stimulus saved the United States from a [...] "double-dip" [...] recession. Obama asked for a second major stimulus package in December 2009, but no major second stimulus bill passed. Obama also launched a second bailout of US automakers, possibly saving General Motors and Chrysler from bankruptcy {{at the cost of}} $9.3 billion. For homeowners in danger of defaulting on their mortgage due to the subprime mortgage crisis, Obama launched several programs, including HARP and HAMP. Obama re-appointed Ben Bernanke as Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>Board</b> in 2009, and appointed Janet Yellen to succeed Bernanke in 2013. Short-term interest rates remained near zero for much of Obama's presidency, and the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates during Obama's presidency until December 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Mellon became unpopular {{with the}} onset of the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover, in memoirs {{published}} decades later, wrote that Mellon advised him as President to [...] "liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate... it will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. People will work harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up from less competent people." [...] Hoover claimed credit for disregarding this advice and intervening in the market, though with little success. There is no corroboration that Mellon ever said such a thing, however, and the claim that he did is inconsistent with his published speeches, which supported anti-recessionary measures by the Federal Reserve. As Treasury Secretary, Mellon was an ex-officio member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>Board.</b> There, he successfully urged the Fed to cut its discount rate after the stock market crash in October 1929, and supported subsequent rate cuts, although only a third of the commercial banks were a part of the Federal Reserve and could benefit from the rate cuts. In November 1929, he recommended a cut of 1 percentage point in personal and corporate income tax rates. He supported Hoover's proposal to increase federal construction spending as an antirecession measure.|$|E

2500|$|As a teenager, Hambro pestered {{his father}} for a trumpet, {{but it was his}} brother-in-law, Harold Segal (older sister Adelaide's husband), who {{introduced}} 15-year-old Hambro to woodwinds, giving him a soprano saxophone and introductory music lessons. (Harold Segal played both the tenor saxophone and clarinet semi-professionally with an Irish band for a time.) By all accounts, Hambro quickly eclipsed his brother-in-law, taking every music class in which he could enroll. As a high school student, Hambro took private lessons from Bill Sheiner, one of the leading music teachers and session musicians in New York City. Sheiner taught in a studio behind the Bronx Musical Mart at 174th Street and Southern Boulevard, between Lenny's school and home. (Stan Getz and future Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>Board,</b> Alan Greenspan, were fellow students of Sheiner.) Sheiner played multiple instruments - clarinet, saxophone, flute, and oboe - and most of his students were trying to simultaneously learn two similar instruments. [...] Sheiner employed two books that are still standard texts: The Universal Complete Saxophone Method, and Klosé Complete Clarinet Method. During this period, Sheiner, who had worked in Shep Fields' all-saxophone band, decided to build his own all-sax band with eight of his students. With Sheiner as frontman, and a drummer, pianist, and bassist, the band included both Lenny and Stan Getz as well as Sol Schlinger, Irving Frank, Red Press, Jerry Grosser, Stan Yuden and Alan Kimmel. The band worked up some arrangements and auditioned for Maria Kramer, who owned both the Lincoln and Edison hotels (both featured dance bands) but the WWII draft intervened and the band quickly disbanded. During his later high-school years, Hambro played alto sax, tenor sax, clarinet, and flute in an assortment of teen dance bands, including a summer in the Catskills, playing occasional gigs in the evenings, while working as a lifeguard during the day at a resort hotel pool. (Years later, Hambro would return to the Catskills, playing with Machito's Orchestra at the Concord Resort Hotel, and during another summer, had his own quintet in the lounge.) ...|$|E
