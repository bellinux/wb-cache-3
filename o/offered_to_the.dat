5|$|The {{only time}} in the year when {{separate}} food is cooked for the goddess is when she is offered non-vegetarian offerings. During Durga Puja, Vimala is offered non-vegetarian food and animal sacrifice, traditionally <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hindu Mother Goddess. The goddess is considered to assume a destructive form during the festival and the meat is considered necessary to placate her. In strict secrecy during the pre-dawn hours, animal sacrifice of a he-goat is offered in the temple, while fish from the sacred Markanda temple tank are cooked and offered to Vimala, as per Tantric rituals. The rituals have to be completed before {{the doors of the}} main sanctum of the vegetarian Jagannath are opened at dawn and the first morning aarti is <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> god. Vaishnava devotees of Jagannath are debarred from the temple. Only a few who witness the ceremony are given the Bimala parusa (Vimala's cuisine) as prasad. The animal sacrifice and the non-vegetarian offerings to Vimala produced protests.|$|E

5|$|Delhi's {{association}} and geographic {{proximity to the}} capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance of national events and holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day (15 August) and Gandhi Jayanti. On Independence Day, the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort. Most Delhiites celebrate the day by flying kites, which are considered a symbol of freedom. The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military strength. Over the centuries, Delhi has become known for its composite culture, and a festival that symbolises this is the Phool Walon Ki Sair, which takes place in September. Flowers and pankhefans embroidered with flowersare <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shrine of 13th century Sufi saint Khwaja Bakhtiyar Kaki and the Yogmaya temple, both situated in Mehrauli.|$|E

In our control, the uninformed player makes an <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> informed player prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> submission of <b>offers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arbitrator.

5|$|Generally, no {{separate}} food offerings {{are cooked}} for the goddess Vimala. The goddess is described {{to survive on}} the remnants (Ucchishta) of Jagannath's meals. The vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as Mahaprasad (see also prasad). The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd and butter. The Shankaracharya, head of the Govardhana matha, receives a pot of the mahaprasad {{and a plate of}} khichdi that is <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> goddess, the presiding goddess (Adya-shakti) of the matha {{as well as of the}} temple.|$|E

Bahadur Shah had grown apprehensive {{of the power of}} the Mughal emperor Humayun and he was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the islands of Mumbai and Bassein were <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese. Bassein and the seven islands were surrendered later by a treaty of peace and commerce between Bahadur Shah and Nuno da Cunha, Viceroy of Portuguese India, on 25 October 1535, ending the Islamic rule in Mumbai.|$|E

As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E
