5|$|Guido Karl Anton List {{was born}} on 5 October 1848 in Vienna, then part of the Austrian Empire.

Guido's mother, Marian List, was the {{daughter}} of builder's merchant Franz Anton Killian. List was raised in the city's second bezirk, on {{the eastern side of the}} Danube canal. Like most Austrians at the time, his family were members of the Roman Catholic denomination of Christianity, with List being christened into this faith at St Peter's Church in Vienna.

5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts <b>of</b> <b>Karl</b> Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E

Phillip Fahrbach also denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the KK Hofballmusikdirektor when the latter first applied for the post. The German operetta composer Jacques Offenbach, who made his name in Paris, also posed a challenge to Strauss in the operetta field.|$|E

5|$|James Frain plays Kieran Ashton, {{a former}} {{colleague}} <b>of</b> <b>Karl,</b> who faked his suicide {{and became the}} Truth Terrorist, serving as the primary antagonist.

Frain believed that Kieran is the most disturbing character he has played. Portraying the character, the actor wanted to make his actions understandable, though not justifiable.|$|E
