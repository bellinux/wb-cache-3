5|$|In central Europe, {{this species}} has been {{recently}} {{introduced in the}} Austrian Danube, where it was first recorded in Tulln, Lower Austria in 2001. In the Czech Republic, it is now extinct in Bohemia; the only findings were in the Elbe river near Litoměřice in 1917, {{and the most recent}} findings of empty shells took place in 1943. Theodoxus fluviatilis also occurs in Poland, in Slovakia where it is non-indigenous since 2002, and in Hungary. Zettler (2008) provided a detailed bibliography of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>T.</b> fluviatilis in Germany. The indigenous distribution <b>of</b> <b>T.</b> fluviatilis included all of the large rivers: Rhine, Main, Moselle, Neckar, Weser, Elbe and Oder.

5|$|In {{the first}} attempt to {{understand}} the many species, Lull found two groups, {{although he did not}} say how he distinguished them: one composed <b>of</b> <b>T.</b> horridus, T. prorsus, and T. brevicornus; the other <b>of</b> <b>T.</b> elatus and T. calicornis. Two species (T. serratus and T. flabellatus) stood apart from these groups. By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull monograph of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage <b>of</b> <b>T.</b> obtusus and T. hatcheri that was characterized by a very small nasal horn. T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus was now thought to be the most conservative lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size, and T. elatus-T. calicornis was defined by large brow horns and small nasal horn. C. M. Sternberg made one modification, adding T. eurycephalus and suggesting that it linked the second and third lineages closer together than they were to the T. horridus lineage. This pattern was followed until the major studies of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

Isolation <b>of</b> <b>T.</b> cruzi can occur by inoculation into mice, by culture in specialized media (for example, NNN, LIT); and by xenodiagnosis, where uninfected Reduviidae bugs are fed on the patient's blood, and their gut contents examined for parasites.|$|E
25|$|With these definitions, the resolvent set <b>of</b> <b>T</b> is {{the set of}} all complex numbers ζ {{such that}} Rζ exists and is bounded. This set often is denoted as ρ(T). The {{spectrum}} <b>of</b> <b>T</b> is the set of all complex numbers ζ such that Rζ fails to exist or is unbounded. Often the spectrum <b>of</b> <b>T</b> is denoted by σ(T). The function Rζ for all ζ in ρ(T) (that is, wherever Rζ exists as a bounded operator) is called the resolvent <b>of</b> <b>T.</b> The spectrum <b>of</b> <b>T</b> is therefore the complement of the resolvent set <b>of</b> <b>T</b> in the complex plane.

25|$|Any {{subspace}} {{spanned by}} eigenvectors <b>of</b> <b>T</b> is an invariant subspace <b>of</b> <b>T,</b> and the restriction <b>of</b> <b>T</b> {{to such a}} subspace is diagonalizable.

50|$|Now that we {{know our}} valid {{measuring}} lives, we can see which interests in Blackacre are valid. Obviously, the life estate to T's children is valid as they are the measuring lives.

T's children are our measuring lives, all <b>of</b> <b>T's</b> grandchildren must be born before the last <b>of</b> <b>T's</b> children dies (or, at least be in the womb, which counts as being alive for rule against perpetuities purposes), meaning their interest would vest within 21 years of a measuring life. T's great-grandchildren's interest is invalidated by the rule. Why? Because T's grandchildren are free to reproduce after all <b>of</b> <b>T's</b> children have died. It is possible that one <b>of</b> <b>T's</b> grandchildren could have a child more than 21 years after T's last child dies, meaning the interest might not vest within 21 years of a life in being and thus the gift is to that extent void under the rule.|$|R
