50|$|To {{accommodate}} future growth, in 1998 Vienna Airport {{published a}} master plan that <b>outlined</b> <b>expansion</b> projects until 2015. These projects included a new office park, railway station, cargo center, general aviation center, air traffic control tower, terminal, and runway. Additionally, the plan called for streamlined security control. The centerpiece of the enlargement was the new terminal, dubbed Skylink during its construction. In 2002, the airport's management estimated that building the new terminal will cost €401.79 million. However, costs skyrocketed and in 2009 stood at an estimated €929.5 million. The Austrian Court of Audit then recommended that the airport implement several cost-savings measures, which in the Court's estimate brought down final costs to €849.15 million, still {{more than double the}} original plans.|$|R

40|$|Although {{efforts to}} {{encourage}} whistleblowers in the United States {{to come forward}} date back to 1778, the country's treatment of whistleblowers has been a conflicted one. Most recently, this reluctance to brand whistleblowers as heroes {{may be seen in}} the wide range of responses to Edward Snowden's revelations about the extent of our own government's surveillance operations. While some commentators have pilloried Snowden and branded him a traitor, privacy advocates and foreign governments have praised his courage. Perhaps reflecting these conflicting sentiments, current protections in the U. S. are a patchwork collection of narrowly tailored, industry-specific legislative acts. In some cases, legislatures have implemented protections on the heels of public disclosures of industry fraud. To an increasingly extent however, lawmakers have anticipated the need for whistleblower protections with the enactment of new federal spending initiatives.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} in systems biology is the analysis of often complex biochemical reacation networks which contain many uncertain parameters. Typically, the dynamics of these systems strongly depends on {{a significant amount of}} parameters, hampering the analysis significantly as even the small changes {{in the value of the}} parameters can have significant influences on the overall behaviour of the entire network. Thus one of the key problems in systems biology is to analyse the influence of parameters on the steady state and transient behaviour. In the first part of this work we derive links between first order sensitivity analysis as typically employed in systems biology and the concepts of controllability and observability of systems theory. Specifically we establish a close connection between cross Gramians and the so called response coefficients as used in Metabolic Control Analysis. In a second part we <b>outline</b> an <b>expansion</b> of this approach using empirical cross Gramians, allowing to overcome some of the limitations of first order sensitivity methods such as local validity...|$|R

40|$|Brazilan {{agriculture}} is characteristically dynamic, land and production resources have a skewed ownership distribution, and agricultural production {{is essential for}} small holders of rural poor regions. Also, the main agricultural land use is composed of pastures where extensive livestock production prevails. Because of increasing demand Brazil is expected to expand its sugarcane based ethanol production. Addressing concerns about social and environmental impacts of such an expansion requires careful consideration {{of the complexity of}} Brazilian agriculture in general and specific local conditions in particular. This paper <b>outlines</b> an <b>expansion</b> model for sugarcane ethanol production that is sensitive to socioeconomic and environmental concerns. Through integration with the prevailing land use, the model avoids the usual displacement of extensive livestock production to remote regions, causing leakage effects with deforestation, promotes milk and beef cattle intensification, and investment opportunities for local society. The expansion model is feasible at current market conditions and should have good prospects for complying with sustainability criteria within various certification schemes presently under development.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} how hope takes place, {{in order to}} outline an explicit theory of the more-than-rational or less-than rational {{in the context of}} the recent attunement to issues of the affectual and emotional in social and cultural geography. In the first part of the paper I <b>outline</b> an <b>expansion</b> of the more-than-rational or less-than-rational into three modalities: affect, feeling, and emotion. From this basis I question an assumption in the literature on affect that the emergence and movement of affect enable the multiplication of forms of life because they takes place ‘in excess’. In the second part of the paper I exemplify an alternative, more melancholy account through a description of the emergence of hope and hopefulness in two cases in which recorded music is used by individuals to ‘feel better’. Emergent from disruptions in various forms of diminishment, hopefulness moves bodies into contact with an ‘outside’. Becoming and being hopeful raise a set of issues for a theory of affect because of, rather than despite, the sense of tragedy that is intimate with how hope heralds the affective and emotive as always ‘not-yet become’. The conclusion, therefore, draws the two parts of the paper together by reflecting on the implications of thinking from hope for both a theory of affect and an affective cultural politics...|$|R

In the 1920 s and 1930 s these were major areas of development, laying down the foundations of these sectors. The paper also considers why nature-based tourism expanded in these decades.

The separate means-testing process for tax credits has been criticised by some as bureaucratic, and in 2003-04 and 2004-05 problems in the system led to overpayments of £2.2bn and £1.8bn respectively. However, economic theory suggests tax credits can strengthen work incentives for those at the margin between employment and unemployment, and the IFS has estimated the reforms brought at least 50,000 single mothers into part-time work.|$|R

The problem {{of the formation of}} molecules (principally H 2) at the surfaces of interstellar dust grains is considered in Chapter I. It is shown that the amounts of formed are sufficient to maintain the interstellar gas at 100 °K. The results obtained for CH, CH show that the mechanism considered does not lead to absurd results under the conditions assumed. The importance of at high densities is also discussed. Chapter II deals with a theory of star formation in a medium composed of randomly moving cloudlets or floccules. An outline is given of a recent paper by McCrea who shows that this idea leads to a satisfactory account of the formation of the solar system and removes the angular momentum difficulty of other star formation theories. The collisions of floccules are considered in detail and a theory of the gravitational capture of the fragments of collision is <b>outlined.</b> The <b>expansion</b> of a fully ionised gas into avacuum is discussed in Chapter III. This problem is connected with a recent theory of galaxy formation. The expansion of a monatomic gas and Lagrange's Ballistic problem are first considered. The latter leads to a new model for a freely expanding gas. It is then shown that, if the fully ionised gas remains neutral, by suitably defining the sound speed the equations for a fully ionised gas may be reduced to those for a monatomic gas. Finally in Chapter IV, Hoyle's theory of the origin of the angular velocities of galaxies is reviewed. A specific model based on this theory is discussed.
