He visited the camp on several occasions representing Joe Maplin. On one occasion, Peggy asked him permission to become a Yellowcoat, although he turned her down.

2500|$|Considered [...] "strapped for cash", the Liberal Party ran a {{very limited}} {{television}} and radio campaign.

During the election campaign, David Pisoni, the Liberal candidate for Unley, made allegations in his advertising that Labor and their candidate Michael Keenan supported controversial urban infill programmes, which Labor flatly denied. Electoral Commissioner Kay Mousley investigated and ordered that the advertisements be withdrawn and corrections be run at Pisoni's expense.|$|E

Reforms in agriculture figured prominently, especially in the export crop sectors which during the 1990 s accounted for almost two thirds of total merchandize exports.

Despite the reforms, several issues must are still <b>outstanding.</b> <b>Taxes</b> should be consolidated, lowered, and rationalized. Licensing procedures need to be re-examined. The coffee auction should be voluntary so the costs of vertically integrated exporters will be reduced and cross-border trade will be enhanced. The power of the board and the relevant ministries ought to be substantially reduced and their respective roles clearly defined. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
