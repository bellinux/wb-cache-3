5|$|Fortunately for Villiers, {{his case}} {{was not to}} be prosecuted with the utmost rigour. He was to some degree {{protected}} by the joint efforts of Boringdon's friends and the Whig George Tierney, as well as his own quick action in surrendering his property through writs of extent; and the delinquency of Joseph Hunt, Treasurer of the Ordnance attracted attention and saved Villiers from the full wrath of the finance committee. Their report on the matter noted that the writ <b>of</b> <b>extent</b> had been to the amount of £264,000, but only £91,000 had been raised from the sale of his property, and about £30,000 from securities and the bond posted for him when he took office. The committee recommended the abolition of the office of Paymaster of Marines and the transfer of its duties to the Treasurer of the Navy, a recommendation which was not immediately acted upon. Villiers was left, in Boringdon's estimation, with a debt of £1,500–2,000, an annual income of £2,000–3,000, and the property in Cranbourne Lodge.|$|E

25|$|Eosinophilia {{is not a}} {{reliable}} measure <b>of</b> <b>extent</b> of infection because it varies from individual to individual. Some cases with multiple pairs of worms have reported low eosinophil levels, while other cases with a single pair had very high eosinophil counts. Such variation {{may be due to}} the lack of host tissue invasion by the parasite, since M. laryngeus attaches to the mucosal epithelium in the tracheolaryngeal region. A singular case even found worms within a cyst.|$|E

25|$|The diet is {{generally}} more diverse {{than any other}} co-existing owl but often focuses predominantly on a particular range of prey species, with two to four species often making {{up the majority of}} the diet. Studies conducted over the course of years has shown that the regional diet often changes dramatically from year to year. This is partially driven by the cyclical population trends of much of their prey as well as by habitat changes, which are often due to human activities. The primary prey species varies by region but is comprised mainly by small mammals such as voles, rats, mice, rabbits and hares. In Europe, the five main prey species are, in order <b>of</b> <b>extent</b> of reporting and numeric abundance in dietary studies: the brown rat (Rattus norvegius), which has now occupied edge habitats (although generally associated with man) in almost every part of Europe excluding the colder north; the common vole (Microtus arvalis), often the most abundant native, small mammal in wild portions of Europe; the European hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), which occupies wooded edges across western Europe alongside the eagle-owls; the European water vole (Arvicola amphibius), a unique, large vole occupying the wetland edges often hunted by eagle-owls; and the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which has a very close relationship with the eagle-owls found throughout the Iberian Peninsula and the massifs of France. As the distribution of the Eurasian eagle-owls moves west (and south), the primarily prey species gradually change but often continues to be dominated in number by small rodents and in biomass by slightly larger mammals such as hedgehogs and hares and rabbits.|$|E
500|$|In October 2015, {{astronomer}} Jean-Luc Margot of the University of California Los Angeles {{proposed a}} metric for orbital zone clearance derived from whether an object can clear an orbital zone <b>of</b> <b>extent</b> 2√3 of its Hill radius {{in a specific}} time scale. This metric places a clear dividing line between the dwarf planets and the planets of the solar system. The calculation {{is based on the}} mass of the host star, the mass of the body, and the orbital period of the body. An Earth-mass body orbiting a solar-mass star clears its orbit at distances of up to 400 astronomical units from the star. [...] A Mars-mass body at the orbit of Pluto clears its orbit. This metric, which leaves Pluto as a dwarf planet, applies to both the Solar System and to extrasolar systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{concepts}} of everywhere and somewhere generate three spatial extents: (1) everywhere, (2) somewhere but not everywhere, and (3) nowhere. These three extents {{can be used}} for the granular description of spatial regions. When spatio-temporal regions are considered there are two additional concepts: always and sometimes. The interaction of the four concepts can be used to produce various systems <b>of</b> spatio-temporal <b>extents.</b> The paper shows that if we want to give granular descriptions of spatio-temporal regions, then the system <b>of</b> <b>extents</b> needs to be chosen carefully. A suitable system <b>of</b> eleven spatio-temporal <b>extents</b> is identi- ed, and a simplied system <b>of</b> six <b>extents</b> is also described. The systems <b>of</b> <b>extents</b> presented here are important in that they will allow various structures and theories understood only in a purely spatial context to be generalized to the spatio-temporal case.
