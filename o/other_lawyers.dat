After two years service in the Taranaki region, he worked at Opunake and later took up farming on land he bought with his brother near Stratford. He studied to become a lawyer and worked in New Plymouth in {{partnership}} with <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> but later set up his own practice in Stratford.|$|E
5|$|Ibrahim Yosri, {{a lawyer}} and former deputy foreign minister, drafted a petition, along with 20 <b>other</b> <b>lawyers,</b> asking the Prosecutor General Abdel Meguid Mahmoud to try Mubarak and his family for {{stealing}} state wealth.

5|$|From 1981 {{until his}} {{retirement}} in 2003, Miskovsky worked for Kirkland & Ellis, where he specialized in environmental law. In 1989, Miskovsky helped establish the Archdiocesan Legal Network, a free legal clinic run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. The clinic aided people with non-criminal legal issues such as bankruptcy, evictions, suspended licenses or delayed social security checks. Miskovsky was originally tasked with recruiting <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> for the clinic, but was eventually promoted to chairmen of the clinic's board.|$|E

5|$|Chinese {{human rights}} lawyers have {{charged that the}} 610 Office {{regularly}} interferes with legal cases involving Falun Gong practitioners, subverting the ability of judges to adjudicate independently. Attorney Jiang Tianyong has noted that cases where the defendants are Falun Gong practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices, rather than through recourse to legal standards. In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong practitioners in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents. <b>Other</b> <b>lawyers,</b> including Gao Zhisheng, Guo Guoting and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with Falun Gong clients or defend them in court.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the Soviet Union {{shot down}} a United States U-2 spy plane. The Soviets {{captured}} its pilot, Gary Powers, and tried him for committing espionage against the Soviet Union. At first, the United States believed that Powers could be freed by crafting an argument regarding international principles. To this end, Miskovsky and two <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> (Alexander W. Parker and Frank Rogers) wrote a brief stating that Power's U-2 plane {{did not violate}} Soviet airspace any more than Sputnik violated American airspace. However, the Soviet Union refused to allow foreigners to defend Powers. Powers was ultimately defended by a lawyer who acted as {{a spokesman for the}} Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|Néstor {{established}} {{a law firm}} that Cristina joined in 1979. The firm worked for banks and financial groups that filed eviction lawsuits, which had a growing rate at the time because the 1050 ruling of the Central Bank had increased the interest rates for mortgage loans. The Kirchners acquired twenty-one land lots at cheap prices as {{they were about to}} be auctioned. Their law firm defended military personnel accused of committing crimes during the Dirty War. Forced disappearances were common at the time, but unlike <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> the Kirchners never signed a habeas corpus. Julio César Strassera, prosecutor in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas against the military, critizised the Kirchners' lack of legal actions against the military, and considered their later interest in the issue a form of hipocrisy.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court Clinic enables {{students}} {{to act as}} Supreme Court litigators in partnership with attorneys at Sidley Austin, including Northwestern Law alum Carter Phillips, who has argued more cases {{in front of the}} Supreme Court than any <b>other</b> <b>lawyer</b> while in private practice.|$|R

5|$|The Weiquan {{movement}} is a non-centralized group of lawyers, legal experts, and intellectuals in China {{who seek to}} protect and defend {{the civil rights of}} the citizenry through litigation and legal activism. The movement, which began in the early 2000s, has organized demonstrations, sought reform via the legal system and media, defended victims of human rights abuses, and written appeal letters, despite opposition from Communist Party authorities. Among the issues adopted by Weiquan lawyers are property and housing rights, protection for AIDS victims, environmental damage, religious freedom, freedom of speech and the press, and defending the rights of <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> facing disbarment or imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas, a court of equity. This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E
5|$|The Serjeants had {{for many}} centuries {{exclusive}} {{jurisdiction over the}} Court of Common Pleas, being the only lawyers allowed {{to argue a case}} there. At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts (the Court of King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas) and precedence over all <b>other</b> <b>lawyers.</b> Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath. Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by Writ of Summons under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive dress, the chief feature of which was the coif, a white lawn or silk skullcap, afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace {{at the top of the}} wig.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lawyers,</b> paralegals and <b>other</b> {{professionals}} {{involved in}} legal advocacy can abuse {{the system in}} a number of ways. In some cases, representation may be well-intended but nonetheless incompetent. In <b>others,</b> <b>lawyers</b> engage in misconduct in an effort to gain unfair advantage for their clients or in pursuit of some self-interest.|$|R
60|$|Startling as this {{admission}} {{might have}} been to any <b>other</b> <b>lawyer,</b> Starbottle was absolutely relieved by it. The absence of any mirth-provoking correspondence, and the appeal solely to his own powers of persuasion, actually struck his fancy. He lightly put aside the compliment {{with a wave of}} his white hand.|$|R

25|$|In the High Court and the Court of Final Appeal, as {{a general}} rule, only barristers and solicitor-advocates are allowed to {{speak on behalf of}} any party in open court.

25|$|According to {{its early}} staff members, the {{opportunity}} to develop a new and original law school excited all those involved in Monash Law School's early years. In addition to its teaching reforms, Monash also became the first law school in Australia to establish its own community legal centres, which were and continue to be run by students under the supervision of staff and <b>other</b> <b>lawyers.</b> In 1971 Monash set another precedent for Australian law schools when Enid Campbell became the first female Dean of any Law School in Australia's history.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Kunstler {{took part}} in efforts to {{integrate}} public parks and libraries in Albany, Georgia. Later that year, he published The Case for Courage (modeled on President Kennedy's Profiles in Courage) highlighting the efforts of <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> who risked their careers for controversial clients as well as similar acts by public servants. At {{the time of the}} publication, Kunstler was already well known for his work with the Freedom Riders, his book on the Caryl Chessman case, and his radio coverage of trials. Kunstler also joined a group of lawyers criticizing the application of Alabama's civil libel laws and spoke at a rally against HUAC.|$|E

25|$|Despite being {{historically}} {{associated with}} doctorates in law, {{the title of}} doctor for lawyers has not customarily been used in English-speaking countries, where lawyers were traditionally not required to have a university degree and were trained by <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> by apprenticeship or in the Inns of Court. The exception being those areas where, up to the 19th century, civil law rather than common law was the governing tradition, including admiralty law, probate and ecclesiastical law: such cases were heard in the Doctor's Commons, and argued by advocates who held degrees either of doctor of civil law at Oxford or doctor of law at Cambridge. As such, lawyers practicing common law in England were not doctoral candidates and had not earned a doctorate. When university degrees became more common for those wanting to qualify as a lawyer in England, the degree awarded was the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.). Similarly in the US, even though degrees became standard for lawyers much earlier, the degree was again the LL.B., only becoming the Juris Doctor generally {{in the latter half}} of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Ebadi and the <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> of {{the family}} insisted in the court that they know that Kazemi was not killed by Aghdam-Ahmadi, and they need {{witnesses}} {{to be brought to}} the court in order to find the real murderer, who they guessed may be Mohammad Bakhshi, a high officer of the Evin prison. The list of witnesses they requested included Saeed Mortazavi, the general prosecutor of Tehran Mohsen Armin, reformist member of the previous parliament , Jamileh Kadivar, and Mohsen Mirdamadi, Minister of Intelligence Ali Younesi, the Vice President of Legal Affairs Mohammad Ali Abtahi, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ahmad Masjedjamei, the five judges who were present during Kazemi's interrogation, a few employees of the Evin prison, the president of the Baghiyyatollah hospital, and all of the medical staff who had signed her file. Judge Farahani denied all of the requests. The lawyers also quoted the official report of death that various of parts of Kazemi's body had been damaged and her clothes were torn and bloody, which proves that she had been tortured.|$|E
25|$|Patel {{travelled}} {{to attend}} schools in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, living self-sufficiently with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character. A popular anecdote recounts how he lanced his own painful boil without hesitation, {{even as the}} barber charged with doing it trembled. When Patel passed his matriculation at the relatively late age of 22, he was generally regarded by his elders as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. Patel himself, though, harboured a plan to study to become a lawyer, work and save funds, travel to England, and study to become a barrister. Patel spent years away from his family, studying on his own with books borrowed from <b>other</b> <b>lawyers,</b> passing his examinations within two years. Fetching his wife Jhaverba from his parents' home, Patel set up his household in Godhra and was called to the bar. During the many years it took him to save money, Patel– now an advocate– {{earned a reputation as}} a fierce and skilled lawyer. The couple had a daughter, Maniben, in 1904 and a son, Dahyabhai, in 1906. Patel also cared for a friend suffering from Bubonic plague when it swept across Gujarat. When Patel himself came down with the disease, he immediately sent his family to safety, left his home, and moved into an isolated house in Nadiad (by other accounts, Patel spent this time in a dilapidated temple); there, he recovered slowly.|$|E
50|$|Shirk fired ten {{lawyers in}} the office, {{including}} the defense attorneys in the Brenton Butler case. He hired as his deputy Refik Eler.

500|$|In one episode, Woo {{literally}} {{turned into}} an alien, reminiscent of {{a scene from the}} movie Alien. Woo's transformation into an alien was a reference on her not fitting in with the <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> as well as a reference on her citizenship. Patton points out that the assumption is often made that a second-generation White immigrant is an American citizen, but that same assumption is not granted to non-Whites - in this case, Woo. Woo is not constructed as American (because an American is constructed as White), nor is she constructed as human. [...] Woo, the only non-Euro-American member of the law firm, is constructed and seen as foreign or alien.|$|E
500|$|During the 16th {{century the}} Serjeants-at-Law were a small, though highly {{respected}} and powerful, elite. There were {{never more than}} ten alive, and on several occasions the number dwindled to one; William Blendlowes bragged {{that he had been}} [...] "the only Serjeant-at-Law in England" [...] in 1559. Over these 100 years, only 89 Serjeants were created. At the time they were the only clearly distinguishable branch of the legal profession, and it is thought that their work may have actually created barristers as a separate group; although Serjeants were the only lawyers who normally argued in court, they occasionally allowed <b>other</b> <b>lawyers</b> to help them in special cases. These lawyers became known as outer or [...] "utter" [...] barristers (because they were confined to the outer bar of the court); if they were allowed to act they had [...] "passed the bar" [...] towards becoming a Serjeant-at-Law.|$|E
