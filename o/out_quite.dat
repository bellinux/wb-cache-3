Once the tinfoil was removed from the cylinder it was nearly impossible to re-align in playable condition.

Hazlitt's son also came to visit, and conflicts broke out between him and his father that also drove a wedge between Hazlitt and his second wife: their marriage was by now in free fall.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of this NFC Championship Game {{is that it was}} the first, and to date, the only time that any Conference Championship game was played on a Saturday, instead of the usual Sunday. In their regular season meeting, Dallas had handed Washington their only loss of the year, 24–10, holding running back John Riggins to just 26 rushing yards while sacking quarterback Joe Theismann seven times and intercepting three of his passes. But this game, would turn <b>out</b> <b>quite</b> different as the Redskins sealed the victory by converting two turnovers in the final quarter into 10 points. Although Dallas outgained Washington in total yards 340–260, it wasn't enough to overcome their three turnovers versus none for the Redskins.|$|E

25|$|In England, {{the great}} school of Grinling Gibbons arose. Although he carved many {{beautiful}} mouldings of conventional form (Hampton Court Palace, Chatsworth, etc.), {{his name is}} usually associated with a very heavy form of decoration which was copied direct from nature. Great swags of drapery and foliage with fruit and dead birds, etc., would be carved in lime a foot thick. For technical skill these examples are unsurpassed; each grape would be undercut, the finer stalks and birds legs stand <b>out</b> <b>quite</b> separate, {{and as a consequence}} soon succumb to the energy of the housemaid's broom. Good work of this class is to be found at Petworth; Trinity College, Oxford; Trinity College, Cambridge; St Pauls cathedral; St James, Piccadilly; and many other London churches.|$|E
25|$|After a {{break to}} recuperate, the band teamed up with {{engineer}} Joe Gibb to create a high-tech studio setup. Brown had been soaking up the Leeds dance scene, while Hussey's explorations were towards folk music. The band, asked to perform a lucrative headlining gig at Finsbury Park in 1991, brought <b>out</b> <b>quite</b> a different side, joined by Maartin Allcock of Fairport Convention and Anthony Thistlethwaite of The Waterboys. Many long-standing fans left the gig worried {{about the direction of}} the forthcoming release, Masque (produced by Mark Saunders). Masque was originally intended to be a solo release by Hussey, however the remaining band members contributed to the recording, and the album was released under the group name as a result. Adams left the group subsequent to the release of the album. Reduced to a duo, the Mission began searching for new members, even placing an ad in the Melody Maker.|$|E
25|$|The script laid <b>out</b> <b>quite</b> {{specifically}} how {{characters were}} {{to move and}} behave, but the actors themselves chose how to bring these directions to life. For example, when Alec Hardy tells Ellie Miller that her husband is the murderer, the script called for Hardy to come round to Miller's {{side of the table}} and for Miller to vomit after the revelation. David Tennant was allowed to improvise how he came round the table and whether he sat or stood. Olivia Colman improvised the portrayal of nausea by rising, crouching, turning to the wall, and vomiting. Director James Strong knew that this put stress on his technical crew, who often had to guess what technical adjustments had to be made (such as lighting or the placement of microphones) in order to accommodate this unusual style of direction and acting. But he felt this spontaneity freed the cast and permitted them to deliver far more intense performances. A heavy reliance was also placed on getting the first take right, as Strong believed the first take was more spontaneous and more natural. Subsequently, most of what the viewer sees in Broadchurch series one are first takes.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode an 8.5/10, commenting that it [...] "worked <b>out</b> <b>quite</b> well mainly {{due to the}} superb musical number". He called the storyline [...] "pretty cohesive" [...] with a [...] "very few truly random jokes thrown in here", though he did criticize {{the killing of the}} cat as [...] "over-the-top" [...] and the large amount of blood which he called [...] "disturbing". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club stated that the episode [...] "showed admirable restraint [...] with its pot-centric plot", and called the musical number [...] "truly spectacular". She graded the episode B, behind the Simpsons episode “The Good, the Sad, and the Drugly” which received a rating of B+; and the American Dad! episode “Delorean Story-an” which received a rating of A. The TV Critic's Robin Pierson gave the episode a 54/100; in his review, he appreciated the plot structure, especially the randomness of Peter's list of hated cultural icons. He did, however, criticize the featured musical number; he referred to it as a [...] "waste of time" [...] and claimed that [...] "jokes about Texans, Michael Jackson, and Helen Keller are so obvious." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben Barnes as Prince Caspian. Adamson said [...] "Caspian is {{a coming}} of age and, to some degree, a loss of innocence story, with Caspian {{starting}} <b>out</b> <b>quite</b> naïve, then craving revenge and finally {{letting go of the}} vengeance." [...] While many readers interpret Caspian as a child, a passage in the novel mentions his age to be near that of Peter's, so an older actor was sought to match Moseley. Barnes had read the novel as a child, and was cast in two-and-a-half weeks after meeting with the filmmakers. He spent two months in New Zealand horse riding and stunt training to prepare for shooting. Barnes modelled his Spanish accent on Mandy Patinkin's performance as Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride, though he also had a dialect coach aiding him. Adamson did not expect to cast a British actor as Caspian, and said Barnes fitted well into the surrogate family of Adamson and the four actors playing the Pevensies. When cast, Barnes was set to tour with the Royal National Theatre's production of The History Boys: producer Mark Johnson joked Barnes [...] "probably isn't the Nation's favourite actor right now". Barnes left England without telling the Theatre. They were furious when they found out that he had left them without permission, so they considered suing him for breach of contract, but decided against it.|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Donen {{teamed up}} with Kelly for their third and final directorial collaboration. The musical It's Always Fair Weather was {{produced}} by Freed, written by Comden and Green and had music by André Previn. It starred Kelly, Dan Dailey, Cyd Charisse, Michael Kidd, and Dolores Gray. Originally envisioned as a sequel to On the Town, Kelly, Dailey and Kidd play three ex-GIs who reunite 10 years after World War II and discover that none of their lives have turned <b>out</b> <b>quite</b> how they had expected. Kelly had approached Donen with this project as their next collaboration and at first Donen was reluctant to accept due to his own success. Their friendship deteriorated during production and Donen noted, [...] "the atmosphere from day one was very tense and nobody was speaking to anybody." [...] He has {{been quoted as saying}} it was a [...] "one hundred percent nightmare" [...] which was a [...] "struggle from beginning to end" [...] and MGM did not allow the co-directors to shoot on location in New York. It's Always Fair Weather was a moderately profitable film, but not as successful as the pairs previous two films. It was Donen's last film with Kelly or Freed. After the film's completion he fulfilled his MGM contract agreement by working with other studios. His last project for MGM was completing the final four days of shooting on Kismet in July 1955 for director Vincent Minnelli, who had other commitments.|$|E

500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} <b>out</b> <b>quite</b> rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so pronounced it gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like the parent of a child throwing a tantrum. People who have been in this business for a long time are watching what's happening, and they say there hasn't been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis [...]" [...] In an instance, a girl was unable to undergo a surgery she needed due to monetary issues, so she sold her tickets to a show of the tour for enough money to pay for the surgery. Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live said the tickets were priced and sold as fairly as possible and assured there as no conspiracy between those who handled the tour and brokers. [...] "We do everything in our power to stop brokers from getting tickets, but it's impossible", she concluded. However, some brokers denied the allegations of purchasing most tickets for the shows. Brian Posey, owner of The Ticket Machine, an online broker based in East Lansing, Michigan, commented, [...] "I've never seen this as far as availability for any show. It's never been that hard to get tickets for us. You don't see seats anywhere. Parents shouldn't blame brokers for snapping up loads of tickets." [...] He continued to complain that the company was only able to purchase 28 tickets, while they usually averaged hundreds of tickets for hot tours.|$|E
