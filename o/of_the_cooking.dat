25|$|Adding {{as little}} as 10-15% shell temper created an {{excellent}} pottery paste that was lighter, stronger and more able to withstand the drying process, and the clay's originally high plasticity was subdued. The calcium carbonate of the freshwater mussels also acts as a binding agent and created a stronger vessel. Thinner coils to make thinner walled vessel were a natural consequence. As the potter was probably also the cook, she was now able to construct a more effective cooking pot. Thinner walls allowed heat to transfer to the food more effectively. A round vessel bottom allows easy stirring of the contents, a more even dissipation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooking</b> heat and also permits a more even dispersion of the shock of impacts reducing breakage.|$|E
