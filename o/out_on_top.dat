5|$|The ninth season saw a United States vs. United Kingdom {{theme for}} the show, with Dan Henderson and Michael Bisping {{coaching}} the respective sides. The two sides contrasted, with the UK side showing close friendship (with many coming from Team Rough House), whilst the US team appeared fractured. The lightweight final saw Team Rough House teammates Andre Winner and Ross Pearson face off for the contract, with Pearson coming <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> via decision. The welterweight final saw James Wilks defeat DaMarques Johnson via submission in the opening round, handing the UK team a 2-0 victory.|$|E
5|$|In Q2, it was Hamilton {{who came}} <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> exactly six-tenths {{of a second}} ahead of Rosberg. Verstappen was third fastest, ahead of Ricciardo in fifth. Kimi Räikkönen had to abandon his first fast lap after running wide in turn four, but later set a time good enough for fourth. Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel {{recorded}} just one timed lap, saving a set of tyres and was sixth. On his return to Toro Rosso, Kvyat was eliminated in 13th place, while teammate Sainz went through to Q3. Sergio Pérez advanced as well, demoting his teammate Hülkenberg into elimination in the process, who would line up eleventh on the grid. Joining him on the sidelines for Q3 were Jenson Button in twelfth, with Romain Grosjean, Kevin Magnussen and Esteban Gutiérrez lining up behind Kvyat.|$|E

All drivers had problems in improving on their times during the second run of timed laps on fresher tyres. While Hamilton did improve early in the lap, his effort was stopped when he made a mistake at turn twelve. This meant that he was unable to challenge Rosberg for pole position, who qualified first for the fourth race in a row. The two Mercedes drivers were closely followed by Vettel, ahead of the two Red Bulls of Kvyat and Ricciardo, both Williams cars and Verstappen in eighth. On the fifth row of the grid, local favourite Sergio Pérez edged out teammate Nico Hülkenberg for ninth.|$|E

Benoit was drafted to SmackDown! on its June 9, 2005 episode, and faced JBL {{in the main}} event with the ECW Originals at ringside cheering him on. JBL's Cabinet was also at ringside, as well as Carlito, Matt Morgan and Kurt Angle.

5|$|Throughout the studio's history, many {{projects}}—including Futureblight, Dwarves, Aliens: Crucible, and Stormlands—were cancelled. Due {{to having}} so many projects cancelled, the company entered a severe financial crisis in 2012. As a result, Obsidian decided to crowdfund their next game, Pillars of Eternity, a role-playing game played from an isometric perspective, which ultimately became a success and saved the studio from closure. The team's focus then changed from developing licensed titles to creating original games {{based on the}} studio's own intellectual property. Obsidian has developed {{a close relationship with}} another studio that was founded by ex-Interplay Entertainment employees, inXile Entertainment. The company's latest games are Tyranny, a role-playing game set in a world where the war between good and evil has been fought with evil coming <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> and Armored Warfare, a massively multiplayer online game with a focus on controlling tanks.|$|E

The pair have also contested one final at the 2012 ATP World Tour Finals, which Djokovic won in {{straight}} sets. They were scheduled to meet again in the 2014 final but Federer withdrew. The pair met four times in 2014, in the semifinal of the Dubai Tennis Championships, with Federer recording his first victory over Djokovic since 2012 and first deciding set victory over {{another member of the}} Big Four since 2010, in the final of Indian Wells the following week, with this time Djokovic coming <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> Monte-Carlo semifinal with Federer winning in straight sets, and at Wimbledon, with Djokovic winning in five sets.

5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as a three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared {{like he was going to}} win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E
5|$|In the 1964 Copa Libertadores, Santos {{were beaten}} in both {{legs of the}} semi-finals by Independiente. The club won the Campeonato Paulista, with Pelé netting 34 goals. Santos also shared the Rio-São Paulo title with Botafogo and won the Taça Brasil for the fourth {{consecutive}} year. In the 1965 Copa Libertadores, Santos reached the semi-finals and met Peñarol in a rematch of the 1962 final. After two matches, a playoff was needed to break the tie. Unlike 1962, Peñarol came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> and eliminated Santos 2–1. Pelé would, however, finish as the topscorer of the tournament with eight goals. This {{proved to be the}} start of a decline as Santos failed to retain the Torneio Rio-São Paulo. In 1966, Pelé and Santos also failed to retain the Taça Brasil as Pelé's goals were not enough to prevent a 9–4 defeat by Cruzeiro (led by Tostão) in the final series. The club did, however, win the Campeonato Paulista in 1967, 1968 and 1969. On 19 November 1969, Pelé scored his 1000th goal in all competitions, in what was a highly anticipated moment in Brazil. The goal, popularly dubbed O Milésimo (The Thousandth), occurred in a match against Vasco da Gama, when Pelé scored from a penalty kick, at the Maracanã Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Just days later, Yankee {{right fielder}} Gary Sheffield's cap was knocked {{off by a}} Red Sox fan while {{trying to pick up}} a fair ball in right field during the 8th inning at Fenway Park. In response, Sheffield pushed the fan. The {{conflict}} was quickly stopped by security guards. The fan was not ejected from the game, although left the park voluntarily. Fan interference was not called and Sheffield's reaction resulted in a run scoring Triple for the Red Sox' Jason Varitek. It was the game-winning RBI. Contrary to most media reports, the fan is still a season ticket holder today. The season ended with both teams, already with guaranteed playoff berths, playing each other for the division crown {{on the last day of}} the season in a game that had the Yankees come <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top.</b> Both teams wound up losing in the 2005 ALDS, the Yankees to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Red Sox to the eventual World Series champion that year, the Chicago White Sox.|$|E
5|$|Porter ran Orme {{in a trial}} {{four days}} before the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park as preparation. He raced against his five-year-old {{half-brother}} Blue Green and the six-year-old Ormuz. Despite conceding weight to both of them, he won by the trial by two lengths from Ormuz. In the Eclipse he faced six rivals and started the 5/4 favourite, with Sussex Stakes winner Orvieto next in the betting at 11/4. During the race Orme was ridden {{in the middle of the}} field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme and Orvieto were close behind the two leaders; the two then took over the lead in the straight. As they neared the finish, Orvieto had a slight advantage, but as Barrett asked Orme for an effort, he responded and got in front to win by a neck from Orvieto, with St. Damien finishing only three quarters of a length behind Orvieto. The race was worth over £9000. Twelve days later Orme lined up as the 1/5 favourite for the Sussex Stakes. In the last few furlongs he battled with Watercress, and it was not until 50 yards from the finish that he came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> going on to win by a head from Watercress.|$|E
5|$|Solis had the {{opportunity}} to run for the California State Assembly when, after California's 1991 redistricting, the incumbent Dave Elder in Solis's 57th State Assembly district was shifted into another district, while her new representative retired. In the June 1992 Democratic primary to fill the open seat, Solis's opponents had the endorsement of powerful State Assemblyman Richard Polanco and the former incumbent. Solis had the support of Molina and U.S. Representative Barbara Boxer, in an effort that focused on door-to-door campaigning and featured Solis's mother making burritos for campaign volunteers. Solis came <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of a three-way Democratic race, receiving 49percent of the vote and besting her nearest competitor, future Assemblyman Ed Chavez, who received 31percent. In the general election, Solis garnered 61percent of the vote against Republican Gary Woods' 34percent, and gained election to the Assembly. She was one of seven Latinos who won election to the Assembly {{in the wake of the}} redistricting and became collectively known as Los Siete. Solis was among the most liberal of this ideologically diverse group.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the start}} of a push for Hardy, and at Survivor Series, Hardy and Triple H were the last two {{standing}} to win the traditional elimination match. Hardy began an on and off tag team with Triple H, which eventually led to a respectful feud between the two. The rivalry continued at Armageddon, when Hardy defeated Triple H to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship. In {{the weeks leading up to}} the Royal Rumble, Hardy and Randy Orton engaged in a personal feud, which began when Orton kicked Hardy's brother, Matt, in the head in the storyline. Hardy, in retaliation, performed a Swanton Bomb on Orton from the top of the Raw set and seemed to have all the momentum after coming <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> in their encounters. Hardy, however, lost the title match at the Royal Rumble, but was named as one of six men to compete in an Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out, where he survived to the final two before being eliminated by the eventual winner, Triple H.|$|E
5|$|Vissi's music rival Despina Vandi {{also became}} less prominent. While the {{supposed}} rivalry {{between the two}} was once a grand topic in the media, with speculation as to who would come <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> the possible overexposure {{of the story and}} their subsequent absences allowed fellow laïko-pop singer Elena Paparizou, fresh off of the momentum of her 2005 Eurovision win, to ultimately overshadow the two {{during the second half of}} the decade. While reviewing Apagorevmeno, Haris Simvoulidis of Avopolis felt that Vissi appeared to be attempting to catch up to her contemporaries, Paparizou and Peggy Zina. Vissi continued to make music and soon managed to fly back to the top as her follow-up album Apagorevmeno becaume the biggest selling album by a female artist for 2009 and her shows continue to be sold out even today. She was also placed 15th in Forbes list of the most powerful and influential Greece celebrities in 2010. Her time on hiatus in the late 2000s was filmed and used for a reality show called Oso Eho Foni in 2011.|$|E
5|$|After {{restoring}} the Beanstar, Mario and Luigi travel to Joke's End {{to make the}} exchange, once again traveling through a maze filled with puzzles to be solved. Bowletta refuses to hand over Peach, but Luigi, disguised in Peach's spare dress, ends up being taken in Peach's stead. He escapes from the repaired Koopa Cruiser, reclaiming the Beanstar in the process. The brothers return to Beanbean Castle Town, finding it under attack by Bowletta using Bowser's flying castle. The brothers and Prince Peasley fly up to it to stop Cackletta. Mario and Luigi battle past the Koopalings, but before they can reach Bowletta the brothers encounter Fawful yet again. A fierce battle between the three ensues with the brothers coming <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>top.</b> But Fawful plays a dirty trick and attacks the brothers while they weren't paying attention. However, Prince Peasly comes in and send Fawful flying, seemingly defeating him. The Bros. finally confront Bowletta and another epic battle begins. Feigning defeat, she tricks the brothers and swallows them. After waking up in her belly, the brothers battle and defeat Cackletta's soul, exorcising her from Bowser's body. The two are regurgitated and Bowser returns to normal. Afterwards, the brothers escape the castle before it explodes from a bomb set by Peasley. The explosion sends the castle falling into the ocean. Exhausted from their vacation, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toadsworth decide {{to head back to}} the Mushroom Kingdom. Before they can leave, Peasley brings a farewell gift for them to take home, which is Bowser, who regained his memory. The gang then returns home, and a movie based on their adventure is being shown at the Yoshi Theatre.|$|E
