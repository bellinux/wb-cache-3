40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the results of a study designed to evaluate experimentally the accuracy and precision of electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesondes as prepared and flown by NASA, as a function of altitude. A combination of dual-instrument soundings and laboratory work using an environmental chamber was employed in the study. The ECC <b>ozonesonde</b> is a small, balloon-borne sensor developed for obtaining vertical profiles of atmospheric ozone. Attention is given to the design of the employed environmental chamber, ozone and temperature profiles used in simulated <b>ozonesonde</b> soundings, absolute and relative ECC <b>ozonesonde</b> precision estimates determined with the environmental chamber and from dual-instrument balloon soundings, and the ECC <b>ozonesonde</b> accuracy...|$|E
40|$|NOAA’s {{program of}} long term {{monitoring}} of the vertical distribution of ozone with Electrochemical Concentration Cell (ECC) ozonesondes has undergone a number of changes over the 50 year record. In order to produce a homogenous data set, these changes must be documented and where necessary, appropriate corrections applied. This is the first comprehensive and consistent reprocessing of NOAA’s <b>ozonesonde</b> data records that corrects for these changes using the rawest form of the data (cell current and pump temperature) in native resolution {{as well as a}} point by point uncertainty calculation that is unique to each sounding. The reprocessing is carried out uniformly at all eight <b>ozonesonde</b> sites in NOAA’s network with differences in sensing solution and <b>ozonesonde</b> types accounted for in the same way at all sites. The corrections used to homogenize the NOAA <b>ozonesonde</b> data records greatly improve the <b>ozonesonde</b> measurements with an average one sigma uncertainty of ± 4 – 6  % in the stratosphere and ± 5 – 20  % in the troposphere. A comparison of the integrated column ozone from the <b>ozonesonde</b> profile with co-located Dobson spectrophotometers total column ozone measurements shows agreement within ± 5  % for >  70  % of the profiles. Very good agreement is also found in the stratosphere between <b>ozonesonde</b> profiles and profiles retrieved from the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instruments (SBUV) ...|$|E
40|$|We present {{validation}} {{studies of}} MLS version 2. 2 upper tropospheric and stratospheric ozone profiles using <b>ozonesonde</b> and lidar data {{as well as}} climatological data. Ozone measurements from over 60 <b>ozonesonde</b> stations worldwide and three lidar stations are compared with coincident MLS data. The MLS ozone stratospheric data between 150 and 3 hPa agree well with <b>ozonesonde</b> measurements, within 8 % for the global average. MLS values at 215 hPa are biased high compared to ozonesondes by ∼ 20 % at middle to high latitude, {{although there is a}} lot of variability in this altitude region. Comparisons between MLS and ground-based lidar measurements from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, from the Table Mountain Facility, California, and from the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France, give very good agreement, within ∼ 5 %, for the stratospheric values. The comparisons between MLS and the Table Mountain Facility tropospheric ozone lidar show that MLS data are biased high by ∼ 30 % at 215 hPa, consistent with that indicated by the <b>ozonesonde</b> data. We obtain better global average agreement between MLS and <b>ozonesonde</b> partial column values down to 215 hPa, although the average MLS values at low to middle latitudes are higher than the <b>ozonesonde</b> values by up to a few percent. MLS v 2. 2 ozone data agree better than the MLS v 1. 5 data with <b>ozonesonde</b> and lidar measurements. MLS tropical data show the wave one longitudinal pattern in the upper troposphere, with similarities to the average distribution from ozonesondes.

40|$|A balloon {{flight to}} compare 18 <b>ozonesondes</b> with an ozone {{photometer}} and with ozone column measurements from Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers {{was completed in}} April 2004. The core experiment consisted of 12 electrochemical concentration cell <b>ozonesondes,</b> 6 from Science Pump Corporation (SP) and 6 from ENSCI Corporation (ES), prepared with cathode solution concentrations of 0. 5 % KI (half buffer) and 1. 0 % KI (full buffer). Auxiliary <b>ozonesondes</b> consisted of two electrochemical concentration cell sondes with 2. 0 % KI (no buffer), two reconditioned sondes, and two Japanese-KC 96 sondes. Precision of each group of similarly prepared <b>ozonesondes</b> was < 2 - 3 %. The six <b>ozonesondes</b> prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations (SP, 1. 0 % KI, ES 0. 5 % KI) overestimated the photometer measurements by 5 - 10 % in the stratosphere, but provided ozone columns in good agreement with the ground-based spectrophotometer measurements. This {{is consistent with the}} difference (similar to 5 %) in ozone photometer and column measurements observed during the experiment. Using cathode cell concentrations of 1. 0 % KI for ES sondes caused overestimates of the photometer by 10 - 15 % and of ozone column by 5 - 10 %. In contrast, 0. 5 % KI in SP sondes led to good agreement with the photometer, but underestimates of ozone column. The KC 96 sondes underestimated the photometer measurements by about 5 - 15 % at air pressures above 30 hPa. Agreement was within 5 % at lower pressures. Diluting the solution concentration and the buffers from 1. 0 % to 0. 5 % KI causes an approximately linear pressure-dependent decrease in ozone for both SP and ES sondes, ratio (0. 5 KI/ 1. 0 KI) = 0. 9 + 0. 024 * log(10) (Pressure) ...|$|R

40|$|Stratospheric ozone {{mixing ratio}} {{profiles}} measured by satellite-borne Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE 11 data version 5. 93) and Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE data versions 17 and 18) are compared {{with each other}} and with balloon-borne <b>ozonesonde</b> profiles at Payerne, Lauder, and Macquarie Island stations during 1994 - 1995. The SAGE 11 -HALOE ozone mixing ratio profiles are compared at 13 - 55 km altitudes, and the satellite-ozonesonde profiles are compared at 13 - 33 km altitudes. It is found that HALOE data version 18 ozone values are systematically larger than HALOE data version 17, particularly in the lower stratosphere. HALOE data version 18 ozone profiles are about 2 per cent, 5 - 8 per cent, and 10 - 20 per cent larger than the corresponding HALOE data version 17 at 40 - 55, 25 - 40, and 15 - 25 km altitudes, respectively. The new version of HALOE ozone agrees better with SAGE 11 and Payerne <b>ozonesonde</b> profiles than HALOE data version 17 does. In general, the agreements bet ween satellite-borne sensors and ozonesondes are all within their stated level of uncertainties. Intercomparison results between SAGE 11 -Payerne <b>ozonesonde</b> and SAGE II-Lauder <b>ozonesonde</b> are compared with earlier comparative studies between SAGE II Payerne <b>ozonesonde</b> and SAGE II-Lauder <b>ozonesonde</b> by Veiga et al.

At altitudes above 20 km the intercomparisons between SAGE II and HALOE data version 18 and between SAGE 11 and ozonesondes seem to indicate that aerosol has no statistically significant impact on SAGE 11 ozone retrieval during the period of 1994 - 1995...|$|E

40|$|The study {{presents}} the climatological characteristics of stratospheric ozone observed over Reunion Island using in-situ (<b>ozonesonde</b> and SAOZ) and satellite (UARS-HALOE, SAGE-II and TOMS) measurements. It uses co-localised ozonesondes (from September 1992 to February 2005) and SAOZ measurements (from January 1993 to December 2004), SAGE-II data from October 1984 to February 1999 (~ 15 years), HALOE data from January 1991 to February 2005 (~ 15 years), and NIMBUS/TOMS data from January 1978 to December 2004 (27 years). The satellite measurements correspond to overpasses located nearby Reunion Island (21 ° S; 55 ° E). The height profiles of ozone concentration obtained from <b>ozonesonde</b> (0. 5 – 29. 5 km) show less bias {{in comparison with}} the HALOE and SAGE-II measurements. Though, the satellite (HALOE and SAGE-II) measurements underestimate the tropospheric ozone, they are in good agreement for the heights above 15 km. The bias between the measurements and the normalized ozone profile constructed from the <b>ozonesonde</b> and SAGE-II satellite measurement shows that the SAGE-II measurements are more accurate than the HALOE measurements in the lower stratosphere. The monthly variation of ozone concentration derived from <b>ozonesonde</b> and HALOE shows a nearly annual cycle with a maximum concentration during winter/spring and minimum concentration during summer/autumn months. The time evolution of total column ozone obtained from TOMS, SAOZ and the one computed from <b>ozonesonde</b> and SAGE-II, exhibits similar behaviour with analogous trends as above. The TOMS variation displays a higher value of total column ozone of about 3 – 5 DU (10 %) {{in comparison with the}} SAOZ and the integrated ozone from <b>ozonesonde</b> and SAGE-II...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{apply the}} NASA Goddard Trajectory Model {{to data from}} a series of <b>ozonesondes</b> to derive ozone loss rates in the lower {{stratosphere}} for the AASE- 2 /EASOE mission (January–March 1992) and for the SOLVE/THESEO 2000 mission (January–March 2000) in an approach similar to Match. Ozone loss rates are computed by comparing the ozone concentrations provided by <b>ozonesondes</b> launched {{at the beginning and end}} of the trajectories connecting the launches. We investigate the sensitivity of the Match results to the various parameters used to reject potential matches in the original Match technique.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{variations of}} ozone around the tropical tropopause layer {{in relation to}} large-scale waves both in the altitude and isentropic coordinates were examined by analyzing <b>ozonesondes</b> provided by SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere Additional <b>Ozonesondes).</b> Because ozone near this level {{can be used for}} the tracer of atmospheric motion, we regarded an ozone enhancement as the signal of a turbulent mixing. Focusing on the vertical fine structure of ozone and temperature, this study presents observed variations of 10 stations near the equator. Based on the signals of Kelvin waves (an eastward-traveling component of equatorial waves) which is filtered in the spectral-frequency domain using reanalysis data (ERA-Interim), we clarified the dependency of the observed profiles to phase evolution of the large-scale wave.

40|$|The Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) was an IR limb {{emission}} spectrometer on the Envisat platform. From 2002 to 2012, it performed pole-to-pole measurements during day and night, producing more than 1000  profiles/day. The European Space Agency (ESA) has recently released {{the new version}} 7 of Level 1 MIPAS spectra, in which {{a new set of}} time-dependent correction coefficients for the non-linearity in the detectors’ response functions was implemeted. This change is expected to reduce the long-term drift of the MIPAS Level 2 data. We evaluate the long-term stability of ozone level 2 data retrieved from MIPAS V 7 Level 1 spectra with the IMK/IAA Scientific Level 2 Processor. We compare it with ozone measurements from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on NASA’s Aura satellite, <b>ozonesondes</b> and ground-based lidar instruments. The <b>ozonesondes</b> and lidars alone do not allow us to conclude with enough significance that the new version is more stable than the previous one, but a clear improvement in long-term stability is observed in the satellite-data based drift analysis. The results of <b>ozonesondes,</b> lidars and satellite drift analysis are consistent: all indicate that the drifts of the new version are less negative/more positive nearly everywhere above 15  km.

40|$|Ozone {{observations}} from <b>ozonesondes,</b> the DIAL and AROTEL lidars aboard the DC- 8, in situ ozone measurements from the ER- 2 and satellite ozone measurements from POAM {{were used to}} assess ozone loss during the SOLVE 1999 - 2000 campaign. We compare three different methods of computing the ozone loss. The first method simply compares the time sequence of <b>ozonesondes</b> taken at the same station inside the vortex from December through the end of March. In the second method, <b>ozonesondes</b> from a variety of stations are compared using a variant on the Match technique. This method uses short (approx. 5 - 10 day) forward diabatic trajectories to connect various sonde launches. In the third method, the measurements are simply injected into a diabatic trajectory model and carried forward in time from December 1 to March 16. Over 60, 000 individual measurements were used in the last calculation. Again, ozone loss is estimated by comparing vortex interior measurements made early in the campaign with those made later in the campaign. The diabatic nature of the second and third methods calculation presumably corrects for the normal increase in ozone within the vortex due to downward advection. The three methods agree that the largest ozone loss occurs between 400 and 460 K potential temperatures (approx. 16 - 20 km) with slightly over 1. 5 ppmv lost over the winter period. Between 460 K and 500 K (approx. 22 km) net ozone loss is less than 0. 8 ppmv. From 500 K to 600 K (26 km) net loss is less than 0. 5 ppmv...|$|R

30|$|Each <b>ozonesonde</b> profile {{with the}} new {{correction}} factor applied was complemented by the O 3 climatology profile above the balloon burst height. The O 3 climatology profiles were made per month by averaging the O 3 profiles and geopotential heights from the MLS observations between 2005 and 2013 (Livesey et al. 2011) within a ± 5 ° latitude and ± 15 ° longitude box centered on Rikubetsu. The climatological monthly profiles were produced separately for daytime (solar zenith angle (SZA) ≤  98 °) and nighttime (SZA >  98 °) data. The O 3 concentrations above the balloon burst height were provided by linearly interpolating in time the daytime climatology profiles arranged at the middle of each month. Note that since the <b>ozonesonde</b> observations at Sapporo were limited to daytime, only the daytime climatology was used here. If the total O 3 column derived from the <b>ozonesonde</b> profile complemented by the climatology did not agree to within ± 15  % with those derived from the Brewer spectrophotometer at Rikubetsu, we considered that the two instruments observed a different air mass and the <b>ozonesonde</b> data were not used.|$|E
