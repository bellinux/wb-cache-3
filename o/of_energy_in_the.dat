5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century all of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of drug metabolism had been discovered, along with the outlines of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the vitamins, began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which—as biochemistry—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by Hans Krebs and Carl and Gerty Cori—began to work out many of the central metabolic pathways of life: the citric acid cycle, glycogenesis and glycolysis, and the synthesis of steroids and porphyrins. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Fritz Lipmann and others established the role of ATP as the universal carrier <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell, and mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E
5|$|Kaladze became {{involved}} in the politics of Georgia {{as a member of the}} opposition Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia party founded by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili in February 2012. He was elected to the Parliament of Georgia on 1 October 2012. He was approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as Minister <b>of</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili on 25 October 2012. The appointment was met with skepticism in professional energy circles. More importantly, it stirred an intense debate on a conflict of interest arising from Kaladze's business interests in the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company, in which Kala Capital owned 45 percent. Kala Capital sold the shares to GMC Group in November 2012 but concerns whether his indirect commercial interests had been abandoned remain.|$|E

5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually not a perfect circle, but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit bursts <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of X-rays.|$|E

It expressed urgency to find a consolidated, geological repository, and said that any future facility should be developed by a new independent organization with {{direct access to the}} Nuclear Waste Fund, which is not subject to political and financial control as is the cabinet department of the Department <b>of</b> <b>Energy.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, most nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to the indefinite on-site dry cask storage of waste in steel and concrete casks.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{considerations}} apply {{whenever the}} energy level spacing {{is much larger}} than the thermal energy. For example, this reasoning was used by Max Planck and Albert Einstein to resolve the ultraviolet catastrophe of blackbody radiation. The paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the electromagnetic field in a closed container, each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator. If each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy kBT, there would be an infinite amount <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> container. However, by the reasoning above, the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as ν goes to infinity; moreover, Planck's law of black body radiation, which describes the experimental distribution <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modes, follows from the same reasoning.|$|E
