5|$|Two British athletes competed, both in alpine skiing events, and no medals were won. The size of {{the team}} was a {{decrease}} from that which had entered previous Games, in the 1998 Winter Paralympics 20 British athletes had participated. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is that whilst funding for the two athletes {{was provided by the}} British Paralympic Association, it totalled only £1,500 compared to the £4 million worth of funding available to British athletes at the 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{identified}} {{reserves in}} 2008 were {{estimated by the}} US Geological Survey (USGS) to be 13 million tonnes, though an accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is that most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects. The world has been estimated to contain about 15 million tonnes of lithium reserves, while 65 million tonnes of known resources are reasonable. A total of 75% of everything can typically {{be found in the}} ten largest deposits of the world. Another study noted that 83% of the geological resources of lithium are located in six brine, two pegmatite, and two sedimentary deposits.|$|E

5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the risk of heart attack by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> recommendation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of invasion, the Royal Navy would have sailed to the landing places, {{possibly}} taking several days. It is now known that the Germans planned {{to land on the}} southern coast of England; <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> site was that the narrow seas of the English Channel could be blocked with mines, submarines and torpedo boats. While German naval forces and the Luftwaffe could have extracted a high price from the Royal Navy, they could not have hoped to prevent interference with attempts to land a second wave of troops and supplies that would have been essential to German success—even if, by then, the Germans had captured a port essential for bringing in significant heavy equipment. In this scenario, British land forces would have faced the Germans on more equal terms than otherwise and it was only necessary to delay the German advance, preventing a collapse until the German land forces were, at least temporarily, isolated by the Royal Navy and then mounting a counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} of atomic bombs lay outside the realm of the Ministry of Defence. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> was that it was only created in October 1946, by which time Portal had already been appointed as CPAE. Tizard became the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence in November 1946, and in January 1947 he also became the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), which was established to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy. Tizard attempted to gain some control over nuclear weapons policy. Anderson's advisory committee was abolished at the end of 1947, and two new committees were established in its place, the Atomic Energy (Defence Research) Committee AE(DR), which came under the DRPC, and was chaired by Tizard; and the Atomic Energy (Review of Production) Committee, which was answerable to Portal. But Tizard failed to gain control of atomic energy policy.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{evidence}} for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> may be that he died on the feast day of Augustine of Canterbury. Later, when he was venerated in England, he was either commemorated after Augustine on 26 May, or his feast was moved to 27 May. However, he was venerated outside England, mainly {{through the efforts of}} Boniface and Alcuin, both of whom promoted the cult on the Continent. Boniface wrote repeatedly back to England during his missionary efforts, requesting copies of Bede's theological works. Alcuin, who was taught at the school set up in York by Bede's pupil Egbert, praised Bede as an example for monks to follow and was instrumental in disseminating Bede's works to all of Alcuin's friends. Bede's cult became prominent in England during the 10th-century revival of monasticism, and by the 14th century had spread to many of the cathedrals of England. Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester (c. 1008–1095) was a particular devotee of Bede's, dedicating a church to him in 1062, which was Wulfstan's first undertaking after his consecration as bishop.|$|E
5|$|French Air Forces {{under the}} command of Commandant des Forces (Commander of Forces) Marcel Têtu Aeriennes de Cooperation du Front Nord-Est (Ardennes Cooperation Front North East, or FACNE) rarely {{supported}} the British efforts despite substantial reinforcements. They flew only an average of one sortie per day, including strategic defensive missions. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> was heavy French bomber losses on the previous two days. During the Battle of Maastricht in the Netherlands, the Groupement de Bombardement (Bomber Groups, or GB) had its squadrons reduced. GB I/12 and II/12 had only 13 LeO 451s between them. Groupement de Bombardement d'Assaut 18 (GBA 18) had only 12 of 25 Breguet 693s left. GB I/34 and II/34 could muster eight aircraft out of 22 Amiot 143s, I/38 seven out of 12, and II/38 six out of 11. All of these groups were sent to Sedan on 14 May. Escort was given from Groupement de Chasse (Fighter Groups, or GC). GC III/7 with 12 Morane 406s, 12 Bloch 152s of I/8 and nine Dewoitine D.520s of I/3 took part. GBA 18 was escorted by 15 Bloch 152s of GC I/8. The missions cost the French five bombers, two from ground fire. After this date, the French bomber forces were eliminated from the fight over Sedan. The major efforts were now made by the AASF.|$|E

25|$|The name Huastec {{comes from}} Nahuatl; the Huastec call {{themselves}} Teenek. While the Huastec {{were the most}} northern Mesoamerican culture, their culture is distinct {{from those in the}} Mexican Plateau, which whom they had contact and from other Mayan groups. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> was their contact with the Chichimecas to the north, and their isolation from other Mayan cultures. While the Huastecs managed to spread their influence over a large territory, they never built cities and ceremonial centers as large as in other parts of Mesoamerica. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> was that the Chichimeca were a constant threat. In the Post Classic period, Huastec territory shrank due to incursions by Nahuas and Otomi in the south and west, culminating into Aztec conquest of much of the territory by the early 16th century. This loss of land would continue into the Spanish colonial period with mestizos coming to dominate the region, especially in the Veracruz and Tamaulipas coast areas.|$|E

50|$|Physicians have {{difficulty}} explaining complicated medical concepts to their patients and patients {{have difficulty}} understanding complicated things which physicians tell them. <b>One</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{is that a}} patient's visit to a physician {{is likely to be}} less than 15 minutes, and in any case, physicians are unable to spend the amount of time which patients that patients typically desire. Physicians use medical terms which patients do not understand, but which they would like to learn. There is consensus that patients should have shared decision making, which means that they make informed decisions about the direction of their health care in collaboration with their physician. Rich, educated, socially advantaged patients enjoy many more benefits of shared decision making than patients who have disadvantages in getting healthcare, including lower socioeconomic class or having a minority status.|$|R
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence was a major advance in physicists' understanding of string theory and quantum gravity. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is that the correspondence provides a formulation of string theory in terms of quantum field theory, which is well understood by comparison. Another reason is that it provides a general framework in which physicists can study and attempt to resolve the paradoxes of black holes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Americans had {{inherited}} a hearty drinking tradition. Many types of alcohol were consumed. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> heavy drinking {{was attributed to}} an overabundance of corn on the western frontier, which encouraged the widespread production of cheap whiskey. It was {{at this time that}} alcohol became {{an important part of the}} American diet. In the 1820s, Americans drank seven gallons of alcohol per person annually.|$|E
