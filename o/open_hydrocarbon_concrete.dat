The Easy %Ro kinetic model was used to calculate vitrinite reflectance (Sweeney and Burnham 1990). Kerogen Type II-S properties of the Temis Flow data base was used because of the similarities of kerogen type of Jurassic Darquain sediments with that of US Monterey Formation. In addition, since the Jurassic intervals of the Darquain Field are under high pressure and temperature regimes, the <b>open</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> system defined by Vandenbroucke et al. (1999) and the Langmuir isotherms (Langmuir 1916) in the Temis Flow software were used to calculate the mass of hydrocarbon generation and retention in the source rocks.|$|R

The experiments involve the modulated fringe pattern photobleaching technique : after flashing a bleaching beam, and thus generating a fluorescence heterogeneity, we observed the kinetics of fluorescence recovery. The analysis of the time course of the recovery yields information regarding the {{lateral diffusion}} of the fluorescent molecules in the system. We observed different types of diffusion, clearly correlated with the topological properties of the different structures, as established by the previous X-ray scattering studies. For one of the cubic phases (Q 223), the results of the fluorescent recovery study appear to be consistent with a structure containing both an <b>open</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> labyrinth and a family of closed micellar elements, rather than with a model containing only closed micelles...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a notion}} that in {{carbonaceous}} materials the sp 3 hybridised fraction determines the mechanical properties, while the sp 2 fraction controls the electro-optical properties. We investigated a narrow range of a-C:H films synthesised in an <b>open</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> plasma source. The a-C:H films displayed unambiguous variation in mechanical properties as measured by nanoindentation measurements. However the proportion of sp 3 constituent, determined using X-ray C 1 s core-level photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, {{was found to be}} essentially the same for all studied samples. The Tauc gap was found to be controlled by the perturbation of the π tail states of sp 2 phase and its magnitude varied inversely with a surface conduction gap determined by scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements. These results indicate that mechanical properties of a-C:H films are also influenced by the degree of disorder of the sp 2 fraction, as characterised by bond saturation and symmetry...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} {{experimental study of}} properties of amorphous diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings synthesised using discharge plasma methods. There were two objectives in this study. The first objective {{was to investigate the}} formation mechanism of hydrogenated DLC films (a-C:H) in an <b>open</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> plasma source. The inductively coupled plasma (ICP) reactor was used to synthesise the films and the formation of sp 2 and sp 3 hybridised phases and the combination of these phases in the ICP plasma environment was studied. It was found that for a-C:H films with narrow distribution of the sp 3 content the mechanical properties are determined by the degree of disorder of the sp 2 fraction. The relationship between the sp 3 content in fabricated films and hardness and Young's modulus was established. Raman and multi-wavelength (Vis – UV range) Raman spectroscopy was primarily used together with other suitable analytical methods to examine a-C:H films and it was found that films fabricated at higher ion energies displayed higher degree of clustering and bonding disorder than films produced at lower ion energies. All as fabricated a-C:H films were also found contain basic π-conjugated polymer inclusions as of trans-polyacetylene. The Raman results also reveal that the magnitude of Rayleigh scattered light is related to the relative density of the films, a feature that can be useful for monitoring film growth in-situ. The use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as a suitable method for measuring the sp 3 content of the bulk DLC was also established. The second objective was to develop a fabrication technique that would allow fabrication of DLC films using graphite target sputtering with a single focused ion beam source and producing films with medium-high sp 3 content. This research was motivated by the industrial partner of the project Laserdyne Pty Ltd that required a simple DLC deposition apparatus to be integrated into a standard, stand alone, optical thin film deposition chamber. Such technique was developed {{on the basis of a}} conventional ion beam target sputtering. In our experiments hydrogen-free DLC films with medium sp 3 content were produced using a single, Kaufmann type ion source operated at low energies. The fabrication technique, denoted a reactive ion beam sputter deposition (RIBSD), was based on sputtering a graphite target at low incident angles and positioning the substrate at the grazing angles to the incoming ions, thus the incident ions (Ar and Xe ions were used) were simultaneously bombarding the target and the growing film. The effect of angle of incidence of an ion beam to the target and to the substrate in creating the sp 3 content in DLC was investigated. It was found that the infringement bombardment of the substrate was not favourable for DLC growth as it essentially provided for a secondary re-sputtering process.

40|$|Fine {{particulate}} matter {{samples were collected}} in an urban ambient fixed site and, outside and inside residencies in Athens greater area, Greece. n-Alkanes, iso/anteiso-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The values of concentration diagnostic ratios indicated a mixture of vehicular emissions, fuel evaporation, oil residues and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in outdoor and indoor samples. Particulate iso/anteiso-alkanes, specific tracers of ETS, were detected in both non-smoking and smoking households. The indoor-to-outdoor ratios of particulate iso/anteiso-alkanes and unresolved complex mixture (a tracer of outdoor air pollution) in non-smoking households were comparable to the measured air exchange rate. This suggested that penetration of outdoor air was solely responsible {{for the detection of}} tobacco smoke particulate tracers in indoor non-smoking environments. Overall, residential outdoor concentrations accounted for a large fraction (from 25 up to 79 %) of indoor aliphatic and polyaromatic <b>hydrocarbons.</b> <b>Open</b> windows/doors and the operation of an air condition unit yielded also in higher indoor concentrations than those measured outdoors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper will}} present {{results of a}} {{numerical}} modelling study on CO 2 migration through abandoned wells. Leakage of CO 2 through plugged and abandoned wellbores {{is one of the}} major concerns for long-term safety and effectiveness of geologic CO 2 sequestration. For risk assessment and mitigation, it is not only important to understand and characterize the potential for CO 2 leakage through wellbores but also subsequent CO 2 migration beyond the primary sequestration reservoir. Subsequent to the leak, CO 2 may take a direct path towards the accessible environment or it may migrate in an indirect stair-stepping manner through wellbores/fractures across multiple, shallow permeable strata. In the later case, identification of leak source and application of mitigation strategies may become a challenge. For this study we use data from a site in Alberta, Canada which has reported natural gas leak at surface. Investigations on origin of the gas and potential gas migration path from the original source to the surface at the analog site show that the gas could be moving through multiple wells and across multiple formations. There are multiple wells at the site which were drilled and abandoned without production casing and are completely <b>open</b> between two <b>hydrocarbon</b> bearing zones creating cross-flow across zones through open wellbores. Our study focuses on the deeper formations and potential for leakage for CO 2 injected in deeper formation. A complex numerical fluid-flow model is developed for the site in FEHM, LANL’s porous media fluid-flow simulator. The model explicitly accounts for wellbore details such as abandonment plugs, casing, annulus cement, etc. The model was used to perform long-term simulations of CO 2 injection and potential migration through abandoned wells. Numerical simulation results show limited migration of CO 2 through abandoned wells. Such detailed simulation would be valuable to develop effective abandonment practices as well as mitigation strategies at CO 2 sequestration sites...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação de Mestrado em Construção Metálica e Mista apresentada à Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de CoimbraOne of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects {{in the design of the}} offshore platforms is related to natural hazards and catastrophic events such as wind storm, wave, earthquake, explosion and fire. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling, which enables to examine complex structures affected by selected fire scenarios, has become one {{of the most}} common tools in the fire engineering, also in case of offshore platforms. Fires on offshore platforms are large, in the <b>open</b> air, <b>hydrocarbon</b> usually with a very rapid heat release. Unfortunately, this type of field models results in problems with their validation since there is a huge gap in analytical methods that could be used for this purpose. For the fire risk assessment, numerous experiments were performed in order to introduce analytical methods. However, these analytical approaches are valid only for particular conditions. The limitations are associated with the experimental environment on which they are based. Regarding the analytical models, EN 1991 - 1 - 2 presents a simplified calculation model developed by Heskestad to assess localised fires in case of fire in open air. However, this method shows some limitations: only the temperature in the plume is calculated and, if the wind effect is considered, the method is no longer applicable. Moreover, it is questionable to use Heskestad approach for large pool fires, since the experiments on which the method is based were conducted for smaller scale fires. There are also some analytical models for determining the radiative heat flux: Shokri and Beyler model, Mudan and Croce model and Modified Solid Flame model. However, they also show some limitations, especially due to the shape of the fire area by assuming that the fire flame is cylindrical. Due to the complex conditions, validation and accuracy of offshore fires and their field models is still uncertain. In this thesis, a numerical simulation of a full-scale hydrocarbon pool fire is performed in FDS software. The study case corresponds to a “fictitious” fixed offshore platform which dimensions are based on the typical offshore platform. It is defined as an open structure composed by three main decks and two intermediate decks, steel frames, compartments and helideck. Fire scenarios assume an accidental crude oil leakage, which spreads and results in a localised pool fire. Modelled scenarios vary due to the localisation of the fire, its size, the total heat release rate and wind conditions. The results from the FDS model are compared with the available analytical methods. It is observed that smaller grid sizes in FDS models give better prediction of the temperature in the plume along its symmetrical vertical axis if compared to the temperatures assessed by the expression given in EN 1991 - 1 - 2 for localised fires. The outcomes for the radiative heat fluxes from FDS models are within the values predicted by the analytical models. However, the deviation in the results from all considered methods was observed which arises from different assumptions that the analytical correlation are based on as well as the input parameters used for the numerical modelling...|$|R
40|$|Synthesis gas {{and clean}} {{hydrogen}} will become {{key components of}} the energy industry. Their production from fossil fuels {{is likely to be}} a major source of these energy vectors and chemical building blocks for many decades ahead. Currently all the hydrocarbon conversion steps are carried out above surface, starting from oil and gas extraction and transportation to dedicated plants, with any separated CO 2 returned back to the fields. However, there are increasingly strong drivers to reduce the environmental impact of the oil processing industry, by e. g. minimising the “footprint” of such operations and leaving the undesirable and low- value material underground (CO 2, heavy metals, sulphur). One novel approach, which could be key, would be the production of syngas or hydrogen via downhole hydrothermal processing/partial oxidation. This envisages using the sub-surface well system as a continuous processing and reactor network to carry out as much as possible of the required separations and conversions in the well system (underground) or close to it (at the wellhead). The goal is to radically reduce, by design, the overall environmental footprint (by minimising the number of species extracted other than final products, the number of external processing steps and the need for transport to/from the underground fields) while improving the overall economics of new fields and increasing the efficiency of recovery from conventional, mature reservoirs. This thesis presents research work on the hydrothermal gasification and partial oxidation of n-hexadecane, as a heavy hydrocarbon model, under potential downhole conditions. Thermodynamic analysis was carried out to predict equilibrium limits showing optimum conditions for maximising the theoretical yield of hydrogen under oxidative and non- oxidative hydrothermal conditions. This was followed by experimental analysis where hydrothermal gasification of n-hexadecane was conducted in high pressure flow reactor system. Conversion data at different residence times, and temperatures were used to determine the reaction kinetic data at sub- and supercritical water conditions. The new experimental system was modified for partial oxidation of n-hexadecane, to enable combined total decomposition of H 2 O 2, in a separate reactor, with partial oxidation of n-hexadecane, in a gasification reactor. The experimental data were consolidated with the development of a new CFD model for supercritical water gasification of hexadecane, and it was also used to validate and tune our kinetic data obtained experimentally by taking into account the radial effects occurring from the laminar flow under the experimental conditions. Finally, a new subsurface georeactor system model was developed, using ASPEN HYSYS, which shows thermodynamically the optimal conditions for maximising the system’s energy efficiency showing potential conditions for maximising energy recovery with hydrogen cogeneration. These results are discussed with view of opening new routes for clean generation of hydrogen and synthesis gas via underground gasification of <b>hydrocarbons.</b> <b>Open</b> Acces...|$|R
