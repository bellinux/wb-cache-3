At Beth Elohim, he focused on programming and services for urban Jewish families. Under his leadership, Beth Elohim opened after–school and early childhood centers in 1978, and a day camp the following year, all housed in the Temple House.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly {{pushed for the}} {{creation}} of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. Mullaly noted that New York City had less parkland per capita than many major European cities, and that the 1853 construction of Central Park had raised property values around the park immediately after construction. His association sent out pamphlets to high-profile New Yorkers, advocating for a new park. However, controversies arose over the proposals for new parks in the Bronx, and so the city did not authorize a commission for the planned new parks. Since the city refused to make a park commission, the New York Park Association appealed to the New York State Legislature instead. On April 19, 1883, the state passed a law authorizing a seven-person commission headed by association member Luther Marsh, which would be responsible for scouting out sites for future parks in the 23rd and 24th wards of New York City (now the portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> that is west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River). Mullaly was named the secretary, In June 1883, the commission visited the park site, and by January 1884, Marsh had drafted a bill to the New York State Legislature regarding a proposed park system in the Bronx, comprising six parks connected by three parkways.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{the park}} was sparsely used for sports. In 1899, there were 10, 7, and 5 permits issued for lawn tennis, baseball, and football, respectively. The Parade Ground was {{converted}} to recreational use starting in 1902, when the National Guard added fields for polo. In 1907, due to overcrowding, Dr. William Hornaday transferred 15 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> Zoo's then-rare bison to the Parade Ground, where they stayed until they were shipped to prairie land in Oklahoma later that year.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the {{original}} New York City Subway line in 1904, and throughout the subway's history, various official and planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions to the subway system. The first major expansion of the subway system was the Dual Contracts, a set of agreements between the City of New York and the IRT and the BRT. The system was expanded into the outer reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> Brooklyn, and Queens, and it provided for the construction of important lines in Manhattan. This one expansion of the system provided for a majority of today's system.|$|E
5|$|This {{station was}} not {{intended}} to be the terminus of the Concourse Line or the D train; both tracks were supposed to have been extended east past Bronx Park and the IRT White Plains Road Line along Burke Avenue to serve the northeast section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx.</b> This idea was postponed due to lack of funding, and ultimately abandoned when the City of New York bought the right-of-way of the bankrupt New York, Westchester and Boston Railway and converted it for subway use in 1941. Another proposal in the 1970s involved extending the Concourse Line to White Plains Road, but financial troubles caused the plan to be aborted.|$|E

5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work {{was going to be}} his masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown many times in the past. Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along the west bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River.|$|E
5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the parkway from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the parkway was helped by the fact that widening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The parkway, while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and the issue {{of what to do with}} truck traffic. The parkway, if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E
5|$|In December 1934, at {{the insistence}} of the Automobile Club of New York, several {{numbered}} routes were extended and signed within New York City, with NY22 being one of these routes. NY22 was extended south from the Mount Vernon line in the Bronx along White Plains Road, then it shifted via East 233rd Street to Webster Avenue until Fordham Road (US1). From Fordham Road, it continued south along the Grand Concourse (overlapped with NY100), crossing into Manhattan via East 149th Street to the 145th Street Bridge. In Manhattan, the NY22/100 pair continued south along Lenox Avenue, 110th Street, Fifth Avenue, 96th Street, and Park Avenue, ending at Houston Street (NY1A). By 1941, the alignment within Mount Vernon was shifted east to use Columbus Avenue and South 3rd Avenue (current NY22), continuing its route to New York City via East 233rd Street as before. On January1, 1970, the NY22 designation was removed from Manhattan and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> and the short piece remaining in the city was realigned to meet US1 at its current southern terminus.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, {{financial}} crisis gripped the New York City {{government and the}} troubles spread to the city's institutions, including NYU. Feeling the pressures of imminent bankruptcy, NYU President James McNaughton Hester negotiated {{the sale of the}} University Heights campus to the City University of New York, which occurred in 1973. In 1973, the New York University School of Engineering and Science merged into Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, which eventually merged into NYU in 2014 forming the present Tandon School of Engineering. After the sale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> campus, University College merged with Washington Square College. In the 1980s, under the leadership of President John Brademas, NYU launched a billion-dollar campaign that was spent almost entirely on updating facilities. The campaign was set to complete in 15 years, but ended up being completed in 10. In 2003 President John Sexton launched a $2.5 billion campaign for funds to be spent especially on faculty and financial aid resources.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, the New York State Legislature {{passed a}} law authorizing the {{construction}} of a highway connecting Route24 (an unsigned legislative route that is now part of NY30) to the new Veterans' Mountain Camp, an American Legion camp on Tupper Lake. The work was funded through appropriations defined in the law. The beginning of a state road to the camp came in 1924 when earth movers were brought in by the Harnathy Contracting Company, with construction beginning in early June. The project would include construction of a concrete bridge over the Bog River. However, Hanrathy was unable to finish the job as it went bankrupt, and a second firm, the Spadaccini Realty Construction Corporation <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bronx</b> was brought into finish the job, which began in June1925.The bridge over the Bog River was completed on August 29, 1925 and they announced would be opened for traffic within ten days.The route did finally open in 1925, with the Veterans Camp opening on May 15, 1926. This road was extended from modern NY30 north to a dead end at Warren Point. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways that did not yet have a designation were assigned one. The Veterans' Mountain Camp highway was designated as NY421 by the following year.|$|E
