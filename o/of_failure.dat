5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust in women, he mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E

However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the risk <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Leigh and Laurence Olivier {{performed}} {{two plays}} about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra and George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a {{season at the}} Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.|$|E
30|$|Considering the {{significant}} impact <b>of</b> dependent <b>failures</b> (CCF and cascading <b>failure)</b> on reliability <b>of</b> redundant systems, these types <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> substantially affect MTBF of such systems. Neglecting {{the role that}} these types <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> play may result in significantly misleading MTBF evaluation models which in turn lead to incorrect MTBF value. Therefore, this paper addresses these two important types <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> and incorporates those into a proposed model for MTBF evaluation of a 2 -out-of- 3 repairable redundant system.|$|R

5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient.

5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This mode <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E

5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> to osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|The blast {{caused by}} a sudden release of the gas {{pressure}} inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged. The greatest risk of explosion exists while filling, but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated. The cause <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> can range from reduced wall thickness or deep pitting due to internal corrosion, neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads, or cracking due to fatigue, sustained high stresses, or overheating effects in aluminum.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivations for}} self-harm vary, {{as it may}} be used to fulfill a number of {{different}} functions.

There is also a positive statistical correlation between self-harm and emotional abuse. Self-harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain, in contrast to the pain experienced earlier in the person's life of which they had no control over (e.g., through abuse).|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Most {{available}} {{approaches for}} adaptive accommodation <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> in flight control actuators {{result in a}} large number of parameters that need to be adjusted on-line. In this paper we propose a new failure parameterization that models a large class <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> in terms <b>of</b> a single parameter. The class <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> includes lock-in-place (LIP), float, hardover and loss of effectiveness (LOE). It is shown that the new parameterization accurately models this class <b>of</b> <b>failures,</b> and that the resulting model can be used for observer design to estimate the uncertain parameters on-line. The use of the resulting estimates in the adaptive reconfigurable control law at every instant is shown to result in a stable closed-loop system. The estimation and control algorithms are integrated within the θ-FLARE (θ-parameterized Fast on-Line Actuator Reconfiguration Enhancement) architecture. Properties of θ-FLARE and convergence properties <b>of</b> the <b>failure</b> parameter estimates are illustrated through simulations of F/A- 18 aircraft dynamics under multiple flight-critical failures.

A victory in extremis (2–3) at Georgetown, Guyana (with a penalty stopped by goalkeeper Dagoberto Portillo in additional time) allowed El Salvador to stay in the race for qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Unfortunately the home defeat (0–1) against Costa Rica buried the hopes of qualifying for the national team.

5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> to provide service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E
5|$|In case <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} {{are sometimes}} collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E

5|$|Mortality is {{high for}} eggs and hatchlings, and nests face threats from floods, overheating, and predators. Flooding {{is a major}} cause <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> of {{crocodilians}} to breed successfully, as nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen, and juveniles get washed away. One of the chief predators of alligators' eggs in Florida is the raccoon, which is attracted by olfactory cues after the nest has been disturbed by turtles. The Florida black bear also raids alligator eggs. In Africa, mongooses, honey badgers, baboons, otters, warthogs, bushpigs, and spotted hyenas are all fond of crocodile eggs, but the monitor lizard {{is thought to be}} the most important nest raider. This lizard is also a major hazard in Asia, where other egg predators include civets, mongooses, rats, sloth bears, jackals, and dogs.|$|E
5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} {{consists of}} a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators. This configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply: it has no redundancy in case <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> If the cylinder or first-stage regulator fails, the diver is totally out of air and faces a life-threatening emergency. Recreational diver training agencies train divers {{to rely on a}} buddy to assist them in this situation. The skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.|$|E
