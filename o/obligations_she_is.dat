In your Extenuation of Mrs. Byron's Conduct you [...] use as a plea, that, by her being my Mother, greater allowance ought [...] {{to be made for}} those little Traits in her Disposition, so much more [...] energetic than elegant. I am afraid, (however good your intention) [...] that you have added to rather than diminished my Dislike, for [...] independent of the moral <b>Obligations</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> under to protect, [...] cherish, and instruct her offspring, what can be expected of that [...] Man's heart and understanding who has continually (from Childhood to [...] Maturity) beheld so pernicious an Example? His nearest relation is the [...] first person he is taught to revere as his Guide and Instructor; the [...] perversion of Temper before him leads to a corruption of his own, and [...] when that is depraved, vice quickly becomes habitual, and, though [...] timely Severity may sometimes be necessary & justifiable, surely a [...] peevish harassing System of Torment is by no means commendable, & when [...] that is interrupted by ridiculous Indulgence, the only purpose [...] answered is to soften the feelings for a moment which are soon after [...] to be doubly wounded by the recal of accustomed Harshness. I will now [...] give this disagreeable Subject to the Winds. I conclude by observing [...] that I am the more confirmed in my opinion of the Futility of Natural [...] Ties, unless supported not only by Attachment but affectionate and [...] prudent Behaviour.|$|E
50|$|The Finnish Defense Forces {{does not}} conscript women. However, since 1995, women between 18 and 30 {{years of age}} have the {{possibility}} of voluntarily undertaking military service in the Defence Forces or in the Border Guard. Females serve under the same conditions as men, with the exception that during the first 45 days of service they {{have the option to}} leave the military without consequences. After that, they must complete the service which lasts 6, 9 or 12 months. After the service, the females face the same reserve obligations as the males who have done the obligatory military service. If the female in national service experiences a conscientious crisis which prevents her from fulfilling her military service or reserve <b>obligations,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> ordered to the alternative civilian service, which lasts 12 months.|$|E

Wade decision, Kathy Hall-Martinez, director of the International Program of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy (CRLP) in New York City, will deliver the 21 st annual Edith House Lecture, titled 2 ̆ 2 Using Legal Strategies to Promote Women 2 ̆ 7 s Reproductive Rights: Achievements and Challenges. 2 ̆ 2 The lecture will be given on Monday, March 3, 2003, at 4 p. m. in the newly renovated Classroom A at the University of Georgia School of Law. It {{is open to the public}} and admission is free. As director of the International Program at CRLP, Hall-Martinez focuses on reproductive health and rights issues from both comparative legal and international human rights perspectives. She has worked with non-governmental organizations to ensure the United Nations committees that monitor compliance with international human rights treaties hold national governments accountable for their reproductive rights <b>obligations.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> a frequent speaker on reproductive rights issues at conferences in North America, Latin America, Europe and Africa. Hall-Martinez has also collaborated on numerous publications including Reproductive Rights 2000 : Moving Forward, Reproductive Rights are Human Rights, and the program 2 ̆ 7 s signature Women of the World series. She received her Bachelor of Arts in Comparative Literature from Princeton University and her Juris Doctor from the Columbia University School of Law. The Edith House Lecture Series, hosted annually by the Women Law Students Association (WLSA), is named for one of the first female graduates of the University of Georgia School of Law. A native of Winder, Georgia, House was co-valedictorian of the law class of 1925, the first class to graduate women. She practiced law for 38 years and became assistant U. S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida and acting U. S. attorney for the district. #...|$|E

60|$|Between {{twelve and}} one that Sunday night Katharine lay in bed, not asleep, but in that {{twilight}} region where a detached and humorous view of our own lot is possible; or if we must be serious, our seriousness is tempered by the swift oncome of slumber and oblivion. She saw the forms of Ralph, William, Cassandra, and herself, {{as if they were}} all equally unsubstantial, and, in putting off reality, had gained a kind of dignity which rested upon each impartially. Thus rid of any uncomfortable warmth of partisanship or load of <b>obligation,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dropping off to sleep when a light tap sounded upon her door. A moment later Cassandra stood beside her, holding a candle and speaking in the low tones proper to the time of night.|$|R

Mrs Pitt further alleged that she entered into the charge because of the undue influence of Mr Pitt, that she had not understood the nature of the <b>obligation</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> undertaking or the amount involved and that, since Mr Pitt had acted as the agent of the plaintiff, the charge should be set aside as against the plaintiff. CIBC, in addition to denying the claims made by Mrs Pitt, contended that the transaction was not manifestly disadvantageous to Mrs Pitt and that, following National Westminster Bank plc v Morgan 1985 AC 686, the claim based on undue influence could not succeed.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a project {{investigating}} authorization systems that assign obligations to users. We are particu-larly interested in obligations that require authorization to be performed and that, when performed, may modify the authorization state. In this context, a user may incur an <b>obligation</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> unauthorized to perform. Prior work has introduced a property of the authorization system state that ensures users will be authorized to fulfill their obligations. We call this property accountability because users that fail to perform authorized obligations are accountable for their non-performance. While a reference monitor can mitigate violations of accountability, it cannot prevent them entirely. This paper presents techniques to be used by obligation sys-tem managers to restore accountability. We introduce sev-eral notions of dependence among pending obligations that must be considered in this process. We also introduce a novel notion we call obligation pool slicing, owing to its sim-ilarity to program slicing. An obligation pool slice identifies a set of obligations that the administrator may need to con-sider when applying strategies proposed here for restoring accountability. The paper also presents the system archi-tecture of an authorization system that incorporates obliga-tions that can require and affect authorizations...|$|R

They discover letters that the Boy has written to the Colonel, to the Boy's mother, and to a girl in England. They are moved to tears by reading the letters, but they burn them, and concoct a letter to the Boy's mother, telling the lie about cholera, and others about his great promise etc., which earns her undying gratitude - [...] "the <b>obligation</b> <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> under to us as long as she lived." [...] "All things considered, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> under an <b>obligation,</b> but not exactly as she meant."

6000|$|Henrietta, {{before leaving}} her, however, {{was obliged to}} make her {{understand}} that she could give no fictitious representation of her journey to Rome. Miss Stackpole was a strictly veracious reporter. On quitting her she took {{the way to the}} Lung' Arno, the sunny quay beside the yellow river where the bright-faced inns familiar to tourists stand all in a row. She had learned her way before this through the streets of Florence (<b>she</b> <b>was</b> very quick in such matters), and was therefore able to turn with great decision of step out of the little square which forms the approach to the bridge of the Holy Trinity. She proceeded to the left, toward the Ponte Vecchio, and stopped {{in front of one of}} the hotels which overlook that delightful structure. Here she drew forth a small pocket-book, took from it a card and a pencil and, after meditating a moment, wrote a few words. It is our privilege to look over her shoulder, and if we exercise it we may read the brief query: [...] "Could I see you this evening for a few moments on a very important matter?" [...] Henrietta added that she should start on the morrow for Rome. Armed with this little document she approached the porter, who now had taken up his station in the doorway, and asked if Mr. Goodwood were at home. The porter replied, as porters always reply, that he had gone out about twenty minutes before; whereupon Henrietta presented her card and begged it might be handed him on his return. She left the inn and pursued her course along the quay to the severe portico of the Uffizi, through which she presently reached the entrance of the famous gallery of paintings. Making her way in, she ascended the high staircase which leads to the upper chambers. The long corridor, glazed on one side and decorated with antique busts, which gives admission to these apartments, presented an empty vista in which the bright winter light twinkled upon the marble floor. The gallery is very cold and during the midwinter weeks but scantily visited. Miss Stackpole may appear more ardent in her quest of artistic beauty than she has hitherto struck us as being, but she had after all her preferences and admirations. One of the latter was the little Correggio of the Tribune--the Virgin kneeling down before the sacred infant, who lies in a litter of straw, and clapping her hands to him while he delightedly laughs and crows. Henrietta had a special devotion to this intimate scene--she thought it the most beautiful picture in the world. On her way, at present, from New York to Rome, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> spending but three days in Florence, and yet reminded herself that they must not elapse without her paying another visit to her favourite work of art. She had a great sense of beauty in all ways, and it involved a good many intellectual <b>obligations.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> about to turn into the Tribune when a gentleman came out of it; whereupon she gave a little exclamation and stood before Caspar Goodwood.|$|R
