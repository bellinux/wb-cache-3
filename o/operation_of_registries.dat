40|$|New York City {{authorities}} in 2006 formulated a policy requiring that medical data from all diabetics in the City {{be stored in}} a centralized registry. This diabetic registry {{is the first in}} the nation to require collection of personal testing data for the purpose of monitoring treatments for a noninfectious disease. The registry represents an important step on the path toward better understanding and managing of the disease. Nonetheless, establishment <b>of</b> the <b>registry</b> threatens privacy in a number of ways. Many individuals are open about their diabetes, but others prefer to keep that information to themselves, whether because of concerns for discrimination in the workplace or for ramifications in custody disputes. Although New York City’s regulation includes a confidentiality provision, privately identifiable information may be divulged through the notification process set up by the City, under which both physicians and patients are notified when their hemoglobin tests are dangerously high; through subpoenas in criminal and family court actions, and through use of the information by public health researchers to conduct epidemiological research. Regulators have already indicated that, despite the confidentiality provision, they intend to use the registry to conduct public health research that can only be attained by combining registry information with other statistics about the individuals covered. Moreover, there is no confidentiality provision at all for physicians, and <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>registry</b> may intrude upon the sanctity of the physician/patient relationship by providing physicians with troubling incentives either to circumvent the reporting requirements or to ensure that their patients appear healthier than they are. After considering the ways in which implementation <b>of</b> the <b>registry</b> potentially compromises privacy, the article concludes with a list of specific recommendations for both the NYC and future registries targeted at noninfectious diseases. In short, we recommend making the confidentiality provision more explicit, limiting secondary uses of the information obtained, protecting diabetics from adverse insurance consequences due to <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>registry,</b> and protecting the privacy of physicians...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Program <b>of</b> Cancer <b>Registries</b> is {{a federally}} funded {{surveillance}} program that provides support and assistance to state and territorial health departments for the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> cancer <b>registries.</b> The objective <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} identify factors associated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s costs to report cancer cases during the first 5 years of the National Program <b>of</b> Cancer <b>Registries.</b> Methods Information on expenditures and number of cases reported through the National Program <b>of</b> Cancer <b>Registries</b> was used to estimate the average cost per case reported for each state program. Additional information was obtained from other sources, and regression analyses were used to assess the contribution of each factor. Results Average costs of the National Program <b>of</b> Cancer <b>Registries</b> differed substantially among programs and were inversely associated with the number of cases reported (P <. 001). The geographic area of the state was positively associated with the cost (P =. 01), as was the regional cost of living (P =. 08), whereas the program type (i. e., enhancement or planning) was inversely associated with cost (P =. 08). Conclusion The apparent existence of economies of scale suggests that contiguous state programs might benefit from sharing infrastructure and other fixed costs, such as database management resources, depending on the geographic area and population size served. Sharing database management resources might also promote uniform data collection and quality control practices, reduce the information-sharing burden among states, and allow more resources to be used for other cancer prevention and control activities...|$|R
40|$|Police {{interviews}} with offenders form {{an important component}} of the sex offender registry monitoring process. This study provides an analysis of police professionals’ perceptions of the benefits and process of interviewing offenders on sex offender registries. Participants were a heterogeneous sample of 24 Australian police personnel whose roles were primarily associated with the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> sex offender <b>registries</b> across three different jurisdictions. Participants’ perceptions <b>of</b> sex offender <b>registry</b> interviews were elicited using non-directive prompts in focus groups of between two and five officers. Transcripts of these focus groups were analysed andkey themes identified. Reported benefits related to the identification and correction <b>of</b> misunderstandings about <b>registry</b> requirements and elicitation of information to assist ongoing management and investigation of new offences. Further, establishing a sound relationship enabled proactive support of the offender in his/her attempt not to re-offend. Interview procedures emphasised the importance of genuine engagement and a relationship based on trust. The findings highlighted several challenges to interviewing and directions for further training, support and research. Participants’ responses underscore the significant role that interviews play in the effective implementation <b>of</b> sex offender <b>registries</b> and emphasise the need for successful engagement of offenders during these interviews to improve the utility <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> schemes. This was the first study to examine the strengths and challenges of interviewing offenders on the registry from a policing perspective...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{developed and}} evaluated the different aspects such as security, feasibility, etc. of an online domain registration {{system and a}} payment gateway for the Sri Lanka Domain Registry as a pilot project in establishing a secure e-commerce infrastructure in Sri Lanka. In doing so, {{it was able to}} formalize and stream line the procedures and guidelines of registering domains and eliminate the delays that were earlier involved in registering domains at the registry. The Internet today has become a place for people to do their day to day purchases {{as well as for the}} sale of products to a global market. The security of the information that is being exchanged in such transactions is vital. If the correct methodologies are not used, it could lead to losses to the consumers as well as heavy losses to vendors that could include damage to long built reputation. Although the Internet usage in Sri Lanka has risen dramatically since its introduction in 1995, local institutions have still not fully exploited its potential for reaching a global market, the main factor for this is the unavailability of a good secure online payment infrastructure in Sri Lanka. Currency regulations restrict people from using the facilities offered by such infrastructure in other countries. Many of the financial institutions in Sri Lanka are reluctant to offer such facilities because of the fear of fraudulent transactions raised by the myth that submitting sensitive information such as credit card numbers on the Internet is very insecure. As a results of the research a web based registration system was developed and implemented to handle the domain registration process and a set of guidelines were also developed to assist in the acceptance of domain names. The security <b>of</b> the domain <b>registry's</b> servers was also scrutinized to enable smooth <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>registry.</b> Recommendations on selecting a suitable online payment system were also made by evaluating the implementation of different mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} Part One of a two-part essay series. It {{outlines}} and evaluates two possible future international instruments. Each instrument draws substantial {{inspiration from the}} Cape Town Convention and its Aircraft Protocol (together, the “Convention”). The Convention governs the secured financing and leasing of large commercial aircraft, aircraft engines, and helicopters. It entered into force in 2006. It has been adopted by sixty Contracting States (fifty-four of which have adopted the Aircraft Protocol), including the U. S., China, the E. U., India, Ireland, Luxembourg, Russia, and South Africa. A novel, distinctive, and path-breaking feature of the Convention is the international registry for the registration (i. e., public notice) of international interests in aircraft objects. It is a completely electronic, computer-based <b>registry</b> operated out <b>of</b> Ireland. It is operational 24 - 7. Inspired by the Convention’s international registry, Part One proposes {{a different sort of}} international registry—one of general application. This registry would constitute the national registry for each adopting State that would provide public notice of security interests in personal property (movables) created under the State’s domestic substantive law on secured transactions. Part One explores the potential scope and structure <b>of</b> such a <b>registry</b> and its benefits as well as the potential means of creation, implementation, and <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> such a <b>registry.</b> It also examines the feasibility of a project on an international <b>registry</b> <b>of</b> general application. Part One concludes that there is a plausible basis for the feasibility of such a project.
