5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of an}} organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the {{scientific name}} of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized <b>or</b> <b>underlined.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Plantae {{belongs to}} Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is {{separately}} classified. The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species. The scientific {{name of a}} plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism. For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum. Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet. The combination {{is the name of}} the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (<b>or</b> <b>underlined</b> when italics are not available).|$|E
25|$|Taxonomic {{names are}} written in italics (<b>or</b> <b>underlined</b> when handwritten) with a {{majuscule}} first letter {{with the exception of}} epithets for species and subspecies. Despite it being common in zoology, tautonyms (e.g. Bison bison) are not acceptable and names of taxa used in zoology, botany or mycology cannot be reused for Bacteria (Botany and Zoology do share names).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the book}} {{it is unclear}} if the first line begins with an [...] "M" [...] or [...] "W", but it is widely {{believed}} to be the letter W, owing to the distinctive difference when compared to the stricken letter M. There appears to be a deleted <b>or</b> <b>underlined</b> line of text that reads [...] "MLIAOI". Although the last character in this line of text looks like an [...] "L", it is fairly clear on closer inspection of the image that this is formed from an 'I' and the extension of the line used to delete or underline that line of text. Also, the other [...] "L" [...] has a curve to the bottom part of the character. There is also an [...] "X" [...] above the last 'O' in the code, and it is not known if this is significant to the code or not. Initially, the letters were thought to be words in a foreign language before it was realised it was a code. Code experts were called in at the time to decipher the lines but were unsuccessful. In 1978, following a request from ABC-TV journalist Stuart Littlemore, Department of Defence cryptographers analysed the handwritten text. The cryptographers reported that {{it would be impossible to}} provide [...] "a satisfactory answer": if the text was an encrypted message, its brevity meant that it had [...] "insufficient symbols", from which a clear meaning could be extracted, and the text could be the [...] "meaningless" [...] product of a [...] "disturbed mind".|$|E

5000|$|The {{practice}} of <b>underlined</b> (<b>or</b> doubly <b>underlined)</b> superscripted abbreviations was common in 19th-century writing (not limited to ordinal indicators in particular, and also extant in the Numero sign №), {{and was also}} found in handwritten English until at least the late 19th century (e.g. [...] "first" [...] abbreviated 1st or 1).|$|R
50|$|In modern usage, {{the first}} letter of {{the first part of}} the name, the genus, is always {{capitalized}} in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text (<b>or</b> <b>underlined</b> in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist Thomas Drummond) is now written as Phlox drummondii.|$|E

5000|$|The {{abbreviation}} [...] "sp." [...] is {{used when}} the actual specific name cannot or {{need not be}} specified.

[...] means [...] "an unspecified species of the genus Canis", while [...] "Canis spp." [...] means [...] "two or more species of the genus Canis". (The abbreviations [...] "sp." [...] and [...] "spp." [...] can easily {{be confused with the}} abbreviations [...] "ssp." [...] (zoology) or [...] "subsp."

50|$|A vinculum is a {{horizontal}} line used in mathematical notation {{for a specific}} purpose. It is most commonly used today to indicate the repetend of a repeating decimal.

For most of its uses it has been replaced by parentheses in modern notational style.|$|R

The calling name (Swedish tilltalsnamn, French Prénom usuel) by which the person is normally identified in conversation, is in Scandinavian countries (and previously in France) one of the given names, not necessarily the first. In contexts where the full name is spelled out, the calling name is often indicated by an asterisk, by capital letters, <b>or</b> <b>underlines</b> <b>or</b> italics.
