5|$|Because of the disappointing {{box office}} {{performances}} of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, Disney restricted its marketing campaign for Mulan spending $30 million on promotional advertisements compared {{to more than}} $60 million for Hercules the year before. Instead of the lavish media event premieres of Pocahontas in Central Park and the electric light parade <b>on</b> <b>Fifth</b> Avenue for Hercules, Disney opted to premiere the film at the Hollywood Bowl complete with Chinese lanterns and fortune cookies. Two days before the general release, McDonald's launched its promotional campaign by including one of eight toys free with {{the purchase of a}} Happy Meal. The promotion also included Szechuan sauce for its Chicken McNuggets, which would be referenced in a 2017 episode of the Adult Swim series Rick and Morty and subsequently brought back by McDonald's as a promotional item related to that show.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' flight to America Epstein was offered {{numerous}} samples of products by merchandisers who required a licence {{to be allowed}} to sell them such as clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games. Epstein rejected all of them; directing the merchandisers to Byrne instead, who was already in New York ensconced in The Drake Hotel on Park Avenue at 56th Street. Byrne rented expensive offices <b>on</b> <b>Fifth</b> Avenue, hiring two limousines (on 24-hour standby) and a helicopter to fly clients to and from the airport, insisting that only the presidents of merchandising companies were allowed to talk directly with him, or with his partner, Lord Eliot, who helped to promote the company name with use of his title. Eliot would later recall going to the Seltaeb office {{once or twice a week}} to draw $1,000 from petty cash.|$|E
5|$|In {{the street}} outside the theatre a street {{carnival}} took place. Living up to the moniker for the theater's marquee, “the Magic Sign of a Wonderful Time,” spotlights scanned the night sky, banks of Klieg lights illuminated the streets outside the theater, and flares were shot from the roofs of nearby buildings. Additionally, dance bands were placed at the closed intersections to provide entertainment and, using giant screens to project the words, a sing-along was orchestrated <b>on</b> <b>Fifth</b> Avenue {{in front of the}} theatre. An estimated crowd of between 50,000 and 100,000 people participated in the events.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{accepted}} {{reports of}} a Japanese counterattack at Saidor, and sent reinforcements in response, but the attack did not eventuate. Because the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation, he was initially reluctant to authorize it to block the trails behind the American beachhead. When he finally did so, it was too late. The retreating Japanese made good their escape, thereby defeating {{the whole purpose of}} the operation. The next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign in February 1944, played out differently. Based <b>on</b> <b>Fifth</b> Air Force reports that the islands were unoccupied, MacArthur accelerated his timetable and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force of the islands. Krueger sent in the Alamo Scouts, who confirmed that the islands were still well-defended.|$|E

5|$|NY394, {{initially}} {{known as}} Sixth Street {{within the city}} limits, splits into a one-way pair after crossing the Chadakoin River. At this point, eastbound NY394 shifts one block south to follow Fifth Street while westbound NY394 remains on Sixth. Between Washington Street and North Main Street, NY394 is concurrent with NY60, with NY60 south overlapping NY394 west on Sixth Street and NY60 north overlapping NY394 east <b>on</b> <b>Fifth.</b> The one-way pair remains intact through downtown to Prendergast Avenue, where NY394 comes back together and shifts south onto Fourth Street. Two blocks later, NY394 veers onto Second Street and passes south of Jamestown Community College before exiting the city. The portion of NY394 within Jamestown from the western city line to Prendergast Avenue is maintained by the city {{and is the only}} section of the route not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|The Bull's Head {{hotel on}} 44th Street, which refused to provide alcohol to the mob, was burned. The mayor's {{residence}} <b>on</b> <b>Fifth</b> Avenue, the Eighth and Fifth District police stations, and other buildings were attacked and set on fire. Other targets included {{the office of}} the New York Times. The mob was turned back at the Times office by staff manning Gatling guns, including Times founder Henry Jarvis Raymond. Fire engine companies responded, but some firefighters were sympathetic to the rioters because they had also been drafted on Saturday. Later in the afternoon, authorities shot and killed a man as a crowd attacked the armory at Second Avenue and 21st Street. The mob broke all the windows with paving stones ripped from the street. The mob beat, tortured and/or killed numerous black people, including one man who was attacked by a crowd of 400 with clubs and paving stones, then lynched, hanged from a tree and set alight.|$|E
5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, choral music, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble <b>on</b> <b>fifth</b> level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E

5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of dirt roads and private residences. The Southern Pacific Railroad's 1868 west side rail line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued on the tracks until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light rail tracks <b>on</b> <b>Fifth</b> Avenue for the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again ran past City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E
