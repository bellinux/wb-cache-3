5|$|The B.1 {{had four}} {{elevators}} (inboard) and four ailerons (<b>outboard).</b> In the B.2, these {{were replaced by}} eight elevons. The Vulcan was also fitted with six electrically operated three-position (in, medium drag, high drag) airbrakes, four in the upper centre section and two in the lower. There were originally four lower airbrakes but the <b>outboard</b> two were deleted before the aircraft entered service. A brake parachute was installed inside the tail cone.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} armament was two 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 {{machine guns}} fitted {{one in each}} wing <b>outboard</b> of undercarriage, operated by a mechanical pneumatics system from the pilot's control column. The rear gunner/radio operator operated one 7.92mm (.312in) MG 15 machine gun for defensive purposes.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the <b>outboard</b> ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the <b>outboard</b> ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|... 1956 {{ushered in}} the {{production}} of the first Tohatsu <b>Outboards</b> (1.5 hp). Since then, Tohatsu <b>outboards</b> have served a variety of marketplaces: commercial fishing, military, marine transport, surf life saving, recreation and competition racing. They are the second largest producer of <b>outboards</b> in the world.|$|R
50|$|Maintenance on I/Os is more {{complicated}} than <b>outboards</b> in several ways, less in others. While sterndrive engines are not as readily removable as smaller <b>outboards,</b> larger <b>outboards</b> (which combine both large powerheads and outdrives) are bigger, bulkier, and heavier than separate engine and outdrive components on sterndrives. Sterndrive engine compartments may be cramped; however components are neither as tightly engineered nor physically as compressed and densely packed as <b>outboards,</b> which all must fit under a streamlined integrated cover.|$|R

Loreauville is home to Pro Drive Shallow Water <b>Outboards</b> & Gator Tail Shallow Water <b>Outboards.</b> Pro Drive <b>Outboard's</b> currently occupies the original Gondron's Garage facility at the South end of the Village.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and <b>outboard</b> elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its hydraulic systems, which were also close together in the tail structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the <b>outboard</b> spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E
5|$|In the {{diffused}} lighting camouflage project, the Royal Canadian Navy experimented with variable counter-illumination camouflage to match horizon light levels and minimize ships' silhouettes during prolonged arctic twilight. During the experiments, {{one side of}} the test ship was faintly illuminated by projectors mounted <b>outboard.</b> Results were improved with the use of blue-green filters, and then with a photocell to measure the brightness of the night sky. The ship's visibility was reduced, but the technology was inconvenient and never adopted in practice.|$|E

5|$|On 24 June 2016, the Australian Transport Minister, Darren Chester, {{said that}} a piece of {{aircraft}} debris had been found on Pemba Island, {{off the coast of}} Tanzania. It was handed over to the authorities so that experts from Malaysia could determine whether {{it is part of the}} aircraft. The Australian government released photos of the piece, believed to be an <b>outboard</b> flap from one of the aircraft's wings, on 20 July. On 15 September, Malaysia's transport ministry confirmed that the debris came from the missing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the <b>outboard</b> wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained {{an arsenal of}} conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|E
5|$|The Skyfleet S570 {{aircraft}} in the film was an ex-British Airways 747-200B G-BDXJ which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the <b>outboard</b> engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner. The plane used {{can be seen on}} the BBC motoring programme Top Gear on the Test Track.|$|E
5000|$|British Seagull <b>outboards</b> {{were first}} sold {{under the name}} Marston Seagull. They were {{developed}} at John Marston Ltd's [...] "Sunbeamland" [...] factory in Wolverhampton by development engineers John Way-Hope and Bill Pinninger. This pair later bought the manufacturing rights and marketed <b>outboards</b> as Bristol Seagull, later moving to Poole and settling for the name British Seagull®.|$|R
5000|$|Electric <b>outboards</b> and {{trolling}} motors {{have been}} available for some years at prices from about $100 (US) up to several thousand. These require external batteries {{in the bottom of}} the boat, but are otherwise practical one-piece items. Most available electric <b>outboards</b> are not as efficient as custom drives, but are optimised for their intended use, e.g. for inland waterway fishermen. They are quiet and they do not pollute the water or the air, so they do not scare away or harm fish, birds and other wildlife. Combined with modern waterproof battery packs, electric <b>outboards</b> are also ideal for yacht tenders and other inshore pleasure boats.|$|R

5|$|The second 28cm shell struck {{near the}} {{aircraft}} hangar {{and started a}} major fire. As the fire spread, it detonated explosives carried for the infantry, hindering firefighting efforts. The explosion {{set fire to the}} two Arado seaplanes on board: one on the catapult and the other in one of the hangars. The explosion also probably punched a hole in the armored deck over turbine room 1. Turbine 1 and generator room 3 stopped for lack of steam and only the <b>outboard</b> shafts from turbine room 2/3 were operational.|$|E
5|$|The {{sides of}} the conning tower were 11inches thick {{and it had a}} 3-inch roof of KNC. It had a {{communications}} tube with 8inch walls of mild steel down to the Transmitting Station on the middle deck. The walls of the signal tower were 8inches thick while it had a roof of 3inches of KNC armour. 2inch torpedo bulkheads were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms of 'A', 'X' and 'Y' turrets, but this increased to 4inches abreast 'P' and 'Q' turrets to compensate for their <b>outboard</b> location.|$|E
5|$|Development {{flying and}} route proving with the Comet 3 allowed {{accelerated}} certification {{of what was}} destined to be the most successful variant of the type, the Comet 4. All airline customers for the Comet 3 subsequently cancelled their orders and switched to the Comet 4, which was based on the Comet 3 but with improved fuel capacity. BOAC ordered 19 Comet 4s in March 1955, while American operator Capital Airlines ordered 14 Comets in July 1956. Capital's order included 10 Comet 4As, a variant modified for short-range operations with a stretched fuselage and short wings, lacking the pinion (<b>outboard</b> wing) fuel tanks of the Comet 4. However, because of financial problems and a subsequent takeover by United Airlines, Capital would never operate the Comet.|$|E

5|$|During early August 1940, {{while she}} was still being {{outfitted}} and was in a semi-complete state, Prince of Wales was attacked by German aircraft. One bomb fell between the ship and a wet basin wall, narrowly missing a 100-ton dockside crane, and exploded underwater below the bilge keel. The explosion took place about six feet from the ship's port side {{in the vicinity of the}} after group of 5.25-inch guns. Buckling of the shell plating took place over a distance of 20 to , rivets were sprung and considerable flooding took place in the port <b>outboard</b> compartments in the area of damage, causing a ten-degree port list. The flooding was severe, due to the fact that final compartment air tests had not yet been made and the ship did not have her pumping system in operation.|$|E
5|$|If {{most of the}} Sea Harriers {{had been}} lost, the GR.3s would have {{replaced}} them in air patrol duties, even though the Harrier GR.3 was not designed for air defence operations; as such the GR.3s quickly had their <b>outboard</b> weapons pylons modified to take air-to-air Sidewinder missiles. From 10 to 24 May 1982, prior to British forces landing in the Falklands, a detachment of three GR.3s provided air defence for Ascension Island until three F-4 Phantom IIs arrived {{to take on this}} responsibility. During the Falklands War, the greatest threats to the Harriers were deemed to be surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and small arms fire from the ground. In total, four Harrier GR.3s and six Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire, accidents, or mechanical failure. More than 2,000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict—equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since hydraulic power to the landing gear in that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized they were too high for landing on runway 02, they decided to climb and go around for runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric thrust, the number one engine (<b>outboard</b> on left side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies would reveal.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, Lehr inc. Produced {{the first}} line of propane powered <b>outboards.</b> Designer Bernardo J. Herzer marked these <b>outboards</b> as low cost, green, and low maintenance. The first models {{included}} a 5 hp option and a 2.5 hp option. Since their introduction,Tohatsu has released their own 5hp versions. The Lehr original currently offers sizes ranging from the original 2.5 hp to 40 hp. Propane's advantages over gasoline include increased fuel stability, lower emissions, and reliability.|$|R

5|$|Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, the {{commander}} of the Kriegsmarine, proposed on 13 November that Tirpitz be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a fleet in being to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of Bismarck, agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5cm guns on the superstructure next to the catapult were moved <b>outboard</b> to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit. The ship's commander, Kapitän zur See (KzS—Captain at Sea) Karl Topp, pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942. The following day, Tirpitz left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the <b>outboard</b> slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|Ise was {{attacked}} by 80-odd aircraft from the fourth wave, but they failed to inflict any serious damage. She dodged 11 torpedoes and was only hit by a bomb once, on the bulge <b>outboard</b> of the port catapult. Some 34 other bombs near missed her, spraying her with splinters and ruptured some hull plates that contaminated some fuel oil and caused leaks in her port boiler rooms. While an exact total of her casualties is not available, {{it has been estimated}} that 5 men were killed and some 111–121 crewmen were wounded during this attack. Hyūga was unsuccessfully attacked by an American submarine at 18:43. Around 19:00 Ozawa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that drove off the Japanese destroyers rescuing survivors from some of the carriers lost earlier in the day and sank Chiyoda. He ordered the Fourth Carrier Division to reverse course and engage the Americans, but the battleships were unable to find them, and Ozawa ordered them to reverse course and head for Amami Ōshima. When they arrived on 27 October, Ozawa transferred to Hyūga and hoisted his flag aboard her. While en route for Kure, the division was unsuccessfully attacked by another submarine.|$|E
