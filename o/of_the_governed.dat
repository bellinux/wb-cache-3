25|$|In the United States {{there has}} never been a {{national}} political party called the Conservative Party.

25|$|In {{order for}} custom {{to become a}} source of law, it must be {{approved}} by the competent legislator. Custom in canon law is not simply created by the people through their constant performance of a certain act, but it is the constant performance of a certain act, with the intention of making a custom, which is approved by the competent legislator, thereby acquiring the force of law. This is because of the Catholic ecclesiological teaching on the constitution of the Catholic Church, which states that Christ constituted the Church by divine delegation of power to the hierarchical authorities; the Church was not created by the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed,</b> but by the direct will of Christ.|$|E

25|$|After the Revolution, {{genuinely}} {{democratic politics}} became {{possible in the}} former colonies. The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions. Concepts of liberty, individual rights, equality among men and hostility toward corruption became incorporated as core values of liberal republicanism. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed.</b> The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with directly elected representative government.|$|E
25|$|Besides jurists {{there was}} a second {{community}} of Muslim ulema, the scholars and ascetics. Foremost among these ābid was Buhlul b.

By virtue of their piety and independence, the ābid won social prestige and a voice in politics; some scholars would speak on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed</b> cities, criticizing the regime's finance and trade decisions. Although substantially different, the status of the ābid relates somewhat to the much later, largely Berber figure of the Maghribi saint, the wali, who as keeper of baraka (spiritual charisma) became the object of veneration by religious believers, and whose tomb would be the destination of pilgrimage.|$|E

500|$|On April 7, 1848, in {{response}} to a citizen's petition, the New York State Assembly passed the Married Woman's Property Act, giving women the right to retain property they brought into a marriage, as well as property they acquired during the marriage. Creditors could not seize a wife's property to pay a husband's debts. Leading up to the passage of this law, in 1846, supporters issued a pamphlet, probably authored by Judge John Fine, which relied on its readers' familiarity with the United States Declaration of Independence to demand [...] "That all are created free and equal...", and that this idea should apply equally to the sexes. [...] "Women, as well as men, are entitled to the full enjoyment of its practical blessings". A group of 44married women of western New York wrote to the Assembly in March 1848, saying [...] "your Declaration of Independence declares, that governments derive their just powers from the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed.</b> And as women have never consented to, been represented in, or recognized by this government, it is evident that in justice no allegiance can be claimed from them...

2500|$|While Locke {{spoke in}} the {{language}} of natural law, the content of this law was by and large protective of natural rights, and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred. Political philosopher Jeremy Waldron has pointed out that Locke's political thought was based on [...] "a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions." [...] To Locke, the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the Decalogue, Christ's teaching and exemplary life, and St. Paul's admonitions. Locke derived the concept of basic human equality, including the equality of the sexes ("Adam and Eve"), from , the starting-point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free, governments need the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed.</b> Thomas Jefferson, arguably echoing Locke, appealed to unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence, [...] "We hold these truths to be self-evident, {{that all men are created}} equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." [...] The Lockean idea that governments need the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed</b> was also fundamental to the Declaration of Independence, as the American Revolutionaries used it as justification for their separation from the British crown.|$|E

But it is an authoritarian state where the consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed</b> is essential. Given the experience of the 1990s and the Kremlin’s propaganda emphasizing this period as one of chaos, economic collapse, and international humiliation, the Russian people have no great enthusiasm for democracy and remain politically apathetic in light of the extraordinary economic recovery and improvement in lifestyles for so many over the last eight years. The emergent, highly centralized government, combined with a weak and submissive society, is the hallmark of traditional Russian paternalism." ...|$|E
