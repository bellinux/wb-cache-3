5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E
5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} of state inheritance taxes on two estates also plagued Black. In the first case, Governor Stanley {{had made a}} compromise {{settlement of}} back taxes with L. V. Harkness before his death. The compromise was criticized, and although Black asked {{the attorney general to}} investigate, the case was not decided during Black's tenure as governor. In the second case, Stanley had appointed three special attorneys to collect inheritance taxes from the estate of Mrs. Robert Worth Bingham. Black wanted the attorneys to resign and save the state their large fees, but refused to remove them outright. This action was made more damning because one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> was a member of Black's campaign staff.|$|E

5|$|While {{the first}} trial was under way, events outside the {{courtroom}} influenced public perception of communism: the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon, and communists prevailed in the Chinese Civil War. Public opinion was overwhelmingly against the defendants. After a 10 month trial the jury found all 11 defendants guilty and the judge sentenced them to terms of {{up to five years}} in federal prison, further sentencing all five defense attorneys to imprisonment for contempt of court. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> were subsequently disbarred.|$|E

On July 19, Feit appeared in court for a prehearing. The trial was expected to place on September 11. However, on September 10, the court decided to push the trial due to scheduling conflicts with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> and because of delays in another high-profile case in the Hidalgo County. Feit appeared in court on September 11 – for the first time without prison uniform – expecting to face trial that week. The initial phase of jury selection was done in mid-September; the trial was pushed for mid-October.|$|E
5|$|The West Coast offices {{had wanted}} {{a test case}} to take to court, but had a {{difficult}} time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU's desired criteria of a sympathetic, Americanized plaintiff. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed, and Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court. Hirabayashi v. United States came before the Court in May 1943, and the justices upheld the government's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast; although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case (over a third of the legal team's total budget) and submitted an amicus brief. Besig, dissatisfied with Osmond Fraenkel's tamer defense, filed an additional amicus brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> in Yasui v. United States (decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case, and with the same results), but he kept his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, ex parte Endo, was also aided by two amicus briefs from the ACLU, one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins.|$|E

25|$|In Saint Louis, Missouri {{records of}} nearly 300 {{petition}} {{cases have been}} found that were filed between 1807 and 1860, and in Washington, D.C. nearly 500 petition cases were filed in the same period.

In {{the early nineteenth century}} in St. Louis and in Washington, D.C., nearly half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attorneys</b> at the bar may have acted as counsel for slave petitions. In Missouri, the courts assigned an attorney to the petitioner if it accepted a freedom suit for hearing; some of the top attorneys in St. Louis defended slaves.

In St. Louis, if the court accepted a freedom suit, it assigned an attorney for the slave petitioner. Among the notable attorneys representing slaves in St. Louis was Edward Bates, future Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln.
