50|$|The Finance Commission was {{established}} in 1951 by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the then-incumbent Law Minister, to address these imbalances. Several provisions to bridge the fiscal gap between the Centre and the States were already enshrined in the Constitution of India, including Article 268, which facilitates levy of duties by the Centre but equips the States to collect and retain the same. Similarly, Articles 269, 270, 275, 282 and 293, among <b>others,</b> <b>specify</b> ways and means of sharing resources between the Union and States. In addition to the above provisions, the Finance Commission serves as an institutional framework to facilitate Centre-State Transfers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{semantic}} view {{of theories}} is {{a position in}} the philosophy of science that holds that a scientific theory can be identified with a collection of models. The semantic view of theories was originally proposed by Patrick Suppes in “A Comparison of the Meaning and Uses of Models in Mathematics and the Empirical Sciences” as a reaction against the received view of theories popular among the [...] logical positivists. Many varieties of the semantic view propose identifying theories with a class of set-theoretic models in the Tarskian sense, while <b>others</b> <b>specify</b> models in the mathematical language stipulated by the field of which the theory is a member.|$|E

5000|$|There is some {{confusion}} about the instrument to which the name was originally applied. Some identify the early theodolite as an azimuth instrument only, while <b>others</b> <b>specify</b> it as an altazimuth instrument. In Digges's book, the name [...] "theodolite" [...] described an instrument for measuring horizontal angles only. He also described an instrument that measured both altitude and azimuth, which he called a topographicall instrument [...] Thus the name originally applied only to the azimuth instrument and only later became associated with the altazimuth instrument. The 1728 Cyclopaedia compares [...] "graphometer" [...] to [...] "half-theodolite". Even {{as late as the}} 19th century, the instrument for measuring horizontal angles only was called a simple theodolite and the altazimuth instrument, the plain theodolite.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} similar, {{overlapping}} definitions of health outcomes, all involving changes in health status. Some stipulate {{that the population}} or group has to be defined (different outcomes are expected for different people & conditions), whilst <b>others</b> <b>specify</b> that health outcomes {{are the result of}} interventions or their lack, rather than simply change over time. A strong example is that of Australia’s New South Wales Health Department: health outcome is [...] "change in the health of an individual, group of people or population which is attributable to an intervention or series of interventions"In its purest form, measurement of health outcomes implies identifying the context (diagnosis, demographics etc.), measuring health status before an intervention is carried out, measuring the intervention, measuring health status again and then plausibly relating the change to the intervention.|$|E
5000|$|While some churches {{identify}} {{only one}} key document as their subordinate standard, <b>others</b> <b>specify</b> several. For example, in 1789 the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America adopted the Westminster Confession of Faith, {{together with the}} Larger Catechism and the Shorter Catechism, but modified the Confession to bring its teaching on civil government in line with American practices and removed references to the Pope as an Antichrist. The Presbyterian Reformed Church (North America) adopted the Westminster Confession of Faith along with the Larger and Shorter Catechisms and Directory of Public Worship, while the (separate) Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America considers as its constitution the same standards along with the Testimony, Directory for Church Government, and Book of Discipline. In Australia, the Presbyterian Church of Australia accepts the Westminster Confession of Faith, read {{in the light of}} a Declaratory Statement of 1901. The Presbyterian Church of Victoria, one of its constituent bodies, also subscribes to the [...] "general principles" [...] of the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, the Form of Presbyterial Church Government, the Directory of Public Worship, and the 1578 Second Book of Discipline. The Presbyterian Church in Canada produced a Declaration of Faith Concerning Church and Nation deemed a [...] "subordinate standard" [...] of the PCC in 1954.|$|E
