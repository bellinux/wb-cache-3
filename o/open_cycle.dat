5|$|Dunston Power Station {{refers to}} a pair of {{adjacent}} coal-fired power stations in the North East of England, now demolished. They were built on the south bank of the River Tyne, in the western outskirts of Dunston in Gateshead. The two stations were built on a site which is now occupied by the MetroCentre. The first power station built on the site was known as Dunston A Power Station, and the second, which gradually replaced it between 1933 and 1950, was known as Dunston B Power Station. The A Station was, in its time, {{one of the largest in}} the country, and as well as burning coal had early <b>open</b> <b>cycle</b> gas turbine units. The B Station was the first of a new power station design, and stood as a landmark in the Tyne for over 50years. From the A Station's opening in 1910 until the B Station's demolition in 1986, they collectively operated from the early days of electricity generation in the United Kingdom, through the industry's nationalisation, and until a decade before its privatisation.|$|E
25|$|Simple-cycle or <b>open</b> <b>cycle</b> {{gas turbine}} plants, without a steam cycle, are {{sometimes}} installed as emergency or peaking capacity; their thermal efficiency is much lower. The high running cost per hour is {{offset by the}} low capital cost and the intention to run such units {{only a few hundred}} hours per year. Other gas turbine plants are installed in stages, with an <b>open</b> <b>cycle</b> gas turbine the first stage and additional turbines or conversion to a closed cycle part of future project plans.|$|E

25|$|The low {{pressure}} in the evaporator is maintained by a vacuum pump that also removes the dissolved non-condensable gases from the evaporator. The evaporator now contains a mixture of water and steam of very low vapor quality (steam content). The steam is separated from the water as saturated vapor. The remaining water is saturated and is discharged to the ocean in the <b>open</b> <b>cycle.</b> The steam is a {{low pressure}}/high specific volume working fluid. It expands in a special low pressure turbine.|$|E
2500|$|Steam {{locomotives}} consume {{vast quantities}} of water because they operate on an <b>open</b> <b>cycle,</b> expelling their steam immediately after a single use rather than recycling it in a closed loop as stationary and marine steam engines do. Water was a constant logistical problem, and condensing engines were devised for use in desert areas. These engines had huge radiators in their tenders and instead of exhausting steam out of the funnel it was captured, passed back to the tender and condensed. The cylinder lubricating oil {{was removed from the}} exhausted steam to avoid a phenomenon known as priming, a condition caused by foaming in the boiler which would allow water to be carried into the cylinders causing damage because of its incompressibility. The most notable engines employing condensers (Class 25, the [...] "puffers which never puff") worked across the Karoo desert of South Africa from the 1950s until the 1980s.|$|E

A conceptual plan for the Raptor project was first unveiled in a June 2009 AIAA presentation. In November 2012, Musk announced a new direction for propulsion side of the company: developing LOX/methane rocket engines for launch vehicle main and upper stages. The Raptor LOX/methane engine will use the more efficient staged combustion cycle, {{a departure from the}} <b>open</b> <b>cycle</b> gas generator cycle system and LOX/RP-1 propellants that the current Merlin 1 engine series uses." [...] The rocket would be more powerful than previously released publicly, with over [...] of thrust. The Raptor engine will likely be the first in a family of methane-based engines SpaceX intends to build. In August 2016, a Raptor engine was shipped to the McGregor testing facility in Texas, where it is undergoing development testing.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of solar}} thermal energy for air {{conditioning}} in buildings has gained interest in the last years. In particular the attention focused on solutions {{which could lead to}} the realisation of solar driven de-centralised systems. Technologies implementing thermodynamic <b>open</b> <b>cycles</b> result often suitable for coupling with market available solar systems, since low temperature heat can drive the process. The disadvantage of such systems is the thermodynamic limit of the cycle employed which diminishes the possibility to employ the technology in any condition. Among them the desiccant and evaporative cooling (DEC) systems have been widely studied, for large size air-conditioning plants with compulsory ventilation. But DEC air-conditioning systems are not suitable small size applications, due to technical problems and high costs. A new desiccant-cooling concept (i. e., ECOS) has been developed and is here briefly presented. It is based on a combination of cooled sorption and continuous indirect adiabatic cooling processes. The component where the cycle takes place is derived from a conventional cross flow air-to-air heat exchanger. The cycle offers the chance to overcome the disadvantages of sorption <b>open</b> <b>cycles.</b> The thermodynamic analysis of the cycle and the experimental tests reveals that ECOS extends the range of application in comparison to other implementations of <b>open</b> <b>cycles</b> and moreover performs particularly well in the range of climatic conditions critical for DEC systems (i. e., hot humid climates). During the work reported on this paper an analysis of the performance of the cycle, in terms of COP, has been carried out. Furthermore the efficiency of the whole system (solar and ECOS) has been worked out through the investigation of the SCOP (Solar Coefficient of Performance) characterising the system. The results analysis allowed to draw a picture of the solar assisted air-conditioning system performance and potential application...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the generation of}} low- and intermediate-level waste (LILW) and high-level waste (HLW) from open and closed nuclear fuel cycles. The closed fuel cycle reflects the development and deployment of fast reactors and pyroprocessing from 2013 to 2100, while the <b>open</b> fuel <b>cycle</b> only considers pressurized water reactors. The closed fuel cycle hardly affects short-term spent fuel management but can save nearly 60 % space of interim storage compared with the <b>open</b> fuel <b>cycle.</b> Compared with the <b>open</b> fuel <b>cycle,</b> the accumulated volume of HLW can be significantly reduced in the closed fuel cycle up to over 95 % in 2100. For this volume reduction, high heat generating fission products should be separated from transuranic waste in pyroprocessing and stored in decay storages for a few hundred years. Mining and milling waste in the closed fuel cycle decreases by about 31 %. In contrast, the closed fuel cycle generates 3. 0 %- 4. 5 % more LILW than the <b>open</b> fuel <b>cycle</b> because fast reactors and pyroprocessing produce more LILW and conversion, enrichment, and fabrication produce less LILW. In the closed fuel cycle, operation and decommissioning wastes from reactor and pyroprocessing, respectively, contribute to 74 % and 8 % of LILW excluding mining and milling wasteclose 1...|$|R
