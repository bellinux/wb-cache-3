40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on the relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and the macroeconomy in order to explain why high <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> {{over the past three years}} do not appear to have led to a slow-down the world economy. It makes three arguments. First, that <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> have never been as important as is popularly thought. Second, that the most important route through which <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> affect output is monetary policy: when <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> pass through to core inflation, monetary authorities raise interest rates, slowing growth. It is argued that the direct effect of high <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> on output is relatively small and that the microeconomic mechanisms proposed in the literature are insufficient to explain the historical impact of <b>oil</b> <b>prices.</b> Based on the second argument, the third argument is that high <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> have not reduced growth in the past three years because they no longer pass through to core inflation, so the monetary tightening previously seen in response to high <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> is absent...|$|R
40|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} palm oil {{exporter}} in the world so that {{the rise and fall}} of the return of palm <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> in international markets will affect farmers' incomes and exporter of palm oil in Indonesia. This study is aimed to analyze the factors that affect the return volatility of crude palm <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> in international market. Observation period from July 1985 until May 2010. Variables used in this analysis to influence the return of palm <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> are the return of petroleum <b>oil</b> <b>prices,</b> the harvest of soybean in the United States that occurred in October / November, and harvest the palm oil that occurred in July / August. Analysis model used in this study is autoregressive model (AR) which is processed by using Exponential Generalized autoregressive conditional Heteroskedastic (EGARCH). The advantages of this model is able to determine whether there is in addition to time varying behavior volatility, leverage effect is also contained in the data return of the international palm <b>oil</b> <b>prices.</b> The results showed that petroleum prices return has positive and significant impact on crude palm <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> return. Soybean harvest will increase average crude palm <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> return. Harvest of palm oil does not impact on average crude palm <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> return.

40|$|We assess {{claims that}} OPEC's ability to {{influence}} real <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> has diminished and {{that the relationship between}} real <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and OPEC production can be used to test competing hypotheses about OPEC behavior.

These variables "Granger cause" real <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> but real <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> do not "Granger cause" these variables. These results imply that OPEC influences <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and that previous models cannot be used to test competing models for OPEC production behavior.

The most common cause of increasing <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> over the last thirty years has been a decrease in supply. Prices increased during the early 1970 s as OPEC reduced supply.
