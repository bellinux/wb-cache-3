5|$|In 1998, after 20th Century Fox had greenlit James Cameron's {{version of}} the film remake, the company's video game division, Fox Interactive, started {{planning}} a video game tie-in. The film project went on hold when Cameron pulled out, but Fox Interactive remained confident a remake would progress eventually and continued with the game. Fox contracted French company Visiware as developer; with the film on hold, the creators developed their <b>own</b> <b>story</b> inspired by Boulle's novel and the original films. The game is an action-adventure in which the player controls astronaut Ulysses after he crashes on the Planet of the Apes. The game was developed for PC and PlayStation.|$|E
5|$|Juan Leyrado {{played a}} {{grandfather}} {{for the first}} time in his career. Unlike the usual telenovela grandfather (a secondary character), his character has a prominent role and his <b>own</b> <b>story</b> arcs.

Korean-Argentine Chang Kim Sung, who played Walter Mao, said he was proud that his character did not conform to stereotypes of Asian people.|$|E

5|$|The Gouldens {{included}} {{their children}} in social activism. As part of the movement to end slavery in the US, Goulden welcomed American abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher when he visited Manchester.

5|$|The {{character}} of Tess was {{originally intended to}} be featured as the main antagonist of The Last of Us, pursuing Joel for a year before a final confrontation in which she is killed by Ellie. However, the team {{found it difficult to}} believe that Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by significantly adjusting the story. Actress Annie Wersching was impressed by the script, and Druckmann's ability to write unique female characters. When writing the game's female characters, particularly Tess and Ellie, Druckmann avoided external influences, such as the media's portrayal of women, as he wished to write his <b>own</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} conceived in 1999 as Resident Evil 4. Due {{to the staff}} feeling it would not fit the Resident Evil franchise, the project dropped its ties to Resident Evil and was made into its <b>own</b> <b>story</b> instead. Devil May Cry received prominent coverage in the video game media due to the impact {{it had in the}} action game genre, its high difficulty and the high overall scores which many professional reviewers concluded {{to be one of the}} best and most innovative video games of all time. The game has sold more than three million copies, and spawned multiple Capcom-developed sequels and prequels.|$|E

5|$|Disney had {{originally}} conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe {{to be with}} a British prince. However, director Tony Bancroft, who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind of Disney heroine – one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot, while Mulan's bravery and strength were emphasized {{in order to ensure that}} she remained the hero of her <b>own</b> <b>story.</b> Mulan's supervising animator was Mark Henn, who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{development}} as an action role-playing sequel to , it retained elements from the Final Fantasy series while having its <b>own</b> <b>story</b> and gameplay elements. The producer of The 4 Heroes of Light, Tomoya Asano, returned to produce Bravely Default. The story's writer was Naotaka Hayashi, who {{was brought in}} from 5pb. due to his work on Steins;Gate. The characters designs were handled by multiple artists, including art director Akihiko Yoshida and Atsushi Ōkubo. The game was influenced by western video games and television series, and individual elements were inspired by aspects of the Dragon Quest series and Higurashi When They Cry. The music, composed by Revo of Sound Horizon, was intended to evoke the feelings of classic series such as Dragon Quest and SaGa.|$|E
