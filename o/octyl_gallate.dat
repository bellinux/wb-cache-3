The {{study examined}} whether the simple phenolic compound <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> affects ATP-induced Ca 2 + signaling in PC 12 cells using fura- 2 -based digital Ca 2 + imaging and whole-cell patch clamping. Treatment with ATP (100 µM) for 90 s induced increases in [Ca 2 +]i in PC 12 cells. Pretreatment with <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> (100 nM to 20 µM) for 10 min inhibited the ATP-induced [Ca 2 +]i response in a concentration-dependent manner (IC 50 = 2. 84 µM). Treatment with <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> (3 µM) for 10 min significantly inhibited the ATP-induced response following {{the removal of}} extracellular Ca 2 + with nominally Ca 2 +-free HEPES HBSS or depletion of intracellular Ca 2 + stores with thapsigargin (1 µM). Treatment for 10 min with the L-type Ca 2 + channel antagonist nimodipine (1 µM) significantly inhibited the ATP-induced [Ca 2 +]i increase, and treatment with <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> further inhibited the ATP-induced response. Treatment with <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> significantly inhibited the [Ca 2 +]i increase induced by 50 mM KCl. Pretreatment with protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporin (100 nM) and GF 109203 X (300 nM), or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (50 µM) did not significantly affect the inhibitory effects of <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> on the ATP-induced response. Treatment with <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> markedly inhibited the ATP-induced currents. Therefore, we conclude that <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> inhibits ATP-induced [Ca 2 +]i increase in PC 12 cells by inhibiting both non-selective P 2 X receptor-mediated influx of Ca 2 + from extracellular space and P 2 Y receptor-induced release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores in protein kinase-independent manner.

The main idea was to formulate concentrated solutions of specific food components at the nanoscale to be consumed either on their own or as integrating parts of classic foods, upon aqueous dilution. For this purpose microemulsions consisting of (R) -(+) -limonene/ethanol/Tween 40 /water/propylene glycol were formulated in the presence {{and in the absence of}} squalene, gallic acid and <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate.</b> The limits of the single-phase region as described by pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were related to the nature of the food additive. The more extended monophasic region was obtained when <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> was added in the system. Interfacial properties of the microemulsions were studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy employing the nitroxide spin probe 5 -doxylstearic acid (5 -DSA).

40|$|Background and Design: The allergens {{responsible}} for {{allergic contact dermatitis}} vary among countries and even between different geographical regions within the same country over time. It is of great importance to perform the patch test at certain intervals, to evaluate the results in different centers and to compare them afterwards. Our aim was to evaluate the patch test results in our patients with allergic contact dermatitis. Material and Method: The records of the patients with allergic contact dermatitis, who had been patch tested between May 1997 and March 2009, were analyzed retrospectively. The demographic features such as age and sex, localization of the contact dermatitis, and the patch test results were recorded. Results: Of the 775 patients, 581 (75. 2 %) were females and 194 (25 %) males. Of all patients, 735 were patch tested with the European Standard Series, 318 - with both the European Standard Series and cosmetic series, and 40 -with cosmetic series alone. Of the patients tested with the European Standard Series, 255 (34. 7 %) {{had at least one}} positive reaction. The most frequent allergen in the European Standard Series was nickel sulfate (17. 3 %), followed by cobalt chloride (7. 2 %), potassium dichromate (3 %), fragrance mix (2. 9 %), and p-phenylenediamine base (2. 6 %). Of the 358 patients tested with cosmetic series, 82 (22. 9 %) had at least one positive reaction.

40|$|AbstractThe {{constitutive}} {{expression of}} the bacterial carotene desaturase (CRTI) in Arabidopsis thaliana leads to increased susceptibility of leaves to light-induced damage.

A much higher level of superoxide/hydrogen peroxide was generated in the light in thylakoid membranes from the CRTI expressing lines than in wild-type while the level of singlet oxygen generation remained unchanged. The increase in reactive oxygen species was related to the activity of plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) since their generation was inhibited by the PTOX-inhibitor <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate,</b> and since the protein level of PTOX was increased in the CRTI-expressing lines.

40|$|Certain phytopathogenic fungi {{are able}} to express {{alternative}} NADH- and quinol-oxidising enzymes that are insensitive to inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory Complexes I and III. To assess {{the extent to which}} such enzymes confer tolerance to respiration-targeted fungicides, an understanding of mitochondrial electron transfer in these species is required. An isolation procedure has been developed which results in intact, active and coupled mitochondria from the wheat pathogen Septoria tritici, as evidenced by morphological and kinetic data. Exogenous NADH, succinate and malate/glutamate are readily oxidised, the latter activity being only partly (approx. 70 %) sensitive to rotenone. Of particular importance was the finding that azoxystrobin (a strobilurin fungicide) potently inhibits fungal respiration at the level of Complex III.

To further probe the roles of these transporters, we assembled a T. b. brucei strain lacking all three AQP-genes. Triple-null aqp 1 - 2 - 3 T. b. brucei displayed only a very moderate growth defect in vitro, established infections in mice and recovered effectively from hypotonic-shock. The aqp 1 - 2 - 3 trypanosomes did, however, display glycerol uptake and efflux defects. They failed to accumulate glycerol or to utilise glycerol as a carbon-source and displayed increased sensitivity to salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> or propyl gallate; these inhibitors of trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) can increase intracellular glycerol to toxic levels. Notably, disruption of AQP 2 alone generated cells with glycerol transport defects. Consistent with these findings, AQP 2 -defective, melarsoprol-resistant clinical isolates were sensitive to the TAO inhibitors, SHAM, propyl gallate and ascofuranone, relative to melarsoprol-sensitive reference strains. We conclude that African trypanosome AQPs are dispensable for viability and osmoregulation but they make important contributions to drug-uptake, glycerol-transport and respiratory-inhibitor sensitivity.

The species of Cryptococcus tested showed higher sensitivity to mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) inhibition compared to species of Candida. This higher sensitivity results from the inability of Cryptococcus to generate cellular energy through fermentation. To heighten disruption of cellular MRC, <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> (OG) or 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzaldehyde (2, 3 -DHBA), phenolic compounds inhibiting mitochondrial functions, were selected as chemosensitizers to pyraclostrobin (PCS; an inhibitor of complex III of MRC). The cryptococci were more susceptible to the chemosensitization (i. e., PCS + OG or 2, 3 -DHBA) than the Candida with all Cryptococcus strains tested being sensitive to this chemosensitization. Alternatively, only few of the Candida strains showed sensitivity. OG possessed higher chemosensitizing potency than 2, 3 -DHBA, where the concentration of OG required with the drug to achieve chemosensitizing synergism was much lower than that required of 2, 3 -DHBA. Bioassays with gene deletion mutants of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that OG or 2, 3 -DHBA affect different cellular targets. These assays revealed mitochondrial superoxide dismutase or glutathione homeostasis plays a relatively greater role in fungal tolerance to 2, 3 -DHBA or OG, respectively.

Cell wall mutants were highly susceptible to four cinnamic acids (4 -chloro-α-methyl-, 4 -methoxy-, 4 -methyl-, 3 -methylcinnamic acids), where 4 -chloro-α-methyl- and 4 -methylcinnamic acids possessed the highest activity. Structure-activity relationship revealed that 4 -methylcinnamic acid, the deoxygenated structure of 4 -methoxycinnamic acid, overcame tolerance of glr 1 Δ to 4 -methoxycinnamic acid, indicating the significance of para substitution of methyl moiety for effective fungal control. The potential of compounds as chemosensitizers (intervention catalysts) to cell wall disruptants (viz., 4 -chloro-α-methyl- or 4 -methylcinnamic acids + CAS or OG) was assessed according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute M 38 -A. Synergistic chemosensitization greatly lowers minimum inhibitory concentrations of the co-administered drug/agents. 4 -Chloro-α-methylcinnamic acid further overcame fludioxonil tolerance of Aspergillus fumigatus antioxidant MAPK mutants (sakAΔ, mpkCΔ). Collectively, 4 -chloro-α-methyl- and 4 -methylcinnamic acids possess chemosensitizing capability to augment antifungal efficacy of conventional drug/agents, thus could be developed as target-based (i. e., cell wall disruption) intervention catalysts...|$|E

The molecular ratio x between OG and pyridine groups in these two PI-b-P 2 VP(OG) (x) systems is 0. 50 and 0. 75, respectively. In both cases, a hexagonally ordered cylindrical self-assembly was revealed by small-angle X-ray scattering in a broad temperature range. The spacing of the hexagonal structure decreases significantly on heating and reversibly increases on cooling. In in-situ SAXS experiments, performed with the tooth rheometer, a gradual macroscopic alignment of the nanoscale structure is observed on heating for both supramolecular systems. The most striking feature is a shear-induced transition from one hexagonal structure to another, more aligned, hexagonal structure observed for PI-b-P 2 VP(OG) 0. 75 in the temperature range 120 - 140 degreesC. The transition is accompanied by an abrupt reduction of the domain spacing and additionally by a decrease of the phase angle measured by the rheometer. In the PI-b-P 2 V-P(OG) (0. 5) system a comparable reduction in the spacing is observed at 90 - 95 degreesC.

Synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) are thermally unstable and decompose at higher temperatures. However, widely used cooking methods such as baking, frying, boiling, and roasting use high thermal temperature that can chemically degrade herbs and spices and diminish their antioxidative capacity, {{but they have been}} little studied. In this context, this review deals with the need of natural antioxidants, spices and herbs as natural antioxidants, their origin, chemical composition, pharmacological, and antioxidant properties. Moreover, the impact of temperature on total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of various herbs and spices such as cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, mace, oregano, rosemary, sage, and turmeric is highlighted. Different antioxidant assays are also studied and this approach revealed that there is a clear correlation between total phenolic content (TPC) and TAC of herbs and spices and specific phenolic compounds are responsible for the antioxidative capacity of particular herb and spice. These findings identified the optimum cooking temperature-time combination which results in the highest retention of antioxidative capacity and assures higher quality of food for the maintenance of human health...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} fundamental self-organized aspects in π-conjugated polymers. Self-organization is {{the central}} issue in nanotechnology of soft condensed matter. The thesis focuses on the design and control of supramolecular hairy-rodlike molecules which are characterized by a thermotropic and preferentially aligned nanoscale structure. The major emphasis is on polypyridine, polyaniline, and polyfluorene. Because of their rodlike chain the formation of supramolecules is nontrivial. The understanding of the structure-property relations of this class of materials is vital {{in the development of}} organic high-performance opto-electronic devices. Throughout this work, synchrotron radiation and X-ray diffraction techniques have been extensively used and combined with the photophysical methods. In the first part, the ways to form hierarchic, highly ordered, and aligned lamellar smectic supramolecules of poly(2, 5 -pyridinediyl) complexed with dodecylbenzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or camphorsulfonic acid and pentyl- or hexylresorcinol, <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate,</b> or octyl phenol have been developed and perfected. They have been characterized in the solution, in bulk and – in particular – in aligned films. Several new phases have been discovered and detailed structural description is given. When side groups are introduced microphase separated phases reveal a regular axial repeat but have different degrees of lateral packing regularity between molecules, varying from crystalline to liquid. Depending on composition they exhibit an order-order and then an order-disorder transition to isotropic phase. Liquid crystallinity allows facile overall alignment and results in the opto-electronic anisotropy as revealed by dichroism and polarized photoluminescence. In particular, it is shown that the hierarchic supramolecular structure of poly(2, 5 -pyridinediyl), camphorsulfonic acid and octyl phenol comprises of a higher level head-to-head structure of polymer and lower lamellae, stacked, and monomer related structure levels in normal, equatorial, and meridional directions, respectively. By choosing the exact components and tuning the composition a coherence length as high as 800  Å along the smectic axis has been achieved. By contrast to covalent side chains, the supramolecular side chains can be cleaved from the aligned materials, which render aligned pristine polymer and high photoluminescence quantum yield of pure polymer. The structure and phase equilibria have been designed between theory and experiment. The compilation of the results has been presented as a phase diagram in the melt state in the high polymer fraction limit. The study shows that the recent theoretical model highlights the most important mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomena and gives trends in which direction the developed system has to be adjusted to achieve the desired effects. In the second part, the thickness dependent triaxial texturing in poly(9, 9 -bis(2 -ethylhexyl) -fluorene- 2, 7 -diyl) thin film on the rubbed polyimide has been identified, when thermotropic alignment has been applied. The polymer is 5 / 2 helix as proposed by Lieser and coworkers. It has three chain unit cell and the hexagonal-like cells of helical polymers are flattened {{in the direction of the}} surface normal and reveal two kinds of coexistent crystallites, a multiple orientation, where the greater proportion of the crystallites have a crystal axis a perpendicular to the substrate surface and where a smaller proportion is aligned with the crystal axis a parallel to the surface. This has been found to depend on the temperature and the film thickness. The overview shows a selection of unpublished results, reviews the trends in the supramolecular science discusses and reviews widely the characterization methods. In addition, a selection of further clarifications of the publications is reported. An unambigous experiment showing a hexagonal (cylindrical) supramolecular hairy-rodlike structure of polyaniline complexed with camphorsulfonic acid and hexylresorcinol is presented. A comb-shaped supramolecule of poly(4 -vinylpyridine) complexed with methanesulfonic acid and <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> is found to form a white lamellar self-organized structure. Characteristics in the fluid state are discussed. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Gallic {{acid esters}} (GAE) of varying alkyl chain length {{were used to}} {{determine}} how antioxidant physical location and partitioning influence hemoglobin-catalyzed lipid oxidation. Specific GAE used were propyl gallate (PG), <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> (OG), and lauryl gallate (LG). GAE partitioning experiments were performed with either isolated cod muscle membranes or washed cod muscle, which primarily contain polar membrane lipids and myofibrillar proteins. Canola oil was used in some experiments to determine how neutral lipids impact partitioning behavior. GAE distribution was determined spectrophotometrically in the recovered membranes, aqueous phase, and oil layer after employing differential centrifugation. Oxidation was monitored by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and lipid hydroperoxides development. ^ When GAE were added to the membrane suspensions, significant differences (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in GAE partitioning were observed in the aqueous phase and membrane sediment, where increases in GAE alkyl chain length corresponded with a decrease in aqueous phase concentrations and increases in the membranes. GAE partitioning in the oil fraction did not show significant differences. Also, increases in GAE alkyl chain correlated with increases in GAE membrane detection when GAE were added to the washed fish muscle (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). ^ Adding GAE to the washed cod muscle before the canola oil was the most effective sequence of addition for extending the storage time before lipid oxidation was detected. Among the three GAE tested, PG showed the greatest inhibition against lipid oxidation. The effectiveness of the GAE in the washed cod-canola oil system follows the order, PG 3 ̆e OG 3 ̆e LG, which corresponds with decreasing hydrophobicity. ^ The conclusions of this study are twofold. First, GAE partitioning into the muscle membranes was not the primary factor for delaying the onset of lipid oxidation. Rather, solubility in the aqueous phase showed the greatest impact on extending storage time. Secondly, the order in which GAE and canola oil were added to the washed cod (WC) muscle system influenced hemoglobin-catalyzed lipid oxidation behavior. Adding GAE before the neutral oil may have allowed the GAE to partition more easily into the polar regions of the washed muscle, which in turn provided the most effective protection against oxidation. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Chlamydia pneumoniae is {{a common}} human {{pathogen}} worldwide, which causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections. In addition, C. pneumoniae infections {{have been associated with}} atherosclerosis and other chronic diseases, and successful treatment and eradication of the organism from tissues would therefore be desirable. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effects of C. pneumoniae inoculations on the development of chronic infection and atherosclerotic changes in normocholesterolemic, wild-type mice. We also aimed to elucidate the effects of antibiotic and other treatments on the eradication of chlamydia and on the reduction of the pathologic sequelae induced by these infections. Female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed either normal chow when assessing the effects of acute infection, or a diet supplemented with 0. 2 % cholesterol when evaluating the atherosclerotic changes. Primary or repeated inoculations with C. pneumoniae isolate K 7 were given to the mice intranasally, and the effects of treatments with telithromycin, levofloxacin and erythromycin antimicrobial agents and with the phenolic compounds quercetin, luteolin and <b>octyl</b> <b>gallate</b> were evaluated. The following methods were used to measure infection and treatment effects and the presence of chlamydia in tissue: chlamydia culture, PCR and RT-PCR methods, histology of lung, heart and aortic tissue, serologic methods and measurements of aortic contractility responses. Repeated C. pneumoniae inoculations induced persistent chlamydial DNA and inflammation in lung tissue and development of mouse Hsp 60 autoantibodies. Infection was shown to influence aortic endothelial function, and repeated inoculations significantly increased subendothelial lipid accumulation in the aortic sinus area. A flavonoid, luteolin, was shown to effectively decrease the chlamydial load and inflammatory reactions in lung tissue. All antimicrobial agents eradicated the presence of viable chlamydia effectively; however, PCR positivity persisted in lung tissue despite the treatments. Only immediate treatment after each inoculation was able to decrease aortic sinus lipid accumulation. In conclusion, these data support the role of C. pneumoniae in promoting atherosclerotic development via autoimmune responses and also via direct effects on aortic tissue. Conventional antimicrobial treatments may not effectively eradicate persistent infection, and further studies are warranted to seek for alternative treatment options...|$|E
