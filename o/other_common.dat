5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} on dead leaves {{of a wide}} variety of angiosperms. It is frequently encountered on members of the heather (family Ericaceae), and the beech family (Fagaceae), such as oak (red, white, and live oak) and chestnut, and also on the exotic Castanea sativa from Chile. <b>Other</b> <b>common</b> substrates include leaves of trees in the genera Rhododendron, Lithocarpus, Berberis, Arbutus, Gaultheria, and Myrica.|$|E
5|$|Common {{praise for}} the game by critics is aimed at the new {{multiplayer}} and practice modes. Common critiques concern the song list, which includes more hard rock and metal than the previous game, deeming it less accessible to casual players. <b>Other</b> <b>common</b> critiques concern {{the quality of the}} covers.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated rats are physiologically {{and psychologically}} {{different}} from their wild relatives, and—when acquired from reputable breeders and shops—pose no more of a health risk than <b>other</b> <b>common</b> pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, while exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like Salmonella into the home. Fancy rats experience different health risks from their wild counterparts, and thus {{are less likely to}} succumb to many of the same illnesses as wild rats.|$|E

5|$|LARP {{events have}} {{a wide variety of}} styles that often overlap. Simple distinctions can be made {{regarding}} the genre used, the presence of simulated weapons or abstract rules, and whether players create their own characters or have them assigned by gamemasters. There is also a distinction between scenarios that are only run once and those that are designed to be repeatable. A number of <b>other</b> <b>common</b> classifications follow.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{has been}} used for bullets since their {{invention}} in the Middle Ages. It is inexpensive; its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment; and it is denser than <b>other</b> <b>common</b> metals, which allows for better retention of velocity. Concerns have been raised that lead bullets used for hunting can damage the environment.|$|E
5|$|Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} morphology, {{found that the}} pelagic {{stingray}} {{is one of the}} more basal members of its family, being the sister taxon to a clade that contains Pastinachus, Dasyatis, and Indo-Pacific Himantura species. <b>Other</b> <b>common</b> names for the pelagic stingray include the blue stingray and the violet stingray.|$|E

5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; <b>other</b> <b>common</b> surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the animals}} in the spruce-fir forest have ranges that extend into the balsam fir forest higher up.

Mammals include the red {{squirrel}} and the pine marten.|$|E

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>common</b> changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|E

Morphological {{examination}} {{has suggested that the}} bluespotted ribbontail ray is more closely related to the amphi-American Himantura (H. pacifica and H. schmardae) and the river stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) than to the congeneric blotched fantail ray (T. meyeni), which is closer to Dasyatis and Indo-Pacific Himantura.|$|E
