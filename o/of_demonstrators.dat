5|$|Belarusian {{authorities}} {{vowed to}} prevent any large-scale demonstrations following the election (such as those that marked the Orange Revolution in Ukraine). Despite their efforts, the opposition had the largest number <b>of</b> <b>demonstrators</b> in years, with nightly protests in Minsk continuing {{for a number of}} days after the election. The largest protest occurred on election night; reporters for the Associated Press estimated that approximately 10,000 people turned out. Election observers from the Russia-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) differed on the Belarusian election.|$|E
5|$|During such campaigns, {{he is said}} to have misled his voters {{into believing}} that he was a son of the deposed Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, and {{therefore}} a natural champion of land reform. His activity in Olt is credited with having sparked some violent incidents: in at least one account, he instigated the peasants of Slatina area to riot, and their revolt was only suppressed with use of force. Others however claim that the Romanian Land Forces randomly shot at, then charged upon, the peaceful mass <b>of</b> <b>demonstrators,</b> killing at least 35 of them.|$|E

5|$|Imprisonment is {{considered}} any restraint on {{the freedom of}} movement, for however short a time. In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, seven hours was considered a sufficient {{period of time to}} constitute false imprisonment (although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd <b>of</b> <b>demonstrators).</b> The requirement is complete restraint; in Bird v Jones, the defendant fenced off part of a footpath for use as a viewing point for a boat race. The claimant, accustomed to walking across it, climbed into the enclosure; the defendants refused to let him pass. They were found not liable for false imprisonment, as another way across existed. There is on the other hand no requirement that the claimant actually attempt to leave, as in Grainger v Hill, or even that he knows he is being prevented from leaving, as in Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{after the}} end of the war, Justice participated in the French naval {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea, and was based in Sevastopol. On 19 April, a mutiny gripped the French fleet, starting on the battleship France, the squadron flagship. At one point during the mutiny, the crew of Justice briefly flew the red flag, though they remained relatively calm. The situation worsened after a group of Greek soldiers fired into a crowd <b>of</b> <b>demonstrators</b> ashore; one French sailor was killed and another five were injured. Justices crew was enraged, and began discussing opening fire on the Greek battleship Kilkis, moored nearby. Justices captain ordered his ship's guns disabled by removing their breech blocks to prevent an attack. The situation was eventually defused by returning the French squadron back to France, one of the mutineers' primary demands. Ultimately, Justice was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February (referred to as Day of Rage by protest organisers), about 6,000 {{people took}} part in many protests around Bahrain {{demanding}} the release of previously detained protesters, socio-economic justice, political reform and a constitutional monarchy. Police then attacked the protesters throughout the day, using tear gas, rubber bullets and shotguns, inflicting many injuries and causing the hospitalisation of four demonstrators. In the evening, Ali Mushaima died from police shotgun wounds to his back at close range. The next day, thousands of mourners attended his funeral. During the ceremony police shot Fadhel Al-Matrook in the back at close range; he died from his wounds within an hour. People were then allowed to march to and occupy Pearl Roundabout, where they began to set up tents; the number <b>of</b> <b>demonstrators</b> had swelled to 10,000 people by nightfall. King Hamad offered his condolences for the two deaths and announced {{the establishment of a}} committee to investigate the events of the previous two days. In total, 25people were said to have been injured on 15February.|$|E

5|$|The School of International and Public Affairs extends {{invitations to}} {{heads of state}} and heads of {{government}} who come to New York City {{for the opening of}} the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum. The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds <b>of</b> <b>demonstrators</b> swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President Lee C. Bollinger tried to allay the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased {{with the fact that the}} Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus. Columbia students, though, turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the South Lawn. An estimated 2,500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion.|$|E
5|$|Former President Hastings Banda {{established}} a pro-Western {{foreign policy that}} continued into early 2011. It included good diplomatic relationships with many Western countries. The transition from a one-party state to a multi-party democracy strengthened Malawian ties with the United States. Significant numbers of students from Malawi travel to the US for schooling, and the US has active branches of the Peace Corps, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency for International Development in Malawi. Malawi maintained close relations with South Africa throughout the Apartheid era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes {{over the use of}} the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid. In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies. In 2011, relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika. Mutharika expelled the ambassador from Malawi, and in July 2011, the UK announced that it was suspending all budgetary aid because of Mutharika's lack of response to criticisms of his government and economic mismanagement. On 26 July 2011, the United States followed suit, freezing a US$350 million grant, citing concerns regarding the government's suppression and intimidation <b>of</b> <b>demonstrators</b> and civic groups, as well as restriction of the press and police violence.|$|E

40|$|Copyright MIT Press [Full text of {{this item}} is not {{available}} in the UHRA]The identification of any form of social learning, imitation, copying or mimicry presupposes a notion of correspondence between two autonomous agents. Judging whether a behaviour has been transmitted socially requires the observer to identify a mapping between the demonstrator and the imitator. If the demonstrator and imitator have similar bodies - for example, are animals of the same species, of similar age, and of the same gender - then to a human observer an obvious correspondence is to map the corresponding body parts: left arm <b>of</b> <b>demonstrator</b> maps to left arm of imitator, right eye <b>of</b> <b>demonstrator</b> maps to right eye of imitator, tail <b>of</b> <b>demonstrator</b> maps to tail of imitator. There is also an obvious correspondence of actions: raising the left arm by the model corresponds to raising the left arm by the imitator, production of vocal signals by the model corresponds {{to the production of}} acoustically similar ones by the imitator, picking up a fruit by the demonstrator corresponds to picking up a fruit of the same type by the imitator. Furthermore, there is a correspondence in sensory experience: audible sounds, a touch, visible objects and colours, and so on, evidently seem to be detected and experienced in similar ways.
