5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} grows anxious as the premiere of the PBS TV {{documentary}} The Office: An American Workplace draws near. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) combines an unflattering appraisal of himself from an early newspaper {{of the program and}} his blunt self-assessment that he is unlikely to remain employed at Dunder Mifflin for very long after it airs, and decides it is time to pursue his dreams of stardom. After many fruitless calls to dismissive talent agencies, he finds himself at the dual talent agency/real estate office run by Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr). Carla agrees to represent Andy, who is thrilled that he <b>only</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> pay $5,000 for the privilege.|$|E
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not <b>only</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the main}} {{reservoir}} pipe is kept constantly pressurized by the locomotive, the car reservoirs can be charged independently of the brake pipe, this being accomplished via a check valve to prevent backfeeding into the pipe. This arrangement helps to reduce the above described pressure loss problems, and also reduces the time required for the brakes to release, since the brake pipe <b>only</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> recharge itself.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the later}} G2 Contender, the {{original}} Contender may be safely dry-fired (provided the hammer is not drawn {{back from the}} second notch) to allow a shooter {{to become familiar with}} the trigger pull.

25|$|Perhaps {{the easiest}} face vise to install is the {{self-contained}} iron vise, {{sometimes called the}} 'quick-action' vise (except they are not all quick-action). This tool comes already assembled and <b>only</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be mounted to the bench. Usually, auxiliary wooden jaws are added. The quick-action feature makes setting it much quicker and is quickly taken for granted. Not only are these vises easy to install and use, they are also robust. Their main drawback is the relatively high cost.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} the vessel provide a {{haunting}} and fascinating dive for anybody who ventures onto the site, the large boilers and {{remains of the}} bow and stern also create a unique and interesting dive. The remains are such that one <b>only</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> have little knowledge of the vessel to understand what features are present. On top of this, the site is significant simply as a dive site, the abundance of marine life that are present and the features provide a wonderful and popular dive.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} frequency-selective channel conditions, for example fading caused by {{multipath}} propagation, {{can be considered}} as constant (flat) over an OFDM sub-channel if the sub-channel is sufficiently narrow-banded (i.e., if the number of sub-channels is sufficiently large). This makes frequency domain equalization possible at the receiver, which is far simpler than the time-domain equalization used in conventional single-carrier modulation. In OFDM, the equalizer <b>only</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> multiply each detected sub-carrier (each Fourier coefficient) in each OFDM symbol by a constant complex number, or a rarely changed value.|$|E
25|$|The {{other type}} of {{exchange}} {{is known as a}} bike-to-bike exchange. The only reason that a team would use this type of exchange is if the team members are not all approximately the same height. More often than not, it is because one member of the team is shorter than the rest because most cyclists in the race are fairly tall. This exchange is far simpler than the other. The first rider <b>only</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> come in and tap the next rider's shoulder or arm and then the other racer can begin. While this is much easier than the other exchange, it is significantly slower because the second racer is starting from a dead stop, while riders performing the man-to-man exchange have some forward momentum.|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of PTC thermistors being powered also is extremely useful. When first {{connected to a}} voltage source, a large current corresponding to the low, cold, resistance flows, but as the thermistor self-heats, the current is reduced until a limiting current (and corresponding peak device temperature) is reached. The current-limiting effect can replace fuses. They are also used in the degaussing circuits of many CRT monitors and televisions where the degaussing coil <b>only</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be connected in series with an appropriately chosen thermistor; a particular advantage is that the current decrease is smooth, producing optimum degausing effect. Improved degaussing circuits have auxiliary heating elements to heat the thermistor further (and reduce the final current) or timed relays to disconnect the degaussing circuit entirely after it has operated.|$|E
25|$|The ICD-11 and DSM-5 {{are being}} {{developed}} {{at the start of}} the 21st century. Any radical new developments in classification are said to be more likely to be introduced by the APA than by the WHO, mainly because the former <b>only</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> persuade its own board of trustees whereas the latter has to persuade the representatives of over 200 different countries at a formal revision conference. In addition, while the DSM is a bestselling publication that makes huge profits for APA, the WHO incurs major expense in determining international consensus for revisions to the ICD. Although there is an ongoing attempt to reduce trivial or accidental differences between the DSM and ICD, it is thought that the APA and the WHO are likely to continue to produce new versions of their manuals and, in some respects, to compete with one another.|$|E
25|$|SSB takes {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} entire original signal is encoded in either one of these sidebands. It is not necessary to broadcast the entire mixed signal, a suitable receiver can extract the entire signal from either the upper or lower sideband. This means that the amplifier can be used much more efficiently. A transmitter can choose to send only the upper or lower sideband, the portion of the signal above or below the carrier. By doing so, the amplifier <b>only</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> work effectively on one half the bandwidth, which is generally easier to arrange. More importantly, with the carrier suppressed before it reaches the amplifier, it can amplify the signal itself to higher energy, it is not wasting energy amplifying a signal, the carrier, that can (and will) be re-created by the receiver anyway.|$|E
