During these, in 1773, General John Burgoyne, one of Clive's most vocal enemies, pressed the case that some of Clive's gains were made {{at the expense of the}} Company and the government. Clive again made a spirited defence of his actions, and closed his testimony by stating [...] "Take my fortune, but save my honour." [...] The vote that followed completely exonerated Clive, who was commended for the [...] "great and meritorious service" [...] he rendered to the country. Immediately thereafter Parliament began debating the Regulating Act of 1773, which significantly reformed the East India Company's practices.|$|R

50|$|The {{formation}} talks {{already started}} to leave their mark on the <b>ongoing</b> <b>parliamentary</b> deliberations: On January 18 the CU voted down a motion seeking to the curb of advertisements for alcohol {{with the understanding that}} this issue was already part of the formation negotiations. In week 10 after the general elections, talks continued in The Hague again with little news to report. On January 24 a plan leaked {{to reduce the number of}} cabinet ministers. and a week later a plan for the reduction of the number of civil servants by 10,000. Even more leaks and speculations followed on January 29 when it was reported that a (record breaking) 40 page agreement was in the making to be presented on February 2. According to the accountants and statisticians at the Centraal Planbureau on January 31 new policies in this agreement would be paid for by anticipating higher economic growth than the officially projected one much to the dismay of the outgoing VVD finance minister Zalm. Also on January 31 the ministerial ambitions of Wouter Bos became an issue for the third time in the formation process and on this occasion his party and a parliamentary majority formally requested him to accept the vice-prime ministership. On the same day a PvdA minority group led by renegade Diederik Samson urged him to keep his election promise. In Samson's view only the other left-wing parties would benefit from a submissive PvdA fraction with Bos a member of the cabinet.|$|R

30|$|The reform had {{to stand}} up to the challenge, and thus not only to be very severe and {{immediately}} effective, but also to appear credible to financial markets. It had to cancel distortions still embedded in the system after twenty years of reasonable but exasperatingly slow piecemeal reforms 3 and provide for demographic transition while reducing the burden on the young and future generations. Due to the financial emergency, there was little time for social <b>dialogue,</b> <b>parliamentary</b> debate and the transition period that is customary in pension reforms. The reform was submitted to Parliament as a Government decree (and therefore approved with a vote of confidence) and was not preliminarily discussed with the social partners. This procedure, entirely due to the urgency imposed by the crisis, created a wound in the relationships with the trade unions for which the government paid a price in the subsequent labor market reform.|$|R
5000|$|The {{result of}} the {{election}} was 'no change', with the Conservatives retaining an overall majority by winning twenty-four of the forty seats available. Of the sixteen remaining seats, ten went to independents, five to the Liberal Democrats and just one to the Labour Party. Although the Conservatives managed to retain control, the Isle of Wight was still the only council in England in which they lost seats. Among the factors which could have led to this relatively poor performance are the recent education reforms on the Isle of Wight, which led to protests over the closure of island primary schools. The [...] "Standards not Tiers" [...] independent candidate Chris Welsford beat the sitting Conservative councillor Jonny Fitzgerald-Bond by 141 votes in the Ventnor East ward. In the Cowes West and Gurnard ward, which {{was at the heart}} of education reforms, sitting Tory councillor Alan Wells was beaten by independent candidate Paul Fuller. The large numbers of independent candidates standing at this election and the increased level of support for them could also be attributed to the <b>ongoing</b> United Kingdom <b>Parliamentary</b> expenses scandal, pushing voters away from the mainstream political parties represented in the House of Commons.|$|R
50|$|In October 1975 the Liberal-Country party {{coalition}} in the Senate voted to defer {{consideration of the}} supply bills until the Whitlam government agreed to 'submit itself to the Australian people', and a political stalemate resulted. With {{the full support of}} caucus Whitlam announced that if the Opposition continued to block Supply in the Senate, he would call an early half-Senate election in December. For the next 4 weeks Fraser refused to give in and allow the budget bills to pass. If this impasse had gone on indefinitely, the government would have run out of money and been unable to fund its <b>ongoing</b> commitments, public-service, <b>parliamentary</b> and judicial costs. It was estimated that it would be late-November before this occurred. Whitlam was confident {{that at least some of}} the Liberal senators would back down if he held out long enough. Undoubtedly, he also surmised that public opinion could swing back his way as a result of Fraser's tactics and that, at an opportune moment, he could call a half-Senate election (at which government would not be at stake) as a means of breaking the deadlock. On 6 November Whitlam informed Kerr that, if the Opposition continued to deny a vote on Supply in the Senate, he would call an early half-Senate election the following Tuesday - 11 November 1975. The necessary paperwork was then drawn up and drafts exchanged between the Prime Minister's office and Government House over the next 4 days. On the morning of 11 November Whitlam rang Kerr and confirmed the wording of the announcement he would make in the House of Representatives that afternoon, setting the half-Senate election in train.|$|R
