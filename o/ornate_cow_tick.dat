40|$|A {{method for}} the {{identification}} of three ixodid <b>tick</b> species; the <b>cow</b> <b>tick</b> (Boophilus annulatus), the camel tick (Hyalomma dromedarii) and the cattle tick (Hyalomma anatolicum excavatum) based on restriction enzyme analysis of the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS- 2) in the nuclear ribosomal DNA was adopted. PCR products with MW 1375 bp, 1650 bp and 1835 bp from B. annulatus, H. dromedarii and H. anatolicum excavatum, respectively were amplified. These products were digested by the restriction enzymes Bgl II, EcoR I, Cfo I and Xmn I and the PCR-RFLP patterns of the enzyme Cfo I showed differences among the three tick species. Species-specific restriction enzyme patterns were identified for B. annulatus (500 bp), H. dromedarii (750 bp) and H. anatolicum excavatum (940 bp). The PCR-RFLP patterns of the enzyme Xmn I showed species-specific restriction enzyme patterns for H. dromedarii species (1000 and 650 bp). Further studies on different ixodid and argasid tick species in Egypt are taken place...|$|R
30|$|The {{communal}} farmers {{preferred the}} aggression and mating behaviour, tick and disease resistance and {{body condition score}} {{as the most important}} traits in the breeding Nguni bulls. Age of farmer and enterprise ownership influenced the preferential ranking of bull coat colour, scrotal circumference, and body size and conformation. The most preferred traits in a breeding <b>cow</b> were <b>tick</b> and disease resistance, reproductive efficiency and body condition score. Enterprise ownership pattern influenced the preference of animal coat colour,and body size and conformation traits in breeding Nguni cows. It is recommended to consider preferential traits of farmers for the improvement and sustainability of the enterprises.|$|R
40|$|Despite cattle herds can harbor Coxiella burnetii, {{risk factors}} for C. burnetii {{presence}} in dairy cattle herds are largely unknown. Therefore, C. burnetii herd prevalence and {{risk factors for}} bulk tank milk (BTM) positivity were investigated. In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was filled out by the farmer and BTM from 301 farms was tested by ELISA for presence of C. burnetii antibodies and PCR for presence of C. burnetii DNA. Risk factors were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Antibodies to C. burnetii were detected in 81. 6 % (CI: 77. 2 - 85. 9) and C. burnetii DNA in 18. 8 % (CI: 14. 4 - 23. 1) of the BTM samples. Herd size (OR= 1. 1 per 10 cows), cleaning the bedding of the cubicles at most every other day (OR= 2. 8) and purchase of cattle from at least two addresses (OR= 3. 1) showed a significant and positive association with ELISA positivity and use of an automatic milking system a negative association (OR= 0. 3). Risk factors for PCR positivity were purchase of cattle from at least two delivery addresses (OR= 3. 2), presence of <b>cows</b> with <b>ticks</b> (OR= 2. 0), use of an automatic milking system (OR= 0. 2) and presence of goats or sheep on the farm (OR= 0. 4). Biosecurity and general hygiene seem associated with introduction and spread of C. burnetii in dairy herds...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} DNA {{levels of}} different development stages of Theileria annulata and T. parva in the <b>cow</b> and the <b>tick</b> were {{measured by the}} cytophotometric DNA technique using the fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 as a staining dye. The results revealed that sporozoites, merozoites, gamonts, and gametes were haploid, where-as multinucleated intralymphocytic schizonts were polyploid. No difference was observed between T. parva and T. annulata in these stages. For both Theileria species, the DNA measurements revealed that fusion of gametes occurred in the gut of the final host, thus providing evidence of sexual reproduction. However, differences were observed between the two parasites in the tick. Whereas T. parva zygotes underwent a two-step meiotic division, a comparable reduction division could not be unequivocally detected in T. annulata. Differences could also be detected in the further development of kinetes, indicating that Theileria species are not characterized by only one life cycle, which is specific for this genus...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Cattle-landscape interactions were evaluated by monitoring movement of cattle on a rangeland landscape using a differential global positioning system (DGPS). Cattle were inspected for ticks before and after each 48 hour DGPS monitoring session in each of two 80 ha study pastures. All ticks were removed during each inspection and host <b>cow,</b> pasture, <b>tick</b> life-stage, gender, and species were recorded. Cattle monitoring sessions took place during May and July, 1996. The resident population of ticks in each of three habitat-types (upland coalesced, upland mature, and drainage) was estimated by C 02 trapping and was conducted on both pastures, after the monitoring sessions. The number of nymphal ticks collected was higher for both cattle and the C 02 traps in May, whereas numbers of adults and larvae were more numerous in July. The study was conducted during a period of severe drought. Only 4. 82 mm of rain was received from January-July 1996, while the average from 1990 - 1995 for this period was 44. 78 mm. Despite the severe weather conditions, ticks were still able to reproduce successfully in the brush habitats. This was evident by the large numbers of larvae estimated in July from C 02 trap data. The proportion of dietary browse for the study cattle was, 18. 38 - 21. 95 % in May and 23. 30 - 27. 1 1 % in July, which was more than 3 to 4 times the normal proportion under normal range conditions. This suggests that the cattle were spending greater amounts of time foraging in the brush, thus increasing the potential for tick-host encounters in vegetation habitat-types supportive of tick populations...|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of subclinical infection by agents of tick fever in dairy cattle on milk parameters, such as production, composition, and quality. Materials and methods. The study was conducted in a private farm with 75 free-stall-housed dairy cows, from which 37 were evaluated. Monthly, individual milk samples were collected for compositional (fat, lactose, protein, and total solids) and quality (somatic cell counts (SCC)) analyses. In addition, blood samples were collected in order to identify <b>cows</b> that were <b>tick</b> fever-negative and positive by PCR for one or more of the following etiological agents: Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina and Anaplasma marginale. Results. The results showed increased SCC in positive animals for at least one of the agents when compared to non-infected cows (p< 0. 05). Milk production was significantly lower in A. marginale positive animals (p< 0. 05). An increase of about 40 % in milk solids content was found in B. bovis positive cows. Also, an increment of approximately 23 % in lactose was found on cows positives for B. bigemina. Conclusions. We may conclude that the presence of at least one of these parasites in dairy cattle affects composition or quality of their milk...|$|R
40|$|This {{survey was}} {{conducted}} from June 2004 to May 2005 to study ticks and tick-borne diseases (TBDs) of cattle namely ehrlichiosis and theileriosis in South Darfur State. Ticks collection was carried out at intervals of two months for one year from sedentary and semi sedentary cattle of three age groups 2 and > 4 years old in five localities, Nyala, Edd-alferrsan, Tulus, Reheid-alberid and Umdafug where tick control measures were not adopted. Four genera and 15 species of ticks were identified. These include Amblyomma lepidum, A. variegatum, Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum, H. dromedarii, H. impeltatum, H. marginatum rufipes, H. impressum, H. truncatum, Boophilus annulatus, B. decoloratus, Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, R. guilhoni, R. muhsamae, R. praetextatusand R. sanguineus sanguineus. H. a. anatolicumwas found only in Nyala. The highest tick load prevalence of ticks was observed {{during the rainy season}}. The effect of animals’ sex showed that <b>cows</b> carriedmore <b>ticks</b> than oxen, but with no significant difference. Younger animals carried low numbers of ticks, cattle with white coatcolour were infested by the higher numbers of ticks compared to animals with brown or black coat colour. A total of 900 blood smears and 408 serum samples were collected from sedentary cattle from the five localities mentioned above plus some samples from Alradom municipality. Blood smears examination revealed that 13 (1. 4 %) of cattle had Theileria spp. piroplasms, while sero-surveillance using ELISA performed with recommbinat antigens (Tasp) revealed that 24 (19. 8 %) out of 121 samples were positive for Theileria annulata antibodies. The highest prevalence of piroplasms (5. 3 %) was observed in Nyala and the lowest prevalence (1. 3 %) was in Reheid-alberdi, no piroplasms were detected in Tulus, Umdafug and Alradom. The highest prevalence of Theileria xii annulataantibodies was in Edd-alferrsan (47. 6 %) while the lowest prevalence (5 %) was in Alradom [...] Out of 408 cattle sera tested using indirect ELISA MAP- 1 B, 169 (41. 4 %) had antibodies against Ehrlichia ruminantium. The prevalence rate ranged between (51. 1 %) in Umdafug and (27. 7 %) in Reheid-alberdi. Cows had higher antibodies against T. annulataand E. ruminantiumthan oxen. Theileriosis and ehrlichiosis antibodiesshowed higher prevalence during the rainy season and winter. Itis concluded that there are geographical changes in distribution of ticks and some TBDs particularly T. annulata. Therefore, it is recommended to carry out further investigations and intensive research on ticks and TBDs on domestic and wild animals, and tostudy economic impact of ticks and TBDs for the purpose of drawing strategic plans for control of ticks and TBD...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of veterinary drug residues in food, especially of pesticides used for cattle disease control, can affect {{public health and}} international trading of food products if maximum residue levels are above those stipulated by FAO and WHO. Milk {{is one of the}} most complete food for humans, because it contains nutrients required for growth and development of newborns. However, milk quality can be endangered due to the {{presence of}} contaminants, especially of cypermethrin pesticide, which is widely used in Brazil to treat lactating dairy <b>cows,</b> mainly against <b>ticks,</b> flies, lice and dermatobia. Methods for monitoring veterinary drugs, for example pesticide residues, should be rapid, have small number of analytical steps, use few reagents in small amounts, be specific, and be sensitive enough to enable detection at very low levels. Anastassiades et al. [1] developed an approach which they dubbed quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS). The method involves extraction of the analyte with MeCN partitioned from an aqueous matrix using anhydrous MgSO 4 and NaCl, followed by a dispersive-SPE cleanup with MgSO 4 and primary secondary amine (PSA). The aim of this study was to evaluate QuEChERS method in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the determination of cypermethrin residue in bovine milk. The following steps were undertaken: (1) weigh a 10 g milk sample into a centrifuge tube; (2) add cypermethrin; (3) add 10 mL of MeCN, 4 g of MgSO 4 and 1 g of NaCl in each tube, and centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 1 min; (4) transfer 1 mL of MeCN extract to a 1. 5 mL minicentrifuge tube for dispersive SPE using 50 mg of PSA + 50 mg of C 18 + 150 mg of MgSO 4; (5) mix the extract, and centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 1 min; (6) transfer 0. 5 mL of the supernatant to an autosampler vial for analysis by GC?MS. The volume analyzed was 1 ?L and the oven temperature program was set at 150 °C - 15 °C min- 1 - 270 °C (7 min). The mass spectrometry was operated in the SIM mode. The method resulted in extracts that contained the target analyte, with recovery values within the ANVISA [2] requeriments, from 70 % to 120 %, with relative standard deviations below 20 %. Detection and quantification limits were 0. 025 and 0. 075 mg kg- 1, respectively. It is possible to analyze cypermethrin in milk below the maximum residue limit of 0. 10 mg kg- 1. The proposed method is rapid and inexpensive, and reduces consumption of organic solvents, which are toxic to health and to the environment. The method may be used as a screening procedure for analysis of cypermethrin residue in milk. 200...|$|R
