Methods : Children 2 ̆ 7 s measured and parents 2 ̆ 7 self-reported heights and weights were used to calculate body mass index (BMI). Locations of major fast food outlets were geocoded. Bivariate linear regression analyses examined associations between the presence of any fast food outlet within a 2 km buffer around participants 2 ̆ 7 homes, fast food outlet density within the 2 km buffer, and distance to the nearest outlet and BMI. Each independent variable was also entered into separate bivariate logistic regression analyses to predict the odds of being overweight or obese. Results : Among older children, those with at least one outlet within 2 km had lower BMI z-scores. The further that fathers lived from an outlet, the higher their BMI. Among 13 - 15 -year-old girls and their fathers, the likelihood of overweight/obesity was reduced by 80...|$|R
40|$|Frequent {{fast-food}} {{consumption is}} associated with weight gain therefore it is hypothesized that relative availability of fast-food is {{a risk factor for}} obesity. This thesis examined the association between the neighbourhood-level density of fast-food <b>outlets</b> and adult <b>body</b> mass index (BMI) in Canada. Population-based data on BMI and socio-economic variables from the 2008 Canadian Community Health Survey [CCHS] and selected neighbourhood-level socio-economic data from 2006 Canadian Census were merged with a commercial database containing geographic locations of all restaurants in Canada. The association between BMI and fast-food density (per 10, 000 people in CCHS respondent’s FSA) was analyzed using ordinary least squares regression. Spatial clustering of BMI was also investigated and spatial-regression analysis was conducted. FSA-level fast-food density is significantly associated with BMI in Canadian adults, predominantly in females and non-rural area. This population-based analysis established that availability of fast-food restaurants is an important risk factor for obesity in Canada...|$|R
40|$|Incised coastal {{channels}} are a specific form of incised channel {{that are found}} in locations where stream channels flowing to cliffed coasts have the excess energy required to cut down through the cliff to reach the <b>outlet</b> water <b>body.</b> The southern coast of the Isle of Wight, southern England, comprises soft cliffs that vary in height between 15 and 100 m and which are retreating at rates ? 1. 5 m a? 1, due {{to a combination of}} wave erosion and landslides. In several locations, river channels have cut through the cliffs to create deeply (? 45 m) incised gullies, known locally as ‘Chines’. The Chines are unusual in that their formation is associated with dynamic shoreline encroachment during a period of rising sea-level, whereas existing models of incised channel evolution emphasise the significance of base level lowering. This paper develops a conceptual model of Chine evolution by applying space for time substitution methods using empirical data gathered from Chine channel surveys and remotely sensed data. The model identifies a sequence of evolutionary stages, which are classified based on a suite of morphometric indices and associated processes. The extent to which individual Chines {{are in a state of}} growth or decay is estimated by determining the relative rates of shoreline retreat and knickpoint recession, the former via analysis of historical aerial images and the latter through the use of a stream power erosion model. <br/...|$|R

Our empirical model combined georeferenced micro data on access to fast food restaurants and grocery stores with data about salient personal characteristics, individual behaviors, and neighborhood characteristics.

Local food landscapes are potentially endogenous due to spatial sorting of the population and food <b>outlets,</b> and the <b>body</b> mass index (BMI) values for individuals living close to each other are likely to be spatially correlated because of observed and unobserved individual and neighborhood effects. The potential biases associated with endogeneity and spatial correlation were handled using spatial econometric estimation techniques. Our policy simulations for Indianapolis, Indiana, focused on the importance of reducing the density of fast food restaurants or increasing access to grocery stores. We accounted for spatial heterogeneity in both the policy instruments and individual neighborhoods, and consistently found small but statistically significant effects for the hypothesized relationships between individual BMI value...|$|R

However, less is known about the influence of built food environment on health outcomes in this population. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the associations of accessibility and availability of supermarkets and fast food <b>outlets</b> with <b>Body</b> Mass Index (BMI) z-score and waist circumference among youth {{with diabetes}}. Methods Information on residential location and adiposity measures (BMI z-score and waist circumference) for 845 youths with diabetes residing in South Carolina was obtained from the South Carolina site of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study. Food outlets data obtained from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and InfoUSA were merged based on names and addresses of the outlets. The comprehensive data on franchised supermarket and fast food outlets was then used to construct three accessibility and availability measures around each youth’s residence. Results Increased number and density of chain supermarkets around residence location were associated with lower BMI z-score and waist circumference among youth with diabetes. For instance, for a female child of 10 [*]years of age with height of 54. 2 inches and weight of 70. 4 pounds, lower supermarket density around residence location was associated with about 2. 8 – 3. 2 pounds higher weight, when compared to female child of same age, height and weight with highest supermarket density around residence location. Similarly, lower supermarket density around residence location was associated with a 3. 5 – 3. 7 centimeter higher waist circumference, when compared to residence location with the highest supermarket density. The associations of number and density of chain fast food outlets with adiposity measures, however, were not significant. No significant associations were observed between distance to the nearest supermarket and adiposity measures. However, contrary to our expectation, increased distance to the nearest fast food outlet was associated with higher BMI z-score, but not with waist circumference. Conclusions Food environments conducive to healthy eating may significantly influence health behaviors and outcomes. Efforts to increase the availability of supermarkets providing options/selections for health-promoting foods may significantly improve the dietary intake and reduce adiposity among youth with diabetes. </p...|$|R

Across it rises a similar unnamed peak with several summits, the highest of which reaches 1620 ft.It is located in the southern portion of the town of Chesterfield, near its tripoint with the towns of Lewis and Willsboro. The nearest settlements are the central hamlet of Willsboro to the east-southeast and the village of Keeseville to the north-northeast. Both are approximately 6 mi from the mountain.A ridge connects the mountain to Carl Mountain a mile to the west. On the mountain's east and south, the slopes rise steeply from the pass to the granite cliffs, their main scarp face 600 ft high and a mile wide, that bracket the summit and the northeast ridge. The north side has a gentler, but deeper, drop into the valley of McGuire Brook, which drains into Butternut Pond to the north and then, via that <b>body's</b> <b>outlet</b> into Augur Lake, to the AuSable River. On the south, a steeper drainage goes to Cold Brook, which flows into the North Branch of the Boquet River.

During the ongoing discussions Bazalgette refined and modified his plans, in line with Hall's demands. In December 1856 Hall submitted the plans to a group of three consultant engineers, Captain Douglas Strutt Galton of the Royal Engineers, James Simpson, an engineer with two water companies, and Thomas Blackwood, the chief engineer on the Kennet and Avon Canal.

40|$|Diatom is a {{unicellular}} micro algae {{that had}} {{an important role in}} the food web and major contributor of oxygen in the water. The short life cycle, rapid reproduction, cosmopolite, wide spread distribution, variation in population, most are sensitive to the environmental changes, easily handle samples and identification, low cost of sampling and data analysis may promote diatoms as a powerful bioindicator of water quality. The unique siliceous frustules make diatoms able to preserve in the sediment. Rawa Pening is a semi natural lake that administratively surrounded by four districts that consist of 27 villages. The main problem of this lake is erosion in the upstream and sedimentation in the downstream area as well as uncontrolled of aquatic plant growth, particularly water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) that induce lake shallowness. For people who live around Rawa Pening, this lake had been used for agricultural irrigation, fisheries, electricity power and tourism. To conserve the lake, as 3 rd World Water Forum in Tokyo, March 2003 and 2006 – 2009 National Research Agenda there is a need of limnological research on the environmental changes. This research was conducted in order to study the potential used of epipelic diatom as bioindicator of lenthic ecosystem, particularly Rawa Pening Lake. Water and sediment samples were taken from 27 sites from inlet, <b>outlet</b> and water <b>body</b> of Rawa Pining Lake. There were 254 diatom species that consist of 8 Centrophycidae species and 246 Pennatophycidae species. The population varied between 6, 989 and 3, 781, 000 individual/gram. Based on diversity indices of diatom, some part of Rawapening Lake was unstable, whereas the others were stable based on the diversity indices. Based on epipelic diatom, Rawa Pening Lake and its catchments area might be divided into 3 groups: agricultural lotic ecosystem, settlement lotic ecosystem and lenthic ecosystem. The high population of Synedra ulna, Nitzschia palea and Aulacoseira indicated that the lake is eutrophic that tent to be hypereutrophic. It was supported by high concentration of total nitrogen and phosphorous. The concentration of heavy metals Cadmium, Chromium, Copper and Lead were very high in sediment. However, the government of Indonesia has not yet set up sediment quality criteria. The following research would be proposed on this matter...|$|R
