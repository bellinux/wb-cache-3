5|$|The first {{published}} account appeared in 1888, written by Gustav Bruhl. The German ethnologist and naturalist Karl Sapper described Stela1 in 1894 after {{he saw it}} beside the road he was travelling.

5|$|Walter married Emma or Emmelina {{and they}} had three sons– Roger, Hugh and Walter. Roger was the heir to Weobley and Walter became Abbot of Gloucester Abbey. Occasionally the elder Walter is claimed to have married twice– once to Emma and once to an Ermeline, but this is {{probably}} a confusion of the variations of Emma's name. Walter and Emma also had a daughter who became a nun at St Mary's Abbey, Winchester. A niece was married to Ansfrid de Cormeilles. Considerable confusion exists about Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn. C. P. Lewis names her as the daughter <b>of</b> <b>Walter,</b> but W. E. Wightman calls her the daughter of Hugh, Walter's son. Yet another pedigree has her {{as the daughter of}} Agnes, the daughter <b>of</b> <b>Walter.</b> In this rendition, favoured by Bruce Coplestone-Crow, Agnes was married to Geoffrey Talbot.|$|E
