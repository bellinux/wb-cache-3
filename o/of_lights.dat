5|$|The Dove Street Festival <b>of</b> <b>Lights</b> – Begun 1990, the Dove Street Festival <b>of</b> <b>Lights</b> {{takes place}} each December. It began when a local {{family on the}} street adopted their {{daughter}} and wanted to dedicate an event to her. Local families on Dove street decorated the entire street with holiday lights, connecting the homes {{together to create a}} light tunnel effect. Previously, the Glee Club of the Miami University of Ohio serenaded residents with holiday songs. Town volunteers collect donations of money, food and toys at the festival that are given to The Deep Well Project, a local charity. In recent years the festival has moved from the original Dove Street to Shelter Cove Lane where the town can assist in the electrical costs.|$|E

5|$|A folk {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's death. Ramprasad was very fond of taking part in Kali puja {{on the night of}} Diwali, the festival <b>of</b> <b>lights.</b> On one Kali puja night, he {{performed}} the puja and sang throughout the night. In the morning, Ramprasad carried the jar of Divine Mother's sanctified water on his head to the Ganges. He was followed by the devotees, who carried the clay image of Kali to be immersed in the Ganges after the night of worship. Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's image was immersed, Ramprasad died— this was believed to be around 1775.|$|E

5|$|Bertie the Brain was {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.|$|E

40|$|This study {{discusses}} the variations of photoelectric current with intensity <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> The photoelectric effect {{is dependent upon}} various factors including frequency <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> nature <b>of</b> material, energy <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and potential difference. However, even if the photoelectric effect is caused, the photoelectric current which is produced {{as a result of}} it may vary if intensity <b>of</b> <b>light</b> is changed, provided that frequency of illumination is greater than threshold frequency. To determine the impact <b>of</b> changing <b>light</b> intensity on photoelectric effect while keeping the other factors constant, an experiment was performed. The impact was seen by changing the distance <b>of</b> <b>light</b> source from photocell and the recording the readings on Microammeter. The correlation and graphical analysis was done to draw the results. The correlation analysis showed a significant positive relationship between photoelectric current and intensity <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> The graphical analysis also highlighted a positive linear relationship. Therefore, it was concluded that intensity <b>of</b> <b>light</b> directly affects the variations in photoelectric current...|$|R

5|$|After 1943, {{more of the}} team's {{players were}} drafted into military, and the Yankees ended 1944 in third place, one {{position}} higher than they finished the following season. A group consisting of Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping, and Del Webb bought the Yankees, their stadium, and the franchise's minor league teams for $2,800,000 in 1945.

McCarthy resigned as manager early in the season. The Yankees used two other managers during the year (Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun), and ended 1946 in third place. Catcher Yogi Berra made his Yankees debut that year; in his 18-season career, Berra won the AL MVP Award three times. Bucky Harris was brought in to be the manager, and his 1947 team won the AL pennant and defeated the Dodgers in a seven-game World Series.

The player's starting location in each stage appears to be near the ending location of the previous one, and {{through the course of}} the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs of electricity, and washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E
