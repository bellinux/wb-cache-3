The door is used {{to control}} the physical atmosphere within a space by enclosing the air drafts, so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled.

The warps {{on either side of the}} rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.|$|E
25|$|A funnel {{water slide}} {{requires}} riders {{to sit in}} a 2 or 4 seater round tube. Riders drop from inside a tunnel out into the ride's main element shaped like a funnel on its side. Riders oscillate from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other until they exit through the back of the funnel and into a splash pool. The most common type of funnel is the ProSlide Tornado which is installed at almost 60 locations around the world dating back to 2003. In 2010, WhiteWater West began developing a competing product known as the Abyss, utilizing a raft that holds up to six riders.|$|E

25|$|Another notable {{feature in}} some stories {{is that the}} arms {{are said to be}} {{connected}} to each other through the torso and can slide from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other. While they are primarily water creatures, they do on occasion venture onto land. When they do, the plate can be covered with a metal cap for protection.

Although they are reported to live throughout Japan, they are often said to be particular to Saga Prefecture.|$|E
25|$|Sweep rowers (one oar per person) and scullers (two oars, {{one in each}} hand) {{have similar}} stroke styles, with some {{differences}} to accommodate the number of oars held by the rower. The most notable {{difference is that the}} oar handles overlap in sculling at the midpoint of the drive, and again during the recovery. This requires the sculler to cross one hand over (left over right) and/or {{in front of the other}} hand to avoid the oar handles colliding. While sculling is a fully symmetrical movement (with exception of the handle overlap), sweep oar rowing is slightly asymmetrical and many rowers strongly prefer <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E

On it, he describes a conflict with Umma over a tract of agricultural land located between the two city-states. The conflict ends in a battle in which Eannatum, described as the beloved of the god Ningirsu, triumphs over Umma. After the battle, the leader of Umma swears that he will not transgress into the territory of Lagash again upon penalty of divine punishment.|$|E

25|$|At {{the death}} of his father in 1909, he became the head of the Mikhailovichi branch of the Romanov family and {{inherited}} great wealth. He received all of the lands and houses of his father: Borjomi, his large rural estate in Georgia where he enjoyed living and preferred to work; Mikhailovskoe outside St Petersburg; an enormous palace on the Neva in St Petersburg, and the great estate Grushovka in southern Ukraine. His primary residence was the palace on the Neva, which was so large that his brother Grand Duke Sergei, who lived with him, used a bicycle to go from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other.

25|$|In 2008, East Midlands Trains {{revealed}} {{its intention}} to restrict access to parts of the station by installing ticket barriers {{to try to prevent}} passengers from travelling without a ticket. This proposal met with widespread opposition from residents and Council members because the footbridge would be closed off to non-ticket holders, severing a popular thoroughfare from the Norfolk Park residential area and the Supertram stop on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station travel centre, the bus station interchange, the city centre and the city centre campus of Sheffield Hallam University on the other. On 6 May 2009, East Midlands Trains implemented its proposal, using temporary barriers and ticket inspectors to bar access to the footbridge to non-ticket holders, and local residents and Supertram passengers were forced to use longer routes around the station.|$|E
25|$|In {{the earlier}} stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs {{consisted}} of independent or separate voussoirs {{down to the}} springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) {{the lower part of}} the transverse diagonal and wall ribs were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the tas-de-charge or solid springer. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions. As soon as the ribs were completed, the web or stone shell of the vault was laid on them. In some English work each course of stone was of uniform height from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other; but, as the diagonal rib was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the apex of the vault were cut to fit one another. In the early English Gothic period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was thought better to simplify the construction of the web by introducing intermediate ribs between the wall rib and the diagonal rib and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these intermediate ribs a ridge rib was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the ridge rib. In France, on the other hand, the web courses were always laid horizontally, and they are therefore of unequal height, increasing towards the diagonal rib. Each course also was given a slight rise in the centre, so as to increase its strength; this enabled the French masons to dispense with the intermediate rib, which was not introduced by them till the 15th century, and then more as a decorative than a constructive feature, as the domical form given to the French web rendered unnecessary the ridge rib, which, with some few exceptions, exists only in England. In both English and French vaulting centering was rarely required for the building of the web, a template (Fr. cerce) being employed to support the stones of each ring until it was complete. In Italy, Germany and Spain the French method of building the web was adopted, with horizontal courses and a domical form. Sometimes, in the case of comparatively narrow compartments, and more especially in clerestories, the wall rib was stilted, and this caused a peculiar twisting of the web, where the springing of the wall rib is at K: to these twisted surfaces the term ploughshare vaulting is given.|$|E
