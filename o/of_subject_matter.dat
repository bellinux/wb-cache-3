5|$|Limited {{access to}} life outside the clinic {{resulted}} in a shortage <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> Van Gogh instead worked on interpretations of other artist's paintings, such as Millet's The Sower and Noonday Rest, and variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the Realism of Jules Breton, Gustave Courbet and Millet, and he compared his copies to a musician's interpreting Beethoven.|$|E
5|$|Although The Raft of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and its dramatic presentation, it represents {{a break from the}} calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence {{can be seen in the}} works of Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's Natural History {{became a}} model for later encyclopedias and {{scholarly}} works {{as a result of}} its breadth <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> its referencing of original authors, and its index. The work is dedicated to the emperor Titus, a son of Pliny's close friend, the emperor Vespasian, in the first year of Titus's reign. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published. He began it in 77, and had not made a final revision at the time of his death during the AD79 eruption of Vesuvius.|$|E
50|$|Sadananda {{explains}} that hearing is determination that the Vedanta teaches non-duality of Brahman {{on the basis}} of six characteristic signs - a) presentation <b>of</b> the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> at the beginning and the conclusion, b) repetition or repeated presentation <b>of</b> the <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> c) originality i.e. the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> is not known through any other source, d) result or utility <b>of</b> the <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> e) eulogy or praise <b>of</b> the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and f) demonstration or reasoning in support <b>of</b> the <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> Shravana results in the genuine ascertaining of the true import of the Vedic texts and statements.|$|R

5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
5|$|For the {{follow-up}} to their 1998 album Aquemini, the duo worked {{to create an}} expansive and experimental musical aesthetic, incorporating a diverse array of styles including funk, rave music, psychedelia, gospel, and rock within a Dirty South-oriented hip hop context. During the recording sessions, André 3000 began moving beyond traditional rapping {{in favor of a}} more melodic vocal style, an approach to which Big Boi and several other producers were initially unaccustomed. Lyrically, the duo touched upon a wide range <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> including sexuality, politics, misogyny, African-American culture, parenthood, and introspection. Stankonia featured appearances from a variety of local musicians discovered by the group while they were visiting clubs in the city of Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|His {{most popular}} work {{was that of}} Tableau de l'état {{physique}} et moral des ouvriers employés dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie (Study of the Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk workers), the final product of extended research and observation, published in the year 1840. The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. He brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults {{as well as the}} danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as it relates to dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé covered a wide array <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the tribe}} {{filed suit in}} the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking $14,000,000 in damages for breach of trust by DOI. The tribe argued that the United States had {{exclusive}} control over the buildings and allowed them to fall into disrepair, {{a violation of the}} trust relationship established by the 1960 statute. Additionally, the tribe claimed that the Snyder Act and the National Historic Preservation Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National Historic Preservation Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs. The United States moved for dismissal on the basis of lack <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. In addition, the United States claimed that the statute of limitations had run under both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act, the acts governing claims in the Federal Court of Claims. The trial court dismissed the suit on the failure to state a claim.|$|E
5|$|In terms <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> {{the story}} of Joan of Arc was not well known outside of a legend. A history dealing with Joan written by Clement L'Averdy was written in 1790 but it was {{probably}} unknown to Southey. This would serve as the major historical source of information on her until Jules Quicherat's history published during the mid-19th century. Of non-historical works, Voltaire's La Pucelle was well known but the work attacks Joan. Joan's reputation was polemical, and Joan would later {{be turned into a}} French hero with Napoleon's encouragement. Friedrich Schiller would also deal with the legend the same way in Die Jungfrau von Orleans. In terms of works relying on the general idea of a warrior woman, many such figures exited in epics: Virgil and Camilla, Tasso has Clorinda, and Spenser had Britomart. However, such females were not the central figure as a woman was unique to Southey at the time.|$|E

40|$|Patentable <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> {{has become}} one of the most {{controversial}} areas of patent law. Efforts to articulate a lucid and productive theory <b>of</b> patentable <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> must acknowledge that there are two competing models <b>of</b> unpatentable <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> One posits that natural laws, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are themselves ineligible for patenting, and that each example of a natural law, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea further defines a class of inventions that cannot be patented because they lack an additional element of ingenuity—or “inventive concept”—that sufficiently distinguishes those inventions from their natural counterparts. This “penumbral ” model <b>of</b> unpatentable <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> mirrors the statutory structure of anticipation and obviousness. The competing “binary ” model <b>of</b> unpatentable <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> posits that one must only apply a natural law, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea in a useful manner in order to have a patent-eligible invention.
