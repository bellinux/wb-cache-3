5|$|There is some {{evidence}} from the Classic period that women provided supporting roles in war, {{but they did not}} act as military <b>officers</b> <b>with</b> the exception of those rare ruling queens.

5|$|After {{nearly twenty}} years as a major, Berryman was {{promoted}} to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1935. Promotion to substantive rank, which carried the rank's pay as well as status, occurred on 1 July 1938, when he became Assistant Director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters. From December 1938 to April 1940 he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of the 3rd Division. The slow rate of promotion of regular officers in the inter-war years fostered a sense of injustice and frustration among <b>officers</b> <b>with</b> good war records who found themselves outranked by Militia officers who had enjoyed faster promotion.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the revolt}} was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of {{disaster}} prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought {{the opportunity to}} attain military glory and joined the other <b>officers</b> <b>with</b> the intention of commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} advanced education and the retention and promotion of Army officers. It uses data from the Active Duty Military Master File for Army officers who were commissioned between 1981 and 2001 and tracked until 2004, or until they separated from active duty. Results of survival analysis indicate that survival functions differ significantly with level of education, and that advanced education has {{a positive effect on}} both the retention and promotion of Army officers. Compared to an <b>officer</b> <b>with</b> a baccalaureate degree, the survival time of an <b>officer</b> <b>with</b> a masterÎ±s degree, a doctorate degree, or a professional degree is greater by 29. 1 percent, 23. 9 percent or 8. 2 percent, respectively. An <b>officer</b> <b>with</b> a masterÎ±s degree, a doctorate degree, or a professional degree has a hazard of leaving the Army that is 38. 3 percent, 44. 4 percent, or 75. 6 percent, respectively, of that of a college graduate. Compared to an <b>officer</b> <b>with</b> a baccalaureate degree, the length of time to promotion to O- 4 for an <b>officer</b> <b>with</b> a masterÎ±s/doctorate degree or a professional degree is 0. 2 percent shorter or 2. 4 percent shorter, respectively. An <b>officer</b> <b>with</b> a masterÎ±s degree or doctorate degree has a hazard of promotion that is 115. 3 percent of that of an <b>officer</b> <b>with</b> a college degree. Having a professional degree has no significant effect on the hazard of promotion. Turkish Army author...|$|R

5|$|During peacetime and war, {{the command}} {{structure}} of the Northern Army remained the same. However, during times of great conflict and crisis, the raising of large militias required the appointment of many new <b>officers</b> <b>with</b> various titles, which were often bestowed as honorary titles to officials during times of peace. Large divisions were led by a General (Jiangjun 將軍) whose rank depended on status; divisions were divided {{into a number of}} regiments commanded by a Colonel, and sometimes by a Major.

5|$|Finland sought {{security}} guarantees {{from the}} League of Nations, {{but did not}} have high expectations.

The prime goal was co-operation with the Scandinavian countries, amongst which Sweden was the most important prospective partner.|$|E

5|$|By April 1918, 35 {{infantry}} and two pioneer battalions were being prepared {{to move to}} Palestine. Those battalions with identification numbers from 150 upwards were formed by removing complete companies from experienced regiments then serving in Mesopotamia and forming new battalions. The 2/151st Indian Infantry was one such battalion formed from one company each from the 56th Punjabi Rifles and the 51st, 52nd and 53rd Sikhs. One regiment, the 101st Grenadiers, formed a second battalion by dividing itself into two with two experienced and two new companies in each battalion. The parent battalions also supplied first line transport and experienced <b>officers</b> <b>with</b> war time service. The 3/151st Indian Infantry had the commanding officer, two other British and four Indian officers included in the 198 men transferred from the 38th Dogras. The sepoys transferred were also very experienced. In September 1918 the 2/151st Indian Infantry had to provide an honour guard for Allenby; among the men on parade were some who had served on five different fronts since 1914, and on eight pre-war campaigns.|$|E
5|$|By October 1918, Austria {{prepared}} to transfer her entire fleet to Yugoslavia {{in order to}} keep it out of Italian hands. On November 10, 1918, one day before the armistice, Yugoslav <b>officers</b> <b>with</b> scratch crews sailed Radetzky and Zrínyi out of Pola. As they cleared the breakwater at Pola, they sighted the approaching Italian fleet. The two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to Castelli Bay near Spolato. They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender, which a squadron of USN submarine chasers in the area did. However, under the subsequent peace treaty, the Allied powers ignored the transfer of the Austro-Hungarian ships to the Yugoslav navy; instead, the ships were to be ceded to Italy. Radetzky and Zrínyi were broken up in Italy between 1920–21; Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand survived until 1926, when she too was scrapped in Italy.|$|E

However, under the subsequent peace treaty, the Allied powers ignored the transfer of the Austro-Hungarian ships to the Yugoslav navy which had already taken place; instead, the ships were ceded to Italy.
