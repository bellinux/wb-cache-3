40|$|Phenylalkylamines (PAA) usually {{known for}} their action on L-type Ca 2 + {{channels}} potently block the C-type inactivating lymphocyte Kv 1. 3 channel resulting in inhibition of activation of T lymphocytes. In order to design PAAs blocking Kv 1. 3 specifically over L-type Ca 2 + channels, we investigated the state-dependent manner of mKv 1. 3 block by the PAA verapamil. Verapamil seems {{to have access to}} the open state (OB) and, once bound to the channel, the channel-verapamil complex is absorbed into a slowly recovering state. This state was proposed to be the inactivated blocked state (IB). Here we present a quantitative description of the transition into this state and provide evidence for the IB state through experiments with an inactivation lacking mutant channel. Since the inactivated state cannot be reached in this case the IB state cannot be reached either. We show that the transition OB→IB is accelerated by verapamil most likely through a mechanism involving the reduction of [K+] at an inactivation modulating low affinity binding site for K+ at the outer vestibule. Measurements of the voltage-dependence of the off-rate constants for verapamil suggest that verapamil can reach the channel in its neutral form and might get partially protonated while bound. Thus only those verapamil molecules that are protonated can more easily dissociate at hyperpolarizing voltages. Since <b>open</b> <b>block</b> kinetics were shown to be similar for wild type mKv 1. 3 and the H 404 T mutant mKv 1. 3 channel, and since the block of the H 404 T mutant channels by verapamil could be described exactly by a simple three-state <b>open</b> <b>block</b> model, the mutant channel could serve as a screening channel to determine <b>open</b> <b>block</b> affinities of new PAA derivatives in high through-put experiments...|$|E
40|$|The phase {{behavior}} of ion-containing block copolymer membranes in equilibrium with humidified air is studied {{as a function}} of the relative humidity (RH) of the surrounding air, ion content of the copolymer, and temperature. Increasing RH at constant temperature results in both disorder-to-order and order-to-order transitions. In-situ small-angle neutron scattering experiments on the <b>open</b> <b>block</b> copolymer system, when combined with wafer uptake measurement, indicate that the disorder-to-order transition is driven by an increase in the partial molar entropy of the water molecules in the ordered phase relative to that in the disordered phase.

40|$|Keeping the {{consistency}} of spatial distribution patterns of buildings has been a difficulty in the problem of spatial conflicts resolution between roads and buildings. The relationships between roads and buildings are classified into types of <b>Open</b> <b>Block,</b> Half-open Block and Close Block based on the extent that roads encircle buildings. An algorithm for buildings displacement is proposed based on geometry similarity which is realized by constraints of distance, angle and area. The skeleton of buildings in a road mesh is constructed by means of MST whose characteristics of length and angle are regarded as distance and angle constraints for buildings displacement. And area ratios of all buildings to corresponding road mesh are regarded as the area constraints for buildings displacement. Series of secondary conflict disposal methods are explored for the possible secondary conflicts. Experimental results show conflicts between roads and buildings are eliminated and spatial distribution pattern of buildings is maintained completely...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{the process of}} data {{transmission}} in star coupled optical communication networks is modelled as a shop-type scheduling problem, where channels (wavelengths) are treated as machines. We formulate an <b>Open</b> <b>Block</b> problem with the minimum makespan objective (OB||Cmax) in which a relation of a new type between the operations of each job is introduced: any two operations of a job have identical processing times and may be processed either simultaneously (in a common block) or, alternatively, at disjoint time intervals. We show {{that the problem is}} polynomially solvable for 4 machines, NP-hard for 6 machines and strongly NP-hard for a variable number of machines. For the case of a variable number of machines we present a polynomial time 2 -approximation algorithm and prove that there is no polynomial time ρ-approximation algorithm with ρ< 11 / 10, unless P=NP. For the case when the number of machines is fixed, we show that the problem admits a linear time PTAS. In addition, we show that the two-machine problem with release dates is NP-hard in the strong sense...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{electrophysiology}} {{and contemporary}} crystallography {{suggest that the}} activation gate of voltage-dependent channels is on the intracellular side, but a more extracellular “pore gate” has also been proposed. We have used the voltage dependence of block by extracellular Y 3 + {{as a tool to}} locate the activation gate of the α 1 G (CaV 3. 1) T-type calcium channel. Y 3 + block exhibited no clear voltage dependence from − 40 to + 40 mV (50 % block at 25 nM), but block was relieved rapidly by stronger depolarization. Reblock of the open channel, reflected in accelerated tail currents, was fast and concentration dependent. Closed channels were also blocked by Y 3 + at a concentration-dependent rate, only eightfold slower than open-channel block. When extracellular Ca 2 + was replaced with Ba 2 +, the rate of <b>open</b> <b>block</b> by Y 3 + was unaffected, but closed block was threefold faster than in Ca 2 +, suggesting the slower closed-block rate reflects ion–ion interactions in the pore rather than an extracellularly located gate. Since an extracellular blocker can rapidly enter the closed pore, the primary activation gate must be on the intracellular side of the selectivity filter...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{analysis}} is of fundamental importance {{to understand the}} factors underlying participation in top-level sports. Recently, an increased importance {{has been given to}} the preservation of the situation’s ecology, thus attempting the comprehension of game patterns through the establishment of relationships between variables of several orders. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyse some match variables that could constraint the setter’s tactical action in high-performance women’s volleyball, as well as its outcomes. Six matches of the Women’s World Champhionships 2006 were analysed following a category system, recurring to observational methodology, namely the technique of sequential lag analysis. Attack tempo has emerged as the crucial variable of the setter’s tactical action. Patterns with closed blocks from the opponent, setting in the ideal zone with a jump set, attack simulation by the middle attacker and block anticipation, through committing strategies, tended to culminate in quick attacks. These, in turn, stimulate a debilitated block opposition. <b>Open</b> <b>block</b> formations, receptions in zones 4 and 1, setting in non-ideal zones, no simulation by the middle attacker and a non-anticipative block (read-and-react strategy) stimulated slow attacks, which, in turn, stimulated cohesive block opposition. Attack efficacy emerged as independent of the setter’s action, although the latter largely influenced the type of block opposition. Hence, match analysis provides a window into aspects involving the tactical actions in high-level athletes. Key words: performance, match analysis, game patterns, ecological analysi...|$|E
