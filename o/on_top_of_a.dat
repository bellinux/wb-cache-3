5|$|Meanwhile, Doofenshmirtz, {{inside his}} robot, traps Perry, {{offering}} him a deli platter thinking he has won; Perry, however, has him pour {{a large amount}} of pepper onto it, blowing it and causing the robot to sneeze. The two are sent flying and crashing through the record building, Perry using the PFT tape to latch himself safely on a flag pole in the resulting free fall, while Doofenshmirtz plummets to the ground, landing <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mattress placed <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parked truck. Unfortunately, the truck belongs to a folding mattress company and Doofenshmirtz is crushed by the mattress and then crushed by his own robot immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of}} the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy {{at the base of the}} wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E

5|$|Bonshō have {{occasionally}} {{been used}} as musical instruments in modern compositions. The recorded sound of temple bells was used in Mayuzumi Toshiro's piece Olympic Campanology, used to open the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. A temple bell is also used in performances of Jacob Druckman's piece Lamia, {{in which it is}} rung while placed <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kettledrum. Modern composers for percussion have sometimes used the temple bell to replace the now common sound of the orchestral tam-tam.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accounts}} date Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle to {{the early}} 14th century, although recent archaeological evidence has proved human existence in the area back to the 12th or 13th century. Initially built to protect the bridge connecting the city with the mainland, the castle sits <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peninsula carved out by the winding Smotrych River, forming a natural defense system for Kamianets-Podilskyi's historic Old Town neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Chicago still {{preferred}} palazzo-styled {{buildings with}} large light {{courts in the}} centre, because they remained the most profitable designs. The Wrigley Building, built under the 1920 law, demonstrated the effect of two ornamental towers <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> skyscraper. Under the revised law, the Straus Building and the Pittsfield Building took the palazzo design and added somewhat stunted towers on top in the early 1920s, producing profitable buildings.|$|E
