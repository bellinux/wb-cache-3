5|$|A {{considerable}} amount <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been done at Mount Baker {{over the past}} decade, {{and it is now}} among the most-studied of the Cascade volcanoes. Recent and ongoing projects include gravimetric and GPS-based geodetic monitoring, fumarole gas sampling, tephra distribution mapping, new interpretations of the Schriebers Meadow lava flow, and hazards analyses. Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continues, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research into metallopharmaceuticals, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial body <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> examined using metallocene derivatives of ruthenium and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes {{in place of}} the fluorophenyl group in haloperidol, which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical antipsychotic. The ferrocenyl–haloperidol compound investigated has structure (C5H5)Fe(C5H4)–C(=O)–(CH2)3–N(CH2CH2)2C(OH)–C6H4Cl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the radioactive isotope 103Ru produces a ruthenocenyl–haloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in mice and rats. Beta-decay of 103Ru produces the metastable isotope 103mRh in a rhodocenyl–haloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodocenium–haloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenyl–haloperidol and the rhodocenium–haloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. 103mRh has a half-life of 56min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include 131I, 59Fe, and 47Ca, and 103mRh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the controversies}} facing bite mark {{analysis}} {{are due to}} the lack of empirical supporting evidence.

The lack <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> led to the continued use of a few outdated and limited studies to support the validity of bite mark analysis.

25|$|By far {{the biggest}} problem with the {{conventional}} approach is cost; solar cells require a relatively thick layer of doped silicon in order to have reasonable photon capture rates, and silicon processing is expensive. There {{have been a number of}} different approaches to reduce this cost over the last decade, notably the thin-film approaches, but to date they have seen limited application due to a variety of practical problems. Another line <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been to dramatically improve efficiency through the multi-junction approach, although these cells are very high cost and suitable only for large commercial deployments. In general terms the types of cells suitable for rooftop deployment have not changed significantly in efficiency, although costs have dropped somewhat due to increased supply.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} area <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> {{been on the}} use of plasma polymer {{films as}} permeation membranes. The permeability characteristics of plasma polymers deposited on porous substrates are different than usual polymer films. The characteristics depend on the deposition and polymerization mechanism. Plasma polymers as membranes for separation of oxygen and nitrogen, ethanol and water, and water vapor permeation have all been studied. The application of plasma polymerized thin films as reverse osmosis membranes has received considerable attention as well. Yasuda et al. have shown membranes prepared with plasma polymerization made from nitrogen containing monomers can yield up to 98% salt rejection with a flux of 6.4 gallons/ft2 a day. Further research has shown that varying the monomers of the membrane offer other properties as well, such as chlorine resistance.|$|E

Over the past half century, a significant amount <b>of</b> <b>research</b> <b>has</b> been focused on the use of stereotaxically placed lesions as a potential treatment method for ataxic cerebral palsy (the method had shown significant improvements in treating Parkinson's disease). Many studies suggested that lesions of the dentate nucleus produced an apparent reduction of symptoms, however the success of these studies did not attain the same level of success that was found when using the method to treat Parkinson’s disease. With the improvement of brain imaging techniques in recent time, it may be possible in the future to utilize these techniques to identify specific sites of imbalance within the brain which could be treated with stereotaxically placed electrodes.|$|E
