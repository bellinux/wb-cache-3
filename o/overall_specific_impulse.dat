50|$|Composite {{modified}} double base propellants {{start with}} a nitrocellulose/nitroglycerin double base propellant as a binder and add solids (typically ammonium perchlorate (AP) and powdered aluminium) normally used in composite propellants. The ammonium perchlorate makes up the oxygen deficit introduced by using nitrocellulose, improving the <b>overall</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b> The aluminium improves specific impulse as well as combustion stability. High performing propellants such as NEPE-75 used to fuel the Trident II D-5, SLBM replace most of the AP with polyethylene glycol-bound HMX, further increasing specific impulse. The mixing of composite and double base propellant ingredients has become so common as to blur the functional definition of double base propellants.|$|E
40|$|Presented at the 2002 Missile Sciences Conference, Monterrey, CA, November 5 - 7, 2002. This paper {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} a conceptual sizing tool for the design of tactical missiles. The sizing tool, called the Tactical Missile Design (TMD) spreadsheet, was developed to allow the user to quickly generate estimates of a missile configuration?s performance and other measures of merit such as lethality. This capability allows the user to get a first order estimate of a missile?s ability to meet a set of requirements and allows for fast trade-studies to quickly identify the performance drivers of a system. In order to generate reasonable estimates for missile range and speed, a sizing tool must have analysis methods for aerodynamics, propulsion, weight, and trajectory. In order for the sizing tool to remain useful for conceptual tradeoffs, these analyses must be robust enough to handle a wide range of inputs, yet simple enough to be executed quickly. The analysis methods were constructed with these requirements in mind. The aerodynamics analysis is based upon several physics-derived analytical expressions as outlined in the text ?Tactical Missile Design? by Eugene Fleeman. Propulsion uses a simplified cycle analysis to relate engine parameters (maximum inlet temperature, fuel heating value, expansion ratio) to <b>overall</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (Isp). The propulsion analysis can handle either air-breathing and solid-rocket systems, or a combination thereof. For trajectory, a constant flight path is assumed, with a boost, cruise, and coast phase. These straightforward analysis methods combine to produce a very powerful, yet robust, conceptual missile design tool. The paper first lays out the analysis methods, assumptions, and limitations in the Tactical Missile Design spreadsheet. Next, a comparison is made between the results of the TMD spreadsheet and the performance of historical missile systems. In addition, the paper explores some example trade studies to identify the drivers of a rocket and a ramjet missile system. Finally, the TMD spreadsheet is used to show how easily a tactical missile can be optimized at the conceptual level...|$|E

40|$|Microsatellite (3 ̆c 100 kg) {{propulsion}} {{is a young}} {{field that}} has not yet produced technologies more commercially viable than cold gas thrusters. Design constraints rule out much of traditional propulsion, requiring new and nonobvious technologies to advance {{the state of the art}} and enable longer and more flexible missions. The radio frequency microthermal thruster is shown to be worth thorough study for this application. A basic analytical model is constructed to look at expected performance, and the theory behind that model is explained. Calibration and the challenges in working with extremely low forces and displacements are also examined. The results of extensive testing on this thruster type are presented. Important trends are confirmed and validated, such as a linearity of <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> with power, and consistent nonlinearities with frequency and mass flow rate. Additionally, tests indicate a nonlinear relationship between applied frequency and thruster internal geometry that can more than triple the heating occurring in the thruster. Further tests focus on this relationship, and find more information about how these parameters couple are found to be primarily due to induced inefficiencies in stochastic heating and the inability of a vibrating voltage sheath to transfer energy into the flow. Additionally, first steps towards optimizing a design for performance are taken, such as analyzing the effect of adding a converging/diverging nozzle and finding an optimal length of inner electrode to be exposed to plasma. <b>Overall,</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> of up to 85 seconds are found with argon as the propellant, doubling cold gas <b>specific</b> <b>impulse,</b> and an error on <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> is calculated to be less than 3...|$|R
40|$|The Supersonic Combustion Ramjet (SCRamjet) {{engine is}} an {{efficient}} propulsion device for supersonic and hypersonic velocities. The present work {{focuses on the}} SCRamjet air intake which serves as the engine’s compressor. First, an analytical intake design tool was developed to generate so called streamline traced intake geometries. Second, the starting behavior of hypersonic air intakes was investigated experimentally in a blow down wind tunnel with a three-dimensional intake model with planar surfaces. A semi-empirical estimate was developed to predict intake starting of three-dimensional intake geometries. Third, the three-dimensional intake was further investigated experimentally and results were compared to numerical simulations. Finally, {{the performance of the}} three-dimensional intake was compared to the performance of different streamline traced intakes, designed with the analytical tool. <b>Overall,</b> the <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> of the streamline traced intakes was approximately 10 % higher compared to the three-dimensional intake configuration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the work {{performed at the}} Surrey Space Centre to produce low cost propulsion systems for small spacecraft with relatively low velocity-change (ÄV) requirements. Traditionally, cold gas nitrogen systems {{have been used for}} this type of application, however these have high storage volume requirements which can be a problem given the typical volume constraints of small spacecraft. An alternative solution is to use liquefied gases, which store as liquids and hence have reasonable densities, whilst still being suitable for use in a cold gas thruster. Thus, liquefied butane gas has been selected as our propellant of choice: Although it has slightly lower <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> than nitrogen, it has a significantly higher storage density, and, conveniently, it stores at a very low pressure, hence no pressure-regulation system is required. On 28 th June 2000 Surrey launched its first nano-satellite: SNAP- 1. This spacecraft was equipped with a small cold gas propulsion system utilising 32. 6 grams of butane propellant, which, since launch, has been used to raise the spacecraft 2 ̆ 7 s semi-major axis by over 3 kilometres. In this paper, we describe SNAP- 1 ’s propulsion system, highlighting its low-cost features. Telemetry data are used to illustrate orbital control operations, and to derive an <b>overall</b> mission <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b> Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) are currently under contract to build three Earth-observation spacecraft for a Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC). Each spacecraft will weigh approx 100 kg and have a ÄV requirement of 10 m/s. A new butane system is being designed and manufactured to meet the requirements of these spacecraft. The system is based very much on the flight heritage of the SNAP- 1 system, but with the addition of greater propellant storage capacity. The lessons learnt from SNAP- 1 operations are reviewed and the resulting design improvements for the DMC propulsion system are detailed...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the operation of a RBCC at ramjet and scramjet flight conditions using a direct-connect test facility. The apparatus being tested is a single strut-rocket within a dual-mode ram/scramjet combustor. The gaseous hydrogen/oxygen, linear strut-rocket was supplied by Aerojet Propulsion Company. The hardware is being tested in the Direct Connect Supersonic Combustion Test Facility at NASA Langley Research Center. The test facilities hydrogen/oxygen vitiated heater is capable of flight total enthalpies to Mach 8. A Mach 2. 5 facility nozzle mates the heater to the combustor duct. The rocket ejector will ordinarily operate in a fuel-rich mode. Additional fuel injection is provided by a pair of parallel injectors located at the base of the strut body. Instrumentation on the test apparatus includes a unique, direct thrust measurement system. Performance predictions for the anticipated test conditions have been made using a one-dimensional, thermodynamic analysis code. Results from the code show the dependence of <b>overall</b> thrust and <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> on rocket chamber pressure, rocket fuel equivalence ratio, and overall fuel equivalence ratio. Once the experimental test series begins, the inferred combustion efficiency as a function of axial location and the thermal choke region (where applicable) can also be determined using this code. Upon completion of the experimental test series, measurements will be used to calculate thrust, <b>specific</b> <b>impulse,</b> etc. Measured and calculated values will be compared to those found analytically. If appropriate, the code will be tailored to better predict hardware operation. Conclusions will be drawn as to the fuel-rich rocket's overall effect on ramjet and scramjet performance. Also, comparisons will be made between the integrated thrust calculated from the static pressure taps located along the duct and the thrust measured by the direct thrust measurement system...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>impulse</b> {{is often}} used as the unit of {{efficiency}} for rockets, since {{in the case of}} the rocket, there is a direct relation between <b>specific</b> <b>impulse,</b> <b>specific</b> fuel consumption and exhaust velocity.

5000|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (usually {{abbreviated}} Isp) is {{a measure}} of the efficiency of rocket and jet engines.

40|$|The {{application}} of electric propulsion to communications satellites, however, {{has been limited}} {{to the use of}} hydrazine thrusters with electric heaters for thrust and <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> augmentation. These electrothermal thrusters operate at <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> levels of approximately 300 s with heater powers of about 500 W. Low power arcjets (1 - 3 kW) are currently being investigated as a way to increase <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> levels to approximately 500 s. Ion propulsion systems can easily produce <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> of 3000 s or greater, but have yet to be applied to communications satellites. The reasons most often given for not using ion propulsion systems are their high level of overall complexity, low thrust with long burn times, and the difficulty of integrating the propulsion system into existing commercial spacecraft busses. The Electrostatic Plasma Accelerator (EPA) is a thruster concept which promises <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> levels between low power arcjets and those of the ion engine while retaining the relative simplicity of the arcjet.

50|$|These {{equations}} {{show that}} a higher <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> means a more efficient rocket engine, capable of burning {{for longer periods of}} time. In terms of staging, the initial rocket stages usually have a lower <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> rating, trading efficiency for superior thrust in order to quickly push the rocket into higher altitudes.
