2500|$|Beginning {{with songs}} and string quartets written {{around the turn}} of the century, Schoenberg's {{concerns}} as a composer positioned him uniquely among his peers, in that his procedures exhibited characteristics of both Brahms and Wagner, who for most contemporary listeners, were considered polar opposites, representing mutually exclusive directions in the legacy of German music. Schoenberg's Six Songs, Op. 3 (1899–1903), for example, exhibit a conservative clarity of tonal organization typical of Brahms and Mahler, reflecting an interest in balanced phrases and an undisturbed hierarchy of key relationships. However, the songs also explore unusually bold incidental chromaticism, and seem to aspire to a Wagnerian [...] "representational" [...] approach to motivic identity. The synthesis of these approaches reaches an apex in his Verklärte Nacht, Op. 4 (1899), a programmatic work for string sextet that develops several distinctive [...] "leitmotif"-like themes, each one eclipsing and subordinating the last. The only motivic elements that persist throughout the work are those that are perpetually dissolved, varied, and re-combined, in a technique, identified primarily in Brahms's music, that Schoenberg called [...] "developing variation". Schoenberg's procedures in the work are <b>organized</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> simultaneously; at once suggesting a Wagnerian narrative of motivic ideas, as well as a Brahmsian approach to motivic development and tonal cohesion.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to define and study Yetter-Drinfeld modules over Hom-bialgebras, a {{generalized}} version of bialgebras obtained by modifying the algebra and coalgebra structures by a homomorphism. Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a Hom-bialgebra with bijective structure map provide solutions of the Hom-Yang-Baxter equation. The category _H^H YD of Yetter-Drinfeld modules with bijective structure maps over a Hom-bialgebra H with bijective structure map can be <b>organized,</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> different <b>ways,</b> as a quasi-braided pre-tensor category.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the Swedish results of {{education}} have fallen continuously since 2000. It has been shown that there are differences in performance between native students and immigrant students. National Centre for “Swedish as a second language” indicates that Swedish schools fail to give all students an equal and high quality education. Then Swedish as a second language education can be <b>organized</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> different <b>ways</b> a wonder arise if it can depend on how teachers´ conditions in teaching reveals in these. This study aims to lighten primary school teachers' views on the opportunities and difficulties in second language teaching, which can be <b>organized</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> different <b>ways,</b> "separate" and "within the framework of the class". The research questions of the study are, 1) What requirements do teachers perceive that the curriculum for “Swedish as a second language” requires? What opportunities and difficulties can be seen here? 2) What trade-offs are made in the planning of teaching and how are these applied in the teaching of “Swedish as a second language”? What opportunities and difficulties can be seen here? 3) What conditions for scaffolding and interaction do teachers create in teaching "Swedish as a second language? What opportunities and difficulties can be seen here? By using Shulmans theory PCK (Pedagogical Content Knowledge) it manages to visualize teacher language didactic choices within the subject “Swedish as a second language”. Through a qualitative study based on interviews and observations, the result shows that both teachers reason about a range of language didactic choices, opportunities and solutions, but these could not always be transformed and seen in practice. During the observations, {{it became clear that the}} “Swedish as a second language” teaching structural conditions both enabling and impeding teachers to conduct effective teaching. In this case, separate teaching came to be ineffective because they did not have a language development perspectives in school, thereby the subject was stigmatized. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the role of {{research}} organizations within the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR 2020) Research and Innovation (R&I) Programme. The SESAR 2020 Programme (2016 to 2021) is intended to demonstrate the viability of the technological and operational solutions already developed within the preceding SESAR R&I Programme (from 2008 to 2016) in larger and more operationally-integrated environments. SESAR 2020 is divided into two sections. One part is the so called Industrial Research (IR) and Very Large Demonstrations (VLD) part with a funding of 398 Mio. € conducted by a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) consisting of 19 members. The second part is the so called Exploratory Research (ER) part with a funding of 81 Mio. € contracted via open Horizon 2020 calls. While the Exploratory Research covers the lower Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 1 and 2 the Industrial Research is covering TRL 3 to 6. The above mentioned Very Largescale Demonstrations are <b>organized</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> They are partly covered by the members of the PPP and partly contracted via open Horizon 2020 calls with a funding of 37 Mio. €. These calls are especially addressing the involvement of the airspace users, e. g. airlines. The only research organizations which are full members of the PPP are: 1) Stiftelsen SINTEF from Norway as part of the North European ATM Industry Group - NATMIG Consortium 2) Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft-und Raumfahrt e. V., DLR (German Aerospace Centre) and 3) Netherlands Aerospace Centre, NLR together forming the AT-One Consortium. All three organizations are involved in every part of the SESAR 2020 research programme. In addition they are coordinating several projects in the Exploratory Research section plus one project in Industrial Research section and one Very Largescale Demonstration. From the experience gained within these three research organizations, this paper will give an overview about the different research topics as well as about the role of research organizations within the SESAR 2020 programme...|$|E

40|$|Sleep can be <b>organized</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> quite {{different}} <b>ways</b> across homeothermic species: either in one block (monophasic), or in several bouts across the 24 h (polyphasic). Yet, the main relationships between variables, {{as well as}} regulating mechanisms, {{are likely to be}} similar. Correlations and theories on sleep regulation should thus be examined on both types of sleepers. In previous studies on monophasic humans, we have shown preferential links between the number of ultradian cycles and the rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) time, rather than with its counterpart non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS). Here, the sleep of 26 polyphasic mice was examined, both to better describe the NREMS distribution, which is far more complex than in humans, and to replicate the analyses performed on humans. As in humans, the strongest links with the number of cycles were with REMS. Links were not significant with NREMS taken as a whole, although positive correlations were found with the NREMS immediately preceding REMS episodes and inversely significant with the residue. This convergence between monophasic and polyphasic patterns supports the central role played by REMS in sleep alternation. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|In this chapter, we {{will assume}} that the Grapheme-To-Phoneme (GTP) module is {{provided}} with the syntactic information it requires (which almost corresponds to {{the output of the}} LIPSS text analyzer in its current state of development, except that accent groups are not yet defined), together with the text to transcribe phonetically. It is then possible to <b>organize</b> its task <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> Dictionary based solutions consist of storing a maximum of phonological knowledge in a lexicon. In order to keep its size reasonably small, entries are generally restricted to morphemes, and the pronunciation of surface forms is accounted for by inflectional, derivational, and compounding morpho-phonological rules which modify the phonetic transcriptions of their morphemic constituents. This approach has been followed by the MITTALK system [Allen et al 87] from its very first day. A dictionary of up to 10, 000 morphemes covered 95 % of the input words. Others were transcribed by rule. In a word: dictionary is the rule, while rules are the exception. A radically different strategy is adopted in rule based transcription systems, which transfer most of the phonological competence of dictionaries into a set of rules. Word...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was on the role of prior {{knowledge}} and text structure in children's comprehension of informational text. It examined the effects of two levels of prior knowledge (High Prior Knowledge and Low Prior Knowledge) and two types of text structure (Attribution and Comparison) on the recall and question performance of fifth graders who were average readers. The 90 subjects in the study were {{selected on the basis of}} a pretest of their knowledge about <b>two</b> cities <b>in</b> their home state and <b>two</b> cities <b>in</b> another state. All selected subjects had high knowledge of the cities in their home state and low knowledge of the cities in the other state. Each subject read one of two passages (high prior knowledge passage or low prior knowledge passage) that was <b>organized</b> <b>in</b> one of <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> (attribution version or comparison version). Measures of written free recall and comprehension questions were the dependent variables. The measures were designed so that both qualitative and quantitative effects could be examined regarding children's recall and comprehension of three subsections of the text information. Prior knowledge had a greater effect on question performance than on recall performance. In addition, it only enhanced the recall of one section of the text information. There was a facilitative effect for the comparison structure on children's recall of one section of the text information. Finally, there was no demonstrated effect for the text structure on question performance. The research results suggest that the effect of prior knowledge and text structure on children's comprehension performance may vary depending upon the task, the information to be learned, and other reader factors such as ability. Substantial research evidence suggests that prior knowledge, as well as the organizational structure of a text, are important factors that influence children'...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{essentially}} a study of how to organize public space vertically in a tall building. In most cases, high rise buildings tend to be <b>organized</b> <b>in</b> one of <b>two</b> <b>ways,</b> either centrally, with the core elements {{in the center of}} the building footprint, or linearly, with core elements at the ends of the building footprint,(usually, with a corridor connecting the <b>two</b> ends). <b>In</b> both cases, the public space created in these kinds of organizations tends to be neutral, devoid of life, dark, and alienating. This thesis explores how the necessary service core elements, of a tall building, can be used as spatial elements to develop public space that is conducive to social/communal gathering and interaction on a variety of levels, through the use of communicating floors; and develop public space that has the capacity to accommodate a variety of amenities that contribute to a better sense of urbanity in the air. The thesis is divided into three major sections - the first section, vertical organization, is an examination of the nature and organization of service core elements and public space, with a design illustration presented to illustrate an alternative core organization in terms of its proto-typical implications. The second section, a design proposal, uses the alternative service core organization, for a high rise multi-use building on a specific site in downtown Boston. Finally, the third section is a conclusion and summary to discuss findings about the nature of this alternative organizational concept. An appendix is included to illustrate similar organizational attitudes explored in a past studio experience, at M. I. T., for a residential high rise building. by David Jay Weiner. Thesis (M. Arch.)

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the level of "burn-out" being experienced by residence hall directors in the state of Wisconsin through the use of survey methods. There was also an historical investigation into the history of housing and its implications for "burn-out. " The study consisted of a pilot instrument and a final instrument for wider distribution. The pilot sample consisted of the eleven residence hall directors at the University of Wisconsin [...] La Crosse. The questionnaire consisted of twenty questions asking for demographic information and responses to items concerning how affected they felt by "burn-out" as a result of their job responsibilities. There was a 100 percent response rate from this pilot instrument. The questionnaire in its final form consisted of six questions. Four questions concerned demographic information and called for short answer responses. Question 5 asked the respondents to break down their responsibilities as a hall director in four specific areas (Administrator, Counselor, Disciplinarian, Educator) according to percentage of time spent performing job responsibilities. Question 6 consisted of a list of twenty factors considered to contribute to "burn-out", using a Leikert scale with " 5 " being greatly affected and " 1 " being not at all affected the respondents were asked to rate the twenty items as they applied to their job. The final survey was distributed to 137 residence hall directors in the state of Wisconsin. 103 surveys were returned for a response rate of 76 percent. The results of the survey were <b>organized</b> and analyzed <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> <b>Two</b> discriminant analyses were performed on the data to determine the significance of the differences between the responses of the hall directors from the private and public universities and colleges and also to determine the significance of the differences of the responses among the four identified roles of a residence hall director. Neither of the discriminant analyses were found to be statistically significant. Several individual variables were found to be highly significant and a t-test and lest squared difference (LSD) procedure were performed on the data to determine where the significance exists...|$|R
