5|$|In {{the medieval}} period, Hale Barns was an <b>outlying</b> <b>area</b> of the {{township}} of Hale, but a growth in prosperity led to it becoming a separate settlement. The village gets {{its name from}} the tithe barn that used to stand there. Before the industrial revolution, Hale Barns was an agricultural village, but since then evolved into a commuter settlement. St Ambrose College Roman Catholic boys' grammar school is in Hale Barns and the village is also home to Ringway golf club. Cotteril Clough in Hale Barns is an ancient and diverse woodland and a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E

This climate is ideal for growing farmed crops in the summer such as tomatoes, sweet corn and squash, leaving much of the <b>outlying</b> <b>area</b> marked with large tracts of farmland. Manchester is a rural commuting town where residents travel {{to work in the}} greater Baltimore Metropolitan Area and the greater Washington Metropolitan Area.|$|E

25|$|In June 1987, Elting {{signed on}} {{broadcast}} translator W269AR on 101.7MHz {{in order to}} bolster coverage in downtown Charlottesville. The 102.3MHz facility is {{what is known as}} a rimshot station – a station licensed to a suburb or <b>outlying</b> <b>area</b> that attempts to serve a larger market. Due to its relatively low transmitter height and the hilly terrain between Crozet and Charlottesville, 102.3 has spotty coverage in the city itself, even with its highly directional signal pointed east. Most Charlottesville stations broadcast from the highest peak overlooking the city, the 1,573-foot Carter Mountain, which provides good coverage of Albemarle County.|$|E
25|$|The world {{wheat market}} {{remained}} strong through the 1870s and early 1880s, but then supply began to exceed demand, and prices began to fall. When the rival Santa Fe Railroad reached Los Angeles in 1885, fare wars {{between the two}} transportation giants brought ever more settlers to Southern California, and pressure rose to subdivide the great ranches of the Valley. In 1886, David Burbank sold his ranch to Los Angeles land speculators who formed the Providencia Land, Water and Development Company, with Burbank {{as one of the}} directors. The land was surveyed and a business district was laid out, surrounded by residential lots. The <b>outlying</b> <b>area</b> was divided into small farms. They named the town Burbank and opened the tract for sale on May 1, 1887.|$|E

2500|$|Transportation {{advocates in}} Boston {{have complained that}} rail transit riders cannot travel from one <b>outlying</b> <b>area</b> to another without first {{traveling}} to the downtown hub stations, changing lines, and traveling outbound again. Some of the radial transit lines, notably the Green Line, are so overcrowded that service is very slow, unreliable, and capacity-limited because of rush-hour [...] "crush loads". There are several crosstown bus lines, such as the #1, #66, CT1, CT2, and CT3 routes, but they are slow, unreliable, and subject to bus bunching because they must operate in mixed street traffic.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{mention in}} the Avesta of Airyan Vaejah, one of the '16 the lands of the Aryans'. Gnoli's {{interpretation}} of geographic references in the Avesta situates the Airyanem Vaejah in the Hindu Kush. For similar reasons, Boyce excludes places north of the Syr Darya and western Iranian places. With some reservations, Skjaervo concurs that {{the evidence of the}} Avestan texts makes it impossible to avoid the conclusion that they were composed somewhere in northeastern Iran. Witzel points to the central Afghan highlands. Humbach derives Vaējah from cognates of the Vedic root [...] "vij," [...] suggesting the region of fast-flowing rivers. Gnoli considers Choresmia (Xvairizem), the lower Oxus region, south of the Aral Sea to be an <b>outlying</b> <b>area</b> in the Avestan world. However, according to , the probable homeland of Avestan is, in fact, the area south of the Aral Sea.Gnoli, Boyce, Skjaervo, and Witzel, as cited in Humbach and Gnoli, as cited in ...|$|E
