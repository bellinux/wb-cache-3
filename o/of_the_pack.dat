5|$|The {{batteries}} in OR–7's Global Positioning System tracking unit expired in October 2015. Officials decided {{to replace the}} collar {{in order to keep}} track <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack,</b> which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts to trap OR-7 or other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> failed, and further tracking of OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four steers were killed by wolves in Wood River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR–7 was last seen, biologists said efforts to trap and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with the pack in Wood River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, the collar on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements and behaviors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>packing</b> {{container}} is used {{in storage}} and transport <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high explosive (HE) material. The study concerns <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> container in fire environment. The spruce wood filled in <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> container can effectively resist heat transfer and protect HE material. <b>The</b> thermal analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> container in <b>the</b> pool fire environment is presented with the finite element method. When considering the water evaporation and the wood pyrolysis, <b>the</b> enthalpy curve <b>of</b> wood is presented in this study. Heat can be transferred from the fire to <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> container via convection and radiation. Thus, two thermal boundary conditions are applied to <b>the</b> thermal model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> container. <b>The</b> simulations show the inner temperature distributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> container are significantly affected by the wood-column thickness. For the same time, the simulations show there is a slight difference in the char layer thickness between two thickness wood columns. The computed results show there are large temperature gradients in <b>the</b> interface <b>of</b> char and wood. This demonstrates the spruce wood is the excellent thermal resistance material...|$|R

5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them to the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> ice on 4 February.|$|E
5|$|Speculation on the pack-hunting {{habits of}} Albertosaurus {{were made by}} a few {{researchers}} who suggest that the younger members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> may {{have been responsible for}} driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower. Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator niches between those of the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than an adult Albertosaurus in mass. However, as the preservation of behavior in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. Phil Currie speculates that the Daspletosaurus formed packs to hunt, although this cannot be stated with certainty. There is no evidence of such gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.|$|E

Tulsa had three running backs who achieved over 700 yards rushing: junior Trey Watts (959), junior Ja'Terian Douglas (857), and senior Alex Singleton (765). Singleton also led the team and the conference and ranked sixth nationally with 21 rushing touchdowns. In the passing game, junior quarterback Cody Green totaled 2592 passing yards and 17 touchdowns, both of which were in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> nationally. Green's leading receiver was sophomore Keyarris Garrett, who amassed 67 receptions for 845 yards and 9 touchdowns, all of which led the team.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts {{won four}} Grand Nationals in 1976, he {{continued}} to experience mechanical misfortunes {{as well as a}} horsepower deficit to the Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the mile and half-mile dirt track events. He had been leading the Daytona 200 once again when tire troubles forced him to make a lengthy pit stop, and Johnny Cecotto {{went on to win the}} race. He dropped to third in the national championship as Jay Springsteen claimed the title for the Harley-Davidson team. He returned to England in April 1977, winning four out of six races at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races. Roberts then travelled to Italy where he raced in the Imola 200, leaving no doubt he was capable of competing at the international level by winning both legs and setting a new track record. He returned to the United States to compete in the Grand National championship where he won five of the six road races that made up the pavement portion of the series. In the road race event at Sears Point, Roberts started the race at the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> and passed the entire field within four laps to win the race. Despite being in contention for much of the season, Roberts was unable to win any of the dirt track events and eventually finished the year in fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Currie {{also offers}} {{speculation}} on the pack-hunting habits of Albertosaurus. The leg {{proportions of the}} smaller individuals were {{comparable to those of}} ornithomimids, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs. Younger Albertosaurus were probably equally fleet-footed, or at least faster than their prey. Currie hypothesized that the younger members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower. Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator niches between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than adult Albertosaurus in mass. A similar situation is observed in modern Komodo dragons, with hatchlings beginning life as small insectivores before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands. However, as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. In 2010, Currie, though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis, admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes, such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood.|$|E
40|$|An {{application}} of statistic techniques for structure evaluation of packing of equal or distributed spherical particles is presented. <b>The</b> <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> particles generated by computer simulation is cut {{by a series}} of equally separated parallel planes, and <b>the</b> area densities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross-sections <b>of</b> particles on <b>the</b> cutting planes are used to analyse <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> structure. It is shown that as <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting planes increases, <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area densities approaches <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density. Then a time series analysis technique is applied to examine <b>the</b> randomness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>packing.</b> <b>The</b> homogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> is evaluated by testing the hypothesis that the particles are uniformly distributed within <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> space. <b>The</b> isotropy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> is evaluated both at micro-level, <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> projections of centre-to-centre lines between touching particles, and at macro-level, <b>the</b> variances <b>of</b> area densities on the cutting planes perpendicular to different directions. As case studies, the above techniques are applied to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> structures <b>of</b> both equal and distributed particles obtained by a collective rearrangement simulation model...|$|R

5|$|In a squad {{with much}} less star power than that {{sent to the}} Tour de France, they were again middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> in the team time trial, {{finishing}} 11th of 22 teams. The squad did not show themselves much, as {{it was not until}} stage 10 that they so much as finished in the top ten on a stage. Phinney took fifth place in the stage 10 individual time trial, {{a minute and a half}} off the pace of the day's winner Tony Martin. Frank rode to fourth from a breakaway in the next stage, again a minute and a half off the pace of the day's winner, this time David Moncoutié. All the team had to show for itself from the second half of the Vuelta was a seventh place from Van Avermaet in the field sprint finish to stage 12. Six BMC riders reached the Vuelta's finish, with Van Avermaet in 83rd place being their highest overall finisher.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{began to}} pull clear {{from the rest of}} the field and set {{consecutive}} fastest laps. Barrichello began to hold up the McLaren drivers to allow his teammate to extend his lead. Further down the field, Trulli passed Ralf Schumacher to take seventh position on lap two. Heidfeld was overtaken by Alesi for 14th on the same lap. On the following lap, Ralf Schumacher retook seventh position from Trulli. Heidfeld lost a further position to Fisichella on lap four. Ralf Schumacher started to challenge Frentzen for sixth position on the fifth lap. At the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack,</b> Michael Schumacher was in control, extending his lead over Barrichello to five seconds by lap ten. Button took tenth position from Irvine on lap twelve, while Heidfeld collided with Alesi, sending his teammate into a spin who rejoined in 18th. Button moved into ninth place when he passed Salo on lap 13. Zonta, who was running 17th, suffered brake problems on lap 17 and collided with the tyre barriers which caused him to retire from the Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–08 season {{started with}} a further {{reduction}} in teams. Harbin and Qiqihar combined into a single team and became {{owned and operated by}} the San Jose Sharks. They took the name of their new owner and became the China Sharks. Kangwon Land renamed to High1. With only seven teams, the league reduced the number of games played to its lowest at just 30 games. The league continued with an unbalanced schedule and the Korean and Chinese teams played each other more than the Japanese teams did. After three years of dominance, the Nippon Paper Cranes slipped to fourth place and the regular season was won by the Prince Rabbits. Alex Kim, playing for High1, recorded the most goals with 23 and most points with 51. Joel Prpic continued to find himself on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> with 30 assists. With six of seven teams going to the playoffs, the Sharks were the only team that didn't find themselves in a playoff spot. The first round was over quickly as the Cranes swept Halla in three games and Oji did the same to the Ice Bucks. Nippon faced their rivals, the Rabbits, in the second round and defeated them three to one. High1 couldn't repeat their success from the previous year by winning a series and were swept by Oji in three games. For the first time, the final series was not between the Cranes and Rabbits. Oji continued to roll over their opponents and swept the Cranes, marking the only time a team in Asia League had swept its way through three rounds. Due to their dominance on the ice, the point race was also swept by Oji. Takeshi Saito led the playoffs with nine assists and 15 points, while Shane Endicott had the most goals with 6. Kunihiko Sakurai, also from Oji, won the MVP of the Year and Eum Hyun-seung, from High1, won the Young Guy of the Year award.|$|E

5|$|With rain {{shortly before}} the race, the start was taken behind the safety car, forcing all drivers to start the race on the full wet tyres. As Ricciardo led the field behind the safety car, Daniil Kvyat had {{to come into the}} pit lane on lap two, {{complaining}} of technical issues. He rejoined with a new steering wheel, being a lap down on the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> already. The race started in earnest on lap seven, with Ricciardo defending his lead at the restart. Kevin Magnussen made a pit stop for intermediate tyres {{at the end of the}} lap, but his teammate Jolyon Palmer proved just how slippery it still was when he crashed out just a lap later, being caught out by a wet zebra crossing and causing a virtual safety car period. More cars came into the pitlane for intermediate tyres over the following laps. On lap twelve, Kimi Räikkönen damaged his front wing on the guardrail at the Loews hairpin, resulting in his front wing getting caught under his front tyres, blocking Grosjean's way in the process. Räikkönen retired some corners later. Meanwhile, Ricciardo built a gap at the front, being ten seconds clear of Rosberg on lap 13. One lap later, Sebastian Vettel was the first of the front runners to change to intermediate tyres. Mercedes issued team orders demanding Rosberg let Hamilton past on lap 16, but the gap had by then grown to 13 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} in the post-season Halla {{replaced}} Vejvoda as head coach with Shim Eui-Sik. Shim had spent his entire professional career playing for Halla and during the 2007–2008 season he was the coach of Little Halla. As a player Shim had 30 points in 80 games. He vowed to reorganize the team and {{set his sights on}} a league championship. The team's general manager also hired Samuel H. Kim, then an analyst for SBS Sports and previously an NHL reporter from Vancouver, as a scout for the organization. Halla moved away from the heavy Czech influence which had previously dominated the team and filled 3 of the 4 spots for foreign players on the team with players from North America. Brock Radunske, Brad Fast and Jon Awe became the first three players from North America to play for the team. They also arranged for Eric Thurston, the head coach of University of Alberta's team, to spend the first 3 weeks of the training camp assisting the new coach and new North American players. Martinec was the only Czech player to remain on the team. In addition to the new foreigner players, Song Dong-hwan and Jang Jong-moon returned from military service. In the 2008 pre-season Anyang Cup, Halla finished 4th out of 5 teams. The AL increased the number of regular season games for the 2008–09 season to 36. In September head coach Shim was suspended for 5 games for refusal to play. The incident stemmed from a goal that was scored as the final buzzer sounded during a 21 September game against High1. Halla entered the dressing room and refused to return to the ice. The league considered the game a forfeit. Anyang Halla finished the season in first place with a total of 76 points. Their defeat of their rivals High1 in the final game of the season marks the first time a non-Japanese team had finished first place in the Asia League. Brock Radunske captured the titles for both the most goals scored with 29 and most points on the season with 57. Martinec finished in second place {{for the second year in}} a row in the assists category with 47. Overall the team finished with 5 players in the top 10 in the overall points tally. For the first time the team ended the season with the number one powerplay scoring 54 goals. In contrast to earlier seasons the team did not lead the league in short-handed goals, ranking in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> both in goals for and against. They were the only team not shutout during the regular season. After receiving a bye in the first round of the play-offs Halla had to face the Nippon Paper Cranes in the semi-final. They returned to Anyang for game 6 of the series leading 3–2. They were expected to win the series but Nippon's Ilmura scored two game-winning goals and the Japanese club defeated Anyang in 7 games.|$|E
