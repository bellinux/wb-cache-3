50|$|Owing to its {{non-specific}} cytotoxicity, instability under ambient conditions, {{and relative}} expense {{of isolation and}} manufacture, kedarcidin chromophore has not been investigated rigorously as a therapeutic candidate. However, the recent scientific advances discussed above have served to diminish this last hurdle, as fully synthetic and biosynthetic routes toward scalable kedarcidin production are now within reach. Moreover, with the rising popularity of antibody-drug conjugate therapies, toxicity liabilities may be mitigated through targeted delivery of this potent cytotoxin, potentially enabling efficient therapies that use minimal quantities of this complex material. The recent development of inotuzumab <b>ozogamicin,</b> a calicheamicin-based antibody-drug conjugate {{for the treatment of}} non-Hodgkin lymphoma, reinforces the potential of enediynes to find critical use in the treatment of human disease.

50|$|Oligonucleotides are a third {{category}} of big molecules. They are oligomers of nucleotides, {{which in turn}} are composed of a five-carbon sugar (either ribose or desoxyribose), a nitrogenous base (either a pyrimidine or a purine) and 1-3 phosphate groups. The best known representative of a nucleotide is the coenzyme ATP (=Adenosine triphosphate), MW 507.2. Oligonucleotides are chemically synthesized from protected phosphoramidites of natural or chemically modified nucleosides. The oligonucleotide chain assembly proceeds in the direction from 3’- to 5’-terminus by following a procedure {{referred to as a}} “synthetic cycle”. Completion of a single synthetic cycle results in the addition of one nucleotide residue to the growing chain. The maximum length of synthetic oligonucleotides hardly exceeds 200 nucleotide components. From its current range of applications in basic research, a.o. in drug target validation, drug discovery and therapeutic development, the potential use of oligonucleotides is foreseen in gene therapy (antisense drugs), disease prevention and agriculture. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) constitute a combination between small and big molecules. The small molecule parts, up to four different APIs, are highly potent cytotoxic drugs. They are linked with a monoclonal antibody, a big molecule which is of little or no therapeutic value in itself, but extremely discriminating for its targets, the cancer cells. The first commercialized ADCs were Isis’s Formivirisen and, more recently, Pfizer’s (formerly Wyeth) Mylotarg (gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin).</b> Examples of ADCs in phase III of development are Abbott’s / Isis’s Alicaforsen and Eli Lilly’s Aprinocarsen.|$|E

40|$|NEW MANIPULATIVE STRATEGIES EX VIVO FOR PURGING OF PHERIPHERAL HAEMATOPOIETICS STEM CELLS UNITS AIMED FOR AUTOLOGOUS BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION This thesis aims to {{evaluate}} {{the possibility of using}} the Gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> in ex vivo purging of autologous pheripheral blood mononuclear cells, in order to eliminate possible contaminants leukaemia cells. The use of this drug is subject to verification that the depletion of malignant cells does not cause cytotoxic effects on normal stem cells and normal multi-potential progenitors, which are in charge restocking stable and enduring new bone marrow.

40|$|Background: Gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> was {{the first}} example of antibody-directed {{chemotherapy}} in cancer, and was developed for acute myeloid leukaemia. However, randomised trials {{in which it was}} combined with standard induction chemotherapy in adults have produced conflicting results. We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data to assess the efficacy of adding gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> to induction chemotherapy in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Methods: We searched PubMed for reports of randomised controlled trials published in any language up to May 1, 2013, that included an assessment of gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> given to adults (aged 15 years and older) in conjunction with the first course of intensive induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (excluding acute promyelocytic leukaemia) compared with chemotherapy alone. Published data were supplemented with additional data obtained by contacting individual trialists. The primary endpoint of interest was overall survival. We used standard meta-analytic techniques, with an assumption-free (or fixed-effect) method. We also did exploratory stratified analyses to investigate whether any baseline features predicted a greater or lesser benefit from gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin.</b> Findings: We obtained data from five randomised controlled trials (3325 patients); all trials were centrally randomised and open label, with overall survival as the primary endpoint.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{results of}} the {{addition}} of gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin,</b> an anti-CD 33 antibody conjugate, to the standard treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in phase 3 trials were contradictory. We investigated whether the addition of low fractionated-dose gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> to standard front-line chemotherapy would improve the outcome of patients with this leukaemia without causing excessive toxicity. METHODS: In a phase 3, open-label study, undertaken in 26 haematology centres in France, patients aged 50 - 70 years with previously untreated de novo acute myeloid leukaemia were randomly assigned with a computer-generated sequence in a 1 : 1 ratio with block sizes of four to standard treatment (control group) with or without five doses of intravenous gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> (3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, and 7 during induction and day 1 {{of each of the}} two consolidation chemotherapy courses). The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). Secondary endpoints were relapse-free (RFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2007 - 002933 - 36. FINDINGS: 280 patients were randomly assigned to the control (n= 140) and gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> groups (n= 140), and 139 patients were analysed in each group. Complete response with or without incomplete platelet recovery to induction was 104 (75 %) in the control group and 113 (81 %) in the gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> group (odds ratio 1 * 46, 95 % CI 0 * 20 - 2 * 59; p= 0 * 25). At 2 years, EFS was estimated as 17 * 1 % (10 * 8 - 27 * 1) in the control group versus 40 * 8 % (32 * 8 - 50 * 8) in the gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> group (hazard ratio 0 * 58, 0 * 43 - 0 * 78; p= 0 * 0003), OS 41 * 9 % (33 * 1 - 53 * 1) versus 53 * 2 % (44 * 6 - 63 * 5), respectively (0 * 69, 0 * 49 - 0 * 98; p= 0 * 0368), and RFS 22 * 7 % (14 * 5 - 35 * 7) versus 50 * 3 % (41 * 0 - 61 * 6), respectively (0 * 52, 0 * 36 - 0 * 75; p= 0 * 0003). Haematological toxicity, particularly persistent thrombocytopenia, was more common in the gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> group than in the control group (22 [16 %] vs 4 [3 %]; p< 0 * 0001), without an increase in the risk of death from toxicity. INTERPRETATION: The use of fractionated lower doses of gemtuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> allows the safe delivery of higher cumulative doses and substantially improves outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.

40|$|PURPOSE Inotuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> (CMC- 544) is an antibody-targeted {{chemotherapy}} agent {{composed of}} a humanized anti-CD 22 antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, a potent cytotoxic agent. This was a phase I study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and preliminary efficacy of inotuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> in an expanded MTD cohort of patients with relapsed or refractory CD 22 (+) B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). PATIENTS AND METHODS Inotuzumab <b>ozogamicin</b> was administered intravenously as a single agent once every 3 or 4 weeks at doses ranging from 0. 4 to 2. 4 mg/m(2). Outcomes included MTD, safety, pharmacokinetics, response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival. Results Seventy-nine patients were enrolled. The MTD {{was determined to be}} 1. 8 mg/m(2). Common adverse events at the MTD were thrombocytopenia (90 %), asthenia (67 %), and nausea and neutropenia (51 % each). The objective response rate at the end of treatment was 39 % for the 79 enrolled patients, 68 % for all patients with follicular NHL treated at the MTD, and 15 % for all patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated at the MTD.
