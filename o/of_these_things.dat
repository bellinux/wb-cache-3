5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|It is {{wonderful}} that both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> occurred under Valerian; {{and it is}} the more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never meant {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense the speaker is attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|In some respects, however, Southey {{was ahead}} of his time in his views on social reform. For example, he was an early critic of the evils which the new factory system brought to early 19th-century Britain. He was appalled by the {{conditions}} of life in towns like Birmingham and Manchester, and especially by the employment of children in factories, and was outspoken in his criticism <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> He sympathised with the pioneering socialist plans of Robert Owen, advocated that the state promote public works to maintain high employment and called for universal education.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{majority}} of the inhabitants being of peasantry stock, the Sasanian economy relied on farming and agriculture, Khuzestan and Iraq being the most important provinces for it. The Nahravan Canal {{is one of the greatest}} examples of Sasanian irrigation systems, and many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> can still be found in Iran. The mountains of the Sasanian state was used on lumbering by the nomads of the region, and due to the great centralization of the Sasanians, they also managed to impose tax on the nomads and inhabitants of the mountains. During the reign of Khosrau I, further land was brought under centralization.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the {{conflict}} with Zionism helped to make Palestinian Arab society more conservative in cultural, social, religious and political affairs because people were highly motivated to preserve their distinct heritage and identity against the dual impact of British colonialism and Jewish innovation. Traditionally, the Arabs had an elite, but not a real leadership. Both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> changed {{over the course of}} the 1930s. During this period new political organizations and new types of activist began to appear, marking the involvement of a far broader cross-section of the population; in particular, nationalism, which had been long-rooted in rural society began to take hold in urban society.|$|E
25|$|To {{make things}} a little more interesting, each team, no matter what type of {{exchange}} they are doing, has to perform their exchange in the distance of two pits. The action of slowing {{is not part of}} the exchange, but the first rider is not allowed to begin getting off the bike until one pit ahead of their team's and the second rider must have complete control of the bike by the end of the team's pit. For bike-to-bike exchanges, the second person CANNOT move until tagged by the first person and the first person MUST stop before end of her team's pit. Failure to do either <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> will result in a penalty for the team.|$|E
25|$|When Jefferson {{retired in}} 1809 he had {{accumulated}} many possessions while in Washington, {{which included a}} huge collection of books.

Jefferson summoned Bacon to come to Washington with two servants to help him pack, load and supervise the transport <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> back to Monticello. Together they loaded about thirty crates which would {{be sent back to}} Monticello by water. The remaining items were loaded into three wagons which Bacon brought up from Monticello and along with the servants drove them back to Jefferson's estate, departing Washington on March ninth or tenth. Jefferson followed him on Saturday, the eleventh. Bacon later recalled the event in his memoirs.|$|E
