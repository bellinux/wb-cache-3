The list was compiled based upon unranked selection undertaken exclusively by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>print</b> and broadcast media who regularly cover the NBA. Teams were chosen from among all single-season individual teams. Each team won the NBA championship, and they combined to average 66 wins per season. The 1995–96 Chicago Bulls had the best single-season record in NBA history with 72 wins.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{domination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>print</b> industry, other businesses were also established on Fleet Street. The Automobile Association was established at No.18 Fleet Street in 1905.

For example, The Inns of Court and barristers' chambers are down alleys and around courtyards off Fleet Street itself {{and many of the}} old newspaper offices have become the London headquarters for various companies; e.g. Goldman Sachs is in the old Daily Telegraph and Liverpool Echo buildings of Peterborough Court and Mersey House.|$|E

5|$|The block {{passed into}} the hands of the Amsterdam printer and {{cartographer}} Willem Janssen (also called Willem Blaeu amongst other names). By this time the block was very damaged; the border lines were chipped, there were numerous woodworm holes and a pronounced crack had developed through the rhino's legs. Janssen decided to re-issue the block with the addition of a new tone block printed in a variety of colours, olive-green and dark green, as well as blue-grey. The resulting chiaroscuro woodcut, which entirely omitted the text, was published after 1620. There is an example in the British Museum.

5|$|By 1830, {{because of}} {{difficult}} economic conditions in Britain that reduced {{the demand for}} fossils, coupled with long gaps between major finds, Anning was having financial problems again. Her friend the geologist Henry De la Beche assisted her by commissioning Georg Scharf to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche's watercolour painting, Duria Antiquior, portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was largely based on fossils Anning had found. De la Beche sold copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>print</b> to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to her. It became the first such scene from what later became known as deep time to be widely circulated. In December 1830 she finally made another major find, a skeleton of {{a new type of}} plesiosaur, which sold for £200.|$|E

5|$|In 1986 News International owner Rupert Murdoch caused {{controversy}} when {{he moved}} publication of The Times and The Sun away from Fleet Street to new premises in Wapping, East London. Murdoch believed {{it was impossible to}} produce a newspaper profitably on Fleet Street and the power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>print</b> unions, the National Graphical Association (NGA) and the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT), was too strong (an opinion endorsed by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher). All Fleet Street print staff were sacked and new staff from the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union were brought in to operate the presses at Wapping using modern computer-operated technology, rendering the power of the old unions obsolete. The resulting Wapping dispute featured violent protests at Fleet Street and Wapping that lasted over a year, but ultimately other publishers followed suit and moved out of Fleet Street towards Canary Wharf or Southwark. Reuters was the last major news outlet to leave Fleet Street in 2005. The same year, The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph announced they were returning to the centre of London from Canary Wharf to new premises in Victoria in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Many {{circumstances}} surrounding the film—including its unusual budget, length, and production time, {{as well as its}} similarities to the 1901 New York attraction—indicate that Méliès was especially keen to release the film in the United States. Because of rampant film piracy, Méliès never received most of the profits of the popular film. One account reports that Méliès sold a print of the film to the Paris photographer Charles Gerschel for use in an Algiers theatre, under strict stipulation that the print only be shown in Algeria. Gerschel sold the print, and various other Méliès films, to the Edison Manufacturing Company employee Alfred C. Abadie, who sent them directly to Edison's laboratories to be duplicated and sold by Vitagraph. Copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>print</b> spread to other firms, and by 1904 Siegmund Lubin, the Selig Polyscope Company, and Edison were all redistributing it. Edison's print of the film was even offered in a hand-colored version available at a higher price, just as Méliès had done. Méliès was often uncredited altogether; {{for the first six months}} of the film's distribution, the only American exhibitor to credit Méliès in advertisements for the film was Thomas Lincoln Tally, who chose the film as the inaugural presentation of his Electric Theater.|$|E

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biggest {{challenges}} in mass printing is repeatability and stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ink transfer from <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate onto <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> substrate. <b>The</b> pad <b>printing</b> is characterised by indirect ink transfer from a gravure printing plate. Beside area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements, on <b>the</b> pad <b>printing</b> plate one should {{take into account}} their depth {{as it is a}} factor which directly influences <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> ink quantity, i. e. overall quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>printed</b> product. <b>The</b> photopolymer pad <b>printing</b> plate production includes two exposures with UV irradiation, first to make difference between printing and nonprinting areas and second to form partitions (walls) in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements. <b>The</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second exposure directly influences <b>the</b> final depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this paper is to determine influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second exposure on <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> elements, consequently on <b>the</b> reproduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pad <b>printing</b> plate elements. For this purpose four pad printing plate samples with various coverage tone value fields will be made by variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second exposure duration.

40|$|Flexography is a {{printing}} technique {{widely used in}} the packaging production. <b>The</b> main feature <b>of</b> flexography is <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a <b>printing</b> plate elastically deformed during the reproduction process. <b>The</b> <b>printing</b> plate is made of an elastic material, rubber or nowadays of mainly different types <b>of</b> photopolymer. <b>The</b> elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate enables <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> {{on a wide range}} of printing substrates, which is one of its advantages compared to other <b>printing</b> techniques. On <b>the</b> other hand, deformations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> process caused by the pressure between <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate and <b>the</b> substrate present a major limitation of flexography. Apart from <b>the</b> functional properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate in <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> process, <b>the</b> plate making process, including photo polymerization, considerably influences <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> halftones on <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate, and consequently on the final product. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this paper is to examine <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> screen ruling on <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> elements and <b>the</b> adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate making process in order to achieve optimal quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>printing</b> plate and, therefore, the final product.
