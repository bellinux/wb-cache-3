5|$|Gair is from Takapuna on the North Island of New Zealand, but she {{now lives}} in both Los Angeles and New York City. Her father is Hon. George Gair, a former New Zealand politician, and her nephew Alastair Gair is a {{competitive}} Etchells racer. Her father was a long-time Member of the Parliament of New Zealand (1966–1990) and later Mayor of North Shore City (1995–1998). Her mother is Fay Gair, and her elder sister Linda Gair served both as a model and as a painting assistant in several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> in her first book. Linda also has a daughter named Lauren. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> for which Linda assisted was the cover of Paint A 'Licious. Gair also has an older brother named Warwick.|$|E
5|$|In some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> of Henry Hudson, Young Sen – a Chinese {{scientific}} prodigy who {{has been}} offered an unconditional place at King's to read medicine – is depicted in his biographical painting series, showing {{the rise and fall}} of the protagonist.|$|E
5|$|The central, larger, scene {{shows the}} Great Flood. The Ark in which Noah's family escaped floats {{at the rear}} of the picture while the rest of {{humanity}} tries frantically to scramble to some point of safety. This picture, which has a large number of figures, conforms the most closely to the format <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> that had been done around the walls.|$|E
50|$|As most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting’s</b> {{inscriptions}} {{were not}} {{transported to the}} ROM from China and the Xinghua si monastery fell to ruins in 1938, {{it is impossible to}} get a full record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting’s</b> background information. Both White and Bachlofer made assumptions in their findings and as such, neither has been able to make a full claim on <b>the</b> <b>painting’s</b> date. As such, <b>The</b> Paradise <b>of</b> Maitreya remains <b>the</b> most controversial painting from the Yuan dynasty.|$|R
50|$|As reproductions became popular, so did {{the notion}} that it {{contained}} a hidden figure. Discussions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting's</b> intended meaning often used this notion to support their interpretations.|$|R
2500|$|Miguel Falomir, heading <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Italian Renaissance Painting at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discovery, {{stated the}} Prado [...] "had no idea <b>of</b> (<b>the</b> <b>painting's)</b> significance" [...] until a recent restoration.|$|R
5|$|As {{the morning}} progressed {{and the light}} changed he would switch to {{sequentially}} later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting a slightly different aspect of light. The process would be repeated {{over the course of}} days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus and 26 others {{taken in}} the 1800 {{invasion}} were subsequently restored to the King of Bavaria in 1815. Five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> in William IV's original set of eight – including The Battle of Alexander at Issus – later passed from the royal collection to the Alte Pinakothek art museum in Munich, Germany, where they remain; the other three are in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm, having been looted by the Swedish army in the Thirty Years War of 1618–1648. Susannah and the Elders is the only other work by Altdorfer in the Alte Pinakothek.|$|E
5|$|The Peasant Wedding (1567) and The Peasant Dance (1569) {{are also}} by Bruegel which {{share the same}} wedding theme and {{elements}} and were painted {{in the same period}} in Bruegel's later years. They are considered to be a trilogy of works by Bruegel. In all three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings,</b> there are pipers playing the pijpzak (bagpipes), they also exude pride and vanity, for example in The Peasant Dance the man seated next to the pijpzak player is wearing a peacock feather in his hat.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} widely reproduced, seen across Canada in schools and public institutions. In 1967, a stamp featuring The Jack Pine was released to coincide with <b>the</b> fiftieth anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting's</b> creation and Thomson's death.|$|R
2500|$|In Chinese night <b>paintings,</b> <b>the</b> moon often symbolizes {{loneliness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting's</b> character. It also {{sets the}} mood for a romantic setting. Chinese paintings also depict mythological characters who symbolize moonlight activity, such as Yue-Laou, the [...] "old man <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moonlight" [...] and Chang'e, <b>the</b> Chinese goddess <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon.|$|R

5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} {{pieces were}} stolen {{at an estimated}} loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings,</b> The Concert, was Gardner's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It {{is thought to be}} the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting, with a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, is Rembrandt's only known seascape. The bronze finial was taken from the top of a Napoleonic flag, possibly appearing like gold to the thieves. The museum is offering a $100,000 reward for this piece alone.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the rich ornamentation of the main building, the galleries in the Sainsbury Wing are pared-down and intimate, to suit the smaller scale of many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings.</b> The main inspirations for these rooms are Sir John Soane's toplit galleries for the Dulwich Picture Gallery and the church interiors of Filippo Brunelleschi (the stone dressing is in pietra serena, the grey stone local to Florence). The northernmost galleries align with Barry's central axis, {{so that there is}} a single vista down the whole length of the Gallery. This axis is exaggerated by the use of false perspective, as the columns flanking each opening gradually diminish in size until the visitor reaches the focal point (as of 2009), an altarpiece by Cima of The Incredulity of St Thomas. Venturi's postmodernist approach to architecture is in full evidence at the Sainsbury Wing, with its stylistic quotations from buildings as disparate as the clubhouses on Pall Mall, the Scala Regia in the Vatican, Victorian warehouses and Ancient Egyptian temples.|$|E
5|$|On {{display in}} the house is an {{important}} collection of fine art and antiquities built up by many generations of the Bankes family, the core having been assembled by Sir Ralph Bankes in Gray's Inn before the house was built. One of the rooms, the Spanish room (named by reason <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo which hang there), has walls hung with gilded leather. It was recently restored at a cost of several hundred thousand pounds over a five-year period. Other important collections include paintings of the Bankes family stretching back over 400 years. Other artworks include works by Diego Velázquez, Anthony van Dyck, Titian and Jan Brueghel the Younger. A portrait of Nicolò Zen the younger by Titian was discovered in the collection in 2008.|$|E
5|$|During the restoration, it was {{discovered}} that a long-standing ascription <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting's</b> date to 1883 was <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a misinterpretation: <b>the</b> artist's original inscription of 1885 was painted in a fugitive red-lake pigment that had faded, and was mistakenly repainted by a conservator to the earlier date.|$|R
2500|$|A New York Times {{art critic}} wrote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting's</b> [...] "harmony <b>of</b> design": [...] "what seems, at first, a chaos of chords or colors {{gradually}} rises upon the enchanted mind {{a rich and}} orderly creation, full of familiar objects, yet wholly new in its combinations and its significance." ...|$|R
50|$|Hildegard Hammerschmidt-Hummel {{wrote that}} the Cobbe {{portrait}} was not an authentic likeness of Shakespeare. She noted <b>the</b> opinion <b>of</b> Eberhard J. Nikitsch, a specialist in inscriptions, who said that <b>the</b> script <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting's</b> inscription was not commonly used in early 17th-century portraits, and {{that it must have}} been added later.|$|R
5|$|Paintings {{and other}} {{precious}} objects served an important {{aid in the}} religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces {{as a means to}} guarantee salvation in the afterlife. Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> were based on Byzantine prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the Cambrai Madonna is probably the best known. In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{engravings}} are mirror images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> (since the engraved {{plates are}} copied from the paintings {{the image is}} reversed when printed), which leads to problems ascertaining the times shown on the clocks {{in some of the}} scenes. The images are sometimes seen as parodies of middle class life in London at the time, but the moral judgements are not as harsh as in some of Hogarth's other works and the lower classes do not escape ridicule either. Often the theme is one of over-orderliness versus chaos. The four plates depict four times of day, but they also move through the seasons: Morning is set in winter, Noon in spring, and Evening in summer. However, Night—sometimes misidentified as being in September—takes place on Oak Apple Day in May rather than in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|The temple shrine {{was built}} on a final {{platform}} {{on top of the}} fourth tier. The exposed remains of the shrine date to the reign of Oxlahuh-Tz'i'. It had a triple doorway divided by columns and was built from adobe covered with plaster, the columns and walls on eithers side of the doorways were painted with decorations, traces of red, yellow and blue were found by archaeologists, these colours were applied to designs marked out onto a thin cap of clay with a pointed instrument. The quality of the work was very fine and indicated execution by a specialised artist. There were ten painted figures {{on the front of the}} building with further murals on the back. The designs consist of two rows of discs on top of a row of vertical stripes with figures painted against the striped background with the discs above them. The painted figures are performing various actions, one of which is tongue piercing, and they probably represent a Kaqchikel ritual in progress. The painted murals are very poorly preserved due to deterioration caused by damp combined with damage caused by tree roots. The style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> is very similar to that of Postclassic Mixtec art. Exposed parts of the middle phase of construction were damaged and the second phase was covered by the final construction phase, which was badly damaged by the stonework being stripped away for building the nearby town of Tecpán.|$|E

In <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> travel guides, <b>the</b> booklets provided a tour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting's</b> varied topography. An excerpt from Noble reads: ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{characteristic}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pundareekapuram <b>paintings</b> and Kerala murals {{in general}} are the boldness and accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lines which give a unique force to <b>the</b> <b>paintings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Davidovich began exhibiting his {{paintings}} in 1956 in Argentina, Brazil, and the United States. Interested {{in space and}} texture, he experimented with <b>the</b> boundaries <b>of</b> visual artworks first by dissolving <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting's</b> frame by affixing canvas to walls and then by installing works directly on walls, floors, stairways, and sidewalks.|$|R
25|$|Wall {{paintings}} {{inside the}} prayer {{halls of the}} temple have been mostly white washed. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> still discernible on the south-west column of the northern devotional hall have been restored by the Department of Archaeology of Myanmar. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> seen in good condition are: {{on the walls and}} ceiling of the eastern devotional hall; the pictures of re-appeared Buddha, north of the statue of standing Buddhas, Arahats and lotus flowers; and floral designs on the western entrance.|$|E

25|$|On {{the weekend}} of 21–22 March 2009, a then {{unidentified}} person placed nude portraits of the Taoiseach in the National Gallery of Ireland and the gallery of the Royal Hibernian Academy. The artist anonymously emailed the show, claiming responsibility for the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings,</b> but not their hanging. Gardaí subsequently raided the Today FM studios and producer Will Hanafin was asked {{to hand over the}} emails claiming that the placing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> constituted indecency, incitement and criminal damage.

40|$|Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang {{are famous}} for its {{profound}} content and perfect art in the world. But various kinds of damage coming from mankind or nature brings Mogao Grottoes a lot of disease, which makes this large-scale historical cultural heritage in the world degraded and damaged constantly. It is very urgent to find out all kinds of measures to protect it. The processes to restore 3 D information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mural <b>paintings</b> by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digital close-range photogrammetry and computer-based image processing technology were expounded in this paper in order to digitally preserve <b>the</b> mural <b>paintings</b> in <b>the</b> original style. The uniform coordinate system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grottoes was set up, and <b>the</b> mural <b>paintings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grottoes were close-range photogrammetried, furthermore, the films obtained from the close-range photogrammetry were scanned as digital images by a higher resolution scanner. The assistant spatial coordinate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mural <b>paintings</b> in <b>the</b> each wall was then {{set up by the}} coordinate transformation. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> this, by means of model orientation, kernel line resampling, image matching, <b>the</b> orthoimages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mural <b>paintings</b> were created and the 3 D information was restored finally. <b>The</b> processing results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mural <b>paintings</b> showed that <b>the</b> residual error <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absolute orientation <b>of</b> all control points reached the millimeter accuracy level, and that <b>the</b> middle error <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digital surface model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mural <b>paintings.</b> That is, <b>the</b> geometric correction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> images data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mural <b>paintings</b> reached <b>the</b> millimeter accuracy level. It indicated that the 3 D information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mural <b>paintings</b> could be accurately restored by the close-range photogrammetry and computer-based image processing technology in order to protect and digitally restore <b>the</b> mural <b>paintings</b> and statues of Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang forever. At the same time, it provided for us a new method and thought for relics protection, and new measures for the ancient costly relics protection, restoration and research. 1...|$|R
