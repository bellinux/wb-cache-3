5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like <b>ochronosis.</b> A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.|$|E
5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous <b>ochronosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Metabolic diseases, such as renal osteodystrophy, produce widening, while <b>ochronosis</b> {{results in}} calcific {{deposits}} in the symphysis. Inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis, result in bony fusion of the symphysis. Osteitis pubis, {{the most common}} inflammatory disease in this area, is treated with anti-inflammatory medication and rest. Degenerative joint disease of the symphysis, which can cause groin pain, results from instability or from abnormal pelvic mechanics.|$|E

50|$|Hydroquinone-induced {{exogenous}} <b>ochronosis</b> is an avoidable dermatosis that {{is exceedingly}} difficult to treat.However, some {{studies show that}} treatment may be possible with a Q-switched alexandrite (755 nm) laser.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of ochronosis: {{endogenous}} and exogenous. The endogenous variety is an autosomal recessive disease, that is caused by a lack of homogentisate oxidase enzyme.Exogenous <b>ochronosis</b> is an avoidable dermatitis, that can be caused by the topical application of compounds such as hydroquinone or phenols.It was first seen in 1912, when a patient who used phenol on a leg ulcer was found by Beddard and Plumtre to have this condition.Hydroquinone-induced exogenous <b>ochronosis</b> was found in 1975 by Findlay, who observed the condition in patients who used skin lightening creams containing the compound.|$|E
50|$|Research done using alkaptonuric mice {{has shown}} that mice treated with nitisinone {{experience}} no <b>ochronosis</b> in knee joint cartilage. In contrast, all of the mice in the untreated control group developed ochronotic knee joints.|$|E
50|$|Research collaborations {{by several}} {{national}} centres {{have been established}} to find a more definitive treatment for alkaptonuria. This has included studies {{on the use of}} nitisinone and investigations into antioxidants to inhibit <b>ochronosis.</b> The ideal treatment would replace HGD enzyme function without accumulating other substances.|$|E
5000|$|Cartilage: Darkening and {{hardening}} of ear cartilage is {{a prominent}} feature of <b>ochronosis.</b> Nasal cartilage is also frequently involved.

The intravertebral cartilage is also more prone to herniation.|$|E
5000|$|Hydroquinone is the {{compound}} {{most frequently used}} in skin whitening products. Due to concerns about its side effects, it was almost banned by the FDA in 2006, as there were medical issues of carcinogenicity and reports of disfiguring <b>ochronosis.</b> [...] In the European Union hydroquinone has been banned in cosmetic creams since 2000.|$|E
50|$|Alkaptonuria {{was one of}} {{the four}} {{diseases}} described by Sir Archibald Edward Garrod, as being the result of the accumulation of intermediates due to metabolic deficiencies. He linked <b>ochronosis</b> with the accumulation of alkaptans in 1902, and his views on the subject, including its mode of heritance, were summarized in a 1908 Croonian Lecture at the Royal College of Physicians.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that treatment with nitisinone can reduce urinary levels of homogentisic acid in alkaptonuria patients by 95%. A series of clinical trials run by DevelopAKUre to determine whether nitisinone is effective at treating the <b>ochronosis</b> suffered by patients with alkaptonuria are ongoing. If the trials are successful, DevelopAKUre {{will try to get}} nitisinone licensed for use by alkaptonuria patients.|$|E
50|$|The homogentisic acid is {{converted}} to the related substance benzoquinone acetic acid (BQA) which forms polymers that resemble the skin pigment melanin. These are deposited in the collagen, a connective tissue protein, of particular tissues such as cartilage. This process is called <b>ochronosis</b> (as the tissue looks ochre); ochronotic tissue is stiffened and unusually brittle, impairing its normal function and causing damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ochronosis</b> {{occurs because}} of {{deposition}} of phenols (such as homogentisic acid and hydroquinone) as plaques in the matrix of cartilage. The pigments {{can also be}} incorporated into collagen and elastin fibers. In the skin, the pigment alters {{the structure of the}} fibers causing enlargement and curling.The embedded pigments also form cross-linkages with pigment depositions in adjacent fibers, stabilizing and reducing the elastic recoil of the fibers. This results in hardening of elastic structures increasing their rigidity and brittleness. Once ruptured, the exposed pigments cause a foreign body reaction and inflammation. This pigment deposition also invokes deposition of hydroxyapatite, the mineral responsible for bone calcification, further hardening the connective tissue.The pigment can also be excreted by glandular cells in apocrine and ceruminous sweat glands as well as breast and prostate tissue. This results in darkly pigmented sweat and breast milk. Excretion of the pigment is only found in endogenous <b>ochronosis</b> and should not occur from topical phenols.|$|E

5000|$|Alkaptonuria {{is caused}} when an enzyme called homogentisic dioxygenase (HGD) is faulty so can't break down homogentisic acid (HGA). Alkaptonuria {{patients}} treated with nitisinone produce far less HGA than those not treated (95% {{less in the}} urine), [...] because nitisinone inhibits HPPD meaning HGA doesn't form in the first place. Clinical trials are ongoing to test whether nitisinone could prevent the <b>ochronosis</b> experienced by older alkaptonuria patients.|$|E
5000|$|The process {{performed}} with creams containing hydroquinone is banned in some countries, {{such as the}} member states of the EU. [...] In 2006, the FDA removed previous advice that stated hydroquinone was considered generally safe, as hydroquinone {{has been linked to}} <b>ochronosis,</b> where skin becomes permanently discoloured and disfigured, and because it may also be a carcinogen. [...] However, its use is not banned in the US and it is still in use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ochronosis</b> is a {{syndrome}} {{caused by}} the accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues. It was first described by Rudolf Virchow in 1865. The condition was named after the yellowish (ocher-like) discoloration of the tissue seen on microscopic examination. However, macroscopically the affected tissues appear bluish grey because of a light-scattering phenomenon known as the Tyndall effect. The condition is most often associated with alkaptonuria but can occur from exogenous administration of phenol complexes like hydroquinone.|$|E
50|$|No {{treatment}} modality has been unequivocally demonstrated {{to reduce the}} complications of alkaptonuria. Main treatment attempts have focused on preventing <b>ochronosis</b> through the reduction of accumulating homogentisic acid. Such commonly recommended treatments include large doses of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or dietary restriction of amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. However, vitamin C treatment has not shown to be effective, and protein restriction (which {{can be difficult to}} adhere to) has not shown to be effective in clinical studies.|$|E
5000|$|Skin: The pigment is {{deposited}} {{throughout the}} skin but only becomes apparent in certain locations where the concentration is great {{enough to be}} seen clinically. This usually occurs in areas where connective tissue is thick (joints, tympanic membrane) or {{close to the surface}} of the skin (thenar and hypothenar eminences and the sides of the fingers). In exogenous <b>ochronosis,</b> the hyperpigmentation is localized to the area where the inciting agent is applied. Intradermal nevi can appear like blue nevi.|$|E
50|$|Virchow {{discovered}} the clinical syndrome {{which he called}} <b>ochronosis,</b> a metabolic disorder in which a patient accumulates homogentisic acid in connective tissues and which is indicated by discolouration under the microscope. He found the unusual symptom from an autopsy of the corpse of a 67-year-old man on 8 May 1884. This {{was the first time}} this abnormal disease affecting cartilage and connective tissue was observed and analysed. His description and coining of the name appeared in the October 1866 issue of Vichows Archiv.|$|E
5000|$|Exogenous <b>ochronosis</b> can {{be caused}} from {{long-term}} usage of certain [...] "skin lightening" [...] products, even if the hydroquinone is in amounts as small as 2%.Skin lightening products are still prevalent {{in many parts of}} the world. This may be due to aesthetic or social standing reasons, in areas where a lighter skin tone is considered to be a sign of wealth or beauty.As well, skin-lightening creams containing compounds such as hydroquinone are commonly used to help with hyperpigmentation disorders such as melasma.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that hydroquinone can cause exogenous <b>ochronosis,</b> a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin, if taken orally; however, skin preparations containing the ingredient are administered topically. The FDA has classified hydroquinone in 2006 as a safe product - {{generally recognized as safe}} and effective (GRASE), however additional studies under the National Toxicology Program (NTP) were suggested in order to determine whether there is a risk to humans from the use of hydroquinone. NTP evaluation showed some evidence of long-term carcinogenic and genotoxic effects ...|$|E
50|$|Apart from {{treatment}} of the complications (such as pain relief and joint replacement for the cartilage damage), vitamin C {{has been used to}} reduce the <b>ochronosis</b> and lowering of the homogentisic acid levels may be attempted with a low-protein diet. It is not proven that Vitamin C works and has been since discredited. Recently the drug nitisinone has been found to suppress homogentisic acid production, and research is ongoing as to whether it can improve symptoms. Alkaptonuria is a rare disease; it occurs in one in 250,000 people, but is more common in Slovakia and the Dominican Republic.|$|E
50|$|Virchow was {{the first}} to {{precisely}} describe and give names of diseases such as leukemia, chordoma, <b>ochronosis,</b> embolism, and thrombosis. He coined scientific terms, chromatin, agenesis, parenchyma, osteoid, amyloid degeneration, and spina bifida. His description of the transmission cycle of a roundworm Trichinella spiralis established the importance of meat inspection, which was started in Berlin. He developed the first systematic method of autopsy involving surgery of all body parts and microscopic examination. A number of medical terms are named after him, including Virchow's node, Virchow-Robin spaces, Virchow-Seckel syndrome, and Virchow's triad. He {{was the first}} to use hair analysis in criminal investigation, and recognised its limitations. His laborious analyses of the hair, skin, and eye colour of school children made him criticise the Aryan race concept as a myth.|$|E

5000|$|Alkaptonuria (black urine disease, black bone disease, or alcaptonuria) {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} {{genetic disorder}} in which the body cannot process the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, which occur in protein. It {{is caused by a}} mutation in the HGD gene for the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (...) if a person inherits abnormal copies from each parent (it is a recessive condition) the body accumulates an intermediate substance called homogentisic acid in the blood and tissues. Homogentisic acid and its oxidized form alkapton are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid causes damage to cartilage (<b>ochronosis,</b> leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. Symptoms usually develop in people over thirty years old, although the dark discoloration of the urine is present from birth.|$|E
