5|$|Benn's mother, Margaret Wedgwood Benn (née Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, {{feminist and}} the founder President of the Congregational Federation. She {{was a member of}} the League of the Church Militant, which was the {{predecessor}} of the Movement for the Ordination of Women; in 1925, she was rebuked by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> His mother's theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she taught him that the stories in the Bible were based around the struggle between the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught righteousness.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E

5|$|Worship at St James' is {{in a style}} {{commonly}} found in the High Church and moderate Anglo-Catholic traditions of Anglicanism. It maintains the traditions of Anglican church music, with a robed choir singing psalms, anthems and responses {{in contrast to the}} great majority of churches in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney where services are generally celebrated in styles associated with Low Church and Evangelical Christian practices. The teaching at St James' has a more liberal perspective than most churches in the diocese on issues of gender and the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1925 General Assembly {{faced the}} threat of schism over {{the actions of the}} Presbytery of New York. Attempting to deescalate the situation, General Assembly {{moderator}} Charles Erdman proposed the creation of a special commission to study the church's problems and find solutions. The commission's report, released in 1926, sought to find a moderate approach to solving the church's theological conflict. In agreement with the Auburn Affirmation, the commission concluded that doctrinal pronouncements issued by the General Assembly were not binding without the approval of a majority of the presbyteries. In a defeat for conservatives, the report was adopted by the General Assembly. Conservatives were further disenchanted in 1929 when the General Assembly approved the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> as lay elders.|$|E

25|$|Various Catholics {{have written}} in favor <b>of</b> ordaining <b>women.</b> Dissenting groups advocating women's {{ordination}} {{in opposition to}} Catholic teaching include Women's Ordination Worldwide, Catholic Women's Ordination, Roman Catholic Womenpriests, and Women's Ordination Conference. Some cite the alleged <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> Ludmila Javorová in Communist Czechoslovakia in 1970 by Bishop Felix Davídek (1921–88), himself clandestinely consecrated due to the shortage of priests caused by state persecution, as precedent. The Catholic Church treats attempted <b>ordinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> as invalid, and automatically excommunicates all participants.|$|R
5000|$|Ochoa {{considers}} the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> priests to be a moot point due to papal opposition; {{he believes that}} homosexuals should remain celibate in accordance with Church doctrine requiring all unmarried people to remain celibate; {{he believes that the}} priest shortage will be solved through faith rather than through allowing a married priesthood; and fears that teaching children about condoms in a school setting would send a [...] "mixed message" [...] regarding pre-marital sex.|$|R

A former relation of full communion with the Polish National Catholic Church (once {{a part of the}} Union of Utrecht) was broken off by the PNCC in 1976 over the <b>ordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E
50|$|After 1870 several German-speaking Catholics {{left the}} Catholic Church {{in light of}} the First Vatican Council. Many aligned {{themselves}} with the independent Bishop of Utrecht, who ordained clergy among them to form the Old Catholic Churches. Though it is not in communion, the Catholic Church recognizes as valid the Old Catholic holy orders and apostolic succession, however does not recognize their <b>ordinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> to the priesthood begun in the 1970s. The Old Catholic Churches consider themselves to be in full communion with the Anglican Communion.|$|R
