5|$|Teeuw {{wrote that}} the moral {{messages}} and sentimentality in Sitti Nurbaya are <b>overdone,</b> similar to Azab dan Sengsara. However, he considers the plot of Sitti Nurbaya more interesting for a reader from a Western background than the older novel.|$|E
5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not <b>overdone,</b> yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|Beef steaks are {{commonly}} grilled, broiled or occasionally fried. Grilled beef steaks can be cooked at different temperatures, or for different lengths of time; the resulting cooked steak ranges from blue (very rare) to <b>overdone.</b> The most common {{characteristics of a}} rare steak is a soft, cold, red center. The outside is seared for flavor, while the inside is cooked to suit the diner's preference. Steaks cooked well-done are typically cooked throughout the entire cut of meat. For example, a beefsteak cooked well-done will not have any pinkness in the middle when sliced. Uncooked beef steak can be served raw, such as in steak tartare.|$|E
5|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based daily Suara Merdeka, found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray {{tolerance}} in Indonesia without making the subject seem cliché; however, he considered some scenes, such as Hendra's conversion, <b>overdone.</b> Frans Sartono, reviewing for the historically Catholic daily Kompas, considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately interesting, because its social commentary was much needed, considering Indonesia's religious turmoil. He {{also noted that the}} characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion.|$|E
5|$|O'Hara {{played the}} love {{interest}} of Henry Fonda in the 1943 war picture Immortal Sergeant. O'Hara noted that Fonda was studying for his service entry exams {{at the time}} and had his head in books between takes, and that 20th Century Fox publicized one of the last love scenes between them in the film as Fonda's last screen kiss before entering the war. She next portrayed a European school teacher opposite George Sanders and Charles Laughton, in their last film together, in Jean Renoir's This Land Is Mine for RKO. At the end of a court case in the film, during a hearty speech by Laughton, O'Hara is shown teary-eyed on screen for a prolonged period. Malone thought her performance was effective, both crying and smiling, though considered Renoir to have <b>overdone</b> the film and confusing the audience as a result.|$|E
25|$|Paullus and Julia had a daughter, Aemilia Lepida and {{possibly}} a son, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (although the latter {{may also have been}} the son to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 6). According to Suetonius, she built a large pretentious country house. Augustus disliked large <b>overdone</b> houses and had it demolished.|$|E
25|$|On leaving Portugal, he {{abandoned}} {{the use of}} rhyme as cramping freedom of thought and expression; nevertheless his highly polished verses are generally robust to hardness and <b>overdone</b> with archaisms. His translations from Latin, French and Italian, are accurate though harsh, and his renderings of Racine and the Fables of Lafontaine entirely lack the simplicity and grace of the originals. But Nascimento's blank verse translation of the Martyrs {{is in many ways}} superior to Chateaubriand's prose.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{earthquake}} sequences in the Wes Craven film New Nightmare were filmed a month prior to the Northridge quake. The real quake struck only weeks before filming was completed. Subsequently, a team was sent out to film footage of the quake-damaged areas of the city. The cast and crew had initially thought that the scenes that were filmed before the real quake struck were a bit <b>overdone,</b> but upon viewing the footage after {{the earthquake}}, they were reportedly startled by the realism of it.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the tour}} was less acrimonious than that made by England six years earlier, {{according}} to Wisden there were nevertheless still some contentious issues, notably those of slow over rates, excessive short-pitched bowling and throwing. England {{were the main}} culprits in wasting time; having won the second Test {{they set out to}} avoid defeat in the remaining three matches. Short-pitched bowling was <b>overdone,</b> especially by the West Indian fast bowlers Hall and Watson. Two bowlers playing regularly for West Indies in the Tests had actions that Wisden considered to be suspect.|$|E
25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very <b>overdone</b> and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E
25|$|Incubation {{takes about}} 16 days in Crypturellus, which {{contains}} the smallest species, and 19–20 days in Tinamus and Eudromia. During this period the male is typically silent; {{if he does}} call, he does so away from the nest. As he incubates, he will leave the nest to feed, and he may be gone from 45 minutes to five hours, covering the eggs when he leaves. While incubating, he is mainly motionless and reluctant to move, even from potential danger. It is possible for a human observer to approach and touch the incubating male without eliciting an overt response. Some species will flatten themselves against the ground, stretch out their necks, and raise {{their backs to the}} air. This posture causes them to resemble a plant; however, if it is <b>overdone,</b> the eggs become visible from behind.|$|E
25|$|If {{the muscular}} wall {{enlargement}} is <b>overdone</b> over time, then a gross {{enlargement of the}} artery results, usually over decades of living. This is a less common outcome. Atheroma within aneurysmal enlargement (vessel bulging) can also rupture and shower debris of atheroma and clot downstream. If the arterial enlargement continues to 2 to 3 times the usual diameter, the walls often become weak enough that with just {{the stress of the}} pulse, a loss of wall integrity may occur leading to sudden hemorrhage (bleeding), major symptoms and debility; often rapid death. The main stimulus for aneurysm formation is pressure atrophy of the structural support of the muscle layers. The main structural proteins are collagen and elastin. This causes thinning and the wall balloons allowing gross enlargement to occur, as is common in the abdominal region of the aorta.|$|E
500|$|She {{appeared}} in the HBO television movie sequel If These Walls Could Talk 2 (2000). Presented in three segments, it follows lesbian couples in different time periods. Williams and Chloë Sevigny {{appeared in}} the second segment, which revealed bitter divisions in the feminist movement during 1972. While Entertainment Weekly critic, Ken Tucker, praised Sevigny, he said Williams had <b>overdone</b> her character's [...] "grinning eagerness to be naughty".|$|E
500|$|In 1995, 123 [...] bronze maquettes of the {{sculpture}} on [...] granite bases were {{produced by the}} Rotblatt-Amranys and sold at $10,000 ($ in [...] dollars) each as a fundraiser for the James Jordan Boys & Girls Club. The TNT 2-hour broadcast of the original ceremony had also been in part a fundraiser for the Boys & Girls Club, but some had thought it was <b>overdone</b> and ungraceful.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti" [...] {{was directed by}} Simon Brand, and was premiered through Vevo on July 19, 2013. Amaris Castilloof of Latina summarized that Fernández and Aguilera [...] "appear {{to be in an}} abandoned mansion and overwhelmed with a tremendous desire for each other." [...] She provided a mixed review for the video, questioning if the [...] "glimpses of skin touching, scenes of someone swimming (we have no idea who) with luxurious pearls, and a cheesy telenovela-esque embrace" [...] were <b>overdone.</b>|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, who {{complained about the}} <b>overdone</b> fantasy imagery of the song, but complimented its composition. Other reviewers likened the composition and performance to the style of The Beatles. The track was a moderate success commercially, reaching the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Ireland and the top 20 in Germany, Spain and Switzerland. The music video of [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] combines live action and animation, portraying a little girl waking {{up in bed and}} interacting with fantasy characters. Madonna appears in the video only as an animated, Tinker Bell-type fairy.|$|E
500|$|American International Pictures {{completely}} changed the Roberto Nicolosi's soundtrack {{from the original}} film with a soundtrack from Les Baxter. Kim Newman described Baxter's score as [...] "inappropriate" [...] with [...] "each shock is accompanied by <b>overdone</b> 'scary music'". Both the Italian and English language films have a different look. Bava supervised the Italian language version at Technicolor Roma under his own supervision while American International Pictures shipped their version to Pathé Color for processing. Mario Bava biographer Tim Lucas described the English language print as looking [...] "warmer, but less nuanced, with flatter tonalities" [...] and that it [...] "doesn't look bad" [...] but that the Italian version [...] "looks more vibrant, more flamboyantly nightmarish".|$|E
500|$|Asked in a {{separate}} interview about the overall process of composing the music {{and how it is}} used in the episode, Djawadi revealed [...] "I sit with David and Dan and we do what's called a spotting session where we watch the entire episode and then discuss when music should start and stop. Everybody's very involved with that. And it constantly gets played with. What I love about Game of Thrones is that the positioning of the music is so well done, because it's not <b>overdone.</b> When the music cuts in, it really has something to say." [...] "Light of the Seven" [...] reached No. 1 on Billboard's Spotify Viral 50 chart on its release.|$|E
500|$|The {{setting of}} the manga was {{inspired}} by [...] "the darker, grislier side" [...] of the Victorian upper class and her admiration of films set in the Victorian time period. For Godchild, she traveled to London to do historical research and visited seven historical sites there. In the series, she refers to the Bible as well as real-life literary works, films and people. Reviewers have found a range of themes in the series. Critical reaction to The Cain Saga was mixed: some felt that the mysteries were well-done with detailed art, while others found the art crude and the short stories confusing and predictable. Reviewers praised Godchild as an <b>overdone,</b> entertaining series with detailed and distinct art.|$|E
500|$|Both {{managers}} {{approached the}} match {{with a view}} to win, in spite of the Shield's friendly feel. Arsenal manager George Graham opined [...] "Winning is a good habit, so why not start early?" [...] Graham lambasted those who found his team's playing style tedious: [...] "The criticism that we don't pass the ball and we don't have flair is <b>overdone.</b> We won two championships and in the second lost one game out of 38." [...] However, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said [...] "Winning means keeping your job, and it can be a delicate situation. But I tell myself I'm not going to fail in this game." [...] Ferguson spoke in glowing terms of new signing Roy Keane, a midfielder who gave United [...] "unbelievable options, a real edge to the squad".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{attained}} mixed receptions {{from television}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'C' grade, scoring lower than [...] "Road to the North Pole" [...] of Family Guy and [...] "For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls" [...] of American Dad. VanDerWerff {{felt that the}} episode was [...] "fairly lazy", and commented that the main plot was [...] "too much of a mob movie pastiche." [...] Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic criticized the humor of the episode, opining that [...] "for an episode with such an <b>overdone</b> story, we could have forgiven things if it were at least funnier." [...] He continued: [...] "Unfortunately, there just weren't enough jokes to make the episode worth it." [...] In conclusion of his review, Hochberger gave [...] "Donnie Fatso" [...] a 2.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E
500|$|Story editor René Echevarria was keen {{not to have}} {{a damaged}} holodeck story appear, as he felt it had been <b>overdone</b> in [...] It was {{specified}} in the information sheet sent to freelance writers that Deep Space Nine was not accepting stories involving malfunctioning holodecks. Producer Ira Steven Behr explained that the show had been looking for a unique holodeck story that would be specifically for Deep Space Nine rather than Sherlock Holmes and Dixon Hill detective stories seen in The Next Generation. Whilst Bashir and O'Brien's adventures in the holosuites in the Battle of Britain and the Battle of Clontarf have been mentioned in episodes, they were simply too expensive to be shown on screen effectively. But Behr felt that the story for [...] "Our Man Bashir" [...] was within the budget of the show.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{known in}} the past for having an {{intricate}} set of effects units, Lukather now says he plays mostly free of such modifications after seeing some <b>overdone</b> commercial unit configurations named after him. Other than some delay, he has not used many effects in recent years. He has held a long association with Bob Bradshaw of Custom Audio Electronics, who designed and manufactured key elements of Lukather's effects rack. Lukather {{was one of the few}} official endorsers of EMG pickups, having collaborated on his own Lukather signature [...] "SL20" [...] pickup system, which is a single unit incorporating two single coils and an EMG 85 humbucker. The system has a single volume and tone knob, and a pickguard. In December 2012, Lukather collaborated with DiMarzio pickups on a new set of signature pickups called [...] "Transition." [...] He has been using these pickups in his Music-Man Luke 3 guitar.|$|E
500|$|Season one's opening {{theme is}} [...] "Far from Any Road", an {{alternative}} country song originally composed by The Handsome Family for their 2003 album Singing Bones. The True Detective soundtrack features {{a compilation of}} gospel and blues music, which were selected by Pizzolatto and T Bone Burnett. The pair opposed the use of Cajun music and swamp blues for the season's musical score because they felt it was <b>overdone.</b> Burnett said the score {{was intended to be}} character-driven, rather than inspired by other crime fiction drama. Songs by Bo Diddley, Melvins, The Staple Singers, Grinderman, Vashti Bunyan, Townes Van Zandt, and Captain Beefheart appear in season one. Burnett also composed original pieces with Rhiannon Giddens, who used a Swarmatron synthesizer, and Cassandra Wilson. HBO released an abridged soundtrack album, featuring 14 tracks from True Detective first two seasons, on August 14, 2015 through physical media and iTunes.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Departures at the Academy Awards, critic Saburō Kawamoto found the film to show a Japan that the Japanese could relate to, in that, in a nation whose customs put great weight on visits to ancestral graves, a death was always a family affair. [...] He {{believed}} the film had a samurai beauty to it, with its many scenes of families sitting seiza. Critic [...] gave the film a 90% rating, and credited the performances of the two leads {{for much of the}} film's success. [...] He praised its emotional impact and its balance of seriousness and humour, but was more critical of the father–son relationship, which he considered <b>overdone.</b> [...] Maeda attributed the film's international success, despite its heavily Japanese content, to its clear depiction of Japanese views on life and death. He found the film's conceptual scale to have an affinity to that of Hollywood (something he considered lacking in most Japanese films).|$|E
500|$|However, critics {{had a more}} mixed response. In {{his book}} Delta Quadrant: The {{unofficial}} guide to Voyager, David McIntee found Chakotay's revelation and Lien's acting the only high points of the episode. Otherwise, he felt the [...] "sexual-politics statements" [...] were cheesy and <b>overdone,</b> and {{that all of the}} possible clichés of Kes' elogium (puberty, PMS, pregnancy, abortion, and menopause) were trodden upon and ill-used. [...] McIntee accused the plot of being dull and the acting as subpar; although he thought the plot was supposed to touch on teenage pregnancy, it instead emphasized that all women wish to be mothers, and all men are [...] "immature bastards." [...] He rated the episode 1 out of 10. Reviewers Lance Parkin and Mark Jones thought the episode was [...] "Voyager at its very worst", repeating fans' complaints that if Ocampan women only give birth once their population would eventually disappear as it would halve every generation.|$|E
500|$|Walton of The Moving Picture News {{said the}} film was, [...] "A bright, clean, human {{interest}} tale. It holds the attention {{from beginning to}} end. A thoroughly commendable reel - in every way." [...] The Moving Picture World offers {{a summary of the}} work and was more or less neutral in its review of the film. The reviewer states, [...] "It is a romantic picture, affording ample opportunity for the imagination to run riot {{in a number of different}} directions. ... Much of human nature is disclosed in this film, even though it is, in a way, a travesty upon the way wealthy girls often fall in love with stablemen or others employed about their fathers' places." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was not very critical, but not offering any praise either. The reviewer highlighted the [...] "common fault of actors" [...] by throwing things on the floor and how Ann's refusal to even look at the titled guest was <b>overdone.</b>|$|E
500|$|Gibson's {{writing was}} {{positively}} received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: [...] "ith a poet's touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics" [...] and Danvers wrote that [...] "no sentence has a subject {{if it can}} do without one". One critic found the prose to be as [...] "hard and compact as glacier ice" [...] and another that it [...] "gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity". Gibson's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and The Village Voices review remarked that [...] "Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the coffee-shop intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war". Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: As usual, Gibson's prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture: {{how it feels to}} be close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room, or to fret about someone spying on your browser's list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be [...] "awkward in its effort to appear [...] "cool"" [...] while other critics have found it <b>overdone</b> and feared it would quickly date the novel. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette review commented that the [...] "constant, unadulterated [...] "hipster-technocrat, cyber-MTV" [...] lingo [...] <b>overdone</b> and inappropriate" [...] On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson's use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that [...] "Gibson is no technologist, he's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson's metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book".|$|E
500|$|Ed Easton Jr. of WNOW-FM {{gave the}} video {{a rating of}} seven out of ten, writing that, [...] "there is plenty of choreographed dancing as Breezy shows us he still got it, getting {{everyone}} in the neighborhood to dance with him. The video {{is good for the}} most part, especially if you are a fan of dancing." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, [...] "it's genuinely a fun clip, absent of any <b>overdone,</b> sexed up R corniness." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator compared the video to Michael Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] (1987), and Janet Jackson's [...] "Alright" [...] (1990), concluding that [...] "sure, the 'Yeah 3x' clip is derivative. But at least Brown is making a serious effort to polish up his commercial appeal once again with both a feel-good, sing-along song and an equally sunny video." [...] Mariel Concepcion of Billboard magazine simply called it a [...] "kid-friendly clip". The video was nominated for Best Choreography at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Japan.|$|E
500|$|On the PlayStation 2, Soul Reaver 2 {{respectively}} {{received an}} aggregate score of 80.71% and 80/100 from rating websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Various reviewers held its storytelling, visuals and sound in high regard, but described its gameplay as dull and unsatisfying. Doug Perry of IGN praised the game's dark atmosphere and intriguing story, {{but said that}} it can become tiresome and drag on. He thought the [...] "haughtiness" [...] and drama of the dialogue, particularly between Raziel and Kain, was often <b>overdone,</b> and noted that its gameplay was near identical to that of its predecessor but with less replay value. Perry enjoyed the new puzzles involving the elemental powers of the Reaver for being more complex and diverse than the block puzzles of Soul Reaver, and praised the combat system. He gave the game a score of 9.0, but in his later review for Defiance, he revised his opinion, saying this rating was [...] "way too high" [...] and [...] "that game told a great story, but just didn't deserve that score".|$|E
500|$|... 11 overall {{received}} mixed, {{but mostly}} unflattering reviews from critics. Music reviewer Chris Jones from the BBC wrote generally positively about 11 in his review. He {{concluded that it}} was another strong album, even if Adams voice sounded dispassionate on some tracks. The Canadian website Jam! gave the album an average review. Reviewer Darryl Stedan found the lyrics clichéd, predictable and, while not criticising it, described it as an album [...] "that didn't really mean much." [...] Ryan Wasoba from the alternatively weekly magazine, Houston Press wrote favorably of the record in a backhanded way, commenting that 11's appeal laid in its [...] "inoffensiveness" [...] and [...] "digestibility". In another favorable review, Daily Mail writer Adrian Thrills said the album highlight was [...] "Oxygen", commenting on the similarities with the music of Bob Dylan. Amy O'Brian of The Vancouver Sun wrote favorably of the new album, {{while at the same}} time criticising it for its clichés, bad lyrics and for its too-familiar melodies, and concluded, [...] "It's cheesy and <b>overdone,</b> but the truth is that it just might give Adams his first hit in a decade." ...|$|E
500|$|AllMusic writer William Ruhlmann {{said that}} [...] "Linkin Park {{sounds like a}} Johnny-come-lately to an already <b>overdone</b> musical style" [...] and called [...] "One Step Closer" [...] "a typical effort", {{referring}} to the lyrics of the song's chorus. Johan Wippsson from Melodic praised Don Gilmore's production and described the albums as [...] "destructive and angry but always with a well controlled melodic feeling all over." [...] NMEs Noel Gardner commented that [...] "otherwise damn fine soaring emo-crunchers like 'With You' and 'A Place for My Head' are pointlessly jazzed up with tokenistic scratching," [...] giving the album a score of six out of ten. Tyler Fisher at Sputnikmusic gave the album a 3.0/5, saying [...] "Hybrid Theory stands as a defining mainstream album {{at the turn of}} the century, and for good reason.", but calling the guitar riffs [...] "often bland and unoriginal". Mike Ross of Jam! declares the albums as a combination of the best of hip hop and heavy metal. He goes on to state [...] "...they can actually rap. They can actually crank out a ferocious, head-banging groove. They can write introspective lyrics with intelligence. It adds up to one of the finest new rap metal bands I've ever heard." ...|$|E
500|$|Ivy {{appears as}} a tall, large busted woman with short, white hair. A bluish-purple leotard covers her torso and arms, with patches of the fabric removed to expose her cleavage, {{buttocks}} and various parts of her abdomen. Similar leggings cover her legs midway below her thighs, connected to the leotard by garters at golden metal bands at their peak. A sleeve of the same material covers her right arm and hand, while armor covers her left arm, hand, and shoulder. A smaller pauldron covers her right shoulder, while high heels cover her feet, and a white glove covers her right hand. The left shoulder pauldron incorporates the Tudor Rose, a traditional heraldic symbol of England, while the plates of the armor were designed to resemble the links of her sword. A mask covering {{the right side of}} her face and eye were also considered but abandoned after the initial character concept. While her design has been altered slightly as the series has progressed, the concept has remained consistent throughout the series, {{with the exception of the}} removal of the glove in later designs. Ivy stands [...] tall, making her the series' tallest female character, and with a bust measurement of 100cm (39in) also the bustiest, though this was an aspect that the developers felt they had <b>overdone</b> by her appearance in Soulcalibur IV.|$|E
500|$|Matsuhara, {{who came}} up with the concept of the phone trigger system, stated that he {{initially}} wanted to incorporate the player's own mobile phone into the system. However, the idea was abandoned due to concerns that it might clash with Japan's privacy laws. When asked if the phone trigger system would be used in a possible sequel to the game, Hayashi stated that he hoped this would not be the case and recalled saying [...] "who thought of this system!" [...] while writing the contents of the text messages. While Shitakura did not directly contribute to the script itself, Hayashi stated that Shitakura helped with the overall plot and provided assistance with the second half of the story. In particular, Shitakura helped a lot on the time traveling aspects of the story. Hayashi stated that while he did not want the script to repeat the same text over and over again, it was ultimately unavoidable due to the player having to travel back in time so he tried to place emphasis on the overall tempo of the plot's development and how the plot unfolded. With regards to the theme of time traveling, Hayashi had felt that it seemed like a topic that was <b>overdone</b> and expressed concern over it when he first heard the idea from Shikura.|$|E
500|$|Not all of {{the recent}} {{critical}} reaction to Tenebrae has been positive. Geoff Andrew of Time Out thought that the film was [...] "unpleasant even by contemporary horror standards". John Kenneth Muir, author of Horror Films of the 1980s, considers the film to be far inferior to Suspiria, but acknowledges {{that it was so}} [...] "unremittingly gory" [...] that it justified its US title of [...] "Unsane". John Wiley Martin, although evaluating the film as a [...] "technically mesmeric" [...] one, felt that thematically it was a [...] "disappointingly retrograde step" [...] for Argento. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com called it a [...] "gory but not particularly effective Argento horror flick", while Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews dismissed it as [...] "trash", giving it the grade C. Gary Johnson, editor of Images, complained, [...] "Not much of Tenebre makes much sense. The plot becomes little more than an excuse for Argento to stage the murder sequences. And {{these are some of the}} bloodiest murders of Argento's career." [...] In 2004, Tim Lucas re-evaluated the film and found that some of his earlier enthusiasm had dimmed considerably, noting that, [...] "Tenebre is beginning to suffer from the cheap 16 mm-like softness of Luciano Tovoli's cinematography, its sometimes over-storyboarded violence (the first two murders in particular look stilted), the many bewildering lapses in logic... and the <b>overdone</b> performances of many of its female actors".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of [...] "The Food Wife", HitFix's Alan Sepinwall commended it for [...] "stay true to the characters. Of course the kids would {{consider}} Homer to be the fun dad on those occasions when he's actually making an effort, and of course Marge would feel jealous of this. And if she goes too far in trying to keep this as her special thing, she also recognizes it immediately, feels guilty throughout the meal and then heads off to save the day, complete with a great homage to the climax of Ratatouille." [...] Sepinwall also praised the episode for being [...] "packed with great jokes", such as Heidecker and Wareheim's hip hop song and the scenes at the video game convention where the screen turns into a first-person shooter game. Similarly, Haydens Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "funny and well-observed", giving it a B+ grade, and cited the hip hop song as {{the highlight of the}} episode. He also praised Bourdain, Batali, and Ramsay, and stated that he wished Bourdain would have gotten a bigger part in the episode. Childs further wrote that [...] "The best thing about this episode is that it doesn’t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out-of-character character moments down the viewers’ throats. It sticks to the basics: the family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still-current fad. I say 'still-current' because although it is probably true that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities, I don’t think that it has been <b>overdone</b> everywhere." ...|$|E
