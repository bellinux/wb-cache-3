5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> some food-borne illnesses, {{including}} Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E

5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi infect {{and kill}} insects, {{including}} {{a variety of}} pest species, so they have been investigated as possible biological control agents. A variety of Ascomycetes, including Beauveria, Lecanicillium, Metarhizium, and Paecilomyces have promising features for use as biological insecticides.

5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest {{that by the end}} of the Middle Ages, the Black Death and subsequent recurring <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> the plague, may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as half a million people. Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half of the sixteenth century. Almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century saw local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584-8, 1595 and 1597–1609.|$|E

5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> avian influenza.|$|E

While floodwaters had largely receded by 19 December, areas of stagnant water covered parts of Tamil Nadu into January 2016, notably around Cuddalore and Tuticorin. Central government survey teams conducted studies on the extent on the flooding in early January.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} two millennia, locust plagues {{continued}} to appear at irregular intervals with the main recorded <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> the desert and migratory locusts occurring in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.

The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of Mercy Brown and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.|$|E

5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> cholera had {{overwhelmed}} the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials.

5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections.
