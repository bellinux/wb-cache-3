5|$|Number two, why {{was this}} person, {{this one of the}} six around to commit this hideous crime? He was <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had a 31-count {{indictment}} for the rape of a child, and he was out on $15,000 bail, instead of the requisite $450,000 bail that he never could have made and never would have been on the street.|$|E
5|$|The cast {{consisted}} {{mostly of}} unknowns, though Isabel Bigley, {{who had just}} originated Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls, was given the leading role of chorus girl Jeanie. For Larry, the assistant stage manager {{who falls in love}} with Jeanie, they cast Bill Hayes, a well-known stage and television actor. William Tabbert, the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part of Larry, but lost <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was thought to be too tall to be afraid of Mark Dawson, hired as the towering bully Bob.|$|E
5|$|Lydia {{finds out}} Sarah is bribing Holly Cunningham (Lydia Waters) to befriend Persephone {{so she could}} get closer to her, leaving things awkward between the girls. The next day, Lydia allays her fears to Sarah over {{relationships}} and the girls seal it with a kiss, which Michaela sees. Sarah and Lydia then begin a full relationship. It is revealed that out of her family, Persephone {{is the only one who}} knows of Lydia's sexuality. Lydia replaces Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) as the drummer of Josh's band 'The Somethings' as he kicked him <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was against having wheelchair user Hayley Ramsey (Kelly Marie Stewart) as the lead singer because of their bad breakup. Lydia is later kicked out of the band due to unreliability.|$|E

50|$|When Walker {{is called}} up, he {{applies to the}} Military Service Hardship Committee, who reject him {{on the grounds that}} he doesn't keep books for his business. After Jones' {{attempts}} to sabotage his medical test fail, Walker is invalided <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> allergic to corned beef.|$|R
50|$|Josh Samman called <b>out</b> Jimmy Quinlan <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to}} be the next one to do that after McDaniel.|$|R
5|$|The {{final version}} of the script was {{distributed}} to the cast, but Patrick Stewart did not receive a copy. Berman was concerned that if anyone had a problem with it, they would call Stewart to complain and it would appear as though Stewart was being left <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had criticized the story. LeVar Burton called Stewart to praise the script. Stewart was sent a copy and requested a meeting to discuss changes. Piller feared the worst, but after a twenty-minute meeting with Stewart, who requested several dialogue changes, the script was finalized. During pre-production, the marketing department wanted to decide a title, preferring Star Trek: Revolution. Alan Spencera friend of Pillersuggested Insurrection, which was selected from a choice of Insurrection, Rebellion, High Treason and Act of Treason.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} match, Jardine made his Test debut against the West Indies who were touring England that season. This was West Indies' first ever Test match. The team possessed several fast bowlers who had enjoyed some {{success on the}} tour of England. Many batsmen only played them with difficulty, {{particularly}} on the occasional fast-paced pitch, but Jardine played them confidently. Jardine played {{in the first two}} Tests, both of which were won by England by an innings, but missed the third for unknown reasons. He scored 22 on his debut, but was more successful in the second Test. He scored 83: when he had scored 26, he hit his wicket when setting off for a run, but was given not out. At the time, a batsman was not out if he had completed his shot and was setting off for a run; the West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine believed that Jardine was only given not <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> told the umpire his shot was complete. Later, while he was batting with Tate, a player with whom {{he did not have a}} good relationship, Jardine was run out when Tate refused to go for a run.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) is {{depressed}} {{because it}} is the first Valentine's Day since he and Holly broke up. Michael donates blood at a mobile blood drive being held in the business park's parking lot and has a nice conversation with a female donor (Kathryn Aselton) sitting next to him. When they both finish at the same time, Michael passes <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> did not eat much before giving blood, and when he wakes up she is gone. A disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it, hoping she will come back for it. When Michael goes back into the office, he decides to gather all the single employees into the conference room to discuss their own personal romantic dilemmas. After becoming further depressed by their sad dating stories, Michael decides to try lifting their spirits by holding a singles mixer. He puts up flyers which also advertise the finding of a missing glove, and Michael hopes his mystery woman will come to the party as a result.|$|E
50|$|Isaac Asimov, {{asked to}} write the novelization from the script, {{declared}} that the script was full of plot holes, and received permission {{to write the book}} the way he wanted. The novel came <b>out</b> first <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wrote quickly and because of delays in filming.|$|R
5000|$|Sady Doyle, {{writing in}} The Guardian, {{compared}} it to the outing of the alleged blackmailer of Amanda Todd and suggested that such outings may be justified, but that they may also unduly focus attention on individuals without confronting the underlying problems by engaging in [...] "sensationalism" [...] {{at the expense of}} cultural reform. In PC Magazine, Damon Poeter stated that, while he has defended protecting anonymity on the Internet, he still supported Brutsch being <b>outed</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt the various subreddits he contributed to as violentacrez were serious invasions of privacy, regardless of legality, and that it was therefore justifiable to reveal his personal details.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to his research on metamorphosis, Swammerdam's entomological work stands <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was among the first}} people to study insects in a systematized fashion (i.e., careful dissection, comparison of different species, and use of the microscope). His anatomical and behavioral descriptions of bees, wasps, ants, dragonflies, snails, worms, and butterflies were major contributions to the nascent field of entomology in the late seventeenth century.|$|E
25|$|That season, he {{made his}} third {{straight}} All-Star team and he had another good year with an ERA of 2.31 in 35 games. However, the Dodgers weren't as good and he suffered {{from a lack of}} offensive support. He went 0–7 over one nine game stretch because the team only scored nine runs total in that period. He had a 15–15 record that season but only evened it <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> pitched 11 innings in the last game of the season and threw 169 pitches. He was determined to stay in until his team took the lead, no matter what the manager wanted.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Hawtrey {{had become}} a regular {{participant}} in the Carry On films series. He was in the first, Carry On Sergeant (1958), and more than 20 others. His characters ranged from the wimpish through the effete to the effeminate and would always, regardless of the historical setting, be seen wearing Hawtrey's signature round glasses. In her autobiography Barbara Windsor wrote about Hawtrey's alcoholism and his outrageous flirting with the footballer George Best. While filming Carry On Spying (1964), in which they both played secret agents, Windsor thought that Hawtrey had fainted from fright at a dramatic scene on a conveyor belt. In fact he had passed <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was drunk. When he came on set with a crate of R. White's Lemonade everyone {{knew that he had}} been on another binge. He smoked Woodbines and played cards between takes with Sid James {{and other members of the}} cast.|$|E
50|$|Lee {{proposes a}} script idea to Saul and Saul reacts positively. Austin begins writing Lee’s story out loud, but stops, saying it doesn't {{resemble}} real life. The two brothers fight and eventually Austin asks Lee for his car keys back. Lee assumes Austin {{is trying to}} make him leave, and Lee says he can’t be kicked out. Austin says he wouldn't kick him <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he’s</b> his brother. Lee counters that being brothers means nothing because in-family murders are most common. Austin assures him they won't be driven to murder over a movie script. The two admit to being jealous of each other’s lives, Lee kindly returns the car keys and the scene closes with Austin typing Lee’s story.|$|R
50|$|Lastly, Saint Bernard’s style stands <b>out</b> to Basevorn <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{frequently}} cites from primary sources, {{so that a}} more authoritative source confirms what {{he says in a}} sermon.|$|R

25|$|On May 30, 2000, {{after the}} New York Knicks beat the Indiana Pacers on Game 4 of the 2000 NBA Eastern Conference Finals, Francesa and Russo {{intended}} {{to board a}} plane to Indianapolis to host Mike and the Mad Dog there. However, the flight got cancelled and the next flight did not have first class seats available. Since Francesa only rode planes with first class seats, {{he walked away from}} the airport and went to the studio. This angered Russo and later that day Russo exploded during a close-door meeting with management. According to Russo, that was their worst fight ever. The duo didn’t talk, or even look at each other, during commercial breaks for 2 and a half months. Francesa said he went on vacation in the summer of 2000 and told WFAN to figure something <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> refused to work with Russo again when he returned.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor and Rose reminisce {{about their}} travels {{in front of}} Mickey, who feels left out. Suddenly the TARDIS is jolted and comes to a sudden stop. The Doctor tells them they have fallen out of the time vortex and that the TARDIS's power cell is dead. The Doctor fears they are trapped in the Void, but Mickey opens the TARDIS doors {{to see that they}} are in London. Heading outside to look, they quickly realise that they are in London on a {{parallel}} Earth. The Doctor finds a small power cell in the TARDIS that still works, and he energises it with some of his own lifeforce. The cell needs time to recharge, so they decide to explore the alternate world. Rose is shocked to see a billboard with her father's picture on it, and the Doctor warns her not to seek him <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is not her real father. Mickey decides to head off on his own and try to find his grandmother, who died in his universe. The Doctor and Rose discover that most of the population of London wear EarPod devices that feed information directly into the wearer's brain.|$|E
500|$|Curteis {{ran into}} several {{problems}} while directing the film. Owing to his absence of feature film experience, the film's tight schedule, and limited funding, he became quickly overwhelmed, and The Projected Man started going over its budget and falling behind on schedule. Executive producers Tony Tenser and Michael Klinger threatened {{to take over}} production as {{they did not want}} to increase the budget. Since Croydon had hired Curteis, it became his responsibility to fire him and finish directing the film. Richard Gordon suggested that [...] "I think Curteis was relieved to step <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> simply didn't know any longer what to do." [...] Croydon was not credited for his directing work on the film; as Gordon said, [...] "one tries not to publicize such incidents." ...|$|E

50|$|In the episode, {{the setting}} has Kyle giving the song to Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), {{who has become}} acquainted with Kyle and Jimmy, to look at {{to see if she}} knows if she can provide some help to getting their musical made. Later, Karen and her roommate Ana Vargas (Krysta Rodriguez) and Bombshell {{ensemble}} friends Bobby (Wesley Taylor) and Jessica (Savannah Wise) attend a party in Brooklyn that Jimmy and Kyle are hosting for their friends. Karen, having previously figured out the song with Ana's help, starts to sing it to Jimmy a cappella to impress him and then is accompanied by Ana on piano. Jimmy storms <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> angry that Kyle showed his work to someone without asking.|$|R
50|$|He went to {{high school}} in the Colegio Nacional de la Capital (National School of the Capital) and started to study Law in the Faculty of Law and Social Sciences, from which he, short time after, dropped <b>out</b> of <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{consumed}} his time participating in political activities since 1900.

500|$|After Wardencyiffe closed, Tesla {{continued}} {{to write to}} Morgan; after [...] "the great man" [...] died, Tesla wrote to his son Jack Morgan, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, he opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents. He went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented {{for a few months}} at the Woolworth Building, moving <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt. Most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop.|$|E
500|$|In licentiousness, he is {{compared}} with Amnon and Zimri, {{both of whom}} were punished for their sins. Samson's eyes were put <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had [...] "followed them" [...] too often. It is said that, in the twenty years during which Samson judged Israel, he never required the least service from an Israelite, and he piously refrained from taking the name of God in vain. Therefore, as soon as he told Delilah that he was a Nazarite of God, she immediately knew that he had spoken the truth. When he pulled down the temple of Dagon and killed himself and the Philistines, the structure fell backward so that he was not crushed, his family being thus enabled to find his body and to bury it in the tomb of his father.|$|E
500|$|Bestselling author Stephen King {{was a major}} {{inspiration}} for Alan Wake. The main character as a writer whose work is coming true is a theme that has been explored by King {{in a number of}} his works. Wake's narration directly alludes to King on several occasions, including the game's opening line, in which he quotes a Stephen King essay. The game also pays homage to the film The Shining (based on King's novel of the same name) with a hedge maze area similar to the iconic maze in the film, among other references, as well as King's novel Christine, with one of the in-game cars resembling her. King himself was asked for permission to use his quote. He also received copies of the game as a [...] "thank you", but was unable to try them <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> does not own an Xbox. In addition to King's work, Lake has cited the stories of Bret Easton Ellis and Neil Gaiman as influences, as well as Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves.|$|E
50|$|After {{talking to}} an old friend, Leif Garrett, Dickie is {{absolutely}} convinced that a new Rob Reiner movie in the works, Mr. Blake's Backyard, will be his comeback vehicle. Even after Sidney, his agent, does not land him an audition, Dickie persists. While on duty at Morton's, he joy rides in a customer's vehicle, drops into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and he pesters Tom Arnold to hook him up with Reiner. After <b>he</b> is kicked <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> not an alcoholic, Dickie fakes being wasted and crashes what {{turns out to be}} a Lamaze class. However, Brendan Fraser (in an uncredited cameo appearance) is in the class and, finding his entrance to the class hilarious and ridiculous, he agrees to help him out and calls Reiner for Dickie.|$|R

500|$|Writing about cricket in Trinidad, {{historian}} C. L. R. James {{noted that}} Dewhurst always kept wicket [...] "excellently", but that many Trinidadians considered Piggott a better wicket-keeper {{who was only}} left <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was black and Dewhurst was white. James recalled that people were astonished when Piggott was not chosen to tour England in 1923. But he suggests {{it was not a}} surprise as without Dewhurst's selection, among the Trinidad representatives on the West Indian team, {{there would have been no}} players from the Queen's Park Club, the most prestigious club on the island, nor would there have been any white players. Writing in 1927, in the expectation that Dewhurst would tour England the following year, his 1923 team-mate C. R. Browne wrote that Dewhurst's [...] "heart is as big as his body" [...] and that his [...] "expansive smile captures many victims". He described him as [...] "very unassuming, but winning in appearance Dewhurst is effective in his job and inspires confidence in bowler and fieldsmen alike. Without Trinidad's skipper no West Indies Team is complete." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the three}} summer interns prepare to depart, Michael (Steve Carell) hears from {{various members of}} the office that two of the interns might be dating, and feels upset that he was left out of the gossip. He talks about the {{situation}} with the third intern, and learns that the interns had recently gone out to a young people's club, where they saw Stanley (Leslie David Baker) dancing with a woman, presumably his wife Teri. Michael, wanting to start some gossip of his own, forms the conclusion that Stanley was <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was having a mid-life crisis and shares it with the office, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) claims Stanley does not like crowds and that Teri is out of town. When Michael confronts the interns about this, they insist they saw Stanley there [...] "making out" [...] with a woman. Now realizing that Stanley is possibly having an affair and he is the first person to learn of it, Michael starts telling the employees. Jim (John Krasinski) urges Michael to stop spreading a rumor that he does not know for certain to be true. When Stanley is leaving, Michael heads to the parking lot to discuss the rumor with him. Stanley initially denies it, but when Michael mentions that he was spotted in the club by the interns, he reveals that since Teri has been out of town constantly, he has been seeking company from a nurse named Cynthia, whom he met in rehab. Stanley urges Michael not to say anything since he is breaking it off with Cynthia, and Michael agrees, despite having already told the entire office.|$|E
500|$|Born {{during the}} Great Depression, and {{raised by his}} grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After {{graduating from high school}} in 1950, he joined the Air Force but was later {{discharged}} due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was succeeding in music. During this time, he worked as a disc jockey in Texas radio stations and a singer in honky-tonks. Nelson moved to Vancouver, Washington, where he wrote [...] "Family Bible" [...] and recorded the song [...] "Lumberjack" [...] in 1956. In 1958, he moved to Houston, Texas, after signing a contract with D Records. He sang at the Esquire Ballroom weekly and he worked as a disk jockey. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including [...] "Funny How Time Slips Away", [...] "Hello Walls", [...] "Pretty Paper", and [...] "Crazy". In 1960 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price's band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ...And Then I Wrote. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson retired in 1972 and moved to Austin, Texas. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return from retirement, performing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters.|$|E
