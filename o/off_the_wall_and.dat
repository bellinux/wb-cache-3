5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> threw it at Costello and Kent {{from the balcony}} of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging {{it so much that}} he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Sistine Chapel {{was to have a}} {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.|$|E

25|$|After {{his victory}} in the {{qualification}} race, Vernay started from pole position with Ericsson starting alongside, with Mortara and Bottas on row two. Due to damage inflicted in his spectacular accident the previous day, Boyd did not start, thus leaving the grid at 28 cars. Once again, Ericsson made an awful getaway, with Bottas and Mortara both slotting in behind a fast-starting Vernay. Into Lisboa, Ricciardo got alongside Ericsson as they battled for fourth with the Australian brushing {{the wall and the}} two continued side-by-side into San Francisco, with Ricciardo again nudging the wall. Behind them, Vanthoor left his braking far too late for Lisboa, and mounted over Chilton, which caused the teenage Briton to retire on the spot. Ricciardo's clip with the wall caused a left-rear puncture, but he managed to carry on up the hill, until he crashed {{at the entrance to the}} Solitude Esses. His car rebounded <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> into direct line of the rest of the field. No less than half a dozen cars impacted with the stricken car, and blocked the track which ultimately led to a red flag, and a race suspension. Also taken out in the incident were the third Carlin of Hartley, the Premas of Coletti and Zampieri, the Fortecs of Rosenzweig and McKenzie, and Ho. Imperatori was also involved, returning to the pits for a lengthy period, but returned to complete three laps towards the end. Vanthoor, with a damaged front wheel after his collision with Chilton, stopped just short of the accident site, and was thus able to continue in the race.|$|E
500|$|Several of the {{contributors}} to the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook album had worked with Jackson on his solo projects in the past. Rod Temperton, who had written several songs featured on <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> Thriller, wrote the music for [...] "Someone in the Dark". Freddy DeMann and Ron Weisner, former managers of The Jacksons, served as the production coordinators for the album. Bruce Swedien engineered E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, a task he had performed on <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> Thriller and {{would go on to}} perform for the albums Bad (1987) and Dangerous (1991). Dick Zimmerman photographed Jackson for the Thriller album cover, before again capturing the singer for the accompanying poster to the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial album.|$|E
500|$|... "Treasure" [...] was {{subsequently}} confirmed as the record's third single by Atlantic Records. It received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised it for [...] " [...] the peppy sound of such pop/R hit-makers of the 1970s and 1980s as the Sylvers, Heatwave, DeBarge and Kool & the Gang." [...] To promote the single, Mars performed on various occasions, including a [...] "little extra Michael Jackson-esque, circa <b>Off</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> Thriller" [...] {{show at the}} 2013 Billboard Music Awards.

500|$|Jackson's {{previous}} album Off the Wall (1979) received strong {{critical acclaim}} {{and was also}} a commercial success, eventually selling over 20 million copies worldwide. The years between <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> Thriller were a transitional period for Jackson, a time of increased independence. The period saw the singer become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping {{to find someone to}} talk to. But I just end up coming home." [...] When Jackson turned 21 in August 1979, he hired John Branca as his manager.|$|E

[...] Rodriguez commented that the album was [...] "wrongfully dismissed by critics because it wasn't the sales blockbuster that Thriller was" [...] and that during the Bad era, Jackson's vocal hiccups and stammered [...] "shamone" [...] would become staples in his music that were [...] "heightening and highlighting the emotion of his lyrics." [...] Rolling Stone commented that [...] "the best way to view" [...] Bad was not as [...] "the sequel to Thriller. In 2009, VH1 said of the album: ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the museum}} was {{equipped}} with motion detectors, the thieves' movements throughout the museum were recorded. After tying up the guards, the thieves went upstairs to the Dutch Room. As one of them approached Rembrandt's Self-Portrait (1629), a local alarm sounded, which they immediately smashed. They pulled the painting <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> [...] attempted to take the wooden panel out of its heavy frame. Unsuccessful at the attempt, they left the painting on the floor. They cut Rembrandt's The Storm on the Sea of Galilee out of the frame, as well as A Lady and Gentleman in Black. [...] They also removed Vermeer's The Concert and Govaert Flinck's Landscape with an Obelisk from their frames. Additionally, they also took a Chinese bronze gu from the Shang Dynasty.|$|E

500|$|Bad saw Jackson {{exercise}} {{even more}} artistic freedom {{than he did}} with his two previous Epic releases (<b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> Thriller); Jackson composed nine of the album's eleven tracks, and received co-producer credit for the entire album. Nine of the eleven songs on Bad were released as singles; one was a promotional single, and another was released outside of the United States and Canada. Five of the singles hit No. 1 in the United States, while a sixth charted within the top ten, and a seventh charted within the top twenty on the Hot 100. Bad peaked at No. 1 in thirteen countries and charted within the top twenty in other territories. The only songs on the album which were not released as commercial singles were [...] "Speed Demon" [...] and [...] "Just Good Friends".|$|E
500|$|After a {{match in}} the Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> threw it at Costello and Kent {{from the balcony}} of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging {{it so much that}} he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15 days in jail, and fined $50 for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury meant that Costello was unable to compete and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Don Kent returned to NWA Mid-America to work as a singles wrestler, while Costello had a full hip replacement, and was forced to retire from active competition. In 1975, Costello surprised everyone by returning to professional wrestling as the manager of a team known as [...] "The Love Brothers" [...] (Hartford and Reggie Love). He [...] actually stepped into the ring on occasion as part of special six-man tag team matches.|$|E
500|$|American {{environmentalist}} {{and writer}} Bill McKibben lamented the {{film on the}} Climate Progress website, where he wrote [...] "The climate skeptics can crow. It's the kind of stupidity that hurts our side, reinforcing in people's minds a series of preconceived notions, {{not the least of}} which is that we're out-of-control and out of touch—not to mention <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> also with completely misplaced sense of humor". McKibben added [...] "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10. When The Daily Caller asked about the film, environmental organisation Greenpeace spokeswoman Jane Kochersperger stated that [...] "as an organisation committed to non-violence, I think you can imagine how Greenpeace views this material. At this time, the only people promoting the material are climate skeptics and think tanks funded by corporations known for lobbying against climate change legislation". Five other environmental groups contacted by The Daily Caller did not comment on the film.|$|E

He stated that the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon. Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. The Avengers director Joss Whedon, who signed a deal to creatively consult {{on all of the}} films leading up to , was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying [...] "James [...] is what makes me think it will work... He is so <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon... He has a very twisted take on it, but it all comes from a real love for the material. It's {{going to be hard for}} [...] to keep up." ...|$|E
500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} a big red box from outside, from which he {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this {{comes to an end}} when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started {{at the beginning of the}} story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, [...] "What would you do if your mother asked you?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "She's Out of My Life" [...] {{had been}} written for Jones by Tom Bahler three years earlier. Jackson heard and enjoyed it, and Jones allowed him to use it on the record. Jones called in Heatwave's keyboardist Rod Temperton to write three songs. The {{intention}} was for Jackson and Jones to select one of his songs, but Jackson, liking them all, included {{all of them in}} the final cut. Jackson stayed up all night to learn the lyrics to these songs instead of singing from a sheet. He finished the vocals to these three Temperton songs in two recording sessions. Temperton took a different approach to his song writing after spending some time researching the background to Jackson's music style. Temperton mixed his traditional harmony segments with the idea of adding shorter note melodies to suit Jackson's aggressive style. Jackson wrote [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" [...] after humming a melody in his kitchen. After listening to hundreds of songs, Jackson and Jones decided upon a batch to record. In hindsight, Jones believed they took a lot of risks in the production of <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> the final choice of album tracks. Attention was also paid to the album cover, which shows Jackson smiling, wearing a tuxedo and trademark socks. His manager stated, [...] "The tuxedo was the overall plan for the Off the Wall project and package. The tuxedo was our idea, the socks were Michael'".|$|E

500|$|Mars has {{performed}} {{the song in}} several shows. On January 11, 2013, Mars sang [...] "Treasure" [...] and his previous single [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] on Jimmy Kimmel Live. On May 19, Mars began the 2013 Billboard Music Awards with a performance of the single on a set decorated with disco balls. The website Idolator described his style during the performance as [...] "Michael Jackson-esque, circa <b>Off</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> Thriller". Billboard considered the performance {{one of the best}} ten of the night. Mars sang [...] "Treasure" [...] at the finale of Germany's Next Topmodel, Cycle 8 on May 30, 2013 at SAP Arena in Mannheim and again a week later on Le Grand Journal. He performed the song with The Hooligans on the season finale of Season 4 of The Voice, on June 18, 2015. On February 2, 2014, the single was featured as the fourth song in Mars' performance in the halftime performance of Super Bowl XLVIII at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Mars performed the song live at the 2014 Brit Awards ceremony. Ashley Lee, a writer for The Hollywood Reporter, noticed that Mars [...] "added few well-harmonized vocal interludes to the song bridge, while reprising the song's vintage-style choreography". The single was also sung during the Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013) as the third item on the setlist. The song was performed as a medley of [...] "That's What I Like" [...] of Mars' third studio album 24K Magic, at the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Awards. [...] "Treasure" [...] was also the third song on the setlist of the 24K Magic World Tour (2017–18).|$|E
500|$|Lloyd's biographer Midge Gillies defines 1891 {{as being}} the year that she officially [...] "made it" [...] thanks to a {{catalogue}} of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; The Era called her [...] "the favourite of the hour". During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. [...] At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. [...] The 1892 pantomime was Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb, in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. [...] The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's harlequinade. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when {{she got out of}} bed to pray, but instead reached for a chamber pot. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her not to do it again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said [...] "Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? [...] I think of little besides her." [...] On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of Little Bo-Peep. [...] Courtenay pulled a decorative sword <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station. In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous, which, according to MacQueen-Pope, [...] "ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress".|$|E

[...] Jae-Ha Kim of Chicago Sun-Times, noted [...] "'Is It Scary' shows a darker side of Jackson than even the tabloids would have you believe...With the hypnotic 'Morphine', he sounds like a seductive cousin of Trent Reznor's." [...] Sonia Murray of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution gave the album a D grade. She claimed that, [...] "'Ghosts' pounds with funk until Jackson's weak vocals come in." [...] She described [...] "Morphine" [...] as an [...] "overblown rock hiss". The Virginian-Pilot gave the album a positive review, also expressing the opinion that [...] "Morphine" [...] sounded [...] "eerily like 'State of Shock'", and continued, [...] "'Scream Louder' a remix of his hit duet with sister Janet, {{is better than the}} original only because it takes away the overpowering guitar twangs." [...] The Washington Post described [...] "Superfly Sister" [...] as [...] "sex funk", adding, [...] "'Morphine' apparently told from the drug's point of view and featuring both the Andrae Crouch Singers and an orchestra, alternates between hard-edged rock and operatic pop." ...|$|E
