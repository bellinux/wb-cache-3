The matrix cell in row [...] "accuracy of measurement" [...] and column [...] "complexity of control" [...] points to several principles, among them the Copying Principle, which states, [...] "Use a simple and inexpensive <b>optical</b> <b>copy</b> with a suitable scale instead of an object that is complex, expensive, fragile or inconvenient to operate." [...] From this general invention principle, the following idea might solve the problem: Taking a high-resolution image of the machined ball.

As mentioned above, Altshuler abandoned this method of defining and solving [...] "technical" [...] contradictions in the mid 1980s and instead used SuField modeling and the 76 inventive standards {{and a number of}} other tools included in the algorithm for solving inventive problems, ARIZ.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{overview}} of current status of the Optical Replica synthesizer at DESY. The method is based on producing an ”optical copy ” of the electron bunch with its subsequent analysis with optical techniques [1]. To this end, a near-IR laser beam is superimposed on the elec-tron beam in the first undulator of an optical klystron. In the following dispersive section the laser-induced energy modulation {{is transformed into a}} density modulation. The modulated electron bunch then produces a strong optical pulse in the second undulator. Analysis of this near-IR pulse (the <b>optical</b> <b>copy)</b> then provides information about the profile, the slice emittance and the slice energy spread of the electron bunch. We discuss the implementation of such a measurement set-up at the FLASH facility at DESY and investigate the influence of various parameters on the performance of the device. Topics we address include the dispersive chicane, as well as the requirements for the seed laser pulses and the detection and analysis of the near-IR pulse...|$|E

Instead, the model of numerical copying is widely used. Until recently, geometry could be copied predominantly in the touching manner and the manufacture of copied - measured shapes on CNC machine tools mainly did not pose o problem. However, because of the introduction of <b>optical</b> <b>copying</b> of geometrical data it is possible to copy the shapes which, sometimes, cannot be made by conventional machining processes (small radii of curvature, negative angles, etc.).

Although the scene is in reverse motion, Nolan used forward-played sounds. For a shot of a shell casing flying upwards, the shell had to be dropped {{in front of the}} camera in forward motion, but it constantly rolled out of frame. Nolan was forced to blow the casing out of frame instead, but in the confusion, the crew shot it backwards. They then had to make an <b>optical</b> (a <b>copy</b> of the shot) and reverse the shot to make it go forward again. [...] "That was the height of complexity in terms of the film", Nolan said.

They achieved a position resolution of < 90 {mu} over the full 5 m{sup 2 } area of the detector. This resolution satisfied the GEM resolution requirements of < 100 {mu} by a comfortable margin. Based on their SSC work they developed a new technique for creating wire supports in drift tubes with an overall placement accuracy of < 20 {mu}.

40|$|The weak intermacromolecular {{interactions}} {{caused by}} the presence of a complexing agent in a two-phase biopolymer mixture can affect its phase equilibrium and morphology In this communication, the attempt was made to induce demixing in semidilute and highly compatible sodium caseinate/sodium alginate system (SC-SA) mixtures {{in the presence of a}} sodium salt of dextran sulfate (DSS) at pH 7. 0 (above the isoelectrical point of caseins), and to characterize phase equilibrium, intermacromolecular interactions. and structure Of Such systems by rheo-small angle light scattering (SAILS), <b>optical</b> micro <b>copy</b> (OM), phase analysis, dynamic light scattering (DLS), fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), ESEM, and rheology. Addition of dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) to the semidilute single-phase SC-SA system, even in trace concentrations (10 (- 3) wt %), leads to segregative liquid-liquid phase separation and a substantial increase in storage and loss moduli of the system. The degree of the protein conversion in the complex glows when the concentration of SC in the system increases from 1 to 2 wt %. It is also established here that demixing of semidilute biopolymer mixtures, induced by the minor presence of DSS, is a rather common phenomenon, because it also wits observed here for other biopolymer pairs At high shear rates SC becomes even less compatible with SA in the presence of DSS than at rest Experimental observations suggest that the approach for Inducing demixing of semidilute and highly compatible biopolymer mixtures by physical interactions of the constituents is a promising tool for regulation of biopolymer compatibility and achieving better predictions of phase behavior of aqueous protein-charged polysaccharide systems. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} a preliminary {{study of the}} correlation between films properties and flexographic print quality defined as the optical density of full tone. It is also an attempt {{to answer the question}} whether traditional plastic films can be replaced by biodegradable and compostable films as printing substrates and as materials for packaging. Four kinds of films were used in the experiments – two plastic films (PP and PET) and two biodegradable films (PLA and cellulose). The permeability to water vapour and oxygen, as well as the tensile strength and elongation at break of the material were investigated for all samples. The measurements of the contact angle with water, diiodomethane and printing ink were also conducted for these films, and their surface free energy was determined. All samples were printed on laboratory equipment by a flexographic technique using water-based inks and the <b>optical</b> density of <b>copies</b> was measured. It has been found that the print quality was determined by the type of film used. Furthermore, the correlation between optical density and wettability defined as the contact angle between film and water or printing ink turned out to be significant. Other important parameter is surface free energy, albeit to a little lesser extent. The barrier and mechanical properties of the material have an even weaker impact on optical density. In addition, it is possible to choose the biodegradable film with properties corresponding to conventional, commonly used films which enable high quality prints...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{publication}} of David Hockney’s book Secret Knowledge: rediscovering the lost techniques of the Old Masters in 2001, it was commonly believed that the first artist to use an optical aid in painting was the seventeenth-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. Hockney, however, believes {{that the use of}} projected images started much earlier, as early as the fifteenth-century, claiming that evidence {{can be found in the}} work of the Flemish painter Jan van Eyck. Without rejecting Hockney’s pioneering work in this field, I nevertheless make the perhaps bolder claim that Italian artists were using the aid of image projections even before the time of Jan van Eyck, that is, as early as 1270. Although much of the information required to make an earlier claim for the use of optics can be found in Hockney’s publication, the key to linking all the information together has been missing. It is my unique contention that this key is a letter that has always been believed to have been European in origin. More commonly referred to as Roger Bacon’s Letter I show in detail how this letter was, in fact, not written by Roger Bacon, but addressed to him, and that this letter originated in China. Chinese knowledge about projected images, that is the concept that light-pictures could be received onto appropriate supports, came directly to Europe around 1250. This knowledge was expanded upon by Roger Bacon in his Opus Majus, a document which arrived in Italy in 1268 for the special consideration of Pope Clement IV. The medieval Italian painter Cimabue was able to benefit directly from this information about optical systems, when he himself was in Rome in 1272. He immediately began to <b>copy</b> <b>optical</b> projections, which stimulated the creation of a new, more individualistic, mode of representation in Italian painting from this time forward. The notion that projected images greatly contributed towards the development of naturalism in medieval Italian painting replaces the previously weak supposition that the stimulation was classical or humanist theory, and shows that it was, in fact, far likely something more technical as well.
