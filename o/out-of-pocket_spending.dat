Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>spending</b> and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E
25|$|The PPACA {{also made}} some changes to Medicare enrollee’s’ benefits. By 2020, it will close the {{so-called}} “donut hole” between Part D plans’ coverage limits and the catastrophic cap on <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>spending,</b> reducing a Part D enrollee’s’ {{exposure to the}} cost of prescription drugs by an average of $2,000 a year. This lowered costs for about 5% of the people on Medicare. Limits were also placed on out-of-pocket costs for in-network care for public Part C health plan enrollees. Most of these plans had such a limit but ACA formalized the annual out of pocket spend limit. Beneficiaries on traditional Medicare do not get such a limit but can effectively arrange for one through private insurance.|$|E

When charity or [...] "uncompensated" [...] care is not available, they sometimes simply go without needed medical treatment. This problem has {{become a source of}} considerable political controversy on a national level. The uninsured still receive emergency care and thus if they are unable to afford it, they impose costs on others who pay higher premiums and deductibles to cover these expenses indirectly. Estimates for 2008 reported that the uninsured would spend $30 billion for healthcare and receive $56 billion in uncompensated care, and that if everyone were covered by insurance then overall costs would increase by $123 billion. [...] A 2003 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report estimated total cost of health care provided to the uninsured at $98.9 billion in 2001, including $26.4 billion in <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>spending</b> by the uninsured, with $34.5 billion in [...] "free" [...] "uncompensated" [...] care covered by government subsidies of $30.6 billion to hospitals and clinics and $5.1 billion in donated services by physicians.|$|E

This paper uses data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the related Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS) to examine the impact of health problems at older ages on <b>out-of-pocket</b> health care <b>spending</b> and other types of expenditures.

Published in the journal Health Affairs, the study found “…After accounting for general inflation, family incomes remained stagnant between 2004 and 2006, while <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>spending</b> on premiums and health care services increased 8.5% over the two-year period. Overall, total <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>spending</b> increased, on average, about 5 percent annually between 2001 and 2006, and was similar for the 2001-4 and 2004-6 periods.” The report found the largest increases in out-of-pocket expenses were for those with private health insurance, including middle- and higher-income families.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the 2008 and 2010 waves of the Health and Retirement Study to analyze the {{determinants}} of material hardship among individuals ages sixty-five and older, I look at five self-reported hardships: food insecurity, skipped meals, medication cutbacks, difficulty paying bills, and dissatisfaction with one's financial situation. One-fifth of the elderly report {{one or more of}} these hardships. Although hardship is more likely for those with low incomes, most older Americans experiencing hardship are not poor. I analyze whether alternative measures of resources do a better job of predicting hardship than does income relative to the federal poverty threshold. I find that spending relative to the poverty threshold does a worse job predicting hardship than does income relative to poverty. Subtracting <b>out-of-pocket</b> medical <b>spending</b> from income yields a measure that is an even better predictor of hardship. In multivariate models, I find that self-reported health, activity limitations, and disability are significant predictors of hardship. Having reliable children (as assessed by the respondent) or an able-bodied spouse reduces the likelihood of hardship. Poor health increases hardship through three channels: by lowering income, by increasing <b>out-of-pocket</b> medical <b>spending,</b> and through its direct effect on hardship. The first two of these—lower income and higher medical spending—are much less quantitatively important than the third; in a nutshell, poor health makes it harder to get by with less...|$|R

We find that out-of-pocket and informal payments have increased in real value throughout the years. Even though their catastrophic effect has gone down (due also to declining trends in absolute poverty), the effect for the poorest expenditure quintiles remains high. Out-of-pocket payments deepen the poverty headcount and also enlarge the poverty gap and again the effect is larger for the poorest quintiles. Future policy interventions should provide better protection mechanisms for the poor by providing exemption criteria or subsidised transport and should seek to address the widespread informal payments in the country. informal payments, out-of-pocket payments, health care expenditure, impoverishment, Albania LSMS, Albania, living standard, poverty...|$|R

50|$|Long-term care is {{typically}} funded {{using a combination}} of sources including but not limited to family members, Medicaid, long-term care insurance and Medicare. One of these includes <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>spending,</b> which often becomes exhausted once an individual requires more medical attention throughout the aging process and might need in-home care or be admitted into a nursing home. For many people, <b>out-of-pocket</b> <b>spending</b> for long-term care is a transitional state before eventually needing Medicaid coverage. Personal savings can be difficult to manage and budget and often deplete rapidly.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (1) to assess the utility of the economic theory of demand for insurance for modeling voluntary Medicare drug benefit enrollment decisions and (2) to explore the degree of adverse selection and crowd-out that might occur under a voluntary enrollment Medicare prescription benefit. Data were collected using a cross-sectional, mail survey of 2, 100 community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older in Wisconsin. Respondents were asked to evaluate their likelihood of enrollment in any of 4 hypothetical drug benefit plans under the assumption that they could enroll in one of the hypothetical plans or maintain their current coverage. Data analyses included bivariate comparisons across enrollment likelihood categories and logit analysis of enrollment likelihood as a function of respondent characteristics. 1041 usable survey forms were returned for an adjusted response rate of 51. 5 %. Older adults with 4 or more chronic conditions were most likely to report that they were “very likely” to enroll in one of the hypothetical drug plans, as were those with the highest <b>out-of-pocket</b> drug <b>spending</b> in the previous 30 days. Respondents with no or self-purchased drug benefits were more likely than those with employer-based plans to express a higher likelihood of enrollment in one of the hypothetical plans. Adverse selection may be problematic for a voluntary enrollment Medicare drug benefit. Given that high <b>out-of-pocket</b> drug <b>spending</b> (secondary to drug coverage source) was a consistent predictor of enrollment likelihood, demand-side factors affecting the crowding out of employer-based drug coverage sources by a voluntary enrollment drug benefit appear minimal. However, the availability of a Medicare prescription benefit may still lead to crowd-out through employer incentives...|$|R
