Klein set up a small team of editors who met regularly, making democratic decisions. The journal specialized in complex analysis, algebraic geometry, and invariant theory (at least until Hilbert killed the subject). It also provided an important outlet for real analysis and the new group theory.|$|E

The same year, he earned plaudits for his handling of England striker Alan Shearer in a World Cup qualifying game at Wembley Stadium. Shearer was then considered by the partisan English crowd {{to be the best}} striker in the world, and thought he would make fun of the inexperienced Italian defender. Nevertheless, in a display ranking alongside those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>best</b> Italian defenders Claudio Gentile and Franco Baresi, Cannavaro managed to keep Shearer quiet for the whole game. Italy won the game 1–0 courtesy of a Gianfranco Zola goal.|$|E

This fishery {{is one of the most}} important in the country, reportedly worth five million Australian dollars a year, as King George whiting fetch premium price in markets. This single species alone was reported as comprising 60% of the total annual catch in South Australia during the late 1980s.

25|$|The index {{typewriter}} {{was briefly}} popular in niche markets. Although they were slower than keyboard type machines they were mechanically simpler and lighter, they were therefore marketed as being suitable for travellers, {{and because they}} could be produced more cheaply then keyboard machines, as budget machines for users who needed to produce small quantities of typed correspondence. The index typewriter's niche appeal however soon disappeared, as {{on the one hand}} new keyboard typewriters became lighter and more portable and on the other refurbished second hand machines began to become available. The last widely available western index machine was the Mignon typewriter produced by AEG which was produced until 1934. Considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>best</b> of the index typewriters, part of the Mignon's popularity was that it featured both interchangeable indexes and type, allowing the use of different fonts and character sets, something very few keyboard machines allowed and only at considerable added cost.|$|E

25|$|A {{great deal}} had been {{actually}} accomplished for Panathinaikos (PAO) {{and the years}} to come would prove it. Alvertis was actually an amazing prospect at the time, almost 10cm (4inches) taller than the conventional shooting guard. His potential was proven to be great in the 1991 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship, where Alvertis led, alongside Panagiotis Liadelis, the Greek team to the silver medal. At the same time, Panathinaikos was going through a transition period during which the average team of the late 1980s strove to become a European powerhouse. Consequently, young Alvertis had to wait until the 1993–94 season to get significant playing time on a team that reached the EuroLeague Final Four that year. The star of the twenty-year-old player shone right away, particularly in the playoff series against Limoges CSP. Alvertis averaged 13 points, forcing Coach Božidar Maljković to declare that he already was to be counted as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>best</b> players in Europe.|$|E
