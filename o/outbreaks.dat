5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to <b>outbreaks</b> of some food-borne illnesses, {{including}} Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two <b>outbreaks</b> of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further <b>outbreaks</b> linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E

5|$|Influenza spreads {{around the}} world in a yearly outbreak, {{resulting}} in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the Northern and Southern parts of the world, <b>outbreaks</b> occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator <b>outbreaks</b> may occur at any time of the year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old and those with other health problems. Larger <b>outbreaks</b> known as pandemics are less frequent. In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (~50 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths). The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009. Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses and birds.|$|E

5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during <b>outbreaks</b> of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of <b>outbreaks.</b> When <b>outbreaks</b> cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If <b>outbreaks</b> spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E

30|$|The {{ability of}} the maxVoI model to detect <b>outbreak</b> sources with high {{accuracy}} and low surveillance nodes is related to determination of the most meaningful nodes (in terms of known information for describing <b>outbreak</b> patterns) via a portfolio model with Pareto optimization that explores all potential combinations of observers and corresponding <b>outbreak</b> information.
