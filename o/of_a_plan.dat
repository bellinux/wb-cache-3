5|$|After {{the death}} of Theobald III, Count of Champagne, the {{leadership}} of the Crusade passed to Boniface of Montferrat, a friend of the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia. Both Boniface and Philip had married into the Byzantine Imperial family. In fact, Philip's brother-in-law, Alexios Angelos, son of the deposed and blinded Emperor Isaac II Angelos, had appeared in Europe seeking aid and had made contacts with the crusaders. Alexios offered to reunite the Byzantine church with Rome, pay the crusaders 200,000 silver marks, join the crusade and provide all the supplies they needed to get to Egypt. Innocent was aware <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to divert the Crusade to Constantinople and forbade any attack on the city, but the papal letter arrived after the fleets had left Zara.|$|E
5|$|Burchard {{continued}} to hold the treasurership until at least October 1194, when he last is mentioned in the office.

In June 1195 both Burchard and his rival, Philip of Poitou, were at the royal court in Le Mans, presumably both attempting to secure the bishopric.

5|$|By December, {{there was}} still no word of García de Celís, nor had Spanish {{assistance}} arrived from any other direction, and the Spanish at Buena Esperanza had lost hope. They were pressed on all sides by hostile natives, with resistance led by Sicumba. Cerezeda got word <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> by Sicumba to assault Buena Esperanza and destroy it. In response he sent parties to seize and execute hostile Indian leaders, thus defusing the imminent threat, although Sicumba managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|During April 1864, the {{regiment}} {{became part of}} the 1st Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of West Virginia. General Crook returned to West Virginia to command the Army's infantry. General Averell became commander of the cavalry. On April 30, Crook and Averell departed Charleston for Virginia, using different routes, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to attack the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. The salt mine and lead mine located along the railroad were also targets.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a review}} of facilities, the US Navy elected to vacate the West Ruislip site, {{beginning}} on 30 June 2006. The final chapel service had been held on 5 June. Many operations returned to the United States, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to save $1 million each year. Staff redundancies involved 7 US service personnel, 55 civilian staff from the US Department of Defence and 95 British civilian staff. The base closed during a ceremony on 28 September, in which the American flag and Royal Air Force Ensign were lowered.|$|E

5|$|Hines {{went to the}} Confederate {{capital of}} Richmond, Virginia, after his escape in January 1864. He {{convinced}} Confederate President Jefferson Davis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to instill mass panic in the Northern states, by means of freeing prisoners and causing arson in larger Northern cities. Impressed by Hines' plan, Davis agreed to back him. Davis urged Hines to tell Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin and Secretary of War James Seddon his plan. Both men agreed to the plan, and encouraged Hines to proceed, with the only hesitation by Davis, Benjamin and Sheldon being the effect on public opinion on such a plan, including what Great Britain and France would think of Hines' actions.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, a new {{railroad}} {{bridge was}} constructed {{adjacent to the}} Long Bridge as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to strengthen the logistics of the Army of the Potomac as it operated in northern Virginia. An extension of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, the bridge would be used until {{the turn of the}} century before being replaced. Owing to the weight of the railroad and the weak strength of the bridge, no locomotives were allowed on the bridge. Prior to crossing the Potomac, the train would detach its locomotive and be pulled across the bridge by a team of horses.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, William Barber's {{successor}} {{as chief}} engraver, his son Charles E. Barber, slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins {{about that time}} suggest that he most likely did it as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to re-engrave all denominations. The most significant change made by Charles Barber was smoothing {{the back of the}} eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles, after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.|$|E

5|$|In 1959 The Angel {{was closed}} and sold to the London County Council as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to {{demolish}} it {{to make way for}} a new road scheme at the Angel intersection. It was used temporarily by the City University. Finsbury merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Islington to form the London Borough of Islington in 1965 and ownership of the site passed to the Greater London Council. The proposals for demolition of the site along with road changes were opposed by Homes before Roads and the Islington Society. Plans to alter the intersection and create a layout similar to that at Old Street roundabout were abandoned and the building was saved from demolition.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{as part of}} a state-brokered deal, LILCO's power {{generation}} facilities, including the Glenwood plant, were absorbed into KeySpan Energy, with the public Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) taking over transmission and delivery functions. In 2001, LIPA proposed building two mini-turbines at Glenwood Landing as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to build ten such plants across Long Island to avoid the risk of rolling blackouts in the face of increased demand like those experienced in California the previous year. The pair of turbines produced 79 MW, just under an 80 MW threshold that would have triggered a full regulatory and environmental review. The new turbines were completed by May 2002, and were the first of the ten to enter operation.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, Frank {{began to}} find that Judy was more {{aggressive}} towards the Japanese and Korean guards. Although he'd normally send her into the jungle to avoid them, on one occasion, the guards gave chase and shot at the dog. He later found Judy bleeding from the shoulder {{where she had been}} grazed by the bullet. He covered the wound with some palm fronds, but could do nothing else to treat or reward her. After moving camps once more, Judy was sentenced to death by the Japanese as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> to control a lice breakout. She disappeared for three days, with guards conducting sweeps in an attempt to find her. She only reappeared when the Japanese forces abandoned the camp.|$|E
