25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{misrepresentation}}: fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds,</b> and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.|$|E

If operated away from a power point or ley line, they require regular recharging by some other means, which in one instance in the series involves the sacrifice of captive humans for their life energy which is used to power the crystal.

In 1987, the organisation benefitted by being primarily funded from The Community Chest of Singapore, and in 1993 MINDS became the largest voluntary welfare organisation in Singapore, with AESN in second place. Relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MINDS</b> special schools, from premises of closed-down primary schools to new buildings with customised facilities, began in 1998. The association started their first social enterprise, a car washing service along Pasir Panjang Road, in 2001.

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{interpretation}} is to overcome the fundamentally strange concept of observers being in a superposition with themselves. In their 1988 paper, Albert and Loewer argue that it simply makes no sense for one {{to think of the}} mind of an observer to be in a indefinite state. Rather, when someone answers the question about which state of a system they have observed, they must answer with complete certainty. If they are in a superposition of states, then this certainty is not possible and we arrive at a contradiction. To overcome this, they then suggest that it is merely the “bodies” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> that are in a superposition, and that the minds must have definite states that are never in superposition ...|$|E

[...] Dietrich Bonhoeffer of the German Confessing Church framed the same characterization in less positive terms when he called Pietism the last attempt to save Christianity as a religion: Given that for him religion was a negative term, more or less an opposite to revelation, this constitutes a rather scathing judgment. Bonhoeffer denounced the basic aim of Pietism, to produce a [...] "desired piety" [...] in a person, as unbiblical.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order for}} a {{contract}} to be formed, the parties must reach mutual assent (also called a meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds).</b> This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which {{is known as the}} [...] "mirror image rule". An offer is a definite statement of the offeror's willingness to be bound should certain conditions be met. If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer. The Uniform Commercial Code disposes of the mirror image rule in §2-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA. As a court cannot read minds, the intent of the parties is interpreted objectively {{from the perspective of a}} reasonable person, as determined in the early English case of Smith v Hughes [...] It is important to note that where an offer specifies a particular mode of acceptance, only an acceptance communicated via that method will be valid.|$|E
2500|$|The best {{indicator}} of teacher quality, according to Dewey, {{is the ability}} to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses he or her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904). [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily good teachers. [...] The explanation is simple. [...] They have a quick, sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> they are in contact with. [...] Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.36). [...] Such a teacher is genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind to mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.|$|E
