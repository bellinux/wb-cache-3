40|$|Ozone is {{a strong}} {{oxidizer}} that can kill bacteria and other micro-organisms very effectively. In the recent years, ozone has become very important for sterilization of water used in shrimp farming and treatment of wastewater from food industry. However, ozonisers available in the markets are very expensive and have low energy-efficiency. In this work, a highly-efficient and low-cost system that can produce high-concentrations of ozone gas and dissolved ozone in water has been developed. The system consists of a dried air unit, high-voltage rf power supply, <b>ozoniser</b> tubes and venturi injector. The tubes are designed and configured to convert oxygen gas to ozone gas by atmospheric surface glow barrier discharge. </p...|$|E

High-voltage {{high-frequency}} {{power supply}} using voltage-fed load resonant inverter with a series-compensated resonant inductor {{has been developed}} for efficient atmospheric surface glow barrier discharges(ASGBD). It produces a controllable frequency and sinusoidal alternating voltage output. The maximum output voltage is about 6 kV peak to peak. Resonant power converter can be tune easily to the resonant frequency of the load. Operating frequency varies according to the load and voltage level typically {{in the range of}} 10 kHz and 1 MHz range. The output voltage is controlled by using pulse width modulation technique. The power supply developed in this paper is applied successfully for <b>ozoniser</b> that can produce high concentrate ozone by using ASGBD for agricultural industry applications...|$|E
40|$|The bachelorÂ´s {{thesis is}} focused on the study of {{influence}} of adsorbed gases on the electrode surface on ozone generation in dielectric barrier discharge. The theoretical part describes some basic properties and applications of ozone, methods of its generation, determination and interaction with the solid surfaces. In the experimental part was studied formation of ozone by the recombination of molecules and atoms of oxygen on the wall of electrodes and also its destruction caused by the reaction with particles present in closed <b>ozoniser</b> without discharge. Ozone was generated in cylindrical configuration system of electrodes made of staniless steel and alumina ceramics as dielectric material. Several series of experiments were measured by using various operating gases (oxygen; oxygen and argon; oxygen and nitrogen). It was also examined the decrease of generated ozone concentration in long-term operation by using pure oxygen of 99, 999 90 % as a feeding gas. The resulting ozone concentration for given reaction time of individual measurements was determined by the method of absorption spectrometry...|$|E
