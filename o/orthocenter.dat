The midpoints of the diagonals are collinear, and (as proved by Isaac Newton) also collinear with {{the center of a}} conic that is tangent to all four lines of the quadrilateral. Any three of the lines of the quadrilateral form the sides of a triangle; the <b>orthocenters</b> of the four triangles formed in this way lie on a second line, perpendicular to the one through the midpoints. The circumcircles of these same four triangles meet in a point. In addition, the three circles having the diagonals as diameters belong to a common pencil of circles the axis of which is the line through the <b>orthocenters.</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{altitude}} of a triangle is {{a straight line}} through a vertex and perpendicular to (i.e. forming a right angle with) the opposite side.

The length of the altitude is the distance between the base and the vertex. The three altitudes intersect in a single point, called the <b>orthocenter</b> of the triangle, usually denoted by H.

25|$|Gaspard Monge found {{a center}} {{that exists in}} every {{tetrahedron}}, {{now known as the}} Monge point: the point where the six midplanes of a tetrahedron intersect. A midplane is defined as a plane that is orthogonal to an edge joining any two vertices that also contains the centroid of an opposite edge formed by joining the other two vertices. If the tetrahedron's altitudes do intersect, then the Monge point and the <b>orthocenter</b> coincide to give the class of orthocentric tetrahedron.|$|E
25|$|The center T of the {{twelve-point}} sphere also {{lies on the}} Euler line. Unlike its triangular counterpart, {{this center}} lies {{one third of the}} way from the Monge point M towards the circumcenter. Also, an orthogonal line through T to a chosen face is coplanar with two other orthogonal lines to the same face. The first is an orthogonal line passing through the corresponding Euler point to the chosen face. The second is an orthogonal line passing through the centroid of the chosen face. This orthogonal line through the twelve-point center lies midway between the Euler point orthogonal line and the centroidal orthogonal line. Furthermore, for any face, the twelve-point center lies at the midpoint of the corresponding Euler point and the <b>orthocenter</b> for that face.|$|E

The remaining six intersection points of these nine-point circles each concur with the midpoints of the four triangles. Remarkably, there exists a unique nine-point conic, centered at the centroid of these four arbitrary points, that passes through all seven points of intersection of these nine-point circles. Furthermore because of the Feuerbach conic theorem mentioned above, there exists a unique rectangular circumconic, centered at the common intersection point of the four nine-point circles, that passes through the four original arbitrary points {{as well as the}} <b>orthocenters</b> of the four triangles.|$|R
40|$|The results {{presented}} in this dissertation refer to the geometry of Minkowski spaces, i. e., of real finite-dimensional Banach spaces. First we study geometric properties of radial projections of bisectors in Minkowski spaces, especially {{the relation between the}} geometric structure of radial projections and Birkhoff orthogonality. As an application of our results it is shown that for any Minkowski space there exists a number, which plays somehow the role that $\sqrt 2 $ plays in Euclidean space. This number {{is referred to as the}} critical number of any Minkowski space. Lower and upper bounds on the critical number are given, and the cases when these bounds are attained are characterized. Moreover, with the help of the properties of bisectors we show that a linear map from a normed linear space $X$ to another normed linear space $Y$ preserves isosceles orthogonality if and only if it is a scalar multiple of a linear isometry. Further on, we examine the two tangent segments from any exterior point to the unit circle, the relation between the length of a chord of the unit circle and the length of the arc corresponding to it, the distances from the normalization of the sum of two unit vectors to those two vectors, and the extension of the notions of orthocentric systems and <b>orthocenters</b> in Euclidean plane into Minkowski spaces. Also we prove theorems referring to chords of Minkowski circles and balls which are either concurrent or parallel. All these discussions yield many interesting characterizations of the Euclidean spaces among all (strictly convex) Minkowski spaces. In the final chapter we investigate the relation between the length of a closed curve and the length of its midpoint curve as well as the length of its image under the so-called halving pair transformation. We show that the image curve under the halving pair transformation is convex provided the original curve is convex. Moreover, we obtain several inequalities to show the relation between the halving distance and other quantities well known in convex geometry. It is known that the lower bound for the geometric dilation of rectifiable simple closed curves in the Euclidean plane is $\pi/ 2 $, which can be attained only by circles. We extend this result to Minkowski planes by proving that the lower bound for the geometric dilation of rectifiable simple closed curves in a Minkowski plane $X$ is analogously a quarter of the circumference of the unit circle $S_X$ of $X$, but can also be attained by curves that are not Minkowskian circles. In addition we show that the lower bound is attained only by Minkowskian circles if the respective norm is strictly convex. Also we give a sufficient condition for the geometric dilation of a closed convex curve to be larger than a quarter of the perimeter of the unit circle...|$|R
