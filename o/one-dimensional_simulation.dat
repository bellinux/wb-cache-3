Two types of simulation were undertaken. The {{first was a}} <b>one-dimensional</b> <b>simulation</b> of the entire facility and the second was a hybrid sim-ulation, combining a <b>one-dimensional</b> <b>simulation</b> of the shock tube section with a two-dimensional simulation of the acceler-ation tube.

Using data taken from the two-dimensional simulation of the expansion tube as a transient inflow condition, modelling was undertaken of a free shear layer experiment being conducted in the facility.

40|$|Using {{detailed}} kinetic {{models in}} {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulations is extremely challenging {{because of the large}} number of species that need to be considered and the stiffness of the associated set of differential equations. The high computational cost associated with using a detail-ea kinetic network in CFD <b>simulations</b> is why <b>one-dimensional</b> <b>simulations</b> are still used, although this leads to substantial differences compared to reference three-dimensional simulations. Therefore, a methodology was developed that,allows one to use, detailed single-event microkinetic Models in CFD simulations by on the fly application of the pseudo-steady-state assumption to the radical reaction intermediates. Depending on the reaction model size, a speed-up factor of More than 50 was obtained compared to the standard ANSYS Fluent routines without losing accuracy. As proof of concept, propane steam cracking in a conventional bare reactor and a helicoidally finned reactor was simulated using a reaction model containing 85 species: 41 radicals and 44 transported species. Next to a drastic speedup of the simulations due to the kinetic network reduction technique, significant differences were observed between the bare and the finned reactor in the three-dimensional simulations. In particular, the ethene selectivity is reduced by 0. 20 % by application of the helicoidally finned reactor.
