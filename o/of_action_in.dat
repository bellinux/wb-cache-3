5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> <b>In</b> the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Braham was not {{satisfied}} with his current score-rate and lack <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> September 1943. Consequently, he flew a number of missions against ground targets. Successful night fighter pilots were ordered {{not to engage in}} such activities that exposed them to excessive risk. On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft. On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged the underside of the fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects. After one sortie against shipping the armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when they opened the panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Hard Target was Woo's first American {{film and}} {{was also the first}} major Hollywood film made by a Chinese {{director}}. Universal Pictures was nervous about having Woo direct a feature, and sent in director Sam Raimi to look over the film's production and to take Woo's place as director if he were to fail. Woo went through several scripts finding mostly martial arts films with which he was not interested. After deciding on Chuck Pfarrer's script for Hard Target, Woo wanted to have actor Kurt Russell in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. Woo then went with Universal's initial choice of having Jean-Claude Van Damme star. Woo got along with Van Damme during filming and raised the amount <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the film as he knew that Van Damme was up for it.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are a {{superfamily}} {{of proteins}} with similar structures that were first identified for their protease inhibition activity and {{are found in}} all kingdoms of life. The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (serine protease inhibitors). They are notable for their unusual mechanism <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> <b>in</b> which they irreversibly inhibit their target protease by undergoing a large conformational change to disrupt its active site. This contrasts with the more common competitive mechanism for protease inhibitors that bind to and block access to the protease active site.|$|E
5|$|That same year, {{he joined}} the Schutzstaffel (SS) as an SS-Führer (SS-Leader); his SS number was 168. The SS, {{initially}} part of the much larger SA, was formed in 1923 for Hitler's personal protection, and was re-formed in 1925 as an elite unit of the SA. Himmler's first leadership position in the SS was that of SS-Gauführer (district leader) in Lower Bavaria from 1926. Strasser appointed Himmler deputy propaganda chief in January 1927. As was typical in the NSDAP, he had considerable freedom <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> his post, which increased over time. He began to collect statistics {{on the number of}} Jews, Freemasons, and enemies of the party, and following his strong need for control, he developed an elaborate bureaucracy. In September 1927, Himmler told Hitler of his vision to transform the SS into a loyal, powerful, racially pure elite unit. Convinced that Himmler was the man for the job, Hitler appointed him Deputy Reichsführer-SS, with the rank of SS-Oberführer.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} combat for 3rd Battalion in 1968 came on 7 February, {{about a week}} after the Tet Offensive began, when Kilo Company engaged a PAVN {{battalion}} near Gio Linh. 29 Kilo Marines were killed, including PFC Robert Quick who was awarded a posthumous Navy Cross for deflecting a PAVN hand grenade. Another 31 were wounded, including PFC Craig Swartz who was wounded three times and received three purple hearts for his service. PAVN losses numbered at least 139, with another 60 graves discovered by 3rd Battalion Marines three days later. That same month a platoon from Mike Company observed and damaged two PAVN PT-76 tanks near Alpha 3, one of only three times they were encountered during the Vietnam War before 1972. On 6 March, Mike Company blundered into the 27th Regiment of the PAVN 325th Division and had one-third of the company put out <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> an all-night engagement, including 14 Marines killed.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, these roads {{remained}} rudimentary {{and were}} impassible {{in bad weather}} and a nuisance in good weather, which limited the economic possibilities of those regions of Delaware and Maryland. The Good Roads Movement in the 1890s and 1900s spurred investment and advocacy for constructing all-weather roads that connected the population centers of the states, although the instigating forces in each state were different.

5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1705 the Russian Field Marshal Boris Sheremetyev set up {{a meeting}} with the Saxon general Otto Arnold von Paykull in order to agree to a common course <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the ensuing campaign. The basis for the {{strategy}} was a plan developed by Johann Patkul as early as 1703, which envisioned a joint strike which would neutralize the Swedish army. von Paykull, inspired by Patkul's blueprint, advocated {{it as a way to}} lure Charles and the main Swedish army out of Greater Poland eastward towards Brest-Litovsk. This was to be accomplished by having the combined forces of the main Russian army under Ogilvy and von Paykull's troops stationed at Brest, which would force Charles to meet them in battle. At the same time the main Saxon army would attack Charles from the rear by sweeping through Poland out of Saxony, ultimately catching the Swedish army exposed. The plan seemed rather daring to Patkul and he suggested that the allies should first crush Lewenhaupt's army, before Ogilvy's troops approached Charles. Otherwise Ogilvy's rear would be threatened. A compromise was made between the two strategies and it was decided that Sheremetyev should engage Lewenhaupt at the same time as Ogilvy marched towards the strongly fortified city of Grodno. The belief was that there, behind fortifications, Oglivy would be able to withstand Charles long enough for the main Saxon army to arrive from Kraków. Meanwhile, von Paykull would attack with his combined Saxon–Polish force towards Warsaw in order to interrupt the coronation of Stanisław I.|$|E
5|$|In {{over half}} of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers—all men <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> <b>In</b> the rest he played {{a wide range of}} characters, {{included}} doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players. Cooper's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career. In his early films, he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues (The Virginian). After becoming a major star, his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas (A Farewell to Arms). During the height of his career, from 1936 to 1943, he played a new type of hero—a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others (Mr. Deeds, Meet John Doe, and For Whom the Bell Tolls). In the post-war years, Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone (The Fountainhead and High Noon). In his final films, Cooper's hero rejects the violence of the past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption (Friendly Persuasion and Man of the West). The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero—a tall, handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man.|$|E
