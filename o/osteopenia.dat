5|$|The most {{significant}} {{adverse effects of}} long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight <b>osteopenia.</b> Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face. These effects begin to reverse quickly upon return to the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Humans evolved {{for life}} in Earth gravity, and {{exposure}} to weightlessness {{has been shown to}} have deleterious effects on the health of the human body. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight <b>osteopenia.</b> These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{effects of}} {{long-term}} weightlessness include muscle atrophy, {{deterioration of the}} skeleton (<b>osteopenia),</b> fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, and puffiness of the face.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol has a {{profound}} effect on bone. Individuals without it (or other estrogens) will become tall and eunuchoid, as epiphyseal closure is delayed or may not take place. Bone structure is affected also, resulting in early <b>osteopenia</b> and osteoporosis. Also, women past menopause experience an accelerated loss of bone mass due to a relative estrogen deficiency.|$|E
25|$|X-rays of {{the hands}} and feet are {{generally}} performed when many joints affected. In RA, {{there may be no}} changes {{in the early stages of}} the disease or the x-ray may show <b>osteopenia</b> near the joint, soft tissue swelling, and a smaller than normal joint space. As the disease advances, there may be bony erosions and subluxation. Other medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are also used in RA.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{radiography}} is useful, both {{by itself}} and {{in conjunction with}} CT or MRI, for detecting complications of <b>osteopenia</b> (reduced bone mass; pre-osteoporosis), such as fractures; for differential diagnosis of osteopenia; or for follow-up examinations in specific clinical settings, such as soft tissue calcifications, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteomalacia in renal osteodystrophy. However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires {{a substantial amount of}} bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images.|$|E
25|$|Cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts (CRMCC) {{is a rare}} genetic disorder, {{which affects}} {{multiple}} organs. Its hallmarks are widespread progressive calcifications, cysts and abnormalities of the white matter of the brain, usually occurring together with abnormalities of the blood vessels of the retina. Additional features include poor prenatal growth, preterm birth, anemia, <b>osteopenia</b> and bone fractures, and gastrointestinal bleeding. It is caused by compound heterozygous mutations in the conserved telomere maintenance component 1 (CTC1) gene, but its exact pathophysiology is still not well understood.|$|E
25|$|To prevent some {{of these}} adverse {{physiological}} effects, the ISS is equipped with two treadmills (including the COLBERT), and the aRED (advanced Resistive Exercise Device), which enable various weight-lifting exercises which add muscle but do nothing for bone density, and a stationary bicycle; each astronaut spends {{at least two hours}} per day exercising on the equipment. Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill. Astronauts subject to long periods of weightlessness wear pants with elastic bands attached between waistband and cuffs to compress the leg bones and reduce <b>osteopenia.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1998 Tour de France, {{when the}} Tour began in Dublin, Ireland, Boardman won the prologue but crashed {{out of the}} race on stage 2 while wearing the yellow jersey. In 1998 he was {{diagnosed}} with <b>osteopenia</b> due to low testosterone levels. Treatment to prevent worsening in this condition would have required him to take testosterone, which is banned under anti-doping rules. The UCI refused to allow Boardman an exemption on medical grounds. Faced with either retiring to allow treatment for his osteoporosis, or continuing to cycle without taking testosterone, Boardman chose to continue in cycling untreated for a further two years, hoping to finish his career on a high note at the 2000 Summer Olympics.|$|E
25|$|In {{mice and}} humans, {{alterations}} in serotonin levels and signalling {{have been shown}} to regulate bone mass. Mice that lack brain serotonin have <b>osteopenia,</b> while mice that lack gut serotonin have high bone density. In humans, increased blood serotonin levels {{have been shown to}} be significant negative predictor of low bone density. Serotonin can also be synthesized, albeit at very low levels, in the bone cells. It mediates its actions on bone cells using three different receptors. Through 5-HT1B receptors, it negatively regulates bone mass, while it does so positively through 5-HT2B receptors and 5-HT2C receptors. There is very delicate balance between physiological role of gut serotonin and its pathology. Increase in the extracellular content of serotonin results in a complex relay of signals in the osteoblasts culminating in FoxO1/ Creb and ATF4 dependent transcriptional events. These studies have opened a new area of research in bone metabolism that can be potentially harnessed to treat bone mass disorders.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia nervosa causes {{alterations}} {{in the female}} reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a cessation of menstruation in women who are past puberty. In patients with anorexia nervosa, there is a reduction of the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the central nervous system, preventing ovulation. Anorexia nervosa can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotrophins in people with anorexia nervosa has been documented. Typically, growth hormone (GH) levels are high, but levels of IGF-1, the downstream hormone that should be released in response to GH are low; this indicates a state of “resistance” to GH due to chronic starvation. IGF-1 is necessary for bone formation, and decreased levels in anorexia nervosa contribute {{to a loss of}} bone density and potentially contribute to <b>osteopenia</b> or osteoporosis. Anorexia nervosa can also result in reduction of peak bone mass. Buildup of bone is greatest during adolescence, and if onset of anorexia nervosa occurs during this time and stalls puberty, low bone mass may be permanent.|$|E
25|$|Primidone, {{along with}} {{phenytoin}} and phenobarbital, {{is one of}} the anticonvulsants most heavily associated with bone diseases such as osteoporosis, <b>osteopenia</b> (which can precede osteoporosis), osteomalacia and fractures. The populations usually said to be most at risk are institutionalized people, postmenopausal women, older men, people taking more than one anticonvulsant, and children, who are also at risk of rickets. However, {{it has been suggested that}} bone demineralization is most pronounced in young people (25–44 years of age) and one 1987 study of institutionalized people found that the rate of osteomalacia in the ones taking anticonvulsantsone out of nineteen individuals taking an anticonvulsant (vs. none among the thirty-seven people taking none) was similar to that expected in elderly people. The authors speculated that this was due to improvements in diet, sun exposure and exercise in response to earlier findings, and/or that this was because it was sunnier in London than in the Northern European countries which had earlier reported this effect. In any case, the use of more than one anticonvulsant has been associated with an increased prevalence of bone disease in institutionalized epilepsy patients versus institutionalized people who did not have epilepsy. Likewise, postmenopausal women taking anticonvulsants have a greater risk of fracture than their drug-naive counterparts.|$|E
500|$|X-rays {{may also}} be used to {{diagnose}} the disease. Usually, these X-rays will show extremely thin bones, which are often bowed or fractured. However, such symptoms are also associated with other bone diseases, such as <b>osteopenia</b> or osteoporosis. Generally, the first bones to show symptoms via X-ray are the fingers. Furthermore, brown tumors, especially when manifested on facial bones, can be misdiagnosed as cancerous. Radiographs distinctly show bone resorption and X-rays of the skull may depict an image often described as [...] "ground glass" [...] or [...] "salt and pepper". [...] Dental X-rays {{may also be}} abnormal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Osteopenia</b> is a {{condition}} in which bone mineral density is lower than normal. It is considered by many doctors to be a precursor to osteoporosis.

50|$|Recent {{studies found}} a clear {{association}} between long-term anticoagulant treatment (OAC) and reduced bone quality due to reduction of active osteocalcin. OAC {{might lead to}} an increased incidence of fractures, reduced bone mineral density or content, <b>osteopenia,</b> and increased serum levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin. Bone mineral density was significantly lower in stroke patients with long-term warfarin treatment compared to untreated patients and <b>osteopenia</b> was probably an effect of warfarin-interference with vitamin K recycling.|$|E
