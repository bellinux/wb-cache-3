40|$|The {{effect on}} {{commercial}} banks {{of exposure to}} large amounts of developing country debt has been a topic of increasing concern in recent years. Fear of default {{on the part of}} the debtor countries has led to fears for the solvency of the creditor banks since in many cases the total of <b>outstanding</b> <b>exposure</b> to risky debtors exceeds the entire capital base of the banks involved. The paper presents a first effort towards measuring the effects of LDC debt exposure on the market value of large commercial value banks in the United States. Our results indicate that exposure to developing country debt has exerted a measurable and significant negative effect on the ratio of market to book value for these banks. ...|$|E
30|$|In {{line with}} the {{standards}} of the European System of National and Regional Accounts, we consider the euro area economy as an open economy composed by four macro sectors: i) the financial sector; ii) the non-financial private sector (or the real sector); iii) the non-financial public sector; and iv) the rest of the world. The financial sector comprises i) the Eurosystem, i.e., the European Central Bank and the National Central Banks (ECB&NCB) of the nineteen countries that have adopted the euro in stage three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) 8; ii) Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem (MFI excl. ECB&NCB), i.e., the private banking system and money market funds; iii) Other Financial Institutions (OFI), such as saving and loan associations 9, credit unions 10, shadow banks 11, Islamic banks 12, etc.; iv) Investment Funds other than the Money Market Funds (Non-MMF IF); and v) Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds (IC&PF). The real sector includes i) Households and non-profit institutions serving households, such as charities and trade unions (HH); and ii) Non-Financial Corporations (NFC). Lastly, the non-financial public sector consists of General Governments (GG), while the sector Rest of the World (RW) includes the financial sector, the real sector and the non-financial public sector, at an aggregate level, operating in non-euro area countries, with an <b>outstanding</b> <b>exposure</b> to the institutional sectors operating in the euro area countries. The institutional sectors considered in our study with relative acronyms and definitions are summarized in Additional file  1 : Table SI 1.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe <b>outstanding</b> <b>exposure</b> of {{deformation}} bands in a multilayer {{sequence of the}} Orange quarry, Provence, France, motivates a study investigating the development and controls of deformation band geometries by field mapping combined with finite element modeling. Field mapping yields new insights into angular relations between, and evolution of, the {{deformation bands}} as well as provides input parameters for the setup and boundary conditions of the numerical simulations using ADELI 2 D. In particular, reverse-sense deformation bands are found to have developed within {{three of the four}} exposed layers of the multilayer stack with similar orientations to bedding, indicating layer-parallel contraction. Numerical simulations, carried out as a parametric study to investigate the influence on deformation band development and geometry, successfully reproduce the sequential development of deformation bands in the three layers as seen in the field as well as recreate the observed angular geometries of similar to 39 degrees to the maximum compression. This angular relationship is put into context with observations from other field studies and theoretical values to explore controls of deformation band orientations. Furthermore, band localization is impeded in the model by increased layer cohesive strength, demonstrating the importance of host-rock property variations on where localization of bands within the multilayer sequence. Results from both field investigation and numerical simulations are consistent with regional tectonics, where the strata underwent gentle folding due to thrust faulting at depth, and bring further insight into the development and geometry of deformation bands in both extensional and contractional tectonic regimes...|$|E

40|$|As {{indicated}} {{on the title}} page, this book is {{an outgrowth of the}} NATO Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on Chemical Transport in Metasomatic Processes, which was held in Greece, June 3 - 16, 1985. The ASI consisted of five days of invited lectures, poster sessions, and discussion at the Club Poseidon near Loutraki, Corinthia, followed by a two-day field trip in Corinthia and Attica. The second week of the ASI consisted of an excursion aboard M/S Zeus, M/Y Dimitrios II, and the M/S Irini to four of the Cycladic Islands to visit, study, and sample <b>outstanding</b> <b>exposures</b> of metasomatic activity on Syros, Siphnos, Seriphos, and Naxos. Nine­ teen invited lectures and 10 session chairmen/discussion leaders participated in the ASI, which was attended by a total of 92 professional scientists and graduate stu­ dents from 15 countries. Seventeen of the invited lectures and the Field Excursion Guide are included in this volume, together with 10 papers and six abstracts representing contributed poster sessions. Although more than two years has elapsed since the ASI, all of the papers in this volume are up to date, and each has benefited from stimulating discussion, critical comment, and scientific interaction, both at the ASI and in the subsequent peer review process. The scientific emphasis of the ASI focused initially on upper mantle metasoma­ tism and crust/mantle interaction. Isotopic evidence was presented indicating that upper mantle peridotites have undergone nonequilibrium metasomatic exchange with an external oxygen-bearing fluid...|$|R

The Adelaide Geosyncline is considered as a deformed sedimentary basin located between the Paleoproterozoic Gawler and Curnamona crystalline basement complexes. A suite of Late Neoproterozoic clastic sediments are widely deposited in the Flinders Ranges, South Australia. From the Proterozoic to the Cambrian, this area was a passive margin system. The <b>outstanding</b> <b>exposures</b> in this region allow detailed study of the sedimentary structures of analogous basins around the world, which often contain similar styles of source rocks and petroleum reservoirs. The Bonney Sandstone in the Northern Flinders Ranges is {{the lower part of the}} coarser, shallow-marine Pound Subgroup. This project provides an opportunity to examine relatively undescribed strata in this area. During the fieldtrip, my investigation consists of two detailed measured stratigraphic sections, which reveal a few well-preserved primary sedimentary structures. Many detailed sedimentological analysis were done during the study, including the measurement of strata and petrography. Several lithofacies were summarized and the associations of them were discovered. The characteristics of sedimentation are influenced by the paleocurrent, sediment supply and basin development. Both the modelling of this sedimentary process and the palaeogeography of the Neoproterozoic of South Australia are required to better understand the sedimentary character in the Northern Flinders Ranges.

40|$|The serum {{activities}} of the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, ornithine carbamyl transferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase were examined in 47 paint industry workers and unexposed age matched referents. The workers were exposed to a mixture of industrial solvents, of which xylene was the main component in most cases. The median total exposure was about 50 % of Swedish 1981 threshold limit values according to measurements of individual solvent exposure performed at the same time. No differences in enzyme activities were shown either when the whole exposed and referent groups were compared or when the five workers with <b>outstanding</b> solvent <b>exposures</b> of five times the TLV or more were compared with their referents. It is concluded that in most workers the liver seems to remain largely undamaged from inhalation exposure to a commonly used mixture of non-chlorinated solvents.

40|$|The Sunnyside Member of the Upper Cretaceous Blackhawk Formation in the Book Cliffs {{of eastern}} Utah {{provides}} an ideal opportunity to investigate high-resolution sequence-stratigraphic correlation between shallow-marine and terrestrial strata {{in an area}} of <b>outstanding</b> outcrop <b>exposure.</b> The thick, laterally extensive coal seam that caps the Sunnyside Member is critical for correlating between its shallow-marine and terrestrial components. Petrographic analysis of 281 samples obtained from 7 vertical sections spanning more than 30 km (18 mi) of depositional dip enabled us to recognize a series of transgressive-regressive coal facies trends in the seam. On this basis, we were able to identify a high-resolution record of accommodation change throughout the deposition of the coal, as well as a series of key sequence-stratigraphic surfaces. The stratigraphic relationships between the coal and the siliciclastic components of the Sunnyside Member enable us to correlate this record with that identified in the time-equivalent shallow-marine strata and to demonstrate that the coal spans the formation of two marine parasequences and two high-frequency, fourth-order sequence boundaries. This study has important implications for improving the understanding of sequence-stratigraphic expression in terrestrial strata and for correlating between marine and terrestrial records of base-level change. It may also have implications for improving the predictability of vertical and lateral variations in coal composition for mining and coalbed methane projects...|$|R
