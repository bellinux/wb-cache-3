5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like <b>other</b> <b>poultry,</b> dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E

Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs. <b>Other</b> <b>poultry</b> eggs including those of duck and quail are also eaten. Fish eggs are called roe and caviar.|$|E

25|$|H5N1 {{is mainly}} spread by {{domestic}} poultry, both through {{the movements of}} infected birds and poultry products and {{through the use of}} infected poultry manure as fertilizer or feed. Humans with H5N1 have typically caught it from chickens, which were in turn infected by <b>other</b> <b>poultry</b> or waterfowl. Migrating waterfowl (wild ducks, geese and swans) carry H5N1, often without becoming sick. Many species of birds and mammals can be infected with HPAI A(H5N1), but the role of animals other than poultry and waterfowl as disease-spreading hosts is unknown.|$|E

500|$|The Chicken Dinner Bar {{had been}} {{a product of the}} Sperry Candy Company, which was {{acquired}} by Pearson’s in 1962.

[...] The bar did not contain chicken or <b>other</b> <b>poultry</b> products, but was, rather, a chocolate-covered nut roll. [...] Pearson’s discontinued the bar’s production after the acquisition.

2500|$|In the United States, squab is [...] "increasingly a {{specialty}} item", as the larger and cheaper chicken has mostly displaced it. However, squab produced from specially raised utility pigeons continues to grace the menus of American haute cuisine restaurants such as Le Cirque and the French Laundry, and has enjoyed endorsements from some celebrity chefs. Accordingly, squab is often sold for much higher prices than <b>other</b> <b>poultry,</b> sometimes {{as high as}} eight USD per pound.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{relative}} ease of raising pigeons, squab is [...] "not usually considered" [...] {{in terms of}} its potential for food security. In parts of the developed world, squab meat is thought of as exotic or distasteful by consumers because they view feral pigeons as unsanitary urban pests. However, squab meat is regarded as safer than some <b>other</b> <b>poultry</b> products as it harbors fewer pathogens, and may be served between medium and well done.|$|E

Frozen whole turkeys remain popular. Sliced turkey is frequently used as a sandwich meat or served as cold cuts; in some cases, where recipes call for chicken, turkey can be used as a substitute. Additionally, ground turkey is frequently marketed as a healthy ground beef substitute. Without careful preparation, cooked turkey may end up less moist than <b>other</b> <b>poultry</b> meats, such as chicken or duck.|$|E
2500|$|The HOD sent {{delegates to}} visit foie gras farms. One delegate, Robert P Gordon of New Jersey, {{indicated}} his personal position changed drastically after the visit. He also testified tube feeding is less distressing than taking the rectal temperature {{of a cat}} and urged the AVMA {{to take a position}} based on science, not emotion, while cautioning against anthropomorphism. [...] The New York delegation offered their opinion that opponents of foie gras were intending to create a wedge issue; that the arguments used against foie gras would be modified to be used against other livestock production. [...] The testimony of the delegate from the Association of Avian Veterinarians was that medicating and feeding sick birds via tube was a normal practice that birds accepted without stress. [...] Another delegate who toured the farms stated that the birds appeared to be well cared for and better off than <b>other</b> <b>poultry</b> raised in factory farming. [...] The overall position of the House of Delegates was that [...] "observations and practical experience shared by HOD members indicate a minimum of adverse effects on the birds involved." [...] The closing comments in the HOD were that the AVMA should be taking positions on facts and science, make broad policy positions on general animal welfare, and support positions that created oversight of controversial practices for fear that prohibition would cause production to move to countries without animal welfare regulation.|$|E
