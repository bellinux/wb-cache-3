50|$|The {{drawback}} to {{this approach is}} that MPPT system can only be applied to the array as a whole. Because the I-V curve is non-linear, a panel that is even slightly shadowed can have dramatically lower output, and greatly increase its internal resistance. As the panels are wired in series, this would cause the output of the entire string to be reduced due to the increased total resistance. This change in performance causes the MPPT system to change the <b>operation</b> <b>point,</b> moving the rest of the panels away from their best performance.|$|E

Aim of this {{control strategy}} {{is to reduce the}} mechanical fatigue of DFIG caused by the frequent adjustment of rotating speed and pitch angle when operating in the islanded power system. Firstly, the stability of DFIG at different <b>operation</b> <b>points</b> is analyzed. Then an optimization model of transfer trajectory at <b>operation</b> <b>points</b> is established, with the minimum synthetic adjustment amount of rotating speed and pitch angle as the objective function and with the balance of active power and the stability of <b>operation</b> <b>points</b> as the constraint conditions. Secondly, the wind speed estimator is designed, and the control strategy of pitch system is improved to cooperate with the indirect stator flux orientation control technology for rotor-side inverter control. Then by the coordination control of its rotating speed and pitch angle, an operation trajectory controller is established to ensure the islanded operation of DFIG along the optimal transfer trajectory. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed control strategy is technical feasibility with good performance...|$|R
50|$|Squegging is a radio {{engineering}} term. It is the abbreviation of self-quenching. A squegging or self-blocking oscillator produces an intermittent or changing output signal.

The receiver sensitivity rises while the oscillation builds up. The oscillation stops when the <b>operation</b> <b>point</b> no longer fulfills the Barkhausen stability criterion. The blocking oscillator recovers {{to the initial}} state and the cycle starts again.The receive frequency of the Armstrong Super-Regenerative receiver was some hundred kilohertz.

The goal is to find the optimal <b>operation</b> <b>point</b> that maximizes network-wide throughput performance, in terms of users’ downlink transmission power and cells’ maximum cumulative power assigned to users (i.e., cells’ coverage size). The large number of variables involved and the non-convexity of the optimization problem associated to the latter goal reveal the difficulty in obtaining such an <b>operation</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{approach}} of optimal sensitivity {{applied in the}} tertiary loop of the automatic generation control. The approach {{is based on the}} theorem of non-linear perturbation. From an optimal <b>operation</b> <b>point</b> obtained by an optimal power flow a new optimal <b>operation</b> <b>point</b> is directly determined after a perturbation, i. e., without the necessity of an iterative process. This new optimal <b>operation</b> <b>point</b> satisfies the constraints of the problem for small perturbation in the loads. The participation factors and the voltage set point of the automatic voltage regulators (AVR) of the generators are determined by the technique of optimal sensitivity, considering the effects of the active power losses minimization and the network constraints. The participation factors and voltage set point of the generators are supplied directly to a computational program of dynamic simulation of the automatic generation control, named by power sensitivity mode.

40|$|Many {{processes}} operate {{only around}} {{a limited number}} of operation points. In order to have adequate control around each <b>operation</b> <b>point,</b> an adaptive controller could be used. Then, if the <b>operation</b> <b>point</b> changes often, a large number of parameters would have to be adapted over and over again. This prohibits application of conventional adaptive control, which is more suited for processes with slowly changing parameters. Furthermore, continuous adaptation is not always needed or desired. An extension of adaptive control is presented, in which for each <b>operation</b> <b>point</b> the process behaviour can be stored in a memory, retrieved from it and evaluated. These functions are coordinated by a “supervisor”. This concept is referred to as supervisory control. It leads to an adaptive control structure which, after a learning phase, quickly adjusts the controller parameters based on retrieval of old information, without the need to fully releam each time. This approach has been tested on an experimental set-up of a flexible beam, but it is directly applicable to processes in e. g. the (petro) chemical industry as well...|$|E
