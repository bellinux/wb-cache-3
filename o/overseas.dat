5|$|For a long time, the Megami Tensei {{franchise}} was not {{exported to}} western territories despite {{there being a}} recognized market. The original reasons were the heavy religious themes and symbols used, which were considered taboo in western game markets, and Nintendo's strict content guidelines for <b>overseas</b> releases. Later, many of these early works were prevented from coming <b>overseas</b> due to their age, which would have put them at a disadvantage in the modern gaming market. Early entries on the PlayStation were also blocked by Sony of America's then-current approval policies. The first title in the franchise to be localized was Jack Bros.; the first role-playing game in the franchise to receive an <b>overseas</b> release was the first Persona game. This was done to give Atlus' North American branch a flagship RPG franchise that could compete {{with the likes of}} Final Fantasy, Suikoden and Breath of Fire. According to Okada, the naming of creatures and enemies was adjusted from the main series and original Japanese release of Persona to make it more acceptable for an <b>overseas</b> audience. Though it managed to establish the franchise <b>overseas,</b> the localization was a taxing task due to a small staff and the need to change multiple aspects to suit a North American audience, including removing references to Japanese culture and changing one character from Japanese to African-American. The first Persona 2 title, Innocent Sin, needed to be passed over due to shortage of manpower and the fact that development was focused on the second title, Eternal Punishment.|$|E

5|$|However, {{following}} {{the terrorist attacks}} {{that occurred in the}} United States on 11 September 2001 and American military action in Afghanistan on 7 October, the Government decided to temporarily suspend <b>overseas</b> voting at the 2001 general election as having large numbers of Singaporeans congregating at known locations at known times could put them at risk of further terrorist attacks. Therefore, <b>overseas</b> voting first took place at the 2006 general election. The number of Singapore citizens who registered to vote <b>overseas</b> was 1,017, and of these, 553 resided in the 16 constituencies that were contested in the election.

The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for <b>overseas</b> service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly {{towards the end of the}} fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war.|$|E
