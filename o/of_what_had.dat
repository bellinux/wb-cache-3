5|$|Aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> {{happened}} in the upper delta region, Chinh abandoned plans for {{an attack on the}} Sơn Tây garrison and fled, but he was captured a few days later by French authorities. The French imposed a curfew on Hanoi, the capital of northern Vietnam for 12 days. French troops were sent to Sơn Tây and Phu Tho where attacks by the VNQDD had been planned, and reinforcements were sent to Tuyên Quang, Nam Định and Hải Dương as well. Garrisons that consisted entirely of Vietnamese were reinforced with French soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Eventually the {{reinforcements}} that al-Muwaffaq {{had promised}} arrived from Iraq, {{under the command}} of his own son, Abu'l-Abbas. The combined Abbasid forces advanced to Shayzar, where the Tulunid army was still encamped. The latter was caught completely by surprise and was defeated; many of the Egyptians were killed in the fighting. The survivors fled to Damascus, but upon learning that the Abbasid army was headed for them they abandoned the city, allowing the Abbasids to retake it in February 885. The Tulunid forces continued south to Ramlah in the district of Palestine, where they wrote to Khumarawayh <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> transpired. Khumarawayh now decided to personally lead his troops against the Abbasids, and departed from Egypt for Syria.|$|E
5|$|Features at {{the park}} include a fountain, artworks, a cafe, and a {{distinctive}} glass canopy. Director Park was designed by Laurie Olin of the design firm OLIN, and the Portland-based architectural firm ZGF Architects. The park is part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> originally been planned as a corridor of consecutive public parks stretching across downtown Portland. This plan included what are today the South Park Blocks and the North Park Blocks. Proposals to connect {{the two sets of}} park blocks arose in the 1970s, and in 1998 businessman Tom Moyer made a proposal for what became Director Park. Planning began in the mid-2000s, and construction began in 2008.|$|E

The remaining three carriages of the Duke's train were detached and the band's carriage, hauled by Northumbrian, {{set off for}} Manchester with Stephenson driving. Lord Wilton held Huskisson's hands and arms steady, while Lord Colville supported his head {{on his knees and}} tried to cushion him from the vibration of the train. With the train almost unladen and Stephenson running the engine flat-out, the train reached the speed of almost , briefly giving those on board the world speed record.

5|$|In 1873, {{journalist}} George Alfred Townsend published Washington, Outside and Inside. A Picture and A Narrative of the Origin, Growth, Excellences, Abuses, Beauties, and Personages of Our Governing City, a {{work that}} covered the history of Washington from its inception to the then-present day. The Civil War defenses of Washington figure prominently in the later portions of the book, and he uses the state of Fort Stanton as an example <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> become of the forts a decade after they had been built.|$|E
5|$|In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived Carmen at the Opéra-Comique, with Adèle Isaac {{featuring}} in an under-rehearsed {{production that}} removed {{some of the}} controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> come {{to be regarded as}} a masterpiece of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.|$|E

Enewetak Atoll was chosen as the test site on 11 October. The island was remote, but with a good harbor and an airstrip. It also had ocean currents and trade winds that would carry fallout out to sea, an important consideration in view <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened at Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads.|$|E

5|$|Teaneck {{was created}} on February19, 1895 by {{an act of}} the New Jersey Legislature from {{portions}} of Englewood Township and Ridgefield Township, both of which are now defunct (despite existing municipalities with similar names), along with portions of Bogota and Leonia. Independence followed the result of a referendum held on January14, 1895, in which voters favored incorporation by a 46–7 margin. To address the concerns of Englewood Township's leaders, the new municipality was formed as a township, rather than succumbing to the borough craze sweeping across Bergen County at the time. On May3, 1921, and June1, 1926, portions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been Teaneck were transferred to Overpeck Township.|$|E
5|$|The British, ill-informed of the {{situation}} in Istanbul, believed the entire Ottoman government was conspiring with the Germans. The British Cabinet sent an ultimatum to the Ottomans, demanding that they remove Admiral Souchon and his German subordinates from their posts and expel Germany's military mission, which consisted of approximately 2,000 men. The Ottomans did not comply. On 31 October, First Sea Lord Winston Churchill, acting on his own initiative, ordered British forces in the Mediterranean to commence hostilities against the Ottoman Empire. This wasn't carried out immediately, so the Ottomans were unaware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> transpired. The Russian Foreign Ministry withdrew Ambassador Girs from Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|What is now MD 5 between Leonardtown Road and Poplar Hill Road was {{constructed}} as {{a gravel road}} by 1927. This road was designated part of MD 233. In 1956, MD 382 was extended west into Charles County along part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been MD 233 to MD 5 at Beantown. MD 382 was removed from Charles County in 1989. That same year, MD 205 {{was assigned to the}} westernmost portion of Poplar Hill Road in Beantown and north along two-lane MattawomanBeantown Road to US 301 and MD 5 at Mattawoman. The route was expanded to a four-lane divided highway and was taken over as MD 5's bypass of Waldorf in 1997. The portion of MD 5 from what had been MD 205's southern terminus west to US 301 became MD 5 Bus.|$|E

5|$|After Orlović's {{battalion}} {{entered the}} undefended village of Zamlača, the Serb rebels {{moved from one}} house to the next, ransacking homes and forcing any civilians they found {{to move to the}} main road. Approximately 50 civilians were captured in the village, they were then forced to walk in front of an armed vehicle towards Struga, forming a human shield. By 13:00, all the units earmarked for the advance between Dvor and Kozibrod had achieved their initial objectives, except for the platoon commanded by Sundać. By 14:30, Struga was under attack. The defending force in Struga was first engaged by the outflanking force and had no knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened in Zamlača. As the human shield and the SAO Krajina force reached Struga, the defending troops were reluctant to fire against them. As a consequence, three Croatian policemen deployed in one house were surrounded and subsequently surrendered. Their captors stripped them, ordered them to run and then killed them. Unsure {{how to deal with the}} situation, the Croatian forces withdrew from the southern part of the village. The unit protected by the human shield moved very slowly and took six hours to move from Zamlača to the centre of Struga.|$|E
5|$|Chile {{began to}} seek {{additional}} ships to bolster its fleet in 1919, and the United Kingdom eagerly offered {{many of its}} surplus warships. This action worried nearby nations, who feared that a Chilean attempt to become the region's most powerful navy would destabilize the area and start another naval arms race. Chile asked for Canada and Eagle, the two battleships they ordered before the war, {{but the cost of}} converting the latter back to a battleship was too high. Planned replacements included the two remaining s, but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar within Chile itself over the value of such ships. In the end, Chile only bought Canada and four destroyers in April 1920—all ships that had been ordered from British yards by the Chilean government before 1914 but were purchased by the Royal Navy after the British entered the First World War—for relatively low prices. Canada, for instance, was sold for just £1,000,000, less than half <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been required to construct the ship.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s Liverpool's form {{continued}} to deteriorate, and they avoided relegation in the 1933–34 season by only four points. Scott left the club {{at the end}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been a poor season for the veteran goalkeeper. In ten matches {{from the start of}} 1934, Liverpool won only once with Scott in goal, and after a 9–2 defeat against Newcastle United, he was replaced by Arthur Riley. The change of goalkeepers brought an upturn in form, with a 6–2 victory over Birmingham City and a 4–1 win against Middlesbrough. Scott, who joined Belfast Celtic after 24 years at Liverpool, remains the club's longest-serving player. As they became used to finishing in {{the lower part of the}} league table, Liverpool began to lose their best players. Hodgson, who had scored 233 goals in 358 league games, was sold to Aston Villa in 1936 and the club struggled to replace him. They finished 19th in the season following his departure. Also in 1936, Patterson resigned as manager for health reasons, and resumed his role as the club's secretary. His replacement, Southampton manager George Kay, did not initially fare much better; Liverpool narrowly avoided relegation in the 1936–37 season, and finished in 11th place in each of the following two seasons. By the outbreak of the Second World War, Liverpool had become accustomed to finishing midtable.|$|E

5|$|Parliamentary {{enclosures}} {{accounted for}} about 4.5 million acres <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been open fields, not counting the enclosure of common land and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; {{by the end of}} the enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.|$|E
5|$|The Ustaše {{used the}} mysterious deaths {{of two of}} their local {{followers}} as a pretext for the killings. The victims were drawn from Gudovac and its surroundings on 28 April. Most were arrested under the guise that they were Serb rebels loyal to the ousted Yugoslav government. They were taken to a nearby field and collectively shot by a firing squad of up to 70 Ustaše guards. Five of the prisoners managed to survive the initial volley and crawled away to safety. The Ustaše forced Gudovac's surviving inhabitants to dig a mass grave for the victims and pour quicklime on the bodies to speed up decomposition. The following day, relatives {{of one of the}} victims informed the Germans <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> transpired. The Germans ordered a partial exhumation of the mass grave, and had 40 suspected perpetrators arrested. Mladen Lorković, a senior Ustaše official, used his influence to have the detained men released and promised German ambassador Siegfried Kasche that the Croatian authorities would carry out a thorough investigation. No investigation took place.|$|E
5|$|William H. Jackson did, in fact, own the {{property}} {{on the opposite}} side of Dearing Street from the tree. That plot included the present-day 226 Dearing Street, but in the early 19th century it was simply designated Lot #14. The tree, however, is located on a portion <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been Lot #15. Jackson and his wife Mildred, along with a J. A. Cobb, sold their property to a Dr. Malthus Ward in 1832, the same year cited on a plaque as being the date of the tree's deed. The Clarke County real estate indices contain no indication of when or from whom Jackson originally purchased {{the property}}, although much of the land in that area is reported to have belonged to a Major James Meriwether. Even though Jackson may have lived near the tree as an adult, his childhood was actually spent in Jefferson County, not in Athens, making it less likely that he had experienced idyllic childhood summers playing beneath the tree's branches.|$|E
