5|$|Initially {{looking for}} ways to further improve its {{electronic}} forms software, in November 1991 Delrina had attempted to buy two associated firms that produced <b>Optical</b> <b>Character</b> Recognition (OCR) software, with the intention of incorporating OCR functionality into its forms products.

This functionality was incorporated into WinFax PRO 3.0 in late 1992, and subsequently in FormFlow Despite the agreement with Caere, the subsequent version of WinFax used Xerox's TextBridge OCR engine instead.|$|E

OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, Google Book Search) and promises more for the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recognition {{techniques}} for printed and handwritten text in scanned documents are significantly different. In this {{paper we address}} the problem of identifying each type. We can list at least four steps: digitalization, preprocessing, feature extraction and decision or classification. A new aspect of our approach is the use of data mining techniques on the decision step. A new set of features extracted of each word is proposed as well. Classification rules are mining and used to discern printed text from handwritten. The proposed system was tested in two public image databases. All possible measures of efficiency were computed achieving on every occasion quantities above 80 %.

Most manually operated typewriters use monospaced fonts. So do text-only computer displays and third- and fourth-generation game console graphics processors, which treat the screen as a uniform grid of character cells. Most computer programs which have a text-based interface (terminal emulators, for example) use only monospaced fonts (or add additional spacing to proportional fonts to fit them in monospaced cells) in their configuration. Monospaced fonts are commonly used by computer programmers for displaying and editing source code so that certain characters (for example parentheses used to group arithmetic expressions) are easy to see.

30|$|Magnetic fluid {{is a kind}} of {{colloidal}} suspension containing surfactant-coated magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in carrier liquids such as water and oil. Since the emergence of magnetic fluid in the 1960 s, researchers have conducted many investigations on the characters of magnetic fluids. When light is incident into the magnetic fluid, the magnetic nanoparticles suspended in the base fluid will interact with the incident light and affect the propagation of the incident light. Magnetic fluid presents some special <b>optical</b> <b>characters</b> such as birefringence [1 – 5] and magnetochromatics [6, 7]. Recently, the remarkable magneto-optical characters of magnetic fluids have attracted enormous attention of researchers who tried to apply magnetic fluids to optical devices such as fabricating optical switches [8], tunable filters [9], magnetic-field sensors [10] and tunable optical grating [11, 12]. Although the <b>optical</b> <b>characters</b> of the magnetic fluids have been studied for decades and novel phenomena have been discovered, there are few reports on the optical constants of magnetic fluids. Yang et a 1. [13] measured the magnetic field-dependent refractive index of magnetic fluid films by total reflection technique. Pu et a 1. [14] designed an experimental system for measuring the refractive index of magnetic fluid and studied the effect of particle volume fraction and temperature on the refractive index. Both of these investigations had the limitation of having one fixed wavelength, besides the experimental systems employed being complicated and expensive. So far, few investigations on the extinction coefficient of magnetic fluid have been reported. To promote the applications of magnetic fluids in different fields such as thermal and optical engineering, many more efforts toward further investigation of optical constants of magnetic fluids are needed. The purpose of this letter is to propose a simple method for measuring the extinction coefficient of magnetic fluids.|$|R

By using the double nested extrusion molds {{and the corresponding}} isolated stacked extrusion method, the utilization rate of glass materials was greatly improved compared with the conventional extrusion method. Fiber preforms with optimal stability of core/cladding ratio throughout the 160 mm length were prepared using the developed extrusion method. Typical fiber structure defects between the core/cladding interface, such as bubbles, cracks, and core diameter variation, were effectively eliminated. Ge-Sb-Se/S chalcogenide glasses were used to form a core/cladding pair and fibers with core/cladding structure were prepared by thermally drawing the extruded preforms.

Despite the age of the subject, it remains one of the most challenging and exciting areas of research in computer science. In recent years it has grown into a mature discipline, producing a huge body of work. Arabic character recognition has been one of the last major languages to receive attention. This is due, in part, to the cursive nature of the task since even printed Arabic characters are in cursive form. This paper describes the performance of combining Hough transform and Hidden Markov Models in a multifont Arabic OCR system.
