5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based {{on the notion that}} giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was based in part <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> these dualities and {{in part on the}} relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} for sexual dimorphism has been weakened.

A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature {{could not be used}} to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As Tyrannosaurus rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, {{the gospels}} were usually {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged who question {{the reliability of the}} gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E
