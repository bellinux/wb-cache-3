5|$|The {{budget of}} the city for 2013 was €7.6 billion, of which €5.4 billion went for city administration, while €2.2 billion went for investment. The largest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> (38 percent) went for public housing and urbanism projects; 15 percent for roads and transport; 8 percent for schools (which are mostly financed by the state budget); 5 percent for parks and gardens; and 4 percent for culture. The main {{source of income for}} the city is direct taxes (35 percent), {{supplemented}} by a 13-percent real estate tax; 19 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> comes in a transfer from the national government.|$|E
5|$|While, unsurprisingly, {{military}} spending constituted the largest {{part of the}} national government's budget {{over the course of the}} war, over time the payment of interest and principal on acquired debt grew as a share of the Confederate government's expenditure. While initially, in early 1861, war expenditure was 95% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> by October 1864 that share fell to 40%, with the majority of the rest (56% overall) being accounted for by debt service. Civilian expenditures and spending on the Navy (recorded separately from general war expenditures in Confederate records) never exceeded 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b>|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget in April 1932. He maintained the severe budget cuts {{that had been}} agreed at {{the inception of the}} National Government. Interest on the war debt was a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> devoted to interest on the war debt.|$|E
5|$|Cocaine {{was already}} so {{prevalent}} {{on the set}} (like many other film productions of that era) that Aykroyd, who used far less than his partner, claims a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> was actually set aside for purchases of the drug during night shooting. The stars had a private bar, the Blues Club, built on the set, for themselves, crew, and friends. Carrie Fisher, Aykroyd's girlfriend at the time, {{says most of the}} bar's staff doubled as dealers, procuring any drug patrons desired.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} six decades of the republic, between 1923 and 1983, Turkey {{generally}} adhered to a quasi-statist approach with strict government planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> and government-imposed limitations over foreign trade, flow of foreign currency, foreign direct investment and private sector participation in certain fields (such as broadcasting, telecommunications, energy, mining, etc.). However, in 1983, Prime Minister Turgut Özal initiated a series of reforms designed to shift the economy from a statist, insulated system to a more private-sector, market-based model.|$|E

Additional co-production support was provided by Essential Filmproduktion of Germany and BIM Distribuzione of Italy. The total budget was 12.38 million euro.

5|$|Governor Dayton {{formally}} {{proposed a}} state budget on February 15, calling for $37 billion in state spending, necessitating cuts of about 10 percent to most state agencies. Because {{the state was}} projected to take in only about $32 billion in taxes, the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> shortfall was covered by increases to income and property taxes for wealthier Minnesotans, as he had promised during his campaign. Meanwhile, Republican legislators, led by House Speaker Kurt Zellers and Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch, demanded the budget be kept below $32 billion.|$|E

However, in 1993, enrollment dropped to 26,800, the lowest attendance since 1973 as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> crisis of 1991.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly {{consisted}} of representatives of {{all members of}} the League, with each state allowed up to three representatives and one vote.

5|$|After unsuccessfully {{searching for}} a vocalist for nearly six months, Mustaine decided to handle the vocal duties himself, while also serving as the band's primary lyricist, main {{songwriter}} and co-lead and rhythm guitarist. Early in 1984, Megadeth recorded a three song demo engineered by Karat Faye, and {{on the strength of}} that demo, the band was asked to sign with the New York-based independent label Combat Records. Early in 1985, Megadeth was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. However, this proved not to be enough and the band was given a further $4,000. Instead, a majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> was spent on drugs, alcohol, and food, forcing the group to fire the original producer and produce the record themselves. The album was successfully recorded at the Indigo Ranch Studios, in Malibu, California.|$|E
