5|$|In 2015, a {{documentary}} film Among the Believers was released. It was filmed <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> {{period in which}} Aziz and his students were interviewed. The documentary portrayed the periods before, {{during and after the}} siege of the Lal Masjid.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1999, MDOT spent {{substantial}} sums {{of money}} <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> program to upgrade M-65 and US23 by refurbishing and replacing bridges and adding more passing lanes. During the same timeframe, the community of Hale embarked on a project to beautify the length of M-65 in town. The project cost $877,929 and installed park benches, new lighting, sidewalks and plantings along the highway. Funding for the venture came {{from the federal government}} and MDOT.|$|E

50|$|The {{attraction}} began life as {{a proposal}} of a historical recreation of the Western Expansion of the United States, {{that would have been}} built {{on the banks of the}} Mississippi River in St. Louis, near the Jefferson National Memorial. Animator-Imagineer Marc Davis designed the attraction and characters in the form of drawings and models <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-years</b> period. Disney executives such as Richard Irvine and Roy Disney both liked the idea when presented with Davis' concepts. The attraction was to have been located inside, outside and around an architectural feature in Frontierland known as Thunder Mesa Mountain.|$|R

5|$|John Gaughan, an American {{manufacturer}} of equipment for magicians based in Los Angeles, spent $120,000 building {{his own version}} of Kempelen's machine <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> period from 1984. The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen presented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a computer running a chess program.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} {{metformin}} overdoses reported to poison control centers <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> period found serious adverse events were rare, though the elderly {{appeared to be}} at greater risk. A similar study in which cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg {{were more likely to}} involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. In healthy children, unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg are unlikely to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E
5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major economic expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play catchup after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E
5000|$|The {{partnership}} initiative {{known as}} GMI, began as the [...] "Methane to Markets Partnership" [...] launched during the George W. Bush Administration in November 2004. The original partnership was formed at a Ministerial Meeting in Washington, D.C. when 14 national governments formally committed to reduce methane emissions from key sectors. In 2004, the U.S. pledged USD$53 million <b>over</b> <b>an</b> initial <b>five-year</b> period.|$|R

5|$|On {{display in}} the house is an {{important}} collection of fine art and antiquities built up by many generations of the Bankes family, the core having been assembled by Sir Ralph Bankes in Gray's Inn before the house was built. One of the rooms, the Spanish room (named by reason of the paintings of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo which hang there), has walls hung with gilded leather. It was recently restored at a cost of several hundred thousand pounds <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> period. Other important collections include paintings of the Bankes family stretching back over 400 years. Other artworks include works by Diego Velázquez, Anthony van Dyck, Titian and Jan Brueghel the Younger. A portrait of Nicolò Zen the younger by Titian was discovered in the collection in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Tau Ceti {{has been}} a target of a radial {{velocity}} planetary searches. As of 1988, observations ruled out any periodical variations attributable to massive planets around Tau Ceti inside of Jupiter-like distances. Ever-more precise measurements continue to rule out such planets, at least until December 2012. The velocity precision reached is about 11m/s measured <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> time span. This result excludes the presence of hot Jupiters, and probably excludes any planets with minimum mass {{greater than or equal}} to Jupiter's mass and with orbital periods less than 15 years. In addition, a survey of nearby stars by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera was completed in 1999, including a search for faint companions to Tau Ceti; none were discovered to limits of the telescope's resolving power.|$|E
5|$|The council's {{budget for}} the {{financial}} year 2015/16 is £437.2m (down from £444.8m in 2014/15). The main source of non-school funding is the formula grant, which is paid by government to local authorities based on the services they provide. The remainder, to which the police and fire authorities (and parish council where this exists) set a precept, is raised from council tax and business rates. Following the 2010 Spending Review, the council announced that 11.1% could be cut from departmental budgets to save £65m <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> period and up to 181 posts could be lost.|$|E
40|$|Comparisons {{are made}} between {{a large group}} of mongols cared for in {{institutions}} and their carefully matched controls in respect of (a) serum levels of immuno-γ-globulin (γA, γG, and γM) and (b) the incidence of pyrexial illnesses <b>over</b> <b>a</b> retrospective <b>five-year</b> period. Male mongols are found to have higher levels of γA-globulin than their male controls and a higher incidence of pyrexial illnesses. Otherwise no significant differences were found.

Some of the Institute founders, including the longest serving President, Colonel Anthony Lawlor with other supporters, who had been impressing on the government and public, <b>over</b> more than <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> period, that another European war was inevitable and Ireland with a dependence on maritime links would quickly fall into crisis.|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{for an investigation}} of rapid subauroral ion drift features using data obtained <b>over</b> <b>a</b> nearly <b>five-year</b> period from the ion RPA/drift meter on Atmosphere Explorer-C. These latitudinally narrow features {{are found to be}} confined predominantly to the local time sector between 18 : 00 and 02 : 00 hr. They occur either singly or as multiple events, one of which almost always straddles the equatorward edge of the auroral zone. Their occurrence probability suggests a dependence of magnetic substorm activity...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords. The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E
5|$|The {{third group}} of {{requested}} amendments pertained to eastern Slavonia. Owen and Stoltenberg requested its status {{to be left}} unresolved, instead of gradually reverting to Croatian control <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> period and applying the postwar ethnic composition of the area as a formula for the ethnic mix of the local police and establishing a joint Croatian-Yugoslav company to extract crude oil in Đeletovci. The proposal was turned down, but it led to local autonomy for Serb villages {{in the area and}} reduced the transitional period to two years. The fourth group of proposed amendments, tabled by Owen, included a proposal for continued Serb armed presence in Krajina and additional authority for Krajina concerning mineral resources and international treaties. After the proposals, the text of the plan became the subject of lengthy discussions between the contact group countries, the EU and the ICFY co-chairs. The co-chairs began drafting their version of the plan; Stoltenberg stalled the plan through Norwegian diplomat (and ICFY ambassador) Kai Eide, creating a conflict between Eide and Galbraith.|$|E

40|$|The {{terminal}} drop hypothesis {{states that}} death is preceded by a decrease in cognitive functioning <b>over</b> <b>an</b> approximately <b>five-year</b> period prior to death (Riegel & Riegel, 1972); there is some disagreement as to whether this decrease is pervasive or restricted to specific abilities. The present study assessed the relationship between distance from death and tests of vocabulary, numerical facility, and perceptual speed for 97 subjects who had died within seven years of testing. Only vocabulary scores for those who died at age 70 or less and within two years of testing were affected by terminal drop. An additional analysis comparing {{the performance of the}} deceased subjects with a still-living sample matched for age, gender, and education produced nonsignificant results but a trend consistent with the initial analyses. Thus the terminal drop phenomenon may be limited to abilities that typically are relatively unaffected by age, such as vocabulary or other verbal abilities. Furthermore, the effects may be restricted to a time period much closer to death than had been originally proposed. THE terminal drop hypothesis states {{that death is}} precededby a decrease in cognitive functioning <b>over</b> <b>an</b> approxi-mately <b>five-year</b> period prior to death. Thus, distance from death in a subsequently deceased population should be correlated with performance on tests of cognitive function-ing if they were administered during this critical five-yea...|$|R

25|$|The {{large and}} quickly-generated funds voted by Parliament and {{guaranteed}} <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> period offered immediate economic incentives as well.

By financing the expansion <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-year</b> period, residual balances from one year could be transferred over to the next, allowing production to continue uninterrupted, at greatly reduced costs. That also aimed for the British completion of her warships more quickly than its rival powers. In theory, the scope and the speed of production would not only cut costs but also deter other powers from hoping to match British production.|$|E
