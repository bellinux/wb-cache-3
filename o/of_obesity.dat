5|$|Obesity in pets {{is common}} in many countries. In the United States, 23–41% of dogs are overweight, and about 5.1% are obese. The rate <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> in cats was {{slightly}} higher at 6.4%. In Australia the rate <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> among dogs in a veterinary setting {{has been found to}} be 7.6%. The risk <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> in dogs is related to whether or not their owners are obese; however, there is no similar correlation between cats and their owners.|$|E
5|$|The rate <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> also {{increases}} with age at least up to 50 or 60years old and severe obesity in the United States, Australia, and Canada is increasing {{faster than the}} overall rate <b>of</b> <b>obesity.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{the past}} decade there have been school-based {{programs}} that target the prevention and management <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity.</b> There is evidence that long term school-based programs have been effective in reducing the prevalence <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{organizations}} exist that promote the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>obesity.</b> They {{have increased in}} prominence {{in the latter half}} of the 20thcentury.

5|$|Comprehensive {{approaches}} are {{being looked at}} to address the rising rates <b>of</b> <b>obesity.</b> The Obesity Policy Action (OPA) framework divides measure into 'upstream' policies, 'midstream' policies, 'downstream' policies. 'Upstream' policies look at changing society, 'midstream' policies try to alter individuals' behavior to prevent obesity, and 'downstream' policies try to treat currently afflicted people.|$|E
5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence <b>of</b> <b>obesity,</b> although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E
50|$|Prevalence <b>of</b> {{childhood}} <b>obesity</b> {{has increased}} dramatically worldwide. A Lancet article published in 2010 that the prevalence <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> {{during the past two}} to three decades, much like the United States, has increased in most other industrialized nations, excluding Russia and Poland. Between the early 1970s and late 1990s, prevalence <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> doubled or tripled in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Japan, the UK, and the USA.|$|R
40|$|A large {{national}} {{cohort of}} children studied {{from birth to}} 36 years {{was used to test}} the predictive value <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> for obesity in adult life. Only 21 % (39) of obese 36 year olds had been obese at age 11 years, and even when associated social factors were taken into account the correctly predicted percentage was much lower than the prediction rate achieved using body mass data from age 26 years. The comparatively poor predictive value <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> and the association <b>of</b> adult <b>obesity</b> with educational achievements and socioeconomic circumstances of family of origin emphasise the need for encouraging good nutritional and exercise habits rather than placing undue emphasis on the control <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity...</b>|$|R
40|$|Waist {{circumference}} {{has been}} widely used as the parameter <b>of</b> central <b>obesity</b> in defining metabolic syndrome. Global consensus definition of metabolic syndrome has suggested various race- and gender-specific cutoffs of waist circumference for quantifying central obesity. We have earlier proposed that using index <b>of</b> central <b>obesity</b> (ICO), the need for race- and gender-specific cutoffs may be obviated. We propose that waist circumference be supplanted with index <b>of</b> central <b>obesity</b> in all definitions of metabolic syndrome. Using index <b>of</b> central <b>obesity</b> a common cutoff of 0. 5 applicable across races and genders might be obtained. Moreover, it will enhance the sensitivity of definition by diagnosing subjects who are shorter than general population. Among 258 male and 242 female diabetic patients, subjects with metabolic syndrome (defined as per gender-specific waist circumference cutoffs), {{were found to have}} a common lower range of index <b>of</b> central <b>obesity</b> suggesting that a common cutoff of waist circumference may be obtained. In another study from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database, replacing index <b>of</b> central <b>obesity</b> with waist circumference was found to enhance the specificity and sensitivity of definition of metabolic syndrome. ...|$|R
5|$|It is {{anticipated}} that rates of OHS will rise as the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> rises. This may also explain why OHS is more commonly {{reported in the}} United States, where obesity is more common than in other countries.|$|E

40|$|Inferiority {{is one of}} {{psychological}} disorder <b>of</b> student’s <b>obesity.</b> One <b>of</b> the approach {{that can be used}} to reduce the inferiority <b>of</b> student’s <b>obesity</b> is Adlerian group counseling. Theorically, Adler discusses physical condition as a factor causing inferiority of humans. This study is aimed to: (1) describe the inferiority <b>of</b> student’s <b>obesity</b> before and after being given the Adlerian group counseling; (2) effectiveness of Adlerian group counseling to reducing inferiority <b>of</b> student’s <b>obesity.</b> This study is conducted by using quantitative method, that is quasi experiment, the one group pre-test post-test design is used. The selection of subjects in this study using non-random sampling technique with purposive sampling method. The subjects were 12 student’s obesity with high and medium levels of inferiority. This study was conducted in SMPI Khaira Ummah Padang from October to November 2014. The instrument used Likert scale. The analyzed was using non-parametric statistical technique that is Wilcoxon’s test. The findings of this study indicate that: (1) there is the difference of inferiority <b>of</b> the student’s <b>obesity</b> before and after being given treatment of Adlerian group counseling. Inferiority <b>of</b> student’s <b>obesity</b> has descreased after being given treatment; (2) Adlerian group counseling effective to reducing inferiority <b>of</b> student’s <b>obesity.</b> Adlerian group counseling can significantly to reduce inferiority student’s obesity, beneficial to further reduce the problem of inferiority due to other physical condition...|$|R

5|$|The healthy BMI range {{varies with}} the age and sex of the child. Obesity in {{children}} and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates <b>of</b> <b>obesity.</b> Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21stcentury, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{negative}} health consequences <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> {{in the general}} population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox.

40|$|General {{practitioners}} (GPs) are ideally {{placed to}} identify and treat childhood obesity, but its prevalence continues to rise and evidence for effective GP interventions is lacking. Further analysis of the barriers to effective identification and management <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> is warranted. This survey aimed to explore how Queensland GPs feel about managing the growing problem <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity.</b> A cross-sectional survey {{was sent to a}} random sample of 573 Queensland GPs about perceptions of diagnosis and management <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity.</b> A total <b>of</b> 30 % of GPs responded (n = 170). The main perceived obstacles to identification <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> were uncertainty about definition criteria and how to calculate body mass index, and lack of access to body mass index percentile charts. The main perceived obstacles in managing childhood <b>obesity</b> were lack <b>of</b> financial incentive, time constraints, lack of health system support and parental resistance. Only 22 % of respondents indicated awareness of the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for management of obese children and 92 % had never used any formal clinical guidelines in assessment or management <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity.</b> Addressing these barriers to identification <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> by GPs may facilitate more effective management. Strategies include greater emphasis on this issue in general practice training, financial incentives for diagnosis and management, incorporating clinical management guidelines into medical software, and increasing allied and community health support.

5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>obesity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk <b>of</b> <b>obesity.</b> Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the medical}} costs {{attributable}} to obesity in the US were an estimated $190.2billion or 20.6% of all medical expenditures, while the cost <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> in Canada {{was estimated at}} CA$2 billion in 1997 (2.4% of total health costs). The total annual direct cost of overweight and obesity in Australia in 2005 was A$21 billion. Overweight and obese Australians also received A$35.6 billion in government subsidies. The estimate range for annual expenditures on diet products is $40billion to $100billion in the US alone.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the greater}} {{prevalence}} of musculoskeletal disorders in obese adults, the consequences <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> {{on the development}} and function of the musculoskeletal system have received comparatively little attention within the literature. Of {{the limited number of}} studies performed to date, the majority have focused on the impact <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> on skeletal structure and alignment, {{and to a lesser extent}} its influence on clinical tests of motor performance including muscular strength, balance and locomotion. Although collectively these studies imply that the functional and structural limitations imposed by obesity may result in aberrant lower limb mechanics and the potential for musculoskeletal injury, empirical verification is currently lacking. The delineation of the effects <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> on musculoskeletal structure in terms of mass, adiposity, anthropometry, metabolic effects and physical inactivity, or their combination, has not been established. More specifically, there is a lack of research regarding the effect <b>of</b> childhood <b>obesity</b> on the properties of connective tissue structures, such as tendons and ligaments. Given the global increase in childhood obesity, there is a need to ascertain the consequences <b>of</b> persistent <b>obesity</b> on musculoskeletal structure and function.
