50|$|Basically, a two-input drive-strength-one NAND gate in CMOS {{technology}} {{consists of}} four transistors. If higher output drive strength is required, an additional <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> stage of four transistors is added.|$|E
50|$|High quality video output: mpv {{includes}} a customizable video <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> based on OpenGL which supports over 100 options for controlling playback quality, {{including the use}} of advanced upscaling filters, color management, and customizable pixel shaders.|$|E

5000|$|A shunt {{regulated}} {{push-pull amplifier}} is a Class A amplifier whose <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> (transistors or more commonly vacuum tubes) operate in antiphase.|$|R
50|$|Project {{boards for}} {{different}} applications are sold by Rev-Ed which contain the PICAXE, download circuit {{and may also}} contain a prototyping area or high power <b>output</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|R
50|$|This command {{performs}} {{a number of}} miscellaneous functions, {{as determined by the}} XOPx field. Although there are 16 possibilities, only 4 are actually used. Three subcommands start and stop <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> calibration (which must be performed periodically, every 100 ms).|$|E
50|$|Both {{master and}} slave devices use a tri-stateable, {{push-pull}} I/O pin {{to connect to}} SCIO, with the pin being placed in a high impedance state when not driving the bus. Because push-pull outputs are used, the <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> on slave devices is current-limited to prevent high system currents from occurring during bus collisions.|$|E
50|$|TFM files contain {{all of the}} {{information}} TeX needs to produce its device-independent (DVI) output. The actual glyphs are then inserted by the eventual DVI <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> or previewer, using, for instance, TrueType fonts, or fonts in METAFONT's PK format. The format is designed to be extremely compact: in the original Computer Modern distribution, every font's TFM file is smaller than 2 kB.|$|E
5000|$|Pink - The {{output of}} the {{flip-flop}} is followed by an output stage with push-pull (P.P.) <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> that can load the [...] "Output" [...] pin with up to 200 mA (varies by device).|$|R
50|$|In the Latin Modern Type 1 fonts the T with comma {{below is}} found under the AGL name /Tcommaaccent. This is in contradiction with Adobe's {{decision}} discussed above, which puts a T with comma-below at /Tcedilla. In consequence, no fixed mapping can work across all Type 1 fonts; each font must come {{with its own}} mapping. Unfortunately, TeX <b>output</b> <b>drivers,</b> like dvips, dvipdfm or pdfTeX's internal PDF driver, access the glyphs by AGL name. Since all of the <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> mentioned are unaware of this peculiarity, the problem is essentially intractable across all fonts. In consequence, one needs to use fonts that include a mapping which is not bypassed by TeX. This {{is the case with}} newer TeX engine XeTeX, which can use Unicode OpenType fonts, and does not bypass the font's Unicode map.|$|R
50|$|The {{first school}} of thought {{believes}} that financial models, if properly constructed, {{can be used to}} predict the future. The focus is on variables, inputs and <b>outputs,</b> <b>drivers</b> and the like. Investments of time and money are devoted to perfecting these models, which are typically held in some type of financial spreadsheet application.|$|R
50|$|MPlayer {{can also}} {{use a variety of}} <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> {{protocols}} to display video, including VDPAU, the X video extension, OpenGL, DirectX, Direct3D, Quartz Compositor, VESA, Framebuffer, SDL and rarer ones such as ASCII art (using AAlib and libcaca) and Blinkenlights. It {{can also be used to}} display TV from a TV card using the device ://channel, or play and capture radio channels via radio://channel|frequency.|$|E
50|$|Relocatable Dynamic Object File Format (RDOFF) {{is used by}} {{developers}} to test the integrity of NASM's object file output abilities. It is based heavily on the internal structure of NASM, essentially consisting of a header containing a serialization of the <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> function calls followed by an array of sections containing executable code or data. Tools for using the format, including a linker and loader, {{are included in the}} NASM distribution.|$|E
50|$|Emission {{considerations}} {{require the}} evaluation of many details such as the clock frequencies and switching rates which {{are related to the}} oscillator. Rise/fall times and signal harmonics are related to the <b>output</b> <b>driver.</b> The data transfer rates can be dependent on hardware or can be controlled by software and often have to meet a certain protocol. Impedances, trace loading and the various circuit components are hardware related and must be considered {{from the beginning of the}} design.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} to use CMOS technology for analog circuits which are integrated with detectors. To fulfill various special demands, CMOS compatible devices are needed for reference elements, <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> and low noise amplifier stages. In this paper integrated passive elements like resistors, capacitors and Zener diodes will be reviewed. Compatible bipolar and junction field effect transistors are presented. (IMS...|$|R
40|$|A novel gallium {{arsenide}} high-voltage MESFET structure (HVFET) suitable for high-voltage, high-speed <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> is described. The device uses an extended drain region and a two-step gate field plate structure to achieve high breakdown voltage of 130 V. The device is implemented using a standard GaAs enhancement/depletion MESFET digital IC process without any additional processing steps and exhibits turn-on and turn-off times under 200 ps...|$|R
50|$|Many Arduino-compatible and Arduino-derived boards exist. Some are {{functionally}} {{equivalent to}} an Arduino {{and can be}} used interchangeably. Many enhance the basic Arduino by adding <b>output</b> <b>drivers,</b> often for use in school-level education, to simplify making buggies and small robots. Others are electrically equivalent but change the form factor, sometimes retaining compatibility with shields, sometimes not. Some variants use different processors, of varying compatibility.|$|R
5000|$|The PGF/TikZ {{interpreter}} can be {{used from}} the popular LaTeX and ConTeXt macro packages, and also directly from the original TeX. Since TeX itself is not concerned with graphics, the interpreter supports multiple TeX output backends: dvips, dvipdfm/dvipdfmx/xdvipdfmx, TeX4ht, and pdftexs internal PDF <b>output</b> <b>driver.</b> Unlike PStricks, PGF can thus directly produce either PostScript or PDF output, but it cannot {{use some of the}} more advanced PostScript programming features that PStricks can use due to the [...] "least common denominator" [...] effect. PGF/TikZ comes with extensive documentation. The version 3.0.0 manual has 1165 pages.|$|E
5000|$|One rather {{distinctive}} {{capability of}} the SYM-1 was its ability to allow an oscilloscope {{to be added to}} provide a 32 character display under software control. As explained in Chapter 7 of the [...] "SYM Reference Manual", the vertical input, ground and trigger input of the oscilloscope were to be connected to the [...] "Scope Out" [...] connector AA on the SYM-1 board. The [...] "Oscilloscope <b>Output</b> <b>Driver</b> Software" [...] code provided in this chapter of the manual was to be entered into the SYM-1's memory and executed to enable the oscilloscope display. This code provided control of the oscilloscope display, as well as a rudimentary character set. Resistors R42 and R45 were to be adjusted to refine the displayed image.|$|E
50|$|A {{hardware}} circuit {{to produce}} subverted bits {{can be built}} on an integrated circuit a few millimeters square. The most sophisticated hardware random number generator can be subverted by placing such a chip anywhere upstream of where the source of randomness is digitized, say in an <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> chip {{or even in the}} cable connecting the RNG to the computer. The subversion chip can include a clock to limit the start of operation to some time after the unit is first turned on and run through acceptance tests, or it can contain a radio receiver for on/off control. It could be installed by the manufacturer at the behest of their national signals intelligence service, or added later by anyone with physical access. CPU chips with built-in hardware random number generators can be replaced by compatible chips with a subverted RNG in the chips' firmware.|$|E
50|$|Embedded systems {{firmware}} {{is usually}} {{not considered to be}} a source of radio frequency interference. Radio emissions are often caused by harmonic frequencies of the system clock and switching currents. The pulses on these wires can have fast rise and fall times, causing their wires to act as radio transmitters. This effect is increased by badly-designed printed circuit boards. These effects are reduced by using microcontroller <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> with slower rise times, or by turning off system components.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{high voltage}} {{transmitter}} integrated circuit for ultrasound medical imaging is implemented using 90 nm technology. The high voltage transmitter consists of level shifter and <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> {{to increase the}} voltage, with reduced delay,that drives the capacitive micro-machined ultrasound transducer to produce acoustic signal in medical applications. The performance of various level shifters are compared. The level shifter generates 20 V pulses from the input of 10 V. The level shifter is designed using 90 nm technology in HSPICE. ...|$|R
50|$|When {{chip select}} is asserted, the chip {{internally}} performs the access, {{and only the}} final <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> are disabled by deasserting output enable. This can be done while the bus is in use for other purposes, and when output enable is finally asserted, the data will appear with minimal delay. A ROM or static RAM chip with an output enable line will typically list two access times: one from chip select asserted and address valid, and a second, shorter time beginning when output enable is asserted.|$|R
50|$|All four {{ports in}} the AT89C51 and AT9C52 are bidirectional. Each {{consists}} of a latch (Special Function Registers P0 through P3), an <b>output</b> <b>driver,</b> and an input buffer. The output drivers of Ports 0 and 2, and the input buffers of Port 0, are used in accesses to external memory. In this application, Port 0 outputs the low byte of the external memory address, time-multiplexed with the byte being written or read. Port 2 outputs the high byte of the external memory address when the address is 16 bits wide. Otherwise the Port 2 pins continue to emit the P2 SFR content. All the Port 3 pins, and two Port 1 pins (in the AT89C52)are multifunctional. The alternate functions can only be activated if the corresponding bit latch in the port SFR contains a 1. Otherwise the port pin is stuck at 0. It has less complex feature than other microprocessor.|$|E
40|$|A {{slew rate}} {{controlled}} <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> adopting delay compensation method is implemented using 0. 18 CMOS process for storage device interface. PhaseLocked Loop {{is used to}} generate compensation current and constant delay time. Compensation current reduces the slew rate variation over process, voltage and temperature variation in <b>output</b> <b>driver.</b> To generate constant delay time, the replica of VCO in PLL is used in output driver's slew rate control block. That reduces the slew rate variation over load capacitance variation. That has less 25 % variation at slew rate than that of conventional <b>output</b> <b>driver.</b> The proposed <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> can satis 2 UDMAlO 0 interface which specify load capacitance as 15 40 pF and slew rate as 0. 4 1. 0 IV/ns]...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} the slew rate and {{therefore}} {{the use of a}} slew rate controlled <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> is an appropriate measure to reduce the ground bounce as well as the electromagnetic emission. In this paper we show a new slew rate controlled <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> based on the distributed and weighted technique which significantly reduces the ground bounce amplitude and the radiated electromagnetic emission compared to a standard digital tapered <b>output</b> <b>driver.</b> We present the radiated electromagnetic emission of the IC, which was measured using the TEM-cell method. 1...|$|E
5000|$|A DMX console’s <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> {{are always}} enabled. The RDM {{protocol}} is {{designed so that}} except during discovery, there should never be data collisions. To assure this lack of collisions, while making possible implementation on different platforms, {{there are times when}} all line drivers are required to be disabled. If nothing more than the termination was done, the line would float to some unknown level. In that case one or more random changes might be read on the line. These random changes greatly decrease system accuracy. So the biasing of the line is required ...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} discloses {{a system}} capable of memorizing maximum sensed values. The system includes conditioning circuitry which receives the analog output signal from a sensor transducer. The conditioning circuitry rectifies and filters the analog signal and provides an input signal to a digital driver, {{which may be}} either linear or logarithmic. The driver converts the analog signal to discrete digital values, which in turn triggers an output signal on one of a plurality of <b>driver</b> <b>output</b> lines n. The particular output lines selected {{is dependent on the}} converted digital value. A microfuse memory device connects across the <b>driver</b> <b>output</b> lines, with n segments. Each segment is associated with one <b>driver</b> <b>output</b> line, and includes a microfuse that is blown when a signal appears on the associated <b>driver</b> <b>output</b> line...|$|R
50|$|The {{parasitic}} {{structure is}} usually {{equivalent to a}} thyristor (or SCR), a PNPN structure which acts as a PNP and an NPN transistor stacked next to each other. During a latch-up {{when one of the}} transistors is conducting, the other one begins conducting too. They both keep each other in saturation {{for as long as the}} structure is forward-biased and some current flows through it - which usually means until a power-down. The SCR parasitic structure is formed as a part of the totem-pole PMOS and NMOS transistor pair on the <b>output</b> <b>drivers</b> of the gates.|$|R
40|$|A {{low-power}} slew-rate controlled <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> {{with open}} loop digital scheme, one-cycle lock time is presented. Proposed <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> maintains slew {{rate in the}} range of 2. 1 V/ns to 3. 6 V/ns in a one cycle after the enable clock is inserted. It is implemented in 0. 18 um CMOS process, and the control block consumes 13. 7 mW at 1 Gbps...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, ESD {{improvements}} of an <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> that {{driving a}} large current in DC brushless fan ICs under HBM ESD stress is investigated. In {{order to improve}} ESD robustness, some protection blocks will be designed and implemented by the layout parameters and structures tuning. From the preliminary ESD testing result, {{it was found that}} the positive Pad-to-VSS (PS) zapping mode of the original DUT is weakest for the <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> of DC brushless fan ICs during an HBM zapping. After a systematic improvement, it is found that the FOD structure of adding protection circuits can effectively protect the whole-chip ESD damage, as compared with the original DUT; the values of ESD failure threshold (VESD) are increased> 57 %, which allows <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> devices more robust in the ESD immunity...|$|E
40|$|As the {{switching}} {{speeds and}} densities of Digital CMOS integrated circuits continue to increase, output switching noise becomes {{more of a}} problem. A design technique which aids in the reduction of switching noise is reported. The <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> stage is analyzed {{through the use of}} an equivalent RLC circuit. The results of the analysis are used in the design of an <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> stage. A test circuit based on these techniques is being submitted to MOSIS for fabrication...|$|E

40|$|A {{pixel array}} has been {{proposed}} which features a completely data driven architecture. A pixel cell has been designed that has been optimized for this readout. It retains the features of preceding designs which allow low noise operation, time stamping, analog signal processing, XY address recording, ghost elimination and sparse data transmission. The pixel design eliminates {{a number of problems}} inherent in previous designs, by the use of sampled data techniques, destructive readout, and current mode <b>output</b> <b>drivers.</b> This architecture and pixel design is directed at applications such as a forward spectrometer at the SSC, an e+e- B factory at SLAC, and fixed target experiments at FNAL...|$|R
40|$|Abstract__ Despite {{heated debate}} {{concerning}} {{the impact of}} the European Union (EU) on its member states, quantitative estimates of EU policy output remains scarce. In this study, we introduce a counting method that allows us to accurately determine the exact size of legal rules contained within EU competition law regulations. This counting method is embedded in an ecological approach, which posits that, apart from external pressures, an internal dynamic is a key driver of EU policy output. Overall, our findings indicate that the competition rule stock has increased drastically over time, and continues to do so, above and beyond the impact of external policy <b>output</b> <b>drivers...</b>|$|R
