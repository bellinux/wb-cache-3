5|$|Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher {{appeared}} to be the right choice but quit after two seasons, overwhelmed by the Tech fan base. Fulcher's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded on the national scene when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to tour {{in support of}} the album was made before it was even complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were completely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> and realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters, and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral). Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, selling out within hours.|$|E

Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained {{the right to use}} the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.|$|E

25|$|The natural tuning, {{inherited}} from the English guitar of the 18th century, was also very frequently employed {{up to the first}} half of the 20th century, being preferred to the former by some late-19th-century players; it was frequently tuned in E instead of C, as this simplified the change between the fado tuning for players who used both. Some variations of this tuning were also adopted, such as the afinação natural com 4ª, also known as afinação da Mouraria, or the afinação de João de Deus, also known as afinação natural menor.

Despite his illness Morphy triumphed easily, winning seven while losing two, with two draws. When asked about his defeat, Anderssen claimed to be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> but also admitted that Morphy was in any event the stronger player and that he was fairly beaten. Anderssen also attested that in his opinion, Morphy was the strongest player ever to play the game, even stronger than the famous French champion La Bourdonnais.|$|E

Foster was (oddly) able to arrange {{to be away from}} England. Although one might have feared that he would be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> in the first Test at Sydney in 1903, Foster scored 287. This was the highest score in Test cricket until 1930 (surpassed by Andy Sandham), and remains the highest score by a debutant and the third highest by a batsman of any nationality against Australia, home or away (surpassed only by Len Hutton's 364 in 1938 & Ross Taylor's 290 in 2015). For more than a century, Foster also held the record for the highest score in a test match at the SCG, his score not being beaten until Australian Michael Clarke scored 329 not out against India in January 2012. Foster did not follow it up, until the final Test on a vicious wicket at Melbourne, where he top-scored in both innings with 18 (in a total of 61 all out) and, having been promoted to open, an excellent 30 (out of 101 all out).|$|E

500|$|Leyland {{was noted}} as a humorist in his playing days; many stories are {{associated}} with him, although some are probably apocryphal. He told stories against himself. One story concerned his dismissal during a wartime match, {{in which he was}} out to a terrible delivery from a bowler who was badly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> Leyland hit the ball in the air and was caught. He ruefully commented: [...] "You know, I don't get much practice against that stuff". Another time, he described how he faced an over from O'Reilly, as related in his obituary in The Cricketer: [...] "'First he bowled me an off-break, then he bowled me a leg-break; then his googly, then a bumper, then one that went with his arm...' 'But that's only five, Maurice. What about the last one?' 'Oh, that,' said Maurice deprecatingly. 'That was a straight 'un and it bowled me. Among his team-mates, Leyland was known as [...] "Tonnip", or [...] "Turnip", possibly a reference to his country upbringing. Robertson-Glasgow and Cardus wrote prolifically on Leyland; Gibson suggests that these pieces are among their best work. Leyland was popular with team-mates, opponents and spectators around the world. Swanton concluded his obituary of Leyland: [...] "No more courageous or determined cricketer ever buckled on pads for England." ...|$|E
500|$|Maryland {{started the}} 2010 season against Navy, which {{intentionally}} kicked {{away from the}} elusive return man. In the home opener against , Smith scored on a 24-yard pass from backup quarterback Danny O'Brien and a five-yard pass from starter Jamarr Robinson. Smith scored two touchdowns of 60and 80yards in Maryland's failed comeback attempt at 21st-ranked West Virginia, 31–17. After the West Virginia game, Sports Illustrated considered Smith a rising prospect for the 2011 NFL Draft and described him as [...] "a true vertical threat who has NFL size and home-run hitting speed." [...] Redshirt freshman Danny O'Brien secured the starting quarterback position after Jamarr Robinson suffered a shoulder injury, and the rookie soon [...] "found great chemistry" [...] with Smith. Against Florida International, Smith made eight receptions for 159yards, including a 68-yard touchdown catch and a 32-yard catch that set up another score. He limped off of the field after his touchdown catch, but later said, [...] "I was fine. I was Jim Brown-ing." [...] The following week, he was limited in practice, but started against Duke and caught a 44-yard reception during a first-half scoring drive. However, the lingering ankle ailment continued to bother Smith, and head coach Ralph Friedgen considered using punt returner Tony Logan for kickoff returns until he fully healed. Smith had four receptions for 55yards in the 31–7 loss to Clemson, but was hindered by his sore ankle which kept him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> Smith said, [...] "I don't like sitting out [...] I feel like I'm leaving my teammates out to dry. I didn't battle with them all week." [...] After the game, Friedgen said in the future he would sit players who could not practice by the Thursday before a game.|$|E
500|$|After {{agreeing to}} rework the {{material}} that Ralbovsky had found so objectionable, Gilmour employed session musicians such as Carmine Appice and Jim Keltner. [...] Both drummers, they later replaced Mason {{on most of the}} album's songs; Mason was concerned that he was too <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> to perform on the album, and instead busied himself with its sound effects. [...] Some of the drum parts were also performed by drum machines. During the sessions, Gilmour was asked by the wife of Pink Floyd's former keyboard player, Richard Wright, if he too could contribute to the project. [...] A founding member of the band, Wright had left in 1979, and there were certain legal obstacles to his return, but after a meeting in Hampstead he was brought back in. [...] Gilmour later admitted in an interview with author Karl Dallas that Wright's presence [...] "would make us stronger legally and musically". [...] He was therefore employed as a paid musician, on a weekly wage of $11,000, but his contributions were minimal. [...] Most of the keyboard parts had already been recorded, and so from February 1987 Wright played some background reinforcement on a Hammond organ, and a Rhodes piano, along with adding several vocal harmonies. The keyboardist also performed a solo in [...] "On the Turning Away", which was discarded, according to Wright, [...] "not because they didn't like it...they just thought it didn't fit." [...] Gilmour later said: [...] "Both Nick and Rick were catatonic in terms of their playing ability at the beginning. Neither of them played on this at all really. [...] In my view, they'd been destroyed by Roger …" [...] Gilmour's comments angered Mason, who reflected: [...] "I'd deny that I was catatonic. [...] I'd expect that from the opposition, it's less attractive from one's allies. [...] At some point, he made some sort of apology." [...] Mason did concede, however, that Gilmour was nervous about how the album would be perceived.|$|E
