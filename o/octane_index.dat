The poor performance of this engine in USA was probably due to fact that in USA the petrol had an <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> of only 85 RON while in Europe the petrol at the time had an <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> of 95 RON (up to 100 RON today). Also the manual transmission with four gears used in Europe contributed to a much better performance than the three-speed automatic transmission usually used in the US. The 1800 (fitted with a manual transmission) also sold in small numbers in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The {{evaluation}} of the octane number by the two laboratory methods requires a standard engine, and the test procedure can be both expensive and time-consuming. The standard engine required for the test {{may not always be}} available, especially in out-of-the-way places or in small or mobile laboratories. These and other considerations led to the search for a rapid method for the {{evaluation of}} the anti-knock quality of gasoline. Such methods include FTIR, near infrared on-line analyzers (ASTM D-2885) and others. Deriving an equation {{that can be used for}} calculating the octane quality would also serve the same purpose with added advantages. The term <b>Octane</b> <b>Index</b> is often used to refer to the calculated octane quality in contradistinction to the (measured) research or motor octane numbers. The <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> can be of great service in the blending of gasoline. Motor gasoline, as marketed, is usually a blend of several types of refinery grades that are derived from different processes such as straight-run gasoline, reformate, cracked gasoline etc. These different grades are considered as one group when blending to meet final product specifications. Most refiners produce and market more than one grade of motor gasoline, differing principally in their anti-knock quality. The ability to predict the octane quality of the blends prior to blending is essential, something for which the calculated <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> is specially suited.|$|E

First patents were taken out on fuel quality (defined by <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> nowadays). After patents on sensors itself, engine settings were piloted to eliminate knock conditions in 1979 - 1980. Many companies followed this pathway. Latest patents on knock are reviewed.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for estimating the <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> (OI), the {{research octane number}} (RON) and the motor octane number (MON) using ignition delay times from a constant volume combustion chamber with liquid fuel injection is proposed by adopting an ignition quality tester. A baseline data of ignition delay times were determined using an ignition quality tester at a charge pressure of 21. 3 bar between 770 and 850 K and an equivalence ratio of 0. 7 for various primary reference fuels (PRFs, mixtures of isooctane and n-heptane). Our methodology was developed using ignition delay times for toluene reference fuels (mixtures of toluene and n-heptane). A correlation between the OI and the ignition delay time at the initial charge temperature enabled the OI of non-PRFs to be predicted at specified temperatures. The methodology was validated using ignition delay times for toluene primary reference fuels (ternary mixtures of toluene, iso-octane, and n-heptane), fuels for advanced combustion engines (FACE) gasolines, and certification gasolines. Using this methodology, the RON, the MON, and the octane sensitivity were estimated in agreement with values obtained from standard test methods. A correlation between derived cetane number and RON is also provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Methyl Tert-Butyl Ether (MTBE) {{is one of}} {{the ether}} oxygenates which its use has been {{increased}} within the last twenty years. This compound is produced from isobutylene and methanol reaction that is used as <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> enhancer and also increases dissolved oxygen in gasoline and decreases carbon monoxide emission in four phased motors because of better combustion of gasoline. High solubility in water (52 g/L), high vapor pressure (0. 54 kg/cm 3), low absorption to organic carbon of soil and presence of MTBE in the list of potentially-carcinogens of U. S EPA has made its use of great concern. The culture media used in this study was Mineral Salt Medium (MSM). The study lasted for 236 days and in three different concentrations of MTBE of 200, 5 and 0. 8 mg/L. A control sample was also used to compare the results. This research studied the isolation methods of microbial consortium in the MTBE polluted soils in Tehran and Abadan petroleum refinery besides MTBE degradation. The results showed the capability of bacteria in consuming MTBE as carbon source. Final microbial isolation was performed with several microbial passages as well as keeping consortium in a certain amount of MTBE as the carbon source...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{combustion}} {{performance of}} gasoline engines {{has traditionally been}} measured using Research Octane Number (RON) and Motor Octane Number (MON) which describe antiknock performance under different conditions. Recent literature suggests that MON {{is less important than}} RON in modern cars and a relaxation in the MON specification could improve vehicle performance, while also helping refiners in the production of gasoline. At the same time, for the same octane number change, increasing RON appears to provide more benefit to engine power and acceleration than reducing MON. It has also been suggested that there could be fuel efficiency benefits (on a tank to wheels basis) for specially adapted engines, for example, operating at higher compression ratio, on very high RON (100 +). Other workers have advocated the use of an <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> (OI) which incorporates both RON and MON to give an indication of octane quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of RON and MON on the power and acceleration performance of modern gasoline vehicles under full throttle acceleration conditions. Tests were carried out using two Euro 4 vehicles. Fuels covering RON levels from 95 to 103 and sensitivities (RON minus MON) of up to 15 were blended. Both pure hydrocarbon and blends containing ethanol or ETBE were included so that specific effects of oxygenates could be identified. The results confirmed the findings of other studies that MON is not a good predictor of vehicle performance and in fact high MON levels increase acceleration time under full throttle conditions. In addition to performance testing, emissions testing was also carried out. Carbon balance was used to calculate energy consumption during the acceleration tests and NEDC tests...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{surrogate}} fuels {{are needed}} to model practical fuels, which are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons. The surrogate fuel should match the combustion and emissions behaviour of the target fuel as much as possible. This paper presents experimental results using {{a wide range of}} fuels in both the gasoline and diesel auto-ignition range, but of different volatilities and compositions, in a single cylinder diesel engine. Premixed combustion in a compression ignition engine is defined, in this paper, to occur when the injection event is clearly separated from the combustion and the engine-out smoke is very low - below 0. 05 FSN (filter smoke number). Under such circumstances, if the combustion phasing is matched for two fuels at a given operating condition and injection timing, the emissions are also comparable regardless of the differences in composition and volatility. For the experimental conditions considered, combustion phasing at a given operating condition and injection timing depends only on the <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> (OI), OI = (1 -K) RON + KMON, where RON and MON are research and motor octane numbers and K is an empirical constant that depends on operating conditions. A mixture of iso-octane, n-heptane and toluene can be found to match the RON and MON of any practical gasoline and will be a very good surrogate for the gasoline since it will have the same OI. If the compression ratio is greater than 14, practical diesel fuels, with DCN (derived cetane number) between 40 and 60, will have comparable ignition delays to n-heptane, which is an adequate surrogate for such fuels. However, premixed combustion can be attained only at much lower loads at a given speed with diesel fuels compared to gasolines...|$|E
40|$|Methyl {{tertiary}} butyl ether (MTBE) is an oxygenated compound used {{to enhance}} the <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> of gasoline and replace lead in gasoline. MTBE can reduce air pollution but causes water pollution due to its high water solubility and low sorption to soil and thus can easily contaminate the environment. Biodegradation {{is one of the}} promising techniques to reduce MTBE contaminated in the environment and MTBE degrader was proposed as an efficient method used to degrade MTBE. In this study, MTBE degraders were isolated from gasoline contaminated soil and then were evaluated with the hypothesis that MTBE degraders could improve biodegradation of MTBE in soil and mixed culture could degrade MTBE more rapidly than monoculture. Gasoline contaminated soil samples were taken from retail gas stations and a motorcycle repair shop in Khon Kaen University. Isolation of MTBE degrader was conducted by using Basal Salt Medium (BSM) containing 200 mg/L of MTBE as a carbon source. Mixed culture of MTBE degrader was successfully isolated under aerobic condition. Morphology study was conducted by streaking isolated mixed culture in solid medium, agar slant and identifying the cells shape under a microscope. It was found that this mixed culture was a gram negative bacteria with 7 different isolates. A comparison of the ability to degrade MTBE between mixed culture and monoculture was investigated in BSM containing 100 mg/L of MTBE. The results indicated that a mixed culture degraded MTBE more rapidly than monoculture i. e. 20 % within 14 days. Monoculture, J 4 and J 7, were the most rapid MTBE degraders among the other monocultures in which they degraded 14 % of MTBE in 14 days while monoculture J 15 could degrade only 1 % of MTBE. This preliminary result suggests that mixed cultures degrade MTBE more efficiently than monoculture...|$|E
40|$|Concern {{over the}} {{negative}} effects of fuel and oil usage on the environment has caused changes in regulations with severe impacts on gasoline, other jet fuels and lubricating oils. In order to improve the octane quality of a gasoline fraction, the refinery industry uses some high-octane rating components that are paraffinic in nature. The <b>octane</b> <b>index</b> is improved by increasing the degree of iso-alkane branching. Since the highly branched isomers have a relatively low environmental impact, the skeletal isomerization of n-alkane can be a key technology for production of high quality gasoline [1]. However, the practical application of this process has only been confined to short chain alkanes, because the isomerization of long-chain alkanes is usually accompanied by undesirable cracking. Thus, catalysts with a sufficiently good balance of metal and acid functions under suitable reaction conditions are generally needed to suppress cracking in order to achieve high isomerization selectivity for long-chain alkanes [2]. Molybdenum oxide (MoO 3) supported catalysts have been extensively studied in recent years due to their possible potential to catalyze the isomerization of linear alkanes [3]. Based on previous study, catalyst support is one of the crucial factors that influence the catalyst acidity [4]. Therefore, in this study, a series of MoO 3 catalyst supported by HZSM- 5, MCM- 41, SiO 2 and ZrO 2 was prepared by impregnation method. Their structural property was characterized using nitrogen physisorption analysis and the acidic property was determined by pyridine adsorbed IR spectroscopy. The catalytic property of all catalyst was evaluated over n-heptane isomerization at 623 K. The result showed that MoO 3 -ZrO 2 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic activity with 33. 9 % conversion. The result was attributed from the Lewis acid property of the catalyst which was crucial in the n-heptane isomerization. Comparison between all the catalyst acidic property and their catalytic activity is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) is one combustion strategy that {{has shown the}} possibility of both lower emissions and lower fuel consumption than spark ignition combustion. However, HCCI combustion can be sensitive to changes in fuel composition. The effects of fuel composition on HCCI combustion were experimentally investigated in a single cylinder 4 -stroke SI engine adapted to run HCCI combustion with the Negative Valve Overlap (NVO) valve timing strategy. This strategy traps large amounts of hot residual gases in the cylinder to raise the mixture temperature and promote auto-ignition. Direct fuel injection was used, with one injection occurring during the NVO period to increase the residual temperature and for fuel reforming, and the other injection occurring just after intake valve opening. The timing and duration of the NVO injection were used to control the combustion phasing; an advance in timing or increase in delivered fuel mass caused an advance in combustion. The testing was performed at three operating conditions: 2100 RPM 3 bar IMEP, 2100 RPM 2 bar IMEP, and 3500 RPM 2 bar IMEP. Three gasoline-like fuels and an 87 octane pump gasoline were tested {{to examine the effects}} on fuel consumption and HC, CO, and NOx emissions. The trends for the fuels were consistent over all conditions and correlated well with combustion phasing. Most differences were small with a few exceptions. One of the test fuels, which was the only oxygenated fuel tested, showed significantly higher fuel consumption, which was mainly due to its lower energy density. This fuel also had lower HC emissions than the other test fuels; however, this may have been caused by the HC analyzer?s lower response to oxygenated hydrocarbons. The pump iv gasoline had significantly higher NOx emissions, but the reason for this difference is less clear and may have been caused by chemical effects. The combustion phasing of the four fuels was also compared. Heptane and Iso-Octane were also tested as they provided limits of low and high octane rating respectively. The phasing of the three test fuels, which ranged in RON from 66 to 88 and MON from 69 to 98, were all advanced compared to the pump gasoline by 2 � at 2100 RPM and 1 � at 3500 RPM. The phasing of Heptane was advanced by 6 � at 2100 RPM and 3 � at 3500 RPM, while the Iso-Octane was retarded 6 � at 2100 RPM and 3 � at 3500 RPM. Correlations of RON and MON with the change in phasing were poor, but <b>Octane</b> <b>Index</b> correlations were good...|$|E
40|$|The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{engine is}} a {{promising}} engine concept that emits low concentrations of NOx and particulates {{and still has}} a high efficiency. Since the charge is auto-ignited, the auto-ignition quality of the fuel is of major importance. It {{has been shown in}} several studies that neither of the classical measures of auto-ignition quality of gasoline-like fuels, RON and MON, can alone describe this in all conditions in HCCI combustion. However, even in such cases it is possible to combine RON and MON into an <b>octane</b> <b>index,</b> OI, that describes the auto-ignition quality well in most conditions. The octane numbers are combined into the OI with the variable K according to the following equation: OI = (1 -K) RON + K MON = RON – K S The OI of a sensitive fuel is the equivalent of the octane number of a primary reference fuel with the same resistance to auto-ignition in the tested condition. The K-value is dependent on the temperature and pressure history. A generic parameter Tcomp 15, the temperature at 15 bar during the compression, was introduced to describe the temperature and pressure history. It was found that the K-value increases with increasing Tcomp 15 and two linear equations have been suggested to describe this relationship. At high or low Tcomp 15 it has been found that the sensitivity of the fuel octane quality on combustion phasing is small and the auto-ignition quality defined by the OI scale does no longer play a big role. NO affects the combustion phasing of gasoline-like fuels. This effect is most significant at low concentration where it advances the combustion phasing considerably. At higher conditions its influence is different for different fuels. A sensitive fuel is considered a good HCCI fuel since its OI changes {{in the same direction as}} the octane requirement of the engine, which would make the engine management easier. It is also likely that a sensitive fuel will enable a wider operating range. The auto-ignition quality of diesel-like fuels was studied in tests with three different strategies of mixture formation. In these tests it was found that the ignition delay increased with lower cetane number and that the cetane number described the auto-ignition quality well, even for fuels of significantly different physical properties. The experiments were, however, made at a limited range of operating conditions and low load. A good diesel-like HCCI fuel should be easy to vaporize to facilitate homogeneity. It should have a high resistance to auto-ignition, not necessarily the highest, one that allows both high and low loads at a given compression ratio. Finally, it should also function well with the injection system without a significant decrease in injection system life length. QC 2010091...|$|E
