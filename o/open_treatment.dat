30|$|Many reports {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} <b>open</b> bite <b>treatment</b> during mixed dentition stage [17] and [18]. A recent systematic review examined <b>open</b> bite <b>treatment</b> modalities in children found no consistent findings regarding the most effective treatment modality in growing patients with open bite malocclusion [19]. However, no comprehensive review was conducted {{to examine the effects}} of posterior teeth intrusion on vertical facial morphology in non-growing patients.

While orthognathic surgery is considered {{the gold standard for}} skeletal <b>open</b> bite <b>treatment</b> to achieve the optimal esthetic and occlusal result [34], non-surgical orthodontic treatment for these cases has become more common since it is less expensive and more acceptable for patients. Early <b>treatment</b> of <b>open</b> bite during mixed dentition has been supported by many authors [35], as it represents the importance of modification of habits or reducing the need for orthognathic surgery after puberty. Therefore, many reports were discussing <b>open</b> bite <b>treatment</b> in the younger age group. Furthermore, difficulty in obtaining open bite patients has made most reports in our electronic search are case reports.|$|R

30|$|There are no {{randomized}} {{clinical trials}} performed {{focused on the}} <b>open</b> bite <b>treatment</b> using temporary anchorage devices.

The drawbacks in most of the articles such as absence of untreated control groups, short follow-up period, small sample size, and presence of confounding factors should be avoided in future studies so as to reach a more accurate conclusion concerning <b>open</b> bite <b>treatment.</b>|$|R

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of rigid internal fixation devices, more and more surgeons favour an open approach to treating condylar fractures of the mandible in adult patients.

Especially when combined with strategies that allow progressive approximation of the fascial edges, high closure rates can be obtained. Intra-abdominal pressure measurement can be used to guide the surgical strategy and continued attention to intra-abdominal hypertension is necessary.

40|$|Objective: To {{detect the}} changes in 3 D mandibular motion after two types of {{condylar}} fracture therapies. Materials and methods: Using a 3 D motion analyzer, free mandibular border movements were recorded in 21 patients successfully treated for unilateral fractures of the mandibular condylar process (nine patients: open reduction, rigid internal fixation, and functional treatment; 12 patients: closed reduction and functional treatment; follow-up: 6 - 66 months), and in 25 control subjects. Results: No differences were found among the groups at maximum mouth opening (MO), protrusion and in lateral excursions. During opening, the patients had a larger maximal deviation to the fractured side than the controls (controls 2. 3 mm, <b>open</b> <b>treatment</b> 3. 9 mm, closed treatment 4. 2 mm; Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0. 014; closed treatment vs. controls, p = 0. 004), with a larger coronal plane angle (controls 2. 4 °, <b>open</b> <b>treatment</b> 3. 6 °, closed treatment 4. 4 °; p = 0. 016; closed treatment vs. controls, p = 0. 013). In the closed treatment patients, a longer follow-up was related to increased maximum MO (p = 0. 04), sagittal plane angle (p = 0. 03), and reduced lateral mandibular deviation during MO (p = 0. 03).

40|$|Introduction: Omphalitis and {{umbilical}} cord separation time {{contributing to the}} number of morbidity and mortality in infants. There are various ways of cord care, but {{there was no significant difference}} in prevent of infection and cord separation time. Breast milk contains anti-infective and antiinflammatory factors that can be used for cord care. WHO recommends to develop it. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of topical breastmilk model on the incidence of omphalitis and separation time of the {{umbilical cord}} to the newborn. Method: The study design was a quasy experimental. The subjects of this study were 30 newborns obtained by consecutive sampling in Rumah Sakit Ibu dan Anak Kendangsari Surabaya May–June 2012. The samples were divided into 2 groups (topical breastmilk and <b>open</b> dry <b>treatment),</b> each group consists of 15 newborns. Data were analyzed using chi-square and independent t-test with a signifi cance level ofα≤ 0. 05. Results: There was no difference in the incidence of omphalitis in the use of topical breastmilk model compared to <b>open</b> dry <b>treatment</b> (p= 0. 33). However, there are significant differences in the average of cord separation time between topical breastmilk model and <b>open</b> dry <b>treatment</b> (p= 0. 020).

40|$|Background and aims: The goal after <b>open</b> abdomen <b>treatment</b> is {{to reach}} primary fascial closure. Modern {{negative}} pressure wound therapy systems are sometimes inefficient for this purpose. This retrospective chart analysis describes {{the use of the}} components separation' method in facilitating primary fascial closure after open abdomen. Material and methods: A total of 16 consecutive critically ill surgical patients treated with components separation during open abdomen management were analyzed. No patients were excluded. Results: Primary fascial closure was achieved in 75 % (12 / 16). Components separation was performed during ongoing <b>open</b> abdomen <b>treatment</b> in 7 patients and at the time of delayed primary fascial closure in 9 patients. Of the former, 3 / 7 (43 %) patients reached primary fascial closure, whereas all 9 patients in the latter group had successful fascial closure without major complications (p= 0. 019). Conclusion: Components separation is a useful method in contributing to successful primary fascial closure in patients treated for open abdomen.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this project was to evaluate the low-moisture anhydrous ammonia (LMAA) pretreatment process of corn stover for bioethanol production. In order to fully evaluate this pretreatment method, three sub-objectives were developed: the optimization of the conditions for the LMAA pretreatment process; {{the influence of the}} LMAA pretreatment process during long-term storage of corn stover; and the techno-economic analysis (TEA) of this LMAA pretreatment process in bioethanol production. In optimization experiments, several influencing factors were being investigated. As a result, the LMAA process increased the glucose yield by nearly 3 times compared with un-pretreated corn stover. And the optimal conditions determined by the experiments were 50 wt % moisture content, 72 h of pretreatment time, 75 °C of pretreatment temperature and 0. 1 g NH 3 /g DM biomass. In storage experiments, two sealing conditions were being explored equipped with two independent variables for each scenario. The results showed that no significant reduction in carbohydrates was found in either sealed or <b>open</b> <b>treatments,</b> but lignin reduction was observed in sealed treatments. In terms of mass loss, it increased with time in sealed <b>treatments,</b> but in <b>open</b> <b>treatments,</b> the mass loss was affected by the environment. As for the techno-economic analysis of the LMAA pretreatment process, the detailed cost analysis was conducted and the unit cost of the bio-ethanol was compared among three various scales.
