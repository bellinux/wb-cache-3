5000|$|Flexplay is a {{trademark}} for a DVD-compatible <b>optical</b> <b>video</b> <b>disc</b> format with a time-limited (usually 48-hour) playback time. They are {{often described as}} [...] "self-destructing" [...] although the disc merely turns black and does not physically disintegrate. The same technology was used by Disney's Buena Vista Home Entertainment under the name ez-D. The Flexplay concept was invented by two professors, Yannis Bakos and Erik Brynjolfsson, who founded Flexplay Technologies in 1999. The technology was developed by Flexplay Technologies and General Electric.|$|E
50|$|DVD (Digital Video Disc, or Digital Versatile Disc) was {{released}} in 1996. It is a hybrid of Philips and Sony's MM-CD (Multi-Media Compact Disc) format and Toshiba's SD (Super Density) format. The last-minute adoption of the hybrid DVD format was agreed to by all three companies {{in an effort to}} avoid a damaging format war, similar to that between Beta and VHS in the 1970s and 1980s. Toshiba failed to reach a similar compromise agreement with Sony in the race to develop a high-definition <b>optical</b> <b>video</b> <b>disc</b> format in the 2000s. This proved to be a costly mistake for Toshiba (and the format's co-developers, NEC and Microsoft), and the AOD (Advanced Optical Disc) format, later renamed HD DVD, lost a brutal format war with Sony's Blu-ray Disc (BD) format. This format war delayed acceptance of either format, and Blu-ray Disc has only recently gained traction in the consumer market, where it competes with the continued success of DVD and the rise of streaming movie services such as Netflix.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} design and {{implementation}} of a binocular display head-set akin to Dr. Ivan E. Sutherland's head-mounted display, but using several new technologies and new techniques in computer graphics: small portable video display, transmitter and receiver; write-once <b>optical</b> <b>video</b> <b>disc</b> recorder; a magnetic position sensor, and a depth cue based animation package. This implementation has permitted {{the creation of a}} highly interactive three dimensional trainer/simulator. Computer generated controlled images are optically mixed into the surrounding environment by imaging through two beamsplitter mirrors positioned in front of the viewer's eyes. The source of the images on the display head-set is two Sony Flat CRT's mounted on top of the head-set pointing downward. The beamsplitter mirrors are angled out from the bottom of a pair of eyeglasses. Normal vision is through the eyeglasses; the TV images are reflected in the mirrors. The viewer is able to manipulate the display image by "touching" and "moving" the image with his hand, or even to "look around" the display image. A position sensor located on either the viewers hand or the head-set itself provides the - input for the manipulation. Stereo for 3 -D viewing is obtained by transmitting two video sources to the two receivers on two OHF channels located in a small beltpack. This thesis also describes a write-once <b>optical</b> <b>video</b> <b>disc</b> recorder that is used to store "pre-computed" view-point dependent images. The images of a scene were recorded in coherent segments to create a visual data base; included were full rotations and general movements of stereoscopic image pairs. Real-time manipulation of the pre-recorded images is done though fast-executing commands on the optical write-once recorder. The graphics package permits quick construction and scripting of objects. To increase the sensation of 3 -D, special attention is paid to the inclusion and the highlighting of physiological and psychological depth cues. by Mark A. Callahan. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} notion of marrying two technologies: raster-scan {{computer}} animation and <b>optical</b> <b>video</b> <b>discs.</b> Animated sequences, generated at non real-time rates, then transfered to <b>video</b> <b>disc,</b> can be recalled under user control at real-time rates. Highly detailed animation may be combined with other media in interactive systems. Such systems inherently offer {{a greater degree of}} flexibility to the animator. The implementation of one such system is discussed in detail. by Walter Bender. Thesis (M. S. V. S.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Architecture, 1980.

50|$|Track {{positioning}} also follows {{two different}} methods across disk storage devices. Storage devices focused on holding computer data, e.g., HDDs, FDDs, Iomega zip drives, use concentric tracks to store data. During a sequential {{read or write}} operation, after the drive accesses all the sectors in a track it repositions the head(s) to the next track. This will cause a momentary delay {{in the flow of}} data between the device and the computer. In contrast, <b>optical</b> audio and <b>video</b> <b>discs</b> use a single spiral track that starts at the inner most point on the disc and flows continuously to the outer edge. When reading or writing data {{there is no need to}} stop the flow of data to switch tracks. This is similar to vinyl records except vinyl records started at the outer edge and spiraled in toward the center.|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>video</b> {{recording}} technology, using {{a transparent}} disc, {{was invented by}} David Paul Gregg and James Russell in 1958 (and patented in 1961 and 1990). The Gregg patents were purchased by MCA in 1968. By 1969, Philips had developed a videodisc in reflective mode, which has advantages over the transparent mode. MCA and Philips then decided to combine their efforts and first publicly demonstrated the <b>video</b> <b>disc</b> in 1972.|$|R
