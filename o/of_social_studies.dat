25|$|Admission to the {{university}} is based upon holistic review of a candidate’s academic record, with the strongest consideration being given {{to those who have}} a combined ability score of 140 or higher. The combined ability score is calculated by adding the percentage of students in the applicant's graduating class that the applicant outranks and the percentage of students the applicant outscored on a nationally standardized test (usually the ACT, although the SAT is also accepted). Admissions decisions are also based, however, on a mandatory application essay, the applicant's resume, and the applicant's high school and extracurricular record. According to the Princeton Review, Truman has a selectivity rating of 88, a 68% acceptance rate, with applicants having a 3.79 average high school GPA, and an 88% retention rate after freshman year. All applicants must have 4 credits of English, 3 credits of math, 3 credits of science, 2 credits of foreign language, 2 credits <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies,</b> and 1 credit of fine art. The average GPA of an admitted student is 3.25 on a 4.0 scale, with 50% of all admitted students ranking in the top 10% of their class, and the median ACT range is 25–31.|$|E
25|$|Queer {{theory is}} a field of post-structuralist {{critical}} theory {{that emerged in the}} early 1990s out of the fields of queer studies and women's studies. Applications of queer theory include queer theology and queer pedagogy. Queer theorists, including Rod Ferguson, Jasbir Puar, Lisa Duggan, and Chong-suk Han, critique the mainstream gay political movement as allied with neoliberal and imperialistic agendas, including gay tourism, gay and trans military inclusion, and state- and church-sanctioned marriages for monogamous gay couples. Puar, a queer theorist of color, coined the term homonationalism, which refers to the rise of American exceptionalism, nationalism, white supremacy, and patriarchy within the gay community catalyzed in response to the September 11 attacks. Many studies have acknowledged the problems that lie within the traditional theory and process <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies,</b> and so choose to utilise a queer theoretical approach instead. One such study was conducted in Melbourne in 2016 by Roffee and Waling. By using queer and feminist theories and approaches the researchers were better equipped to cater for the needs, and be accommodating for the vulnerabilities, of the LGBTIQ participants of the study. In this case, it was a specifically post-modern queer theory that enabled the researchers to approach the study with a fair perspective, acknowledging all the varieties of narratives and experiences within the LGBTIQ community.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: As the {{progress}} of digital technology, involving e-learning into&# 13; curriculum becomes a novel trend. In general, the teaching practice <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>study</b> for elementary&# 13; school students in Taiwan still depends on teachers one-way instruction. Its difficult to activate&# 13; students motivation within the limited course time. Approach: This study is proposed to recognize&# 13; how e-learning improves teaching and learning in the domain <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>study</b> for elementary school&# 13; students. The quasi-experimental method is basically introduced into this study. Additionally, two&# 13; sample teams: experimental group (the team with MOODLE, Modular Object Oriented Dynamic&# 13; Learning Environment, e-learning) and control group (the team with traditional teaching method) are&# 13; arranged for this study. The resource in how e-learning will affect elementary school students in the&# 13; field <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>study</b> is moreover received. Results: Through the computer-based statistical analysis,&# 13; two points are furthermore concluded as 1. The average learning score from the experimental group&# 13; exceeds that from control group. 2. The students {{in the experimental group}} have a positive attitude&# 13; toward e-learning. Conclusion: It is shown that the e-learning integration into curriculum indeed&# 13; helped students performance. Besides, from the data of questionnaires, students with MOODLE elearning&# 13; were more confident in self-studying and understanding of the course content...|$|R
