5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– and the presence <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E

5|$|After {{two years}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bradbury became an {{assistant}} professor of physics at Stanford University in 1935, rising to become an associate professor in 1938, and a full professor in 1943. He became an expert on the electrical conductivity of gases, the properties of ions, and the behavior <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> electricity, publishing in journals including the Physical Review, Journal of Applied Physics, Journal of Chemical Physics, and the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> Electricity and Terrestrial Magnetism. He invented the Bradbury-Nielsen shutter, a type of electrical ion gate, widely used in mass spectrometry in both time-of-flight mass spectrometers and ion mobility spectrometers.|$|E

30|$|Another {{simulation}} {{is performed}} with a source amplitude (win) of 5.0 × 10 − 3 cm/s (but not shown). The fraction <b>of</b> the <b>atmospheric</b> perturbations {{to the background}} at 300 -km altitude is about ~ 0.001 % in this case. Both the source amplitude and the amplitudes <b>of</b> upper <b>atmospheric</b> perturbations are smaller {{by a factor of}} 100 than for the source amplitude of 0.50 cm/s. The features <b>of</b> the upper <b>atmospheric</b> perturbations are not so different qualitatively from those with the larger source amplitude. This shows that the response of the amplitudes <b>of</b> upper <b>atmospheric</b> perturbations is linear to the source amplitude. Therefore, the source amplitude can be estimated if the amplitudes <b>of</b> upper <b>atmospheric</b> perturbations are obtained by observation.|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) signals are often seriously contaminated by atmospheric delays. The state of the atmosphere, especially the atmospheric water vapor, varies significantly both in space and with time. It is necessary to understand the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>atmospheric</b> variations in order to devise appropriate means for the mitigation of the effects. We use interferograms generated from some ERS tandem pairs covering Hong Kong, Shanghai of southern China and New South Wales of Australia to study the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>atmospheric</b> effects in these areas. The anisotropy and Gaussianity <b>of</b> the <b>atmospheric</b> effects are first examined with the method of Radon transform and Hinich test and then compared in terms of different regions and climate patterns. The spectral features <b>of</b> the <b>atmospheric</b> effects are then analyzed with the method of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and power spectrum. The implication of the results on practical Interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements, especially on the modeling and correction <b>of</b> the <b>atmospheric</b> effects are examined. ...|$|R

5|$|Carbon-14 {{is formed}} in upper {{layers of the}} {{troposphere}} and the stratosphere at altitudes of 9–15km by a reaction that is precipitated by cosmic rays. Thermal neutrons are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen-14, forming carbon-14 and a proton. As such, 1.2 × 1010% <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> carbon dioxide contains carbon-14.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants {{on the surface of the}} ocean and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> carbon.|$|E
5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, was the use <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric,</b> or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E

5|$|Significant discoveries {{relating}} to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism, including ammonification, nitrification and nitrogen fixation (the uptake <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> nitrogen by symbiotic soil microorganisms) {{had to wait}} for advances in chemistry and bacteriology in the late 19th century and this was followed in the early 20th century by the elucidation of protein and amino-acid synthesis and their role in plant metabolism.

5|$|The chaotic {{nature of}} the atmosphere, the massive {{computational}} power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.|$|E
5|$|Another type <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> water {{collector}} {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E

5|$|Because Jupiter {{is not a}} solid body, {{its upper}} {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5minutes longer {{than that of the}} equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°N to 10°S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island {{was not the first}} point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs to a point of land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the Antarctic Circle, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> refraction effects.|$|E
5|$|Franklin was {{a pioneer}} in the field of archaeometry, which applies modern {{materials}} analysis to archaeology. She worked for example, on the dating of prehistoric bronze, copper and ceramic artifacts. In the early 1960s Franklin was {{one of a number of}} scientists who participated in the Baby Tooth Survey, a project founded by Eric and Louise Reiss along with other scientists such as Barry Commoner, which investigated levels of strontium-90—a radioactive isotope in fallout from nuclear weapons testing—in children's teeth. This research contributed to the cessation <b>of</b> <b>atmospheric</b> weapons testing. Franklin published more than a hundred scientific papers and contributions to books on the structure and properties of metals and alloys as well as on the history and social effects of technology.|$|E
