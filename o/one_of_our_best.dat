Introduction: As for untruths in poetry, poets are apt {{to go beyond the}} true facts in the case, and as a result, things are stated which are not in accordance with scientific laws. In taking up the different ways in which a few of the best poets have treated Nature we may have some idea of the elements in Nature poetry. Chaucer, who has been called “The Morning Star of English Song”, is said to have loved Nature equally as well as any poet but with that simple child-like love. Shakespeare, through all his dramas, forcibly impresses the reader with not only the characters of the persons but with it gives you and often-times by just a line or two a perfect picture of the surrounding scenery. In this he differs from our modern poets for in describing his characters he strikes off the surroundings most natural to fit the case, while the modern poet is prone to premeditate on all the scenery and then bring in the character later. For this reason Shakespeare excelled as a poet. Wordsworth is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> very <b>best</b> Nature poets. While but a mere boy he had that love of Nature which grew up with him and made him the great interpreter of Nature. While roaming over the hills with other boys he had such beautiful thoughts which found expression later in his poems...|$|R

Forecasting of future grid load (electricity usage) {{is an important}} task to provide intelligence to the smart gird. Accurate forecasting will enable a utility provider to plan the resources and also to take control actions to balance the supply and the demand of electricity. In this paper, our contribution is the proposal of a new data mining scheme to forecast the peak load of a particular consumer entity in the smart grid for a future time unit. We utilize least-squares version of support vector regression with online learning strategy in our approach. Experimental results show that our method is able to provide more accurate results than an existing forecasting method which {{is reported to be}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the <b>best.</b> <b>Our</b> method can provide 98. 4 – 98. 7 % of average accuracy whilst the state-of-the-art method by Lv et al. is able to provide only 96. 7 % <b>of</b> average accuracy. <b>Our</b> method is also computationally efficient and can potentially be used for large scale load forecasting applications.
