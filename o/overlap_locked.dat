In particular, the Parisi spontaneous replica symmetry breaking phenomenon is described {{in the frame of}} extended variational principles, Derrida-Ruelle probability cascades, and <b>overlap</b> <b>locking.</b> Comment: 25 page...|$|R
50|$|The lens is even smaller, and {{the search}} for an {{everything}} in focus both cruel and unmoved together, burns every remaining twilight; the lens is focused and restricted as much as the conscience of the painter expands, and the object fills the canvas with no evidence of any effort. The world could be said to be reduced to a still life, but a still life - this still life - is elevated to the rank of absolute and pivotal phenomenon. It is a fatal mechanism that Verrusio realizes aggregating, <b>overlapping,</b> <b>locking,</b> around the same subject, the results of a more widespread observation: the pebble, smoothed by the wind from the sea, is found in every position possible, under every possible light, and is reborn countless times, totally possessed, in a succession of surfaces, curves, volumes, always the same and always different.|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} written in Delphi 6, a dialect of Object Pascal, by Geoff Mayo {{and has been in}} {{development}} since the late 1990s. Visually, it resembles the British Rail Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC), though most of the simulations do not cover areas operated by IECC-based signal boxes. It simulates <b>overlaps,</b> approach <b>locking,</b> time-of-operation point locking, shunt routes, warner routes, call-on routes, and more.|$|R
40|$|Nano-rod {{reinforced}} {{materials for}} example with cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) has shown great potential. It {{is common to}} optimize the compatibility between cellulose, polymer and solvent {{in order to improve}} material properties. Here we show that increased compatibility will give more porous films, which from many points of view can be a drawback, e. g. an increased porosity in the material can decrease mechanical and barrier properties. It was hypothesized that the addition of higher amounts of a rod-like nano-filler, i. e. up to 20 wt% to a composite material will cause the nano-rods to <b>overlap,</b> <b>lock</b> the system and introduce pores and cavities to the final material. In order to investigate the hypothesis, nano-composite films consisting of the matrix materials polylactide acid (PLA) or poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and the nano-filler cellulose nanocrystals were produced via solvent casting and the morphology, density and water permeability were studied for the produced films. The addition of both unmodified and modified CNC to the matrix polymers resulted in materials where pores and cavities were present, which was more evident for the modified CNC that was more homogeneous dispersed into the matrix. The presence of pores in the films resulted in decreased density and increased water permeability. The solvent casted films were hot-melt pressed to reduce the amounts of pores and cavities but density and water permeability measurements for the pressed films showed that it was difficult to remove all cavities using melting and pressing procedure...|$|R
50|$|The third {{component}} in SIPs is the spline or connector piece between SIP panels. Dimensional lumber {{is commonly used}} but creates thermal bridging and lowers insulation values. To maintain higher insulation values through the spline, manufacturers use Insulated Lumber, Composite Splines, Mechanical <b>Locks,</b> <b>Overlapping</b> OSB Panels, or other creative methods. Depending on the method selected, other advantages such as full nailing surfaces or increased structural strength may become available.|$|R
40|$|Â© 2015 Society for Psychophysiological Research. Trial-to-trial latency {{variability}} pervades cognitive EEG {{responses and}} may mix and smear ERP components but is usually ignored in conventional ERP averaging. Existing attempts to decompose temporally overlapping and latency-variable ERP components show major limitations. Here, we propose {{a theoretical framework}} and model of ERPs consisting of temporally <b>overlapping</b> components <b>locked</b> to different external events or varying in latency from trial to trial. Based on this model, a new ERP decomposition and reconstruction method was developed: residue iteration decomposition (RIDE). Here, we describe an update of the method and compare it to other decomposition methods in simulated and real datasets. The updated RIDE method solves the divergence problem inherent to previous latency-based decomposition methods. By implementing the model of ERPs as consisting of time-variable and invariable single-trial component clusters, RIDE obtains latency-corrected ERP waveforms and topographies of the components, and yields dynamic information about single trials.

50|$|US 220 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the establishment of the U.S. Highway System on November 11, 1926. The route began at US 40 in Cumberland, Maryland, and followed its modern corridor northeast to Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The highway turned north here, proceeding northward along the current US 15 corridor to its end at the New York-Pennsylvania border in Lawrenceville. US 220 did not directly connect to US 20, its implied parent; instead, the connection was intended to be made via US 120, a route extending from Philadelphia to US 20 in Erie. As originally planned, US 120 and US 220 would <b>overlap</b> between <b>Lock</b> Haven, Pennsylvania, and Williamsport. East of Williamsport, the modern US 220 corridor was served by US 120 from Williamsport to Muncy and US 711 between Muncy and the New York state line at South Waverly. When US 120 was signed in 1927, it was altered to run only from Reading to Ridgway, isolating both US 120 and US 220 from US 20.|$|R
5000|$|Colt's Detective Special {{went through}} several issues or series. The First Series was {{produced}} from 1927 until 1946. Compared to later production models, the First Series used a narrower frame, with reduced clearance between the frontstrap of the gripframe and {{the rear of}} the trigger guard. Other distinctive features included a shorter ejector-rod with an ungrooved, knurled tip; a checkered hammer spur and cylinder latch, a [...] "half-moon"-shaped front sight, and an <b>overlapping</b> screw and <b>locking</b> pin set-up {{on the right side of}} the frame. Grip panels were wooden. A rounded butt on the metal frame became standard in 1933, but pieces with the original square butt (like that of the Police Positive Special) continued to be produced into the 1940s.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} of self-generated and externally driven non-linear current oscillations due to impact ionization of shallow impurities in n-type GaAs at low temperatures are presented. The regular relaxation oscillations which {{appear at the}} onset of breakdown are destabilized by a magnetic field normal to the epitaxial layer and multifrequency oscillations and chaotic fluctuations following the Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse scenario can be found. Driving the self-generated oscillations with an external periodic bias voltage quasiperiodicity, mode <b>locking,</b> interaction and <b>overlap</b> of mode <b>locked</b> resonances and period doubling can be observed depending on frequency and amplitude of the external force. The reconstructed return maps, recorded phase diagrams and Devil's staircase agree with theoretical predictions based on the circle map and give new evidence of the universality of the transition from quasiperiodicity to chaos. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} kilohertz-repetition-rate flame {{temperature}} measurements performed using blue diode lasers. Two-line atomic fluorescence {{was performed by}} using diode lasers emitting at around 410 and 451 nm to probe seeded atomic indium. At a repetition rate of 3. 5 kHz our technique offers a precision of 1. 5 % at 2000 K in laminar methane/air flames. The spatial resolution is better than 150 mu m, while the setup is compact and easy to operate, at much lower cost than alternative techniques. By modeling the spectral <b>overlap</b> between the <b>locked</b> laser and the probed indium lines we avoid the need for any calibration of the measurements. We demonstrate the capability of the technique for time-resolved measurements in an acoustically perturbed flame. The technique is applicable in flames {{with a wide range}} of compositions including sooting flames. (C) 2009 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R
50|$|File data locks {{are managed}} by the OST on which each object of the file is striped, using byte-range extent locks. Clients can be granted <b>overlapping</b> read extent <b>locks</b> for part {{or all of the}} file, {{allowing}} multiple concurrent readers of the same file, and/or non-overlapping write extent locks for independent regions of the file. This allows many Lustre clients to access a single file concurrently for both read and write, avoiding bottlenecks during file I/O. In practice, because Linux clients manage their data cache in units of pages, the clients will request locks that are always an integer multiple of the page size (4096 bytes on most clients). When a client is requesting an extent lock the OST may grant a lock for a larger extent than originally requested, {{in order to reduce the}} number of lock requests that the client makes. The actual size of the granted lock depends on several factors, including the number of currently-granted locks on that object, whether there are conflicting write locks for the requested lock extent, and the number of pending lock requests on that object. The granted lock is never smaller than the originally-requested extent. OST extent locks use the Lustre FID of the object as the resource name for the lock. Since the number of extent lock servers scales with the number of OSTs in the filesystem, this also scales the aggregate locking performance of the filesystem, and of a single file if it is striped over multiple OSTs.|$|R
