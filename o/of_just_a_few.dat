5|$|Aware {{of demand}} for his act in Australia, Robey {{conducted}} a second tour of {{the country at the}} start of 1939. While he was appearing at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney, war broke out with Germany. Robey returned to England and concentrated his efforts on entertaining {{to raise money for the}} war effort. He signed up with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) for whom he appeared in a wide range of shows and also in his own one-man engagements.

Lock became internationally {{recognised}} as a high scoring fighter ace of the Royal Air Force in the Second World War with 26 victories {{before his death in}} combat at the age of 21.

5|$|The United States is {{the only}} {{advanced}} economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation and is one <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{countries in the world}} without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.|$|E

Cozzens' novels disregarded modernist literary trends, and are characterized {{by the use of}} often unfamiliar, archaic words, traditional literary structures, and conservative themes. As a result, many contemporary critics regarded his work as old-fashioned or moralistic, and he was viciously attacked as a reactionary by his harshest critics.|$|E
25|$|The first cyclotron, {{an early}} type of {{particle}} accelerator, {{was built by}} Ernest O.

Since then, accelerators have grown enormously in the quest to produce new particles of greater and greater mass.

25|$|The Earth tide {{encompasses}} {{the entire body}} of the Earth and is unhindered by the thin crust and land masses of the surface, on scales that make the rigidity of rock irrelevant.

The oscillation periods of the earth as a whole are not near the astronomical periods, so its flexing is due to the forces of the moment.|$|E

25|$|The old mercantile and {{industrial}} elite, with their relative sophistication {{in matters of}} industry, trade and financing, were well poised to expand under British rule, using their own financing for new technology, represented by British machinery. Instead <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> merchants introducing new industrial machinery, as elsewhere in India, in Ahmedabad the mercantile class as a whole supported the new techniques, even though hand spinners and handloom weavers, as well as female spinners in the outlying communities had their traditional operations upset as a result. They and others were recruited into the new manufacturing plants. The merchant class tended to support the British, thinking the rule provided more security than under the Marathas, lower taxes (including lower octroi), and more property rights.|$|E
25|$|The Placenames Branch of the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs {{gives the}} origin of the name Kilmashogue as meaning “Church of Saint Mochióg”. In the nineteenth century, the {{antiquarian}} Patrick Weston Joyce reported that he had found the remains of a small church, consisting <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> walls, on the northern side of the mountain. Subsequent attempts to locate this site have been unsuccessful. In the chapel of nearby St Columba's college is an early Christian cross which was found on the mountain and is believed to have come from the church reported by Joyce. However, Coillte, the state-owned enterprise that manages the forestry on the mountain's slopes, suggest that the name Kilmashogue is a corruption of , which means “wood of the ash”, or , which means “wood of the lark”.|$|E
25|$|The Philadelphia Opera House {{was built}} over the course <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months in 1908 by {{impresario}} Oscar Hammerstein I. The house was initially the home of Hammerstein's opera company, the Philadelphia Opera Company, but was sold to the Metropolitan Opera of New York City in 1910, when it was renamed the Metropolitan Opera House. The Metropolitan Opera's association {{with the city of}} Philadelphia began during its first season, presenting its entire repertoire in the city during January and August 1884. The company's first Philadelphia performance was of Faust (with Christina Nilsson) on January 14, 1884 at the Chestnut Street Opera House. The Met continued to perform annually in Philadelphia for nearly eighty years, taking the entire company to the city on selected Tuesday nights throughout the opera season. With the exception of ten years spent performing in Hammerstein's opera house, the Met mostly performed at the Academy of Music. In 1961 the Met's regular visits ceased after having given close to 900 performances in Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|The American Buffalo, {{also known}} as a gold buffalo, is a 24-karat bullion coin first offered for sale by the United States Mint on June 22, 2006, and {{available}} for shipment beginning on July 13. The coin follows the design of the Indian Head nickel and has gained its nickname from the American Bison on the reverse side of the design. This was the first time ever that the United States Government has minted pure (.9999) 24-karat gold coins for the public. The coin has a legal tender (face) value of US$50. Due to a combination of the coin's popularity and the tremendous increase in the price of gold since its creation the coin's value has increased considerably in a short time <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years. The initial 2006 U.S. Mint price of the proof coin was $800. In 2007 the Mint proof coin was $899.95, $1,410.00 in 2009, and $2,010.00 in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Americans {{have the}} highest average {{employee}} income among OECD nations. The median household income in the US as of 2008 is $52,029. About 284,000 working people in the US have two full-time jobs and 7.6million have a part-time job {{in addition to their}} full-time employment. Of working individuals in the US, 12% belong to a labor union; most union members are government workers. The decline of union membership in the US over the last several decades parallels the decline of labor's share of the economy. The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. The United States is the only advanced economy that does not legally guarantee its workers paid vacation or paid sick days, and is one <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. In 2014, the International Trade Union Confederation graded the U.S a 4 out of 5+, its third lowest score, on the subject of powers and rights granted to labor unions.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words would be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E
