5|$|Also {{beginning}} in 2012, sighted guides became eligible to receive medals in certain events; sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football, along with guides and pilots in athletics and cycling and boccia assistants were {{now able to}} receive medals for their contributions. Previously {{in the case of}} tandem cycling, where a visually-impaired rider takes the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> with a sighted pilot in front, only the visually-impaired rider actually received a medal.|$|E
5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|Steering may be {{supplied}} by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself. This self-stability {{is generated by}} a combination of several effects that depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and forward speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> Tires, suspension, steering damping, and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|Capcom {{announced}} {{two free}} DLC packs {{to be released}} sometime after the game's release. The first pack contains <b>the</b> 800cc <b>bike</b> class with all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes,</b> riders and team liveries, {{as well as the}} brand new track for the 2010 MotoGP season, the new Silverstone Arena Circuit. The second pack includes all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes,</b> riders and team livery updates for the 600cc and 125cc bike classes, giving players brand new MotoGP 2010 data far earlier than ever before.|$|R
2500|$|... oBike placed 1,250 bikes in Melbourne since July 2017. [...] There {{has been}} notable {{vandalism}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> in <b>the</b> first few months, including being dumping in the Yarra River.|$|R
50|$|Cozy Yamakoshi {{served as}} the company's product {{development}} manager, designing <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> frames, coordinating <b>the</b> manufacture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> by Japanese manufacturers, and importing <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> into <b>the</b> US. Subsequently, around 1986, Centurion introduced their first Taiwanesebuilt model, the Signet. The Cinelli Equipe Centurion of 1985 (only) was a joint-venture of WSI and Cinelli of Italy.|$|R
5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with the mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves {{the view of the}} road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
50|$|ExhausTEC {{stands for}} Exhaust Torque Expansion Chamber, a {{technology}} patented by Bajaj. The technology involves {{use of a}} small chamber connected to <b>the</b> exhaust pipe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine to modify the back-pressure and the swirl characteristics, with an aim to improve <b>the</b> low-end performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes.</b> <b>The</b> ExhausTEC technology is claimed to be highly effective in improving the low and mid-range torque.|$|R

25|$|Unable to {{accurately}} gauge demand for <b>the</b> new <b>bike,</b> Honda limited its initial {{investment in the}} production dies for the CB750 by using a technique called permanent mold casting (often erroneously referred to as sandcasting) rather than diecasting for the engines – unsure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> reception. <b>The</b> <b>bike</b> remained in <b>the</b> Honda line up for ten years, with a production total over 400,000.|$|R
5|$|Between {{these last}} two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In the case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, which is usually stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards {{the direction in which}} the bike is traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the wobble or shimmy and rear wobble instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|E
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to {{one side or the}} other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle and the amount of trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to the rear wheel. Also, depending on the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E
25|$|United States Bicycle Route 97 is a U.S. Bicycle Route {{located along}} Alaska Route 1. <b>The</b> <b>bike</b> route runs {{alongside}} the Seward Highway along <b>the</b> entire length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway. <b>The</b> <b>bike</b> route {{was created in}} 2011.|$|R
25|$|From 2005 to 2008, {{a largely}} {{unregulated}} bike sharing program was {{operated by the}} Peoples' Pedal organisation in Edmonton, Alberta. The program suffered from high theft and vandalism rates, with 95% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> that had been placed into service stolen or missing by 2008.|$|R
5|$|The {{primary control}} input that the rider can make {{is to apply}} a torque {{directly}} to the steering mechanism via <b>the</b> handlebars. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> own dynamics, due to steering geometry and gyroscopic effects, direct position control over steering angle {{has been found to}} be problematic.|$|R
5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> and rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E
5|$|Ash pedals furiously toward Viridian City. Ash loses control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> {{and wipes}} out, {{crashing}} down a hill. Realizing Pikachu's condition is critical, Ash pleads {{him to go}} inside his Poké Ball so that Ash can protect him from the approaching Spearow. Pikachu, after seeing how much Ash cares for it, performs a powerful Thunder attack which drives the Spearow away, but also destroys Misty's bike. As the rain-clouds part, a mysterious golden bird flies over a rainbow and Ash's Pokédex informs him {{that there is no}} current data on this Pokémon and that there are several yet to be identified. Ash carries Pikachu into Viridian City, and Pikachu licks Ash's cheek.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E

25|$|Deposit: A small {{cash deposit}} {{releases}} <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> from a locked terminal {{and can only}} be retrieved by returning it to another. Since the deposit (usually one or more coins) is a fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike's</b> cost, this does little to deter theft. Other bike sharing programmes have implemented rules requiring the user to provide a valid credit card, along with substantial security deposits for bicycles and mandatory security locks.|$|R
50|$|Back in {{the early}} 80’s in the UK, MZ were {{regarded}} by the motorcycle press as producing ugly and old-fashioned (if worthy) motorcycles. The then importer, Wilf Green, decided to try and update <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> by producing his own modified versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TS125, christened the “Pathfinder” and the “Sport”.|$|R
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> and rider system, are mostly {{caused by the}} rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
50|$|Greeves {{also built}} a {{successful}} export business {{and at one}} time most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motorcycles produced {{were going to the}} United States. Greeves became so successful in the US that they had a significant influence on <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> off-road <b>biking</b> sport and with <b>the</b> invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trail <b>bike</b> with their road legal off-roader, the Ranger.|$|R
40|$|Finally, many {{bicycles}} {{were at the}} event. Though it is {{not likely}} that anyone would have left an entire bike, it is possible that wheels or other pieces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> could have broken off and been left behind. In conjunction with the other remains from the event, this would likely make it clear that the event involved bicycles and global participation. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|As with upright bikes, {{there is}} a {{subculture}} of recumbent builders who design and build home-built recumbents. Often these are assembled of parts from other bikes, particularly mountain <b>bikes.</b> <b>The</b> frame designs may {{be as simple as}} a long steel tube bent into the appropriate shape, or as elaborate as hand-built carbon fiber frames. For many builders, the engineering and construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bikes</b> is as much of a challenge as riding them.|$|R
5|$|The first {{attacks on}} the final climb came from Barguil and Van Avermaet, {{followed}} by Yates, while Rodríguez and Valverde waited in the main group. Yates passed Barguil and was chasing Van Avermaet, {{who was in the}} lead of the race. Towards the top of the climb, however, Van Avermaet was hit from behind by one of the motorbikes providing television coverage of the race. He was knocked to the ground and the frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> was broken; Van Avermaet was unable to finish the race. Yates therefore led the race alone {{at the top of the}} final climb as the race descended into San Sebastián. Unlike in the 2014 race, when he had crashed out of the lead group on the final descent, Yates extended his lead to 15 seconds as the road flattened out and was able to keep this advantage to the end of the race. As he crossed the finish line, Yates was unaware that he had won the race, as he believed that the initial breakaway had not been caught. It took some time for the message to come through from his team that he had won. In the group behind, Gilbert sprinted to second place ahead of Valverde.|$|E
5|$|The women's triathlon {{took place}} on 4 August 2012, {{featuring}} 55 women from 31 countries. Lucy Hall (Great Britain), the youngest athlete in the race, led early in the swim and finished the swim leg first {{in a time of}} 18 minutes and 27 seconds. Hall led a group of seven; Line Jensen (Denmark), Mariko Adachi (Japan), Pâmella Oliveira (Brazil), Claudia Rivas (Mexico), Laura Bennett (United States) and Jessica Harrison (France); out of the water. In the early stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> leg, Hall slowed the leading pack down so that her teammate Helen Jenkins (Great Britain) could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peloton {{at the end of the}} second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt (Australia) had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. The lead group quickly separated on the run leg and the lead group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Nicola Spirig (Switzerland), Lisa Nordén (Sweden), Erin Densham (Australia), Jenkins, Sarah Groff (United States) and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand), Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was the first to get dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after been dropped earlier on in the race. With 500 metres in the final lap to race Jenkins was dropped by the other four athletes. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nordén, Densham and Groff; Spirig pushed the pace and held off a fast-finishing Nordén to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth. After the race, Nordén and the Swedish Olympic Committee appealed against the result in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The organisation turned down the appeal and Spirig retained the gold medal.|$|E
