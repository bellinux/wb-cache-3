5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and loneliness, Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E

Political stability has {{an important role in}} determination <b>of</b> healthy <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payment than economic freedom. This study focus on selected 10 Asian countries of various income levels and test the factor of political stability and economic freedom in stability <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payment by using a simple econometric model with various techniques. Our empirical finding shows that political stability is more important than economic freedom in stabilizing <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payment. Stable political regime with visionary leadership leads the nations to higher level <b>of</b> favorable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payment. Political stability is playing major role than theoretical explanation to achieve surplus <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payment hence exchange rare stability. Surplus <b>of</b> trade <b>balance,</b> foreign direct investment and higher international reserves hence appreciation of Yuan in china mostly depends on its long term political stability under one party political system rather than pure theoretical determination <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payment.

5|$|At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul {{announced}} his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent). He said {{that each of}} them had pledged to adhere to a policy <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing {{either of the two}} main parties' candidates (McCain– Republican Party, or Obama– Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the “charade” that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process. Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the same again.|$|E
5|$|Some forms <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> {{selection}} do {{not result}} in fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E

5|$|The coin, {{known as}} the Eisenhower dollar, proved unpopular with the public, and {{very few of the}} coins were found in circulation. In 1976, the Research Triangle Institute {{conducted}} a survey of United States coinage. Among other things, they recommended the half dollar, which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, {{and the size of the}} dollar be reduced. Their report read in part: A conveniently-sized dollar coin would significantly broaden the capabilities of consumers for cash transactions, especially with machines. Members of the automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong interest in a smaller dollar, indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use. Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a Republican, was chosen as a means <b>of</b> <b>balancing</b> the half dollar, depicting Democrat John F. Kennedy. In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half dollar production ceased entirely, and the dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design. Treasury officials desired the small dollar coin as a cost-saving measure; Mint Director Stella Hackel estimated that replacing half of the issued dollar bills with small dollars would save $19 million ($ today) in annual production costs.|$|E
