The welding results show that Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) and its variants like Surface Tension Transfer (STT) and modified short circuit are the most preferred processes in the welding of root pass and can be replaced to the Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) in many applications. Furthermore, dual-tandem gas metal arc welding technique is currently considered the most efficient method in the welding of fill pass. Orbital GTAW process mostly is applied for applications ranging from single run welding of thin walled stainless tubes to multi run welding of thick walled pipes. Flux cored arc welding process is faster process with higher deposition rate and recently this process is getting more popular in pipe welding applications.

30|$|Four types welding {{methods are}} {{typically}} used: linear <b>welding,</b> <b>orbital</b> friction <b>welding,</b> circular welding, and rotation welding. These methods differ in velocity and force. In linear and <b>orbital</b> friction <b>welding,</b> the velocity and frictional force is a sinusoidal wave caused by linear oscillatory and elliptical movement, respectively, during welding. For circular and rotation welding, the velocity and frictional force are constant and {{caused by a}} circular and rotation movement [3]. Linear welding and rotation welding have been well studied. Linear welding occurs with high-speed linear motion between the surfaces of two wood blocks. In this method, the welding pressure, amplitude, frequency, holding pressure, and time are the main parameters affecting welding efficiency. In contrast, wood dowel welding with lignin softening and degradation {{is caused by the}} increase in temperature resulting from the friction generated by the high-speed rotation between the wood dowel and the substrate hole [4 – 7].|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{its ability}} to realise high purity results, <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> found {{its place in the}} {{production}} of clean-room components for the semiconductor industry. Its application has now expanded to the construction of pipework and equipment for diverse industries like food processing, pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, automotive engineering, biotechnology, shipbuilding and aerospace. Automated <b>orbital</b> TIG <b>welding</b> is also used in the construction of power stations, (thermal power plants). The construction materials used must be able to withstand the enormous mechanical loads produced by the high pressures and temperatures created by the media carried in the tubes. Notches, pores and inclusions in the weld seams must be avoided at all costs, as these create weak points that can lead to subsequent formation of cracks. These in turn can have serious consequences in terms of component failure. This means that tubes are often made from nickel-based materials with walls up to 200mm thick. One manufacturer has developed an <b>orbital</b> narrow gap <b>welding</b> system with hot-wire feed specifically for this purpose, which uses running gear that moves on a guide ring fixed around the tube. This new variant has created {{a lot of interest in}} the sector, with the worldwide boom in power station construction fueling the never-ending search for increasingly productive manufacturing methods using new types of high-temperature steels.|$|R
50|$|The main {{components}} of every <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> system are the power source and controller, the welding head and, where required, a wire feed mechanism. Welding of certain sizes and material types will also {{require the use}} of a water/coolant system. There are a large number of factors that can have an influence on the welding result. These aspects include the arc length, magnitude and pulse frequency of the welding current, welding speed, inert shielding gas, parent material, filler material, weld preparation, and thermal conductivity. Ultimately, a high quality weld is achieved through detailed knowledge of how to precisely adjust all these parameters for each individual welding task.|$|R

Pharmadule Emtunga is using a modular building concept for building pharmaceutical factories. The modules contain these pipes. The goal of the thesis was to present concepts for technical solutions regarding welding methods and fixtures for the cell. Conceptual models for the cell were made with aid of CAD software. A concept generation/evaluation resulted in the winning concept; <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> using V-stands as fixture method. The main purpose of the fixture is to offer fast and accurate alignment of pipes, with arbitrary lengths and fittings. The fixture was made after a thorough evaluation of data concerning geometries and occurrences of pipes in a typical pharmaceutical factory. A number of efficiency problems concerning welding were identified during the project.

Increase productivity by introducing <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> in the cell. Additional work with efficiency should be performed in connection with the execution of these four steps: • Possibilities of parallel work in the cell should be investigated. • Construction personnel need to work by the “Design for Manufacturing” (DFM) principle. • Single-module production would contribute to steady flow through the cell. • Better drawing data may increase number of welds performed in workshop...|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} {{primarily}} {{motivated by the}} industrial need for control of {{problems associated with the}} Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) of small bore titanium and austenitic stainless steel tubes. These include: pore creation and entrapment in the weld zone, and variability of the fusion zone geometry. The primary aim of this study was the development of a low current <b>orbital</b> plasma <b>welding</b> capability using a structured approach which could lead to defect minimisation. The methodology should also have the potential to be used {{in a number of different}} conditions, extending the use of plasma welding in both melt-in and keyhole modes for the <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> of small bore tubes. The project originally involved the modification of a totally enclosed <b>orbital</b> GTAW <b>welding</b> head for low current welding operations. It was established that for the current range required for small bore and small to medium thickness tubes, the use of a solid copper torch was sufficient to provide the required heat absorption. A stable arc was produced even for very low current values (down to 7 A) while arc voltages were within the operating range of a standard GTA welding power source. Procedural (i. e. off line) control was adopted for identification and optimisation of welding parameters. Since no procedure was available for the proposed welds it was necessary to generate the parameters required for the production of consistent weld profiles. Simultaneously, an expert system has been developed for the determination of optimum process parameters based on empirical models, developed using statistical techniques. Parameter combinations were selected based on physical as well as statistical relevance, providing a measure of confidence when predicting the required weld bead output characteristics. The approach also indicates the influence of the major input parameters on weld bead geometry and defect formation, such as undercut. Two quality acceptance criteria were employed during this investigation, weld bead dimensional accuracy, and the type and seriousness of defects present (penetration / burn-through, porosity and undercut). Off line programming was utilised to control heat build up and to ensure welds were obtained with the desired geometry and minimal defect levels. The end result was the development of a prototype system for low current <b>orbital</b> plasma <b>welding</b> (in both melt-in and keyhole mode) of small bore tubes in a totally enclosed head. Tolerant procedures for low current orbital melt-in and particularly keyhole welding have been generated and a systematic methodology for the prediction and optimisation of welding procedures based on predetermined criteria has been developed...|$|R

Root gap measurement is especially important for success in the automated root pass deposition, with production and quality benefits in different applications, such as pipeline construction for the Oil & Gas industry. The measurement of this feature is sensitive to noises generated by welding and joint surface reflexivity. The image processing algorithms for gap measurement available in literature do not have the desired characteristics of measurement error and flexibility for dimensional variability of welding joints.
