25|$|The {{prototype}} car, SP 618000 {{was turned}} out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine <b>oil</b> <b>baffle</b> to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had filler caps located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.|$|E

50|$|Intake {{manifold}} vacuum {{is applied to}} the crankcase via the PCV valve, drawing fresh air into the crankcase via the breather. The airflow through the crankcase and engine interior sweeps away combustion byproduct gases, including a large amount of water vapour which includes dissolved chemical combustion byproducts. This mixture of air and crankcase gases then exits, often via another simple baffle, screen, or mesh to exclude oil droplets, through the PCV valve and into the intake manifold. On some PCV systems, this <b>oil</b> <b>baffling</b> takes place in a discrete replaceable part called the 'oil separator'.|$|R
50|$|The first {{compression}} ring {{and the oil}} ring are made of steel, the second {{compression ring}} is made of cast iron. Compression rings 1 and 2 prevent exhaust leakage from the combustion chamber while the oil ring works to clear oil off the cylinder walls, preventing excessive oil from entering the combustion chamber. An <b>oil</b> pan <b>baffle</b> is used {{to ensure that there}} is sufficient oil available in the oil pan.|$|R
5000|$|A Twin-turbocharged {{version of}} this engine {{is used in the}} Noble M400, a British sports car. The engine is rebuilt and tuned to a max power of [...] at 6500 rpm, with a torque figure of 390 lbft Nm at 5000 rpm. Noble has used forged pistons, an oil cooler, a larger <b>baffled</b> <b>oil</b> sump and extra cooling ducts to {{maintain}} its durability.|$|R
5000|$|This {{engine is}} adapted for {{transverse}} front-wheel drive applications. According to GM, [...] "The crankshaft is shortened 13 mm - 3 mm at the flywheel end and 10 mm at the accessory drive end - {{to reduce the}} length of the engine compared to the 6.0L. All accessories are driven by a single serpentine belt to save space. The water pump is mounted remotely with an elongated pump manifold that connects it to the coolant passages. Revised <b>oil</b> pan <b>baffles,</b> or windage trays, are incorporated into the LS4 to ensure that the oil sump stays loaded during high-g cornering." [...] Active Fuel Management is also used. Output of this version is /300 hp on LaCrosse Super and [...]|$|R
50|$|Although {{most of the}} Northstar's features, {{including}} the coolant loss system, remained intact, the decreased bore increased weight unacceptably. To reduce it, Oldsmobile used a one-piece glass-filled thermoplastic intake manifold and simplified AC Rochester sequential fuel injection. A new die-cast structural aluminum <b>oil</b> pan incorporated <b>baffling</b> to reduce <b>oil</b> starvation in hard driving. A starter interlock prevented the starter from engaging if the quiet L47 was already running.|$|R
5000|$|The HiPo {{engine was}} used in {{modified}} form by Carroll Shelby for the 1965-1967 Shelby GT350, raising rated power to [...] at 6,000 rpm through use of special exhaust headers, an aluminum intake manifold, and a larger carburetor. The Shelby engine also had a larger <b>oil</b> pan with <b>baffles</b> to reduce <b>oil</b> starvation in hard cornering. Shelby also replaced the internal front press-in oil gallery plugs with a screw-in type plug to reduce chances of failure.|$|R
40|$|An {{unsteady}} solute dispersion {{technique was}} used to characterise dispersion in a baffled flotation column. The practicality of the baffle shapes and spacings was tested using a synthetic ore comprised of uniform glass beads made suitably hydrophobic by treatment with silicone <b>oil.</b> A particular <b>baffle</b> shape (convex underside) produced significant reductions in experimental axial dispersion coefficients averaging 1000 cm 2 /min for superficial gas velocities ranging from 23 to 85 cm/min {{when compared with the}} unbaffled column. Steady-state experiments using a synthetic ore and modelled by a linear capture mechanism produced dispersion coefficients comparable with values obtained by unsteady solute dispersion tests...|$|R
5000|$|For durability, Noble {{also added}} forged pistons, an oil cooler, a larger <b>baffled</b> <b>oil</b> sump, and extra cooling ducts. Its engine has a maximum power of [...] at 6,500 rpm, with a torque figure of [...] at 5,000 rpm. This {{power and a}} light weight allow the M400 to achieve a power-to-weight ratio of just over 400 bhp/ton, the figure {{for which it was}} named, a 0-60 mi/h km/h of 3.2 seconds and a 1/4-mile time of 11.4 @ 119.8 mi/h km/h. [...] Top speed is 187 mi/h km/h. The UK {{automotive}} TV show Vroom Vroom suggested that the M400 gave Ferrari Enzo performance at a Porsche 911 price.|$|R
5000|$|The 301 Turbo {{was unique}} in {{that it had a}} {{stronger}} block with thicker cylinder walls made from reinforced materials compared to the '77-'81 301 naturally aspirated unit, and featured a lower compression ratio (lower compression due to the increased pressure created by the turbo system). Further it had newly developed internals such as forged pistons, a relatively mild camshaft, a high pressure oil pump (60 psi) to ensure adequate oil to the oil-cooled Garrett TBO-305 Turbocharger, a rolled fillet crankshaft with 2 instead of 5 counterbalances, a fully <b>baffled</b> <b>oil</b> pan, and a high pressure fuel pump (10 psi), a unique single plane intake, side and turbo-specific exhaust manifolds, and an Electronic Spark Controller(ESC) using a knock sensor to retard timing when detonation is detected.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{noise source}} {{identification}} remains a current challenge in industry {{to be able}} to act at the origin of noise. Since decades, many identification methods have been developed but most of them are not suitable for industrial applications. In this context, the presented method named Mixed-inverse Patch Transfer Functions (M-iPTF), could be promising as it is able to reconstruct acoustic fields on irregularly shaped sources, only needs pressure measurements and can be performed in a noisy environment. The present paper describes the theoretical background of the M-iPTF method, based on the application of the Green's identity on a virtual cavity surrounding the source, and its application results on a <b>baffled</b> <b>oil</b> pan excited with an electro-dynamic shaker, with and without the presence of a secondary correlated source...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the theoretical {{framework of the}} virtual acoustic volume concept and two related inverse Patch Transfer Functions (iPTF) identification methods (called u-iPTF and m-iPTF depending on the chosen boundary conditions for the virtual volume). They {{are based on the}} application of Green's identity on an arbitrary closed virtual volume defined around the source. The reconstruction of sound source fields combines discrete acoustic measurements performed at accessible positions around the source with the modal behavior of the chosen virtual acoustic volume. The mode shapes of the virtualvolume can be computed by a Finite Element solver to handle the geometrical complexity of the source. As a result, it is possible to identify all the acoustic source fields at the real surface of an irregularly shaped structure and irrespective of its acoustic environment. The m-iPTF method is introduced {{for the first time in}} this paper. Conversely to the alreadypublished u-iPTF method, the m-iPTF method needs only acoustic pressure and avoids particle velocity measurements. This paper is focused on its validation, both with numerical computations and by experiments on a <b>baffled</b> <b>oil</b> pan...|$|R
5000|$|The 301 Turbo {{was unique}} in {{that it had a}} beefier block than the 1977-79 {{versions}} (which carried on in the non turbo versions in 1980 and 1981), a very mild camshaft with [...]350 in lift and 250 degrees gross duration, a 60 psi oil pump to ensure adequate oil to the oil-cooled Garrett TBO-305 Turbocharger, a rolled fillet crankshaft, a fully <b>baffled</b> <b>oil</b> pan, and a specific 800 cfm Quadrajet carburetor. This had extra-rich [...] "DX" [...] secondary metering rods and a remote vacuum source for the primary metering rod enrichment circuit to allow the Power Enrichment Vacuum Regulator (PEVR) to release the primary metering rods to move to the up position (enrichment) anytime during boosted conditions. This was to ensure there was enough fuel to cool the cast offset dished pistons. Boost was wastegate limited to 9 psi (+/- 1 psi). The 301 Turbo package mandated air conditioning, THM350 (sometimes referred to as the CBC350 in various literature) non-lockup automatic transmission (THM350C lockup in 1981 Trans Ams), and 3.08 rear axle gearing.|$|R
5000|$|Replacing the 2.7-litre 'biturbo' V6 {{engine of}} the {{previous}} generation B5 S4, the new B6 S4 powertrain gained an all-aluminium alloy 4.2-litre, 40 valve (five valves per cylinder) V8 engine (parts code prefix: 079.C, identification code: BBK), with chain-driven double overhead camshafts, roller-finger rocker arm cam followers, and included variable inlet camshaft timing. It also utilised a strengthened alloy crankshaft bedplate for the five main bearings, and a two-part <b>baffled</b> <b>oil</b> sump, and a light-alloy variable intake manifold (VIM), containing the fractionally sequentially actuated fuel injectors. This petrol engine, based on the unit from the Audi A8, displaces , and it produces a motive power output of [...] at 7,000 revolutions per minute (rpm), and generates torque of 410 Nm at 3,500 rpm, making it more potent than the RS2 Avant, and nearly as powerful as the B5 RS4. Engine management was {{by way of a}} Bosch Motronic ME 7.1.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), utilising a Bosch 'E-Gas' drive by wire electronic throttle, and powering eight individual spark coils with longlife quad-electrode Bosch spark plugs. Ignition timing is a mapped direct ignition, with cylinder-selective knock control with the aid of four knock sensors. The exhaust system includes vacuum-operated valves in the twin rear silencers (mufflers), finished with chrome plated tail-pipes.|$|R
2500|$|The engine has {{increased}} crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return {{system and a}} <b>baffled</b> <b>oil</b> sump, to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank (so it is 'quad cam') and these are driven by roller chains with variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve low engine speed combustion). On 98RON (93AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces [...] at 7,800rpm giving it a specific power output of [...] per litre. [...] Based on a kerb weight of , {{this results in a}} power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kilogram. This engine also produces [...] of torque at 5,500rpm, 90percent of the total torque being available between 2,250 and 7,600rpm. (Using lower 95RON (91AKI) standard unleaded fuel slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. [...] The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. [...] The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324g/km.|$|R
