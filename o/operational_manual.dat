25|$|Flight 213 was on {{approach}} to Benazir Bhutto International Airport piloted by Captain Noor Afridin and First Officer Javid Malik. Airport AFIS told {{the crew of}} Flight 213 that the weather in the area was thundery with heavy precipitation. The crews acknowledged the report and continued the approach. Flight 213 had only experienced some turbulence while approaching therefore it continued the approach. The Flight crew was still at normal mood condition, as Captain Noor's jokes and laugh were heard in the CVR. But a few minutes later, the flight finally encountered bad weather conditions. The flight crew entered bad weather, but still continued the approach, even though Bhoja Air's <b>operational</b> <b>manual</b> told crews to discontinue approach if bad weather was encountered. They continued the approach until finally they realized that they had entered an active cell. At this time, Captain Noor {{was worried about the}} condition, but continued the approach. Autopilot was later disengaged by flight crews. Islamabad Tower then told Flight 213 to land on Runway 30. The landing checklist was completed and done.

40|$|When {{consumers}} {{are in need}} of help concerning how to use electrical equipment they immediately take a quick look at household product manuals. Generally, household consumer product manuals contain a contents section and there are other sections such as safety rules, technical features, the use of the product, the use of the accessories, maintenance and cleaning. Product manuals are desig-ned for a specific reader with the aim of giving the needed information. Thus, they can be thought as representing a register of their own. In order to understand these registers there are three contextu-al parameters which are field, tenor and mode variables. Field of discourse refers to the subject and focus of interaction. Tenor of discourse marks the relationship between the interactants. Mode of discourse refers to spoken or written interaction. These three contextual parameters are represented through three meanings; ideational, interpersonal and textual. Concerning the linguistic analysis of the study, Halliday’s systemic functional grammar is applied to <b>operational</b> <b>manuals.</b> The linguis-tic analysis concerns 3 meanings: ideational, interpersonal and textual. In terms of ideational mea-ning the linguistic categories used in the analysis can be listed as follows: a) Second Person Prono...|$|R
40|$|In many organisations, {{business}} process (BP) descriptions {{are available in}} the form of written procedures, or <b>operational</b> <b>manuals.</b> These documents are expressed in informal natural language, which is inherently open to different interpretations. Hence, the content of these documents might be incorrectly interpreted by those who have to put the process into practice. It is therefore important to identify language defects in written BP descriptions, to ensure that BPs are properly carried out. Among the potential defects, one of the most relevant for BPs is the absence of clear actors in action-related sentences. Indeed, an unclear actor might lead to a missing responsibility, and, in turn, to activities that are never performed. This paper aims at identifying unclear actors in BP descriptions expressed in natural language. To this end, we define an algorithm named ABIDE, which leverages rule-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We evaluate the algorithm on a manually annotated data-set of 20 real-world BP descriptions (1, 029 sentences). ABIDE achieves a recall of 87 %, and a precision of 56 %. We consider these results promising. Improvements of the algorithm are also discussed in the paper...|$|R
