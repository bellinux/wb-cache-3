5|$|Bird {{collections}} are curated repositories of scientific specimens consisting <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> their parts. They are a research resource for ornithology, the science <b>of</b> <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> for other scientific disciplines in which information about birds is useful. These {{collections are}} archives of avian diversity {{and serve the}} diverse needs of scientific researchers, artists, and educators.|$|E

5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E
5|$|Fish do {{not possess}} {{parathyroid}} glands; several species {{have been found to}} express parathyroid hormone. Developmental genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> mammals. It has been suggested that the tetrapod glands may have been evolutionarily derived from these fish gills.|$|E

40|$|Both {{experiment}} <b>and</b> {{numerical simulation}} <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> impact on aircraft windshield was studied. The {{finite element model}} <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> impact on the windshield was established to predict the damage initiation and propagation of the windshield after bird impact via the nonlinear finite element method, combined with the user-defined materials subroutine (VUMAT) of the ABAQUS/Explicit software. In the model, an elastic-plastic and a nonlinear viscoelasticity constitutive model were adopted to define the material constitutive response <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> windshield, respectively. The shear failure criteria and the tensile failure were selected to identify the damage <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> windshield, respectively. The corresponding elements will be removed when the materials meet the above failure criteria. The supporting structure of the windshield glass was modeled with skins and rubber gaskets herein instead of modeled with the boundary condition directly. The analysis results include the instantaneous deformation <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> <b>and</b> windshield, the damage modes of the windshield, displacement curves and strain curves of the measured points on the windshield, which agree well with the experimental results.

With his new position, Beebe no longer had the duty of caring for the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research. Beebe's duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe's expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> <b>and</b> other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{is mainly}} on the ground, and the bird's diet {{consists}} mainly of seeds. Oily seeds, {{such as those of}} brassicas, are ignored in favour of more starchy items. Typical food plants include common nettle, docks, common knotgrass, fat hen, common chickweed and yarrow. Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, and grain makes up {{a significant part of the}} food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks which can occasionally number hundreds <b>of</b> <b>birds,</b> <b>and</b> often contain other buntings and finches.|$|E
