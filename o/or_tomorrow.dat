500|$|On September 2, 2008, {{a record}} store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic {{nearly two weeks}} before its {{scheduled}} worldwide release date, {{which resulted in the}} album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich [...] responded to the leak by saying, [...] "...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today <b>or</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> happy days. Happy days. Trust me", and, [...] "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} global {{interpretation}} of the council, Luciani wrote: [...] "The physiognomy {{and structure of the}} Catholic Church have been determined once and for all by the Lord and cannot be touched. If anything, superstructures can. Things that have not been determined by Christ, but were introduced by popes or councils or the faithful, can be changed, or eliminated today <b>or</b> <b>tomorrow.</b> Yesterday they might have introduced a certain number of dioceses, a certain way to lead missions, to educate priests, they might have chosen to follow certain cultural trends. Well, this can be changed and one can say [...] "the Church that comes out of the Council is still {{the same as it was}} yesterday, but renewed". No one can ever say [...] "We have a new Church, different from what it was".|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, Halleck telegraphed that if Rosecrans {{was unwilling}} to move, some of his troops {{would be sent to}} Mississippi to {{reinforce}} Grant, who by then was besieging Vicksburg, but was potentially threatened by the army of Joseph E. Johnston in his rear. Rosecrans sent a questionnaire to his corps and division commanders in the hopes of documenting support for his positionthat Bragg had so far detached no significant forces to Johnston in Mississippi, that advancing the Army of the Cumberland would do nothing to prevent any such transfer, and that any immediate advance was not a good idea. Fifteen of the seventeen senior generals supported most of Rosecrans's positions and the counsel against advancing was unanimous. The only dissenter was the newly assigned chief of staff, Brig. Gen. James A. Garfield, who recommended an immediate advance. On June 16, Halleck wired a blunt message: [...] "Is it your intention to make an immediate movement forward? A definite answer, yes or no, is required." [...] Rosecrans responded to this ultimatum: [...] "If immediate means tonight <b>or</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> no. If it means as soon as all things are ready, say five days, yes." [...] Seven days later, early in the morning of June 24, Rosecrans reported that the Army of the Cumberland had begun to move against Bragg.|$|E

"I do {{not know}} whether the plan I have thought of will commend itself to your opinion, sir, but I have worked out a scheme which will, I think, enable us {{to get to the bottom}} of the matter. I believe that a galley is {{expected}} back from a cruise today <b>or</b> <b>tomorrow.</b> Now, sir, my idea is that I should go on board a small craft, under the command of a knight upon whose discretion and silence you can rely, such as, for example, Sir John Boswell, and that we should intercept the galley. Before we board her I should disguise myself as a Turkish slave, and as such Sir John should hand me over to the officer in command of the galley, giving him a letter of private instructions from you as to my disposal. If they have other slaves on board I would ask that I should be kept apart from them, as well as from the rowers of the galley. On being landed I should be sent to the prison where I saw the officer enter last night, and the slaves and rowers should be distributed among the other prisons. Thus, then, the slaves I should be placed with would only know that I had arrived in the galley with other slaves captured by it. I have no doubt I should be able to maintain my assumed character, and should in a short time be taken into the confidence of the others, and should learn what is going on. It would be well, of course, that none of the officials of the prison should be informed as to my true character, for others, besides the one I saw, may have been bribed to participate in whatever plot is going on." ...|$|E
