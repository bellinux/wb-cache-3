40|$|The roller {{swashplate}} {{bearing in}} hydraulic piston pumps is very unique in applications of roller element bearings. The main advantages {{of this type}} of bearings are low friction, very small difference between start torque and steady state torque, and no additional pressure source is required for their functioning. Therefore, better control performance and higher efficiency can be expected from piston pumps with roller swashplate bearings, compared with pumps with hydrostatic or plain ones. However, it is particularly challenging to design a roller swashplate bearing to meet the very demanding and widely varying load requirements for heavy duty <b>off-highway</b> <b>machine</b> operations, considering cost and pump size limitations. Quite different from most other roller bearing applications, a roller swashplate bearing for heavy duty hydraulic piston pumps is subject to (a) extremely high contact pressure between rollers and races due to high system pressure, (b) high frequency oscillating forces in three dimensions caused by the torque ripple and discharge pressure ripple inherent in pump rotating group, (c) very unfavorable local lubrication conditions when the pump is operated with no or little displacement change, and (d) sliding between rollers and races because of frequent sudden pump displacement changes. Based on the observed failure modes of bearings in this application, this paper discusses several measures to improve the fatigue life of the swashplate roller bearing for an axial swashplate type piston pump used in a heavy duty <b>off-highway</b> <b>machine.</b> Analyses, simulation results, and machine operation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed measures. 1...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{demands on}} the world‘s {{resources}} require the design of <b>off-highway</b> <b>machines</b> that provide greater functionality and productivity along with greater efficiency. Model-based or virtual design provides a means for achieving these design improvements with reduced time and costs. However, virtual design is often limited by the fidelity with which human operators are modeled. A greater understanding of how highly skilled operators obtain high machine performance and productivity can inform machine development and advance agricultural and construction machine automation technology. This research investigated how machine operator expertise, strategies, and decision-making can be integrated into operator models that simulate authentic human behavior in construction machine operations. The initial effort of this work {{was to develop a}} virtual operator model (VOM) through a combination of human factors and physical system modeling techniques. Operator interviews were conducted to build a framework of tasks, strategies, and cues commonly used while controlling an excavator through repeated work cycles. A closed loop simulation demonstrated that a VOM could simulate the trenching work cycle and enable closed-loop virtual equipment operation simulation. Advancing {{the state of the art}} in operator modeling requires models that can adapt. Approaches to enable a generic virtual operator model to adapt to changes in the environment based on the operator‘s actions were investigated. The closed loop simulation performed successfully when using the VOM, the vehicle model, and an environment model which represented how the VOM adapted during a complete trenching operation...|$|R

40|$|Although {{micro hybrid}} {{propulsion}} (MHP) systems {{are recognized as}} a feasible solution for <b>off-highway</b> construction <b>machines</b> (OHCMs), {{there is still a}} lack of understanding how existing MHP technologies can be transferred effectively from the automotive sector to the construction sector. To fill this gap, this paper is the first of a two-part study which focuses on micro hybrid construction machines paying attention to a novel idle-stop-start control (ISSC) strategy. Part A presents the system concepts and design procedure while Part B studies on a hardware-in-the-loop test platform for a comprehensive analysis on the potential fuel/emission saving of the proposed system in real-time. In this study—Part A—different types of OHCMs are briefly discussed to identify the target machine. The procedure to model the machine powertrain is also concisely introduced. Next, to minimize the fuel consumption and emissions without degrading the machine performance, a prediction-based idle-stop-start control (PISSC) approach is properly designed. The core of the PISSC is to estimate online the future engine working state changes in order to directly shut down the engine or shift it to low power regions during idle periods. Numerical simulations have been carried out to validate the potential of the proposed PISSC method. ...|$|R
40|$|Micro hybrid {{propulsion}} (MHP) technologies {{have emerged as}} promising solutions for minimisation of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of <b>off-highway</b> construction <b>machines</b> (OHCMs). Their performance and economic feasibility strongly depend on the way they utilize the idle-stop-start control (ISSC) concept. The ISSC design process and performance evaluation are particularly challenging due to the peculiar structures and dynamics of OHCMs compared to other vehicles and, therefore, require significant development time and efforts. This paper is the second of a two-part study focusing on prediction-based idle-start-stop control (PISSC) for micro hybrid OHCMs. In part A, the powertrain model and the procedure to design the PISSC system have been presented. The PISSC-based engine control performance has been investigated through numerical simulations with the designed model. In this Part B, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test platform is established in HIL Control Laboratory for the rapid validation of the proposed technique {{in terms of the}} fuel/pollutant emission saving in real-time.

40|$|The {{off-highway}} {{sector is}} under increasing pressure to reduce operating costs (including fuel costs) {{and to reduce}} emissions. Recognizing this, the Society of Automotive Engineers and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) convened a workshop in April 2001 (ANL 2001) to (1) determine {{the interest of the}} off-highway sector (consisting of agriculture, construction, surface mining, inland marine) in crafting a shared vision of <b>off-highway,</b> heavy <b>machines</b> of the future and (2) identify critical research and development (R&D) needs for minimizing off-highway vehicle emissions while cost-effectively maintaining or enhancing system performance. The workshop also enabled government and industry participants to exchange information. During the workshop, {{it became clear that the}} challenges facing the heavy, surface-based off-highway sector can be addressed in three major machine categories: (1) engine/aftertreatment and fuels/lubes, (2) machine systems, and (3) thermal management. Working groups convened to address these topical areas. The status of off-highway technologies was determined, critical technical barriers to achieving future emission standards were identified, and strategies and technologies for reducing fuel consumption were discussed. Priority areas for R&D were identified. Given the apparent success of the discussions at the workshop, several participants from industry agreed to help in the formation of a joint industry/government ''roadmap'' team. The U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies has an extensive role in researching ways to make heavy-duty trucks and trains more efficient, with respect to both fuel usage and air emissions. The workshop participants felt that a joint industry/government research program that addresses the unique needs of the off-highway sector would complement the current research program for highway vehicles. With industry expertise, in-kind contributions, and federal government funding (coupled with the resources at the DOE's national laboratories), an effective program can be planned and executed. This document outlines potential technology R&D pathways to greatly reduce emissions from the off-highway sector and yet greatly reduce fuel costs cost-effectively and safely. The status of technology, technical targets, barriers, and technical approaches toward R&D are presented. Program schedule and milestones are included...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{the mass}} of the {{manipulated}} load (i. e. payload) in <b>off-highway</b> <b>machines</b> is useful information {{for a variety of reasons}} ranging from knowledge of machine stability to ensuring compliance with transportion regulations. This knowledge is difficult to ascertain however. This dissertation concerns itself with delineating the motivations for, and difficulties in development of a dynamic payload weighing algorithm. The dissertation will describe how the new type of dynamic payload weighing algorithm was developed and progressively overcame some of these difficulties. The payload mass estimate is dependent upon many different variables within the off-highway vehicle. These variables include static variability such as machining tolerances of the revolute joints in the linkage, mass of the linkage members, etc as well as dynamic variability such as whole-machine accelerations, hydraulic cylinder friction, pin joint friction, etc. Some initial effort was undertaken to understand the static variables in this problem first by studying the effects of machining tolerances on the working linkage kinematics in a four-wheel-drive loader. This effort showed that if the linkage members were machined within the tolerances prescribed by the design of the linkage components, the tolerance stack-up of the machining variability had very little impact on overall linkage kinematics. Once some of the static dependent variables were understood in greater detail significant effort was undertaken to understand and compensate for the dynamic dependent variables of the estimation problem. The first algorithm took a simple approach of using the kinematic linkage model coupled with hydraulic cylinder pressure information to calculate a payload estimate directly. This algorithm did not account for many of the aforementioned dynamic variables (joint friction, machine acceleration, etc) but was computationally expedient. This work however produced payload estimates with error far greater than the 1 % full scale value being targeted. Since this initial simplistic effort met with failure, a second algorithm was needed. The second algorithm was developed upon the information known about the limitations of the first algorithm. A suitable method of compensating for the non-linear dependent dynamic variables was needed. To address this dilemma, an artificial neural network approach was taken for the second algorithm. The second algorithm’s construction was to utilise an artificial neural network to capture the kinematic linkage characteristics and all other dynamic dependent variable behaviour and estimate the payload information based upon the linkage position and hydraulic cylinder pressures. This algorithm was trained using emperically collected data and then subjected to actual use in the field. This experiment showed that that the dynamic complexity of the estimation problem was too large for a small (and computationally feasible) artificial neural network to characterize such that the error estimate was less than the 1 % full scale requirement. A third algorithm was required due to the failures of the first two. The third algorithm was constructed to ii take advantage of the kinematic model developed and utilise the artificial neural network’s ability to perform nonlinear mapping. As such, the third algorithm developed uses the kinematic model output as an input to the artificial neural network. This change from the second algorithm keeps the network from having to characterize the linkage kinematics and only forces the network to compensate for the dependent dynamic variables excluded by the kinematic linkage model. This algorithm showed significant improvement over the previous two but still did not meet the required 1 % full scale requirement. The promise shown by this algorithm however was convincing enough that further effort was spent in trying to refine it to improve the accuracy. The fourth algorithm developed proceeded with improving the third algorithm. This was accomplished by adding additional inputs to the artificial neural network that allowed the network to better compensate for the variables present in the problem. This effort produced an algorithm that, when subjected to actual field use, produced results very near the 1 % full scale accuracy requirement. This algorithm could be improved upon slightly with better input data filtering and possibly adding additional network inputs. The final algorithm produced results very near the desired accuracy. This algorithm was also novel in that for this estimation, the artificial neural network was not used soley as the means to characterize the problem for estimation purposes. Instead, much of the responsibility for the mathematical characterization of the problem was placed upon a kinematic linkage model that then fed it’s own payload estimate into the neural network where the estimate was further refined during network training with calibration data and additional inputs. This method of nonlinear state estimation (i. e. utilising a neural network to compensate for nonlinear effects in conjunction with a first principles model) has not been seen previously in the literature...|$|R
