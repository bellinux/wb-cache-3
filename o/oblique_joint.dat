The over-correction, needed to obtain good long-term clinical results, may increase the obliquity even more. To avoid this drawback, the authors suggest use of an accurate and reproducible radiological protocol including at least a standing AP long-leg X-ray to measure not only the hip–knee–ankle (HKA) angle but also the medial distal femoral mechanical angle (MDFMA) and the medial proximal tibial mechanical angle (MPTMA). These measures will guide the surgeon to choose the best indication, including HTO, double level osteotomy (DLO) and distal femoral osteotomy (DFO). Computer-navigation of the osteotomies is the best choice to achieve the preoperative goal.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} several distinct studies {{aimed at}} better understanding fracturing in compressional fault-cored folds. ^ At outcrops of growth strata in the Oliana anticline in the Spanish Pyrenees, {{the relationship of}} two joint sets may reflect changing mechanical properties (i. e. via diagenesis) during the folding process. Using a Schmidt hammer, I assess the rigidity contrast between the individual units and suggest that late-stage, throughgoing joints formed in strata with conditions {{similar to those of}} the present day and that early, bed-contained joints formed when the rigidity contrast between beds was significantly greater than the present day contrast. ^ Modeling algorithms that are used for fracture prediction assume plane strain to construct, model and restore fault-cored folds. Using mechanical models that allow heterogeneous transport in three dimensions, I explore the distribution and magnitude of out-of-plane transport in plunging fault-cored anticlines and provide guidelines of where plane strain should and should not be applied. I show that out-of-plane transport is significant in the simplest non-cylindrical folds, and suggest that complex non-cylindrical structures should not be modeled using plane strain. ^ I mapped five bed-orthogonal fracture sets associated with folding and faulting events at Sant Corneli anticline, a non-cylindrical, fault related anticline in the Spanish Pyrenees. Fold axis perpendicular, calcite healed joint sets associated with similarly oriented normal faulting both pre-date, and are cross cut by calcite healed, N-NW striking joints. Later bed strike <b>oblique</b> <b>joint</b> sets are distinguished by the presence of iron oxide mineralization that probably occurred during Paleocene-Oligocene time. This study directly links fold-related fracturing to fold evolution because fracture sets can be dated relative to the structural evolution of the anticline. ^ I use three-dimensional restorations of Sant Corneli anticline in the Spanish Pyrenees to test the fracture prediction capability of a fully three-dimensional finite element geomechanical restoration algorithm. Reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of the syn-tectonic strata provides a template for incrementally unfolding the anticline. Strains predicted by the restorations are compared to the fracture sets that formed over the corresponding time intervals, which are consistent with the observed fracture patterns at Sant Corneli anticline. ...|$|E

The purpose of this study was to analyze the medium-term results of computer-assisted osteotomy for 29 valgus knees. The hypothesis was that computer navigation would allow a valgus deformity to be corrected with similar precision as varus deformity. Material and methodsThe series consisted of 27 patients (29 knees); there were 7 men and 20 women with ages ranging from 15 to 63 years (mean: 42. 4 ± 14. 3 years). Twenty-four varus osteotomies of the femur (14 medial closing and 10 lateral opening) and five double osteotomies (proximal tibia and distal femur) were performed. The pre-operative functional status was evaluated with the Lysholm-Tegner score. The mean score was 64 ± 20. 5 points (range: 18 – 100). According to Ahlbäck's modified classification for knee osteoarthritis, 12 patients were at stage 1, nine were at stage 2, five at stage 3 and one at stage 4. Two of the knees had no radiological signs of osteoarthritis but had a particularly unsightly deformity; one of these was secondary to high tibial valgus osteotomy. The mean pre-operative hip-knee-angle (HKA) angle was 189. 3 ± 3. 9 °; the mean mechanical medial distal femoral angle (mMDFA) was 97. 2 ± 2. 6 ° and mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA) was 90. 1 ± 2. 8 °. The goal was to achieve an HKA angle of 179 ± 2 ° and mMPTA of 90 ± 2 ° to avoid an <b>oblique</b> <b>joint</b> line. Functional outcomes were evaluated with the Lysholm-Tegner, KOOS and IKS scores. ResultsNo complications other than a transient paralysis of the common fibular nerve were observed. Twenty-three patients (25 knees) were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 50. 9 ± 38. 8 months (range: 6 – 144). The mean Lysholm-Tegner score was 92. 9 ± 4 points (86 – 100), the mean KOOS was 89. 7 ± 9. 3 (range: 68 – 100), the mean IKS “knee” score was 88. 7 ± 11. 4 points (range: 60 – 100) and the “function” score was 90. 6 ± 13. 3 points (range: 55 – 100). Twenty-two patients were satisfied or very satisfied. The mean HKA angle was 180. 1 ± 1. 9 °, the mean mMDFA 90. 7 ± 2. 5 ° and the mean mMPTA 89. 1 ± 1. 9 °. The pre-operative goal was achieved in 86. 2 % of cases (25 / 29) for the HKA angle and 100 % of cases of the mMPTA angle. At the follow-up, none of the knees had been revised with a prosthesis. ConclusionComputer-assisted osteotomy for cases of osteoarthritis secondary to valgus knee leads to excellent medium-term results. Navigation provides reliable and accurate deformity correction.

40|$|Background: Medial {{patellofemoral}} ligament (MPFL) reconstruction {{in adults}} often utilizes screw fixation in the distal femur. The {{aim was to}} define the safety of similar fixation in young patients, {{with respect to their}} open physis. Purpose: To define the age-related relationship between the femoral insertion of the MPFL and the medial aspect of the distal femoral physis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The study investigates whether screw fixation at this point is safe with respect to patient age and screw inclination. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Retrospective review of the MRI scans of 159 skeletally immature patients. The femoral insertion of the MPFL was defined with respect to the distal femoral physis. The predicted paths of 2 -cm screw fixation were simulated both parallel to the joint line and 45 distally oblique; physeal and joint penetration were noted when present. Results are plotted against age and com-pared as quartile ranges. Results: The femoral insertion of the MPFL was found to be distal to the distal femoral physis in all patients by an average of 10 mm (range, 2 - 16 mm). The mean distance increases slightly with age in a nonlinear relationship (r 0. 51, P <. 001) from 9 mm at age 10 years to 12 mm by age 16 years. For the classic, parallel screw, the risk of physeal breach is high for all age groups (mean, 64 %).

40|$|In {{an effort}} to answer some of the {{questions}} left unanswered by the classical theory of disc failure, an experimental study using clinical, radiological, human cadaveric and surgical (experimental) material and methods is made. At the clinical level, a high correlation is obtained between the side of sciatica and side of the oblique posterior intervertebral facet joint as seen on roentgenograms of the lumbosacral spine in patients with back pain. Similarly, a high correlation exists between the side of sciatica, myelographic defect and the <b>oblique</b> posterior intervertebral <b>joint</b> in patients with known symptoms of back pain and sciatica. Using dissected cadaver disc-vertebra units from a random group of patients at autopsy, a lower though still significant positive correlation is obtained between the side of posterior intervertebral joint obliquity and side of annular tear in the disc. Using a calibrated strain gauge apparatus, torsional stress can rupture an intervertebral disc without causing bony fracture and moreover, compression appears to protect the disc in the presence of intact posterior intervertebral joints. Finally, using young white male rabbits, the possibility of creating intervertebral instability with attrition and extrusion of the annulus and nucleus by unilateral facetectomy is demonstrated.

40|$|The Shickshock Group of Cambrian-Ordovician metavolcanic, and {{metasedimentary}} rocks outcropsalong {{mountains of}} the same name bounded to the south by the Shickshock Fault. Within these rocks a schistosity S 1 and layering are parallel, and there is a lineation L 1 marked by a mineral elongation and fine striation. These structures suggest the presence of isoclinal, F 1 folds, and the Shickshock rocks are considered to form the core of a major recumbent F 1 fold. The absence of F 1 structures from Lower Ordovician rocks to the north suggests a pre-Lower Ordovician period of folding. F 2 folds, the dominant structures in the area, deform all Paleozoic rocks older than upper Middle Devonian and form the stratigraphically defined Gaspe Synclinorium, an Acadian structure. On the basis of the inclination and symmetry of the small scale F 2 folds, the Gaspe synclinorium is divided into three major domains. (I) The northern limb of the synclinorium, north of the Shickshock Fault, where folds in Cambrian to Ordovician rocks are overturned northwest; anticlines have short northwest limbs. (II) The northern limb, south of the fault to the axial area of the synclinorium, where folds in SiluroDevonian. rocks are upright; folds are both asymmetric as in domain I and symmetric. (III) The southern limb of the synclinorium where axial planes of folds in Ordovician to Devonian rocks are inclined northwest; anticlines have short southeast limbs. The folds in domains I and II are gradational in inclination and symmetry; but are separated by vertical displacement across the Shickshock Fault. In the study area, the F 2 folds affect the S 1 schistosity and trend northeast, co-axially with F 1 structures. However, to the northeast, near Mount Albert, F 1 and F 2 structures are divergent. The F 2 folds vary in shape with lithology, from open in competent, to isoclinal in incompetent rocks. They are dominantly flattened concentric in competent limestone and sandstone, and similar in style in argillite. The folds are doubiy plunging, and the axes of variable plunge lie on planar axial surfaces. Slickensides on axial-plane calcite veins dominantly plunge down the dip. This is regarded as the movement direction during the F 2 folding. Variation in the amount of movement resulted in the curved fold axes. It is suggested that the folds progressed from an initial concentric mechanism determined, by the competent beds to a flattening and extension along the axial planes determined by flow of the incompetent beds. An S 2 cleavage, a close fracture set parallel to the F 2 axial planes is present in all incompetent rocks except those of the Shickshock Group foliated by S 1. A classification of the cleavage is suggested by means of the ratio of slip across individual fractures and the average fracture spacing. The cleavage is termed fracture if the ratio is less than. 25, and fracture slip if it is. 25 or more. F 3 folds, restricted to the northern coastal sections are mostly S-shaped in plan, and plunge steeply to the southeast. A rough S 3 fracture lies parallel to the steep axial planes striking E-W. The folds may have formed by N-S compression and sinistral shear along the northeast striking F 2 structures. F 4 folds, restricted to the belt of Cambrian Ordovician rocks with S 1 schistosity, are mesoscopic to microscopic, open with sharp rectilinear hinges, and resemble kink bands. The folds trending NW-SE are S and Z shaped and are considered as a conjugate system developed in response to a northeast-southwest compression parallel to the general strike of the country rock. A low plunging fine kink lineation and larger kink bands with low dipping axial planes that deform S 2 occur along the axial area of the synclinorium. The kink bands consistently displace the upper rocks away from-the axis. They are considered as late stage structures. Joint patterns in competent rocks (sandstone, siltstone and limestone) consist of dip, strike, and <b>oblique</b> <b>joints</b> which are normal to bedding. In slates there is a predominance of dip sets accompanied by oblique sets, both of which are steeply inclined. Strike joints in slates are rare and form normal to cleavage. The steep dip joints in slates bear no consistent angular relationship to meso-F 2 fold axes. Thus it is suggested that joint planes-in folded rocks are independent of attitudes of local folds and are post-kinematic in origin...|$|R

The characteristics of the tool-induced extinct-lemur bone alterations (sharp cuts and chop marks near <b>joints,</b> <b>oblique</b> cuts along the shafts, spiral fractures, and percussion striae) suggest skinning, disarticulation, and filleting.

The hypothesis was that the application of a lateral radiograph is insufficient to detect osteophytes that are located in the anteromedial aspect of the ankle <b>joint.</b> <b>Oblique</b> anteromedial impingement (AMI) radiographs were hypothesized to be a relevant adjunct, because of their utility to detect these anteromedially located osteophytes. Methods: Presence or absence of tibial and talar osteophytes on both radiographs was compared with the combined findings of CT, MRI scan, and arthroscopic surgery. Estimates of test characteristics were obtained for 60 consecutive patients with an anterior ankle impingement syndrome. Results: It was shown that the sensitivity of lateral radiographs for detecting anterior tibial and talar osteophytes was 40 % and 32 %, respectively (specificity, 70 % and 82 %). When the lateral radiograph was combined with an oblique AMI radiograph, these figures increased to 85 % and 73 %, respectively (specificity decreased to 45 % and 68 %). This increase was due to the high sensitivity of the oblique AMI radiographs for detecting anteromedial osteophytes (93 % for tibial and 67 % for talar osteophytes). Conclusion: A lateral radiograph is insufficient to detect all anteriorly located osteophytes. An oblique AMI radiograph is a useful adjunct to routine radiographs and is recommended to detect anteromedial tibial and talar osteophyte...|$|R

However, {{most of them are}} 2 -dimensional or are complex procedures that require a longer operation time and a highly trained surgeon. This study aims to introduce a new technique using a condylar repositioning plate and a centric relation splint to achieve a centric relationship. MethodsWe evaluated 387 patients who had undergone surgery for skeletal jaw deformities. During the operation, a centric relation splint, intermediate splint, final centric occlusion splint, and condylar repositioning plate along with an L-type mini-plate for LeFort I osteotomy or a bicortical screw for bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy were utilized for rigid fixation. The evaluation included: a physical examination to detect preoperative and postoperative temporomandibular joint dysfunction, 3 -dimensional computed tomography and <b>oblique</b> transcranial temporomandibular <b>joint</b> radiography to measure 3 -dimensional condylar head movement, and posteroanterior and lateral cephalometric radiography to measure the preoperative and postoperative movement of the bony segment and relapse rate. ResultsA 0. 3 % relapse rate was observed in the coronal plane, and a 2. 8 % relapse rate in the sagittal plane, which is indistinguishable from the dental relapse rate in orthodontic treatment. The condylar repositioning plate could not fully prevent movement of the condylar head, but the relapse rate was minimal, implying that the movement of the condylar head was within tolerable limits.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{cross-sectional}} {{study of the}} Rocky Cape Geanticline, {{one of the major}} tectonic elements of Tasmania. The Rocky Cape Geanticline consists of deformed, unfossiliferous, and dominantly unmetamorphosed sedimentary rock of presumed Proterozoic age. The internal structure is due to the Penguin Orogeny of late Proterozoic age. Two distinct lithological assemblages are recognised, corresponding to different basins of deposition. These basins have a northeast southwest trend, parallel to the axis of the Rocky Cape Geanticline, and flank the older Precambrian nucleus Which lies to the east. To the west of the axis of the geanticline is an unstable shelf sequence about 20, 000 feet thick, consisting of Shale, Oiltstone, orthoquartzite and minor dolomite. This comprises the Rocky Cape Group; a revised definition is given for the Rocky Cape Group, and new names are given to the Constituent formations. First record of sedimentation indicates a starved euxinic environment. This was followed by a stable, Shallowwater, frees-circulating environment in which unusually large thicknesses of cross-bedded orthoquartzite accumulated. Palaeocurrent directions from cross-bedding have diametrically opposed, bimodal or polymodal patterns, which are interpreted as the expression of transverse dispersal currents. These may reflect a gently oscillating palaeoslope. Further to the west the Rocky (Cape Group is overlain, with a low-angle unconformity, by the Smithton Dolomite which has a basal conglomerate. East of the axis of the geanticline, a flysch- type sequence at least 15, 000 feet thick accumulated. This is called the Burnie Formation, and is considered to be younger than the Rocky Cape Group. It consists of slate, quartz wacke and minor pillow lava. Axially directed turbidity currents were an important agent of sedimentation, although, large-scale festoon cross-bedding Indicates that traction movement by bottom currents was significant. These currents are considered to be Independent of the turbidity currents. A variety of sedimentary deformation structures occur. Most are post-depositional, and can be further classified into those due either to-down-Slope mass movement, (block slide, slump sheet, and fluxoturbidite); or to small vertical, horizontal, or toroidal movements, (load cast, psendonddule, diapiric contortion, ball-andpillow structure and convolute lamination). Liquefaction is considered to be an important process In the development of the latter category. The imposed tectonic cleavage is Commonly-controlled by the pre-existing sedimentary deformation, but crosscutting relationships also occur, and assist in the distinction between sedimentary and tectonic Structures. Major tectonic Movements during the Penguin Orogeny were to the southeast, so that the Burnie Formation was squashed between the older basement to the east and the Rocky Cape Group to the west. Albite dolerite (Cooee Dolerite) in the form of dykes, sills and sheets were intruded during the early stages of folding. The two main sedimentary assemblages are now separated by the Keith Metamorphics, a belt about five miles wide, composed of pelitic schist, basic schist and amphibolite. The western boundary is gradational across, strike, and displays cataclastic textures. The Keith Metamorphics was derived in part from the surrounding sediments and partly from basic igneous rock, believed to be equivalent to the Cooee Dolerite. This belt is interpreted as a high-angle Shear zone. Correlation with similar schists along the axis of the Rocky Cape Geanticline indicates that this is a fundamental structure, and it is here termed the Arthur Lineament. The structure in the Rocky Cape Group is simple, consisting of a series of folds trending parallel to the major axis. The folds are tight and asymmetrical near the shear zone, and become more open and symmetrical to the west. This folding affects the Smithton Dolomite. Detailed structural analysis of the Burnie Formation reveals a complex picture of progressive. deformation involving five phases, all on approximately the same axis [...] The first and third generations were the major events in the structural evolution. The major structure consists of two overturned synclines separated by a flat belt and an anticlinal hinge. The overall vergence is to the southeast, toward the older Precambrian nucleus. Mesoscopic folds and associated Structures of one phase tend to form in zones which are spatially segregated from zones of other generations. Thus, the first generation folds are Mostly confined to the overturned limbs of the major synclines, and the third generation folds are confined to the intervening fiat belt. Smaller scale segregation is demonstrated by the occurrence of the later phases in zonee of planar bedding between clusters of. first generation folds. The area of overlap of these zones is generally small, So that examples of refolded structures are not abundant, and a false impression is given of rapid changes in tectonic style of the one fold generation. The segregation of fold phases is most strongly expressed where the bedding remained kinematically active, a feature which suggests that there is a mechanical limitation to Superposed folding. In the first generation mesoscopic folds, the geometry of the arenite beds approximately fits that Of flattened concentric folds. At Sulphur Creek, the mesoscopic folds have a marked asymmetry, shown by common-limb thinning of the fold couplet, a "half-fan" cleavage, and offset carinate structures. These features may be explained by an obliquity between the initial axial plane and the plane of flattening. The flattening stage of fold development was followed by a disharmonic stage involving variable lateral shortening, and the formation of "slip-off" structures, <b>oblique</b> shear <b>joints</b> and boudinage. Cleavage formed continuously throughout the sequence of development of the P 1 minor structures, although the mairpariod of formation was during the flattening stage. The change in behaviour of the arenite beds during folding from initially competent, to incompetent, and back to competent, {{may be due to the}} role of internal pore water during deformation. The evolution of the Rocky Cape Geanticline fits into a pattern of pxoterozoic Lower Palaeozoic orogenesis, in which the axis of sedimentation progressively shifted toward the older nucleus, and the tempo of - sedimentation and structural deformation increased to a climax in the Upper Cambrian...|$|R
