40|$|From the 1680 s onwards, Ferdinando Galli Bibiena (1657 - 1743) {{revolutionized}} {{the art of}} stage design by experimenting with a so-called “manner of seeing scenes from an angle”. The scena per angolo substituted the traditional, single-point perspective with two distance points and worm’s-eye views that rendered architectures in more monumental fashion than ever before. At the same time, the new system’s reliance on backdrops and wings that were placed irregularly, instead of symmetrically, restricted the illusionary compass of perspective to enclosed spaces, rather than ‘infinite’ vistas. It reduced the theater’s <b>optical</b> <b>scope</b> by limiting itself to horizontal slices of earthly reality, devoid of the celestial and infernal. Especially noteworthy {{is the fact that}} vertical descents, especially of dei ex machina, could only be implemented in Bibiena’s schemes at the cost of upsetting vertical proportions. Not that this defect complicated stagings of contemporary Italian opera. Quite the contrary: opera seria’s poetics of verisimilitude chimed perfectly with the phenomenal breadth of two-point perspective. Yet, operatic genres hinging on the marvelous through the deployment of machinery, most notably the tragédie en musique and the various forms of feste, held on to central perspective so as to allow divine descents. Evidence for this intriguing development can be gleaned from a rich array of visual and textual sources...|$|E

50|$|The M4 carbine barrel is 14.5 inches (368 mm) and the XM8 barrel is 12.5 inches (318 mm) but the rifles {{have the}} same overall length.

An electronic round counter was proposed for the XM8. The system would have tracked the number of rounds fired and the date and time of each shot. The data would then be accessed wirelessly by a device like a PDA. Another benefit would be to monitor unauthorized weapon use or corroborate field reports.

ITER is an international collaboration to build a large fusion energy tokamak with a goal of demonstrating net fusion power for pulses much longer than the energy confinement time. At the time of this report, six of the ITER upper ports are planned to each to contain a camera system for recording visible and infrared light, as well as other diagnostics. the performance specifications for the temporal and spatial resolution of this system are shown in the Section II, Functional Specifications. They acknowledge a debt to Y. Corre and co-authors of the CEA Cadarache report ''ITER wide-angle viewing and thermographic and visible system''. Several of the concepts used in this design are derived from that CEA report. The infrared spatial resolution for optics of this design is diffraction-limited {{by the size of the}} entrance aperture, at lower resolution than listed in the ITER diagnostic specifications. The size of the entrance aperture is a trade-off between spatial resolution, optics size in the port, and the location of relay optics.

50|$|The {{reason why}} scopes {{intended}} for short range use are often equipped with parallax compensation {{is that at}} short range (and at high magnification) parallax errors become more noticeable. A typical scope objective has a focal length of 100 mm. An <b>optical</b> ideal 10&times; <b>scope</b> in this example has been perfectly parallax corrected at 1000 m and functions flawlessly at that distance. If the same scope is used at 100 m the target-picture would be projected (1000 m / 100 m) / 100 mm = 0.1 mm behind the reticle plane. At 10&times; magnification the error would be 10 &times; 0.1 mm = 1 mm at the ocular. If the same scope was used at 10 m the target-picture would be (1000 m / 10 m) / 100 mm = 1 mm projected behind the reticle plane. When magnified ten times the error would be 10 mm at the ocular.|$|R
50|$|By 1943, most armies judged {{anti-tank}} rifles to lack combat effectiveness {{due to the}} diminished {{ability to}} penetrate the thicker armor of new tanks -the British Army had abandoned them by 1942 and the Wehrmacht by 1943, while the US Army never adopted the weapon, although the USMC used Boys anti-tank rifles in the Pacific Theater. However, the anti-tank rifle remained in Soviet use during the conflict due to the importance it occupied in its doctrine of anti-tank in-depth defense, first demonstrated during the defense of Moscow and again during the Kursk battles. This became particularly true later in the war when the Red Army assumed an almost constant offensive, and anti-tank in-depth defensive deployments were used for protecting flanks of the operational breakthroughs against German tactical counterattacks. By firing on the lighter armored infantry and support vehicles (e.g. artillery tractors) the anti-tank rifle units helped to separate the supporting infantry (panzergrenadiers) and artillery of the German tanks and so forced the tanks to halt at short distances from the concealed anti-tank guns leaving them exposed to fire from larger, longer ranged anti-tank guns. PTRS-41 semi-automatic anti-tank rifles were also used for sniping since an additional tracer round enabled rapid fire adjustment by the gunner. Although <b>optical</b> sniper <b>scopes</b> were tried with the PTRS-41, the weapons proved too inaccurate at sniping distances (800 m or more), and the recoil too much for effective use of the scopes.|$|R

40|$|The muon {{radiography}} {{is a novel}} {{imaging technique}} to probe the volca- noes interior, using the capability of high energy cosmic ray muons to penetrate large thicknesses of rock. In this way {{it is possible to}} derive a 2 D density map along the muon trajectory of volcanic ediﬁces and deduce information on the variations in the rock density distribution, like those expected from dense lava conduits, or low density magma supply paths. This method is applicable also to study geological objects as glaciers, faults, oil underground reservoirs, engineering constructions, where a density contrast is present. Nuclear emulsions are well suited to be em- ployed in this context for their excellent angular resolution; they are com- pact and robust detectors, able to work in harsh environments without need of power supply. On the other side, a long exposure time is required for a reasonable detector surface (10 m 2) in order to collect a sufﬁcient statistics of muons, and a quasi-real time analysis of the emulsion data is rather difﬁcult due to the scanning time needed by the <b>optical</b> micro- <b>scopes.</b> Such drawback is on the way to be overcome thanks to a recent R&D program on ultra-fast scanning systems. Muon radiography tech- nique, even if limited to the summit part of the volcano ediﬁce, represents an important tool of investigation, at higher spatial resolution, comple- mentary to the conventional geophysics techniques. The ﬁrst successful result in this ﬁeld was obtained by a Japanese group that observed in 2007 the conduit structure of Mt. Asama. Since 2010, other interesting volca- noes have been probed with the same method: Stromboli in 2011, Mt. Teide in 2012 and La Palma in 2014.

40|$|Abstract. The present work {{involves}} {{the development of}} a particle imaging velocimetry system using an <b>optical</b> fiber bundle <b>scope</b> as shown in Figure 1. Applying a fiber scope to PIV system, the resolution of particle images is spatially poorer than those taken directly by a CCD camera, which leads to an inadequate result of cross-correlation between a pair of particle images from the fiber scope. With a conventional cross-correlation PIV, the results processed by images transmitted through a fiber scope show the direction of the vectors along the orientation of fiber elements of bundle scope, because they have a strong correlations in one frame image to the other reference frame image due to the stationary image while the particles show the intermittent images in their trace. A distribution of correlation coefficients used to obtain particle displacements has many random correlation peaks, so it is necessary to reduce background noise from the frame images. In the present study, the pattern of the fiber scope was eliminated by subtracting an initial reference image from the image with particles and using the cross-correlation PIV with a hierarchical interrogation technique could reduce erroneous vectors. Further the more improvement was tried to obtain vectors even in the case of lean particle concentration using particle streak tracking method as shown in Figure 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of neutrino astronomy, {{born with the}} identification of thermonuclear fusion {{in the sun and}} the particle processes controlling the fate of a nearby supernova, is to build instruments which reach throughout and far beyond our Galaxy and make measurements relevant to cosmology, astrophysics, cosmic-ray and particle physics. These telescopes will push astronomy to wavelengths smaller than $ 10 ^{- 14 }$~cm by mapping the sky in high-energy neutrinos instead of high-energy photons to which the Universe is partially opaque. While a variety of collaborations are pioneering complementary methods by building neutrino detectors with effective area in excess of 0. 01 ~km$^ 2 $, we show here that the science dictates 1 ~km$^ 2 $, or a 1 ~km$^ 3 $ instrumented volume, as the natural scale of a high-energy neutrino telescope. The construction of a high-energy neutrino telescope therefore requires a huge volume of very transparent, deeply buried material such as ocean water or ice, which acts as the medium for detecting the particles. We will speculate on its architecture. The field is immersed in technology in the domain of particle physics to which many of its research goals are intellectually connected.

40|$|Combining optics, {{electronics}} and mechanics on one miniature platform is an emerging reality in micro device technology. An important {{goal of this}} is the simplification and enhancement of actions in every-day life, e. g. lab-on-a-chip for full characterization of blood samples with integrated loading, transportation, manipulation and analysis on one chip. Many elements are required for this to work, among them the control and manipulation of light. This thesis presents a study of the use of porous silicon within this <b>scope.</b> <b>Optical</b> filters changing the spectral characteristics of light are fabricated in an electrochemical etching process of silicon in solutions containing hy-drofluoric acid. The aim of this investigation is to fabricate high quality op-tical transmission and reflection filters in the near-infrared making use of the special properties of porous silicon which are hard to achieve in other opti-cal materials, {{and at the same time}} enhance micro-opto-electro-mechanical-system technology in silicon by adding the possibilities presented by porous silicon. Both discrete layer and graded index optical filters (rugate filters), with and without laterally dependent filter functions, are fabricated showing the versatility of this process. However, to obtain high quality optics with porous silicon, a very good control of the etch process is needed. For this reason, equipment has been developed for monitoring the most important etch parameters in situ; depth/time dependent porosity, etch rate, and interface roughness. The technique is based on interference effects in an infrared laser beam partly reflected off the different interfaces in a sample during etching of a porous layer. The information obtained is later used to control the etching of the designed structures. Several device designs and ideas incorporating multilayer or graded index porous silicon are included at the end of the thesis...|$|R
40|$|An {{underlying}} {{premise of}} any segmentation method is that spectral similarity and thematic similarity are synonymous. This assumption {{holds true for}} image objects at an individual tree crown scale {{and they can be}} classified with a degree of accuracy. However, at coarser spatial scales, a large patch of vegetation can encompass a variety of thematic attributes. Mapping native vegetation using remote sensing suffers from an inability to make meaningful predictions through a change in scale. I propose that heterogeneous vegetation needs to be analysed across multiple scales to categorise it as a vegetation community. A multi-scale, object-based, hierarchical approach was introduced to generalise floristic data collected at the plot scale to a vegetation community map using remote sensing. This framework uses the cover and abundance of classified tree crown objects to inform the classification of larger patches of vegetation. Community scale image objects can then be named using the same hierarchical framework used by ecologists in plant ecology. Machine learning classification algorithms and patch scale segmentation algorithms were reviewed and benchmarked for this application. A crown delineation algorithm was formulated as well as a new way to combine lidar with <b>optical</b> imagery. The <b>scope</b> of this thesis was limited to three sensors: the HyMap hyperspectral airborne scanner, small footprint lidar, and the multi-spectral SPOT- 5 satellite. To ensure that the results are relevant, the fieldwork for this thesis was based largely on operational standards. The result was a vegetation map classified on cover and abundance of dominant crown species. The extra resources required for individual tree crown surveys and the difficulty of analysis in highly diverse ecosystems are the main limitations. Vegetation structure was assessed by quantifying forest fuel load using remote sensing. The correlation between field derived attributes and vegetation indices was stronger when narrow band hyperspectral vegetation indices were used. Small footprint lidar successfully penetrated the canopy and offered quantitative information about the structure of the understorey. However, the total fuel load assessed in the field was dominated by leaf litter component in wet forest, which was problematic to quantify with remote sensing...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of optical}} fiber as a {{transmission}} medium for long distance high speed communication has become commonplace throughout the world. This {{has come to}} be almost a necessity as wide area computer networks and the Internet continue to grow in size and <b>scope.</b> <b>Optical</b> fiber has with it an extraordinarily large bandwidth capacity {{that has yet to be}} fully realized by any network protocol. One of the major obstacles to utilizing the terahertzs of bandwidth available in the optical fiber is the lack of electronic devices capable of switching at the extremely high rate of terabits per second. Current state of the art electronics are only capable of switching at rates of tens of gigabits per second. ^ Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) has emerged as one of the most promising optical networking technologies for harnessing the bandwidth available in the optical fiber. By dividing the optical spectrum into multiple operational wavelengths, WDM attempts to multiply the amount of data that can be transferred with today 2 ̆ 7 s electronics. The implementation of WDM brings with it a new set of engineering problems not typically associated with single wavelength optical transmission systems. These problems include the development of rapidly tunable coherent light sources for use as transmitters and equally rapid tunable devices for optical receivers. Moreover, the use of multiple wavelengths for data transmission on the same optical fiber requires the development of wavelength switches capable of handling the enormous amounts of data that multiple optical channel networks experience. ^ Perhaps just as important as the previously mentioned hurdles to realizable high capacity WDM network is a wavelength selection methodology that allows for a more efficient usage of the currently available multiple wavelength technology. The Wavelength Assignment Algorithm presented in this dissertation helps to reduce the number of wavelengths essential to the realization of high capacity WDM networks. Through an intelligent and straightforward process the Wavelength Assignment Algorithm has been shown to reduce the blocking probability associated with a network 2 ̆ 7 s physical topology. By assigning wavelengths based on connection priorities the algorithm has been shown to increase a network 2 ̆ 7 s overall data carrying capacity through a reduction in the number of blocked calls encountered. Via computer simulation, the Wavelength Assignment Algorithm exhibits a significant drop in the number of blocked calls experienced with multiple network topologies by allowing wavelengths to be re-used on other non-related connections pairs. Through the re-use of wavelengths, the Wavelength Assignment Algorithm increases the performance potential of WDM networks with a limited number of operational wavelengths available. ...|$|R
