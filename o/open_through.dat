The talk show, aired on Saturday nights from 11:30 to midnight, often {{featured}} her performing songs with guests, among whom were Goto Maki, Puffy, and Akina Nakamori. To promote the program (and her album Rainbow), Hamasaki opened a restaurant, Rainbow House, on Shōnan Beach on July 1, 2003, which was <b>open</b> <b>through</b> August 31, 2003. After less than two years, the last episode of Ayuready? aired in March 2004.|$|E
5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was not {{prepared}} for such an attack. French soldiers had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been laid out in the <b>open)</b> <b>through</b> bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|The road charged 25 cents ($ {{in modern}} dollars) for saddle horses and twice that for two-axle stagecoaches. The tolls, {{collected}} at three separate gates, primarily reflected {{the cost of}} retaining a large crew of men with snow shovels to keep the road open in wintertime; {{they were able to}} keep the road <b>open</b> <b>through</b> its first five winters. When the snow was too deep, sleighs were used instead. During the summer the stages were able to take the switchbacks at full speed, with dogs running in advance to warn other traffic. A typical voyage over the pass required 10–25 hours and five changes of horses.|$|E

The rehabilitation project, with an estimated cost of $1.2–1.5billion, is being done in phases and spread out over ten contracts, {{the first of which}} began in 2012, and the last, for final painting of the steel structure, planned for completion in 2020. The improvements are expected to extend the life of the bridge until at least 2095.|$|E
5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which <b>open</b> <b>through</b> separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of the}} body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E

25|$|In early June, the Clinic {{announced}} that financial difficulties would force it to close several programs, including the Food Bank and the Clinic’s sites in Virginia and Maryland. Almost immediately, small donors, {{local governments and}} corporate partners offered financial support. The District of Columbia provided a one-time grant of $3.2 million.

As of December 17, 2016, the mall is still empty and no progress had been made in doing anything with it.|$|E
25|$|The Cascade Mountain Range also impedes transportation. Washington {{operates}} and maintains roads over seven major mountain passes and eight minor passes. During winter months {{some of these}} passes are plowed, sanded, and kept safe with avalanche control. Not all stay <b>open</b> <b>through</b> the winter. The North Cascades Highway, State Route 20, closes every year due to snowfall and avalanches {{in the area of}} Washington Pass. The Cayuse and Chinook Passes east of Mount Rainier also close in winter.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Finland had a {{fleet of}} six steam-powered icebreakers to keep trade routes <b>open</b> <b>through</b> the winter months. Following the {{commissioning}} of Jääkarhu in 1926, the Finnish Board of Navigation had planned to replace the smallest vessels of the state-owned fleet, the 1890-built Murtaja and the 1899-built Apu, with a new medium-sized icebreaker. These icebreakers represented {{the first generation of}} icebreaker design in the Baltic Sea and were considered obsolete because they had no bow propeller. However, the plans were shelved due to the recession.|$|E

25|$|Snake venoms {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} of proteins, and {{are stored in}} venom glands {{at the back of}} the head. In all venomous snakes, these glands <b>open</b> <b>through</b> ducts into grooved or hollow teeth in the upper jaw. These proteins can potentially be a mix of neurotoxins (which attack the nervous system), hemotoxins (which attack the circulatory system), cytotoxins, bungarotoxins and many other toxins that affect the body in different ways. Almost all snake venom contains hyaluronidase, an enzyme that ensures rapid diffusion of the venom.|$|E
25|$|With no funding {{available}} to perform needed inspections and repairs, the locks were closed in January 2008. In April 2009, {{as part of}} the federal government's economic stimulus plan, $1.8 million was allocated to repair and inspect the locks, with an additional $900,000 allocated in October 2009 for additional repairs and operational costs. The locks reopened in January 2010 with the Willamette Queen the first vessel to pass. The locks were <b>open</b> <b>through</b> the summer of 2010, and then {{due to a lack of}} federal funding for operations, were not scheduled to reopen for 2011.|$|E
25|$|The HealthCare.gov website was {{launched}} on {{the scheduled date}} of October 1, 2013. Although the government shutdown began on the same day, HealthCare.gov {{was one of the}} federal government websites that remained <b>open</b> <b>through</b> the events. Although it appeared to be up and running normally, visitors quickly encountered numerous types of technical problems, and, by some estimates, only 1% of interested people were able to enroll to the site {{in the first week of}} its operations. Even for those that did manage to enroll, insurance providers later reported some instances of applications submitted through the site with required information missing.|$|E

25|$|When the Soviet forces {{retreated from}} Hanko {{by the end}} of 1941 and the {{fighting}} moved outside the Finnish borders, the icebreaker flotilla was disbanded and Tarmo resumed her normal peacetime duties as an escort icebreaker. During the extremely difficult winter of 1942, Tarmo assisted 177 vessels and sailed , more than any other Finnish icebreaker during the season. After saving the crew and cargo of German steamer Helgoland, which was damaged by ice and later sank, Captain Yrjö Malmi was awarded the Order of the German Eagle by Adolf Hitler. The winters of 1943 and 1944 were easier and several ports were kept <b>open</b> <b>through</b> the winter.|$|E
25|$|The Saint Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway {{make the}} Great Lakes {{accessible}} to ocean-going vessels. However, shifts in shipping to wider ocean-going container ships—which {{do not fit}} through the locks on these routes—have limited container shipping on the lakes. Most Great Lakes trade is of bulk material, and bulk freighters of Seawaymax-size or less can move throughout the entire lakes {{and out to the}} Atlantic. Larger ships are confined to working in the lakes themselves. Only barges can access the Illinois Waterway system providing access to the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River. Despite their vast size, large sections of the Great Lakes freeze over in winter, interrupting most shipping from January to March. Some icebreakers ply the lakes, keeping the shipping lanes <b>open</b> <b>through</b> other periods of ice on the lakes.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, restaurateur Oscar Tucci {{purchased}} {{the ground floor}} and {{the basement of the}} 70,000-square foot building at 56 Beaver Street and reopened Delmonico's as speakeasy. During the 1920s & 30s the upper floors of 56 Beaver Street, were being used as offices for ship insurance, legal offices, and other types of offices. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, Tucci was given the third liquor license in New York, City and quickly renamed the restaurant to Oscar's Delmonico's. By the 1940s Tucci was able to purchase the entire building. Delmonico's in the Tucci era was <b>open</b> <b>through</b> 1986 with its final closure of the Greenwich, Connecticut, location after the death of Oscar Tucci's son Mario Tucci.
