25|$|Carleton University, {{founded in}} 1942, is located south of {{downtown}} on a verdant campus stretched between the Rideau Canal and Rideau River. It is itself {{home to one}} of Canada's premier schools of architecture. The design of Carleton's campus and buildings deliberately rejected monumentalism, focusing instead <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> quadrangle, aiming to present an egalitarian rather than elite sensibility. The University's current building projects include a new River Building adjacent to the Rideau River, which was completed in 2011. The tallest academic building in Ottawa is Carleton's Dunton Tower; completed in 1971, the international style building sits along one side of the quadrangle and is Carleton's most visible architectural landmark.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from his}} clear {{influence}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> art and high culture of Vienna at the time, Makart also influenced {{a range of}} painters and decorators who followed him, including many who rebelled against his style—the most notable being Gustav Klimt, {{who is said to}} have idolized him. Klimt's early style is based in historicism and has clear similarities to Makart's paintings. The entire decorative focus of the Secession, the Austrian Art Nouveau of which Klimt was a part, arose in an environment in which Makart had put the decorative aspects of art in the forefront. Some have also suggested that primacy of sexual symbolism in Art Nouveau artworks were influenced by the sensuality in many of Makart's paintings.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{giving rise}} to modernist reforms, {{up to a certain}} degree the state-sponsored faculties were able to retain their {{independence}} from government control. However, as Pierret has pointed out in detail for Syria, in some countries the orthodox madrasa system remained largely intact, its decentralised organisation protecting it from state control. In fact, the government's attempt at controlling the religious education focussed largely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> institutions and neglected the traditional madrasas. By their continuing ability to provide social support and access to an educational alternative which was propagated as being more orthodox according to Islamic faith, the traditional ulama not only maintained their influence on large parts of the population, but actually increased their political influence and power.|$|E
