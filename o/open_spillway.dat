40|$|Passage of {{upstream}} migrant {{sockeye salmon}} (Oncorhynchus nerka) and chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) through the three pool-and-weir type fish ladders at Rock Island Dam on the Columbia River was controlled {{to a large}} extent by the proportion of the total flow discharged through the turbines and also by the location of the <b>open</b> <b>spillway</b> gates with respect to the ladders. At intermediate river discharges (140, 000 through 300, 000 ft 3 /sec) it was demonstrated conclusively that the fish 2 ̆ 7 s preference for either the right or center ladders could be controlled by spilling adjacent to these ladders. Response to the attraction spill was rapid. Attraction of sockeye was dependent not only upon spill position but also upon the tailwater elevation at the ladder entrance. The statistical analysis of fish behavior in an experimental choice situation is discussed in some detail, particularly the use of Chi-square and analysis of variance methods...|$|E

5000|$|The {{hydroelectric}} {{generating plant}} worked by allowing water {{to enter the}} generating station from an inlet located one mile upstream of Niagara Falls, near Dufferin Islands, and was then brought to the plant through buried conduit pipes and steel penstocks tunneled through the rock. [...] The conduits, two steel and one wooden (bound with iron hoops and encased in cement), ran underground 6,180 feet (1,884 meters) {{to the top of}} the generating station. There, each conduit connected with six penstocks, six feet in diameter. At the point where the conduits and the penstocks join, there was a section which turned upwards into a spillway, called a surge tank. The surge tanks served to reduce fluctuations in heat and pressure during both the increase and decrease of loads. The <b>open</b> <b>spillways</b> sent any excess water to the Niagara River if the load suddenly reduced, which prevented any unwanted rise in pressure.|$|R
50|$|In {{times of}} extreme flooding, the US Army Corps of Engineers may <b>open</b> the Morganza <b>Spillway</b> and other spillways to relieve {{pressure}} on levees and control structures along the Mississippi. On May 13, 2011, {{in the face}} of a rising Mississippi River that threatened to flood New Orleans and other heavily populated parts of Louisiana, the USACE ordered the Morganza <b>Spillway</b> <b>opened</b> for the first time since 1973.

50|$|Late on 26 March, it was {{reported}} that the SDF had taken full control of Tabqa Dam, and that repairs on the dam by Coalition engineers had begun. A day later however SDF announced they were temporarily pausing their offensive for the dam. Later in the day, a spokeswoman of the SDF announced that engineers who had been permitted to check the dam and its operations did not find it was damaged or malfunctioning. SDF also captured 2 villages to the west of Raqqa on the same day. It resumed the offensive against ISIL at the Tabqa Dam on 28 March. Syrian engineers worked on the dam during a pause in the fighting to <b>open</b> <b>spillways</b> and ease the pressure on the dam. Its southern reaches were reported to be under ISIL control. ISIL claimed that the maintenance team was killed in airstrikes by the anti-ISIL coalition while the SOHR stated that it had learned that the engineer administering the dam had been killed in airstrikes along with a technician. It also stated that the group had sent 900 fighters from Raqqa to fight against the SDF advance.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1986, nearly 500,000 people {{faced the}} {{possibility}} of flooding when engineers at Folsom Dam were forced to <b>open</b> the <b>spillway</b> gates after heavy rains. The flooding was made worse {{by the failure of}} the Auburn Dam cofferdam upstream which released an extra [...] into the American River. A peak flow of [...] entered Folsom Lake, forcing operators at Folsom Dam to <b>open</b> all the <b>spillway</b> gates, releasing [...] into the American River. This was [...] above the safe capacity of downstream levees. Although the dam and the Sacramento levee system held without major damages, the requisite winter flood control space was increased 50%, from 400,000 to 600,000 acre feet, to protect against future floods. In addition, about [...] of sediment carried down from the mountains was deposited in Folsom Lake, considerably reducing its capacity. The consequence was a reduced capacity to store winter rainfall for summer use. Folsom Dam may have prevented as much as $4.7 billion in damages in 1986 alone.|$|R
50|$|Near the dam on the {{southeast}} {{side of the}} reservoir is an <b>open</b> bell-mouth <b>spillway,</b> 72 ft in diameter, which {{is known as the}} Glory Hole. The pipe has a straight drop of 200 ft, and the diameter shrinks down to about 28 ft. The spillway has a maximum capacity of 48,000 cfs (1360 m³/s). The spillway operates when there is excess water in the reservoir; in 2017 after heavy rains it started flowing, {{for the first time since}} 2006. In 1997 a woman was killed after being pulled inside the spillway.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after {{becoming}} operational, Dayton Hollow Dam narrowly avoided destruction. The city-owned Fergus Falls City Light Station, several miles upstream, abruptly {{failed in the}} early hours of September 24, 1909. Three other dams between the disaster site and Dayton Hollow were swept away and a fourth (Central / Wright) was badly damaged. Otter Tail Power Company president Vernon Wright received enough advance warning to reach his dam by 6:15AM and <b>open</b> the <b>spillway.</b> The only flood recorded in the history of the river was due to this disaster.|$|R
5000|$|In March-April 2008, {{officials}} considered {{but declined}} to <b>open</b> the <b>spillway</b> gates. [...] While the spillway gates remained closed then, flooding still occurred in part of the Morganza floodway when the Mississippi River crested higher than levees near the spillway. Local residents and National Guard troops attempted to add height to the permanent levee by building a supplemental sandbag levee on top of it. However, additional rainfall raised the flood crest higher than even the supplemental sandbags, sending floodwaters over these levees into 3000 acres of cropland located within the floodway.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} time in the dam's history, the Army Corps of Engineers <b>opened</b> the dam's <b>spillways</b> on the morning of June 3, 2011.

25|$|In 1967, heavy {{snowmelt}} in the Bighorn River basin {{caused the}} reservoir {{to rise to}} record levels. Reclamation <b>opened</b> the <b>spillway</b> of the dam for twenty consecutive days in June and July of that year. However, {{the design of the}} spillway tunnel was flawed, causing severe cavitation of the concrete, leading to the formation of a hole the size of an eighteen-wheeler in the concrete lining. The resulting repairs and retrofits to the spillway were the vital predecessor to the repair work to dams such as Hoover, Glen Canyon and Flaming Gorge that would follow severe floods in 1983 in the Colorado River basin.|$|R
50|$|As a UN {{observer}} he {{prevented a}} disaster at the Peruća hydroelectric dam in 1993 during the Croatian War of Independence. The Serbian military raised {{the level of}} the lake and placed 30 tons of explosives within the dam in their preparations for withdrawal; detonating the explosives was intended to destroy the dam, which would have released a huge surge of water which would have killed or made homeless 20,000 people. Gray, on his own initiative and exceeding his authority, <b>opened</b> the <b>spillway</b> gate and reduced the level of water in the lake by several metres; when the explosives were detonated the dam did not fail.|$|R
50|$|The town's dam {{continues}} to experience huge {{pressure from the}} rain and the operator Hank (Wayne Duvall) is forced to <b>open</b> another <b>spillway</b> floodgate. This causes another huge burst of water to stream through the town, resulting in even worse flooding, especially at the church. Tom wakes in his cell, trapped as the Sheriff's building slowly fills up with water.

5000|$|... the US Army Corps of Engineers {{believes}} that if the Morganza <b>Spillway</b> is not <b>opened</b> to funnel [...] {{of water from the}} Mississippi River into the Atchafalaya River basin, that water which would be diverted by opening the spillway could potentially cause levees to fail along the river from Morganza to Plaquemines Parish, including all of the New Orleans area, resulting in as much as 25 ft of floodwater. [...] <b>Opening</b> the Morganza <b>Spillway</b> to this extent would only use 50% of the spillway's designed flow capacity.|$|R
25|$|The {{structure}} has eight overflow gates which channel water into four spillways. The spillways incorporate side piers on the upstream face to more correctly channel {{water over the}} dam so that each spillway discharges {{the same amount of}} water. The spillways release their water slightly above the actual bed of the river, creating a waterfall effect when they are fully <b>open.</b> A <b>spillway</b> tunnel carved from granite in the right bank of the river augments the spillways and provides for additional overflow. The total spillway capacity is half that of Grand Coulee Dam in the United States. The Export-Import Bank of the United States provided $8.9 million (about $67.2 million in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) in credits in 1958 to Iberduero to enable it to purchase six 120 Megawatt (MW) turbines and other electrical equipment for the power generating station, all of which were supplied by American firms.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, University of British Columbia {{professor}} Charles Edward Borden shifted his attention toward urgent salvage archaeology in Nechako Canyon after {{learning of the}} planned Kemano reservoir that would flood the canyon, {{a large part of}} Dakelh hunting territory in Tweedsmuir Park. In 1951, he received funding from Alcan and the British Columbia Ministry of Education to undertake salvage archaeology at the [...] "Carrier Indian site". In 1951, Borden and his protégé, anthropology student Wilson Duff, located over 130 sites of importance to Cheslatta T'en history. They conducted more intensive investigations prior to the flooding of the area. The damming triggered [...] "devastating changes for First Nations communities whose traditional territories lay in their path, including the destruction of Aboriginal gravesites, territories, livelihoods, and archaeological sites."

5000|$|The main {{spillway}} has five crest gates: A central drum gate with a 27 m clear span {{with a pair}} of radial gates on each side. Each radial gate has a 12 m clear span. The drum gate is hinged along the upstream edge to the upstream crest and lowers into the dam wall to allow water to flow over it. When fully open, it forms a continuation of the crest profile. [...] All gates open automatically as the dam passes full water level, or can be manually <b>opened.</b> The auxiliary <b>spillway</b> is normally closed by a series of fuse plugs that are designed to be washed away {{in the event of an}} extreme flood event.|$|R
50|$|Because the Morganza Spillway is {{slightly}} higher and well {{back from the}} river, it is normally dry on both sides. Even if it failed at the crest during a severe flood, the flood waters would have to erode to normal water levels before the Mississippi could permanently jump channel at this location. During the 2011 floods, the Corps of Engineers <b>opened</b> the Morganza <b>Spillway</b> to 1/4 of its capacity to allow 150,000 ft3/sec of water to flood the Morganza and Atchafalaya floodways and continue directly to the Gulf of Mexico, bypassing Baton Rouge and New Orleans. In addition to reducing the Mississippi River crest downstream, this diversion reduced {{the chances of a}} channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system.|$|R
50|$|At 8 A.M. on Thursday {{morning of}} October 19th 1950, 9 men plunged {{to their deaths}} after a {{platform}} collapsed unexpectedly. The men were pulled into the spillway.

Mr. Frank Lloyd Barton's body was found {{a mile down the}} river from the dam. The other 8 men were Frederick Rule, Frederick Basham, James Chant, James Fillery, Robert Elliott, Reginald Lippiatt, Peter Steinmanis, and Eugene Podusteanu. There was a 10th man, Bruce Grieves, working as well but he survived the accident because he had one leg off the platform and managed to pull back when the platform gave way.|$|R
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is a {{physical}} model of air slot ramp aerators designed to eliminate cavitation in <b>open</b> channel <b>spillway</b> chute flows. The experimental work {{involves the use of}} a Laser system to measure the turbulent low structure on a spillway, ramp and jet system, and then to relate the turbulent flow structure to the rate of air entrainment in the aerator. Even though aerator model studies have been carried out for decades, this appears to be the first time that turbulence has been measured in detail, having regard both to the ability of a ramp to generate turbulence and also to the decay of turbulence in the aerator jet downstream of the ramp. An expression is found for air entrainment in the models tested at Glasgow University. It is also valid for a range of previous prototype measurements, and is valid for a range of other previous model studies. The results are also translated into a computer program for designing such structures. The model used was a rectangular cross-section perspex flume, sloping at 45 degrees, incorporating a range of ramps at different angles. A range of flow depths, flow velocities, and boundary roughness values were tested and the measurements were taken by a Laser Doppler Anemometer. The results of this work provide a clearer understanding of the physical processes which occur in aerator ramp. This includes a clear demonstration of the ability of the ramp to generate additional turbulence in the flow, increasing turbulence values by about 30 % above normal boundary layer values...|$|R
5000|$|Croatian {{forces and}} other {{officials}} involved with the Medak Pocket Mission lost confidence in the UN's ability due to failed attacks on forces in the zone of separation between Krajinan Serb forces. Earlier that year Croatian troops had launched an attack in order to seize a Peruća Lake power dam and reservoir. The dam was gravely damaged on 28 January 1993, {{in the aftermath of}} Operation Maslenica, at 10:48 a.m., when it was blown up in an intentional effort to destroy it by RSK forces. 30 t of explosive was used, causing heavy damage, but ultimately the effort to demolish the dam failed. The Croatian communities in the Cetina valley were nevertheless in great danger of being flooded by the lake water. The actions of Major Mark Nicholas Gray of the Royal Marines, deployed with UNPROFOR, prevented total collapse of the dam as he had <b>opened</b> the <b>spillway</b> channel before the explosion and reduced the water level in the lake by 4 m. Subsequently, the Croatian forces intervened and captured the dam and the surrounding area. UN forces stationed in the area quickly fled before the attacking Croats, confirming Croat beliefs that a show of force would scare away the UN soldiers. Consequently, the UN needed muscle in Sector South to rebuild its credibility {{in the eyes of many}} across the globe. With their 'tough but fair' reputation, 2PPCLI was sent from North near Zagreb to Krajinan region in Southern Croatia, near the Dalmatian Coast territory. According to Canadian version of following events, Croatian forces, under the pretext of not receiving authorization from Zagreb, decided to attack the Canadian forces who were moving in between the Serb and Croat forces. Private Scott LeBlanc who was present in the UN forces recalls, [...] "We started taking fire almost immediately from the Croats". When the Canadians began constructing a fortified position, the Croatians fired hundreds of artillery shells at them. The Canadians successfully used breaks in the shelling to repair and reinforce their positions.|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} mixed integer linear {{programming}} (MILP) model {{to optimize the}} spillways scheduling for reservoir flood control. Unlike the conventional reservoir operation model, the proposed MILP model specifies the spillways status (including the number of <b>spillways</b> to be <b>open</b> {{and the degree of}} the <b>spillway</b> <b>opened)</b> instead of reservoir release, since the release is actually controlled by using the spillway. The piecewise linear approximation is used to formulate the relationship between the reservoir storage and water release for a spillway, which should be open/closed with a status depicted by a binary variable. The control order and symmetry rules of spillways are described and incorporated into the constraints for meeting the practical demand. Thus, a MILP model is set up to minimize the maximum reservoir storage. The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) and IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio (CPLEX) software are used to find the optimal solution for the proposed MILP model. The China’s Three Gorges Reservoir, whose spillways are of five types with the total number of 80, is selected as the case study. It is shown that the proposed model decreases the flood risk compared with the conventional operation and makes the operation more practical by specifying the spillways status directly...|$|R
5000|$|Subsequently, {{inspection}} {{crews were}} lowered down the spillway tunnels {{in a small}} cart to assess damage. What they found was that at tunnel bends, {{the force of the}} water, by means of cavitation, had damaged and eroded the lining of the tunnel, which was 3 ft-thick concrete. At some places the erosion had completely worn away the lining, exposing the soft sandstone underneath; this was the source of much of the debris. The tunnels could not be closed for long, however: the National Weather Service was reporting more rainstorms in the Colorado River Basin, and the reservoir continued to rise. Reclamation <b>opened</b> the left <b>spillway</b> to [...] per second; the right, which had suffered worse damage, was carrying [...] per second. As the water level increased, wooden flashboards were installed on top of the spillway gates; this allowed reservoir water to rise 4 ft while not increasing releases. The left tunnel, however, was suffering damage unknown until it began to show itself as a [...] "surging, boiling flow that filled the portal". The tunnel was now forming a hydraulic jump as it was turned into a [...] "pressure conduit" [...] by the surging flow of water, and as erosion threatened to collapse the tunnel, Reclamation had to open the gates further. The extra water would help to support the tunnel, but it would increase damage to the tunnel walls. Eventually, Reclamation attached even more boards to the spillway gates, allowing the reservoir to rise a further 8 ft without increasing releases.|$|R
