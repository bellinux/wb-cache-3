5|$|Cage diving is {{most common}} at sites where great whites are {{frequent}} including {{the coast of}} South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at {{the focus of a}} booming tourist industry. A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.|$|E

25|$|Of course, it is {{possible}} to code more than two symbols in any given medium. For example, one might use respectively 0, 1, 2, and 3 volts to code a four-symbol alphabet <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire,</b> or holes of different sizes in a punched card. In practice, the tight constraints of high speed, small size, and low power combine to make noise a major factor. This makes it hard to distinguish between symbols when there are several possible symbols that could occur at a single site. Rather than attempting to distinguish between four voltages on one wire, digital designers have settled on two voltages per wire, high and low.|$|E
25|$|A {{special case}} nest {{observed}} in Mt. Hakken-zan {{in the summer}} months of 1968 showed two queens sharing one nest. This nest was unsuccessful, as predicted. It is unclear if the nest was an instance of temporary pleometrosis, where two queens cooperate {{in the initial stages}} of nest building, and then one leaves. On the other hand, a multi-comb nest was found with one queen in Tokyo in 1980. The nest sat <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> fence, and the two petioles were merely 13mm apart. This nest was founded by a worker, in contrast with the well known fact that P. snelleni nests are founded by a single queen. The worker reared brood in both combs at the same time. Early emerging males were often spotted around this special nest, so it has been assumed that the worker who created the nest copulated with at least one early emerging male.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} first {{successful}} telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of submarine communications cables was first mooted. One of the primary technical challenges was to insulate the submarine cable sufficiently to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon William Montgomerie introduced Gutta-percha, the adhesive juice of the Palaquium gutta tree, to Europe. Michael Faraday and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested {{that it should be}} employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from Dover to Calais. It was tried <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> laid across the Rhine between Deutz and Cologne. In 1849, C.V. Walker, electrician to the South Eastern Railway, submerged a two-mile wire coated with gutta-percha off the coast from Folkestone, which was tested successfully.|$|E
25|$|The trapper who has {{located a}} cricket must catch and contain the insect without causing it any injuries. Present-day trappers use zhao, a soft {{catching}} net <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> frame, {{to contain the}} cricket on the ground. The captured crickets are then placed into a clay pot and stay there until being sold; they are fed a few boiled rice grains per day. Earlier, the Chinese used cage-like traps made of bamboo or ivory rods. Pavel Piassetsky, who visited Beijing in the 1880s, described a different technique. The Beijing people used two kind of tools: a bell-like bowl {{with a hole in}} its bottom, and a tube several inches long. When a cricket was forced to leave its hideout, the trapper would quickly cover it with the bell. When the trapped cricket emerged from the hole, the trapper would present the tube, and the cricket would eagerly hide inside it. The plugged tube then became a convenient cricket cage.|$|E
500|$|In March 2004, {{the band}} {{released}} their fourth studio album Guilt Show, produced by Ed Rose. Sonically, the album combined the more measured, sophisticated sound of <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wire</b> with the frenetic style of their earlier work. Guilt Show, which was titled after a misreading of a flier saying [...] "Quilt show", {{was very well}} received both critically and commercially. The more pop-driven tone of the album reunited the band with many fans who were disenchanted after <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wire,</b> while also staying {{close enough to the}} evolution of the last album to interest newer fans and critics. However, their return was overshadowed by the booming popularity of other contemporary emo bands such as Dashboard Confessional, who invited the band to open for them on the 2004 Honda Civic Tour.|$|E

500|$|After {{three years}} of touring for Something to Write Home About, the band was {{beginning}} to feel burned-out, and wished to depart from the upbeat power-pop sound with which they had become associated. They also wanted to find a new producer to challenge them creatively, approaching Nigel Godrich and Gil Norton with offers, although both declined. Finally, the band settled on Scott Litt, best known for his work with R.E.M. and Nirvana. The band's third studio album, <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wire</b> was released on May 14, 2002, debuting a more measured, alternative style. Just as Something to Write Home About alienated some fans with its more produced sound, <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wire</b> was criticized by fans who were disappointed with the album's softer musical direction. Specifically, the reviewer for Alternative Press wrote [...] "Unfortunately, the visceral energy of their early days is lost in their newfound maturity." ...|$|E
500|$|The Get Up Kids {{were viewed}} {{throughout}} their existence as a prototypical emo band, having been {{major players in}} the Midwest emo movement of the mid-1990s. Their second album Something to Write Home About remains their most widely acclaimed album, and is considered {{to be one of the}} quintessential albums of the second-wave emo movement. However, like many early emo bands, The Get Up Kids sought to dissociate themselves with the term, as it was considered dismissive to be seen as an [...] "emo band." [...] The band departed heavily from their established style with the release of their 2002 album <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wire,</b> which saw the band take on a much more layered, alternative rock sound. Years later, guitarist Jim Suptic even apologized for having the influence they did on many of the modern third-wave emo bands, commenting that [...] "he punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like glam rock now ... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologize." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{many fans}} were upset with this sudden change of direction, {{the album was}} {{generally}} well received by mainstream publications. Entertainment Weekly was highly positive, writing that [...] "This is the group at their best." [...] In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote [...] "On a Wire quivers with the anxieties that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them. Straining vocals, racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing, spacious guitars and prominent keyboards [...] [...] [...] The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves. What they find is often subtle, less visceral but far more tender." [...] The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band's popularity as a whole. The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released, {{only to find that}} they had far less support from both their fans and their record label. Using the financial and critical success of Something to Write Home About, Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as Alkaline Trio, Dashboard Confessional, and Saves the Day. The Get Up Kids were no longer the label's top priority, and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wire.</b> In an interview with Alternative Press, lead singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wire</b> seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since Something to Write Home About, allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that The Get Up Kids had previously earned. In an interview, Pryor confessed that he did not think that [...] "anyone, including Vagrant, gave that record a chance". Even though they had avoided the term since its inception, it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term [...] "emo", a word that had defined them for years but had come to be associated with more pop-oriented acts. Pryor commented on the album, saying [...] "We really didn't give two shits if anyone liked the record or not, we were really confident {{that we were going to}} kill this 'emo' stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} much less {{politically}} focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor. Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for [...] "a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics". The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged {{by some of the}} show's cast. Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, [...] "You wanted to take your soul off, put it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> hanger, and leave it in the closet before you got on the plane to do one of these pieces."

500|$|Jeremy Renner, {{who played}} the film's adult Hansel, has stated that his initial {{attraction}} came from a one sheet he was given even before seeing the script, showing Hansel and Gretel walking away and a witch burning at {{a stake in the}} background, which he found [...] "incredibly interesting" [...] (this scene was included in the finished film). He added, [...] "When I read the script, my first thought was, 'I can’t believe this hasn’t been done yet.' It’s such a great idea with so much potential. That dynamic was definitely a big thing, I loved that what Tommy [...] wrote left so much room for character." [...] Wirkola said he wanted Renner in the role after seeing him in The Hurt Locker. Wirkola, who described Hansel as the [...] "loose cannon" [...] of the duo, gave him an additional character flaw of diabetes, in addition to the psychological scars that Hansel shares with his sister (in the original idea for the short film, Gretel was also suffering from eating disorder). Renner said it was a great escape for him [...] "as this was a fairytale with no stress like the other action movies I'd done recently. I was having so much fun hanging <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> like Peter Pan, hanging onto a broom and doing other crazy stuff."

The singer was dressed in a one-piece outfit in matador red, surrounded by male dancers as Minotaurs similar to the song's music video. It was developed by designer Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy and styled by Akerlund. The performance was described as a [...] "beautiful story for why the matadors fight the bulls and that also reflects life". After being introduced by singers Miley Cyrus and Nicki Minaj, the performance began with images of Madonna on a kabuki screen talking about starting a revolution. She emerged from the screen and started singing, surrounded by the dancers. Near the end, the singer encouraged the audience to sing-along with her, finally being pulled atop the stage <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire.</b> Dina Gachman from Forbes reported that Madonna's performance was the most-watched moment of the night. Brittany Spanos from Rolling Stone described it as [...] "the legendary singer was out for blood with her first live performance [...] ". Shauna Murphy from MTV News observed Illuminati symbolism with the performance, including rituals, organized religion homage and a metaphor for death. MuuMuse's Bradley Stern listed it as the best performance of the Grammys, saying that [...] "this is how a major pop performance should really look". Her effort to sing live without Auto-Tune during the choreographed performance was also heavily praised.|$|E
