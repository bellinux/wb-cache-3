25|$|The city elected {{its first}} {{municipal}} legislators (called trustees) in 1808. Steamboats {{first arrived in}} St. Louis in 1818, improving connections with New Orleans and eastern markets. Missouri was admitted as a state in 1821. St. Louis was incorporated as a city in 1822, and continued to develop largely due to its busy port and trade connections. Slaves worked in many jobs on the waterfront {{as well as on}} the riverboats. Given the city's location close to the free state of Illinois and others, some slaves escaped to freedom. Others, especially women with children, sued in court in freedom suits, and several prominent local attorneys aided slaves in these suits. About half the slaves achieved freedom in hundreds <b>of</b> <b>suits</b> before the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Dry {{suits are}} used for windsurfing, kitesurfing, kayaking, water skiing and other surface water sports where the user is {{frequently}} immersed in cold water. These suits are often made from very lightweight material for high flexibility. Membrane type suits are commonly used {{in the spring and}} autumn with moderate water temperatures, but Neoprene and hybrid dry suits for surface sports are preferred in cold water. These provide greater thermal protection {{in the event of a}} leak. The ability to swim for self-rescue in these types <b>of</b> <b>suits</b> is important to water sports users that do not use a boat. A neoprene bottom also is less likely to allow trapped air to collect in the legs, causing the wearer to tend to float head down in the water.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton's Coppley Apparel Group {{is doing}} {{something}} rare in the Canadian clothing industry - adding jobs. The company plans to expand its employment by almost 200 jobs - about 30 per cent - starting with 50 additional jobs this year in 2007. Coppley's growth burst will bring its workforce to about 750 people, {{the majority of them}} in Hamilton. The new jobs follow exploding sales growth as the company uses computer-aided custom tailoring <b>of</b> <b>suits</b> that give struggling retailers a much-needed cash-flow boost. Coppley, which has been a fixture in downtown Hamilton for more than 150 years, pioneered a method of using a computer, a grid and a digital camera to do the work of a master tailor, producing made-to-measure suits in as few as seven days - work that used to take six weeks.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert {{to produce}} {{artificial}} silk. They {{succeeded in making}} a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name Azlon. It was usable in the making <b>of</b> <b>suits,</b> felt hats, and overcoats. Though pilot production of Azlon reached 5000pounds per day in 1940, it never reached the commercial market; Dupont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce artificial silk. In 1932–33, the Ford Motor Company spent approximately $1,250,000 on soybean research. By 1935, every Ford car had soy involved in its manufacture. For example, soybean oil was used to paint the automobiles, as well as fluid for shock absorbers. Ford's involvement with the soybean opened many doors for agriculture and industry to be linked more strongly than ever before.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the 1904 World’s Fair (also {{known as}} the Louisiana Purchase Exposition) had an exhibit of Filipinos dressed as the Igorot tribe. This led to the mistaken {{portrayal}} of Filipinos as solely representative of the Igorot people. Filpino students looked to dispel the stereotypes of the Igorot tribe by dressing in American style clothing. Throughout {{the course of the}} week, Filipina women were allowed to either dress in American clothes or Filipino clothes. Filipina students often alternated between the two styles of dress. For the purposes of work and study, Filipina students decided to wear American clothing. On other occasions such as special events, Filipina students opted for traditional Filipino clothing. Garments such as the terno were often worn for such special events. The wearing of the terno was interpreted as a patriotic thing to do, showing pride in Filipino culture. For male pensionados, their styles of clothing differed from the “Manong” generation. Instead of wearing suits, male Filipino students opted to wear hats instead <b>of</b> <b>suits</b> and ties. The main reason for this occurrence was because male Filipino students wanted to differ themselves from the negative stereotypes surrounding individuals belonging to the Manong generation. For some male Filipino students, more money was spent on clothing and material possessions than their education and food.|$|E

Instead, a new edit was produced which contained shots of the band in both suits and dresses. The original edit of the video never aired.

500|$|Lody {{was also}} the subject of {{literary}} and stage works; a hagiographic biographical account, Lody – Ein Weg um Ehre (Lody – One Way to Honour), was published by Hans Fuchs in 1936 and a play called Lody: vom Leben und Sterben eines deutschen Offiziers (Lody: {{the life and death}} of a German officer), by Walter Heuer, premiered on Germany's National Heroes' Day in 1937. It depicts Lody as brave and patriotic but clumsy, leaving a trail of clues behind him as he travels in the UK: wearing clothes marked [...] "Made in Germany", writing naval secrets on the back of a bus ticket which he loses and a Scotland Yard detective finds, coming to attention when an orchestra in London plays the German naval anthem, arousing suspicion when he calls for German wine while writing secret reports to Berlin, and leaving incriminating letters in the pockets <b>of</b> <b>suits</b> which he sends to be pressed. Lody is arrested in London and sentenced to death. Offered a chance to escape, he refuses and drinks a glass of wine with the firing squad, toasting Anglo-German friendship. He is led out to his execution, saying his final words: [...] "I shall see Germany once more –from the stars." [...] The Dundee Evening Telegraph described the storyline as [...] "quaint".|$|E
500|$|Shaw {{asserted}} that the new gameplay mechanics reinvigorated the Super Mario franchise, and summarised by saying {{it was the best}} title since Super Mario 64. Similarly, Hudak thought that the game was a reincarnation of Super Mario 64, whilst stating that the variety of gameplay had a [...] "signature Miyamoto style". Navarro said that the level designs were [...] "top flight in every regard" [...] and also praised the game's introduction <b>of</b> <b>suits,</b> adding that they brought a [...] "great dimension" [...] to gameplay. Williams opined that the game's [...] "shallow" [...] two-player mode did not add anything to the overall experience. He did praise the various gameplay components and the use of both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, stating that the setup was [...] "pinpoint accurate". A reviewer from GamesRadar thought that the control scheme had a fluid response that improved over the controls of its predecessor, Super Mario Sunshine. Regarding the controls and world designs, Bedigan stated that both aspects are [...] "close to perfection as a game can get". Casamassina found the gameplay mechanics, in particular varying physics, as [...] "ridiculously entertaining". He also regarded the motion control as being well implemented, stating that the player would appreciate the change of pace that the levels offer. Halverson particularly commended the innovative controls, saying the Wii Remote and Nunchuck was [...] "at its finest" [...] and that it was difficult to imagine playing it in another fashion.|$|E

500|$|Following a {{trial at}} the club, Gill signed for Cheltenham Town on 25 February 2004 on a non-{{contract}} basis {{until the end}} of the season. He was given a one-year contract for the 2004–05 season and, at the age of 34, played in all 46 league games; he believed that all the fitness work he did during rehabilitation from his knee injury had given him a new lease of life. Gill acted as regular deputy when club captain John Finnigan was unavailable through injury. For the following season, he was given another one-year contract, with an option for 2006–07 if he managed to play 20 games during the season. Not only did he start twice that number, he contributed to the club reaching the final of the League Two play-offs at the Millennium Stadium. His starting place and winners' medal, achieved with the help of his [...] "excellent last-ditch defending", went some way to alleviate the disappointment of missing the 2001 League Cup final. In addition, his sales experience enabled the players to look smart for the occasion; expecting to be wearing tracksuits for their big day because the club was unable to afford a set of new suits, Gill persuaded a local outfitters to supply a set <b>of</b> <b>suits</b> at reasonable cost. While at Cheltenham Town he became a fan favourite and even had a song created by the fans who jokingly sung about his less than impressive goal scoring abilities, [...] "If Jerry scores, We're on the pitch, if Jerry scores, We're on the pitch!" [...] to the tune of Tom Hark.|$|E
500|$|Henry faced many {{challenges}} to secure possession of his father’s and grandfathers’ lands {{that required the}} reassertion and extension of old suzerainties. [...] In 1162 Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury, died, and Henry saw an opportunity to re-establish {{what he saw as}} his rights over the church in England by appointing his friend Thomas Becket to succeed him. [...] Instead, Becket proved to be an inept politician whose defiance alienated the king and his counsellors. [...] Henry and Becket clashed repeatedly: over church tenures, Henry’s brother’s marriage and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket, {{and other members of the}} English episcopate, to recognise sixteen ancient customsgoverning relations between the king, his courts, and the churchin writing for the first time in the Constitutions of Clarendon. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry attempted to ruin him by laying a number <b>of</b> <b>suits</b> relating to Becket’s time as chancellor. In response Becket fled into exile for five years. Relations later improved, allowing Becket's return, but soured again when Becket saw the coronation of Henry's son as coregent by the Archbishop of York as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him. When he heard the news, Henry said: [...] "What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk." [...] Three of Henry's men killed Becket in Canterbury Cathedral after Becket resisted a botched attempt to arrest him. Within Christian Europe Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket's death. The opinion of this transgression against the church made Henry a pariah, so in penance he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral where he was scourged by monks.|$|E
