5000|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> is {{the part}} of the {{fireplace}} unit that is installed in the framing of the building. Two of the main operational components are housed inside of it. The first key component within the <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> is the firebox, which is surrounded on three sides by the <b>outer</b> <b>housing,</b> and on one side by the glass panel that faces in towards the room. This is the space in which the fire burns during operation. Because of this, the gas burners (either natural gas or propane) are located inside of the firebox. To provide a more realistic look, imitation logs and ember material are placed on top of the burners. The ember material, which will not burn, is designed so that it will glow like real embers when heated. The firebox is designed to be smaller than the <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> so that there is an empty space between the outermost walls of <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> and the outer walls of the firebox [...] The empty space in between the firebox and the <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> is the second important operational component of the <b>outer</b> <b>housing.</b> This space is filled with air from the interior of the room being heated and is used to add hot air to the room without the addition of exhaust gasses from combustion.|$|E
50|$|The OxySure Model 615 {{consists}} of an <b>outer</b> <b>housing,</b> oxygen mask and a disposable cartridge. The <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> and the cartridge are made of thermoplastic materials. The disposable cartridge contains the two dry, inert proprietary powders inside a chamber. The powders are dry and inert until activated when the dial is turned. The cartridges are disposable while the <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> is reusable. The unit will provide medically pure (USP) oxygen at a flow rate of six (6) liters per minute for at least 15 minutes.|$|E

50|$|An OEM damper {{consists}} of an outer mass bonded/vulcanized to an inner hub. An aftermarket performance damper consists a mass which attached/mounted to a housing (steel, aluminum, titanium, etc.). Based on {{the different types of}} damper and where the mass is controlled differently. The first three use older technology; First is the liquid type damper which surrounds the mass immersed in the housing which is then bonded or welded together. Second is the o-ring type which surrounds the mass with a number of o-rings as it sits in its housing. Third is the friction type which has clutches and spring acting on the mass inside the <b>outer</b> <b>housing.</b> Fourth is the newest type in which the mass sits over and is attached an elastomer ring which is then attached to the <b>outer</b> <b>housing.</b> The crankshaft and damper together become (in its torsional response) a spring-mass-damper system again which can only occur by the two being interference fit together.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Outer</b> <b>House</b> is a {{court of}} first instance, {{although}} some statutory appeals are remitted to it by the Inner House. Such appeals are originally referred from the sheriff courts, the court of first instance for civil causes in the court system of Scotland. Judges in the <b>Outer</b> <b>House</b> {{are referred to as}} Lord or Lady name, or as Lord Ordinary. The <b>Outer</b> <b>House</b> is superficially similar to the High Court in England and Wales, and in this house judges sit singly—and with a jury of twelve in personal injury or defamation actions. Subject-matter jurisdiction is extensive and extends to all kinds of civil claims unless expressly excluded by statute, and it shares much of this jurisdiction with the Sheriff courts. Some classes of cases, such as intellectual property disputes, are heard by an individual judge designated by the Lord President as the jurist for intellectual property cases.|$|R

50|$|The GT26B {{gas turbine}} burns {{a mixture of}} {{compressed}} air and gas. When this mixture is ignited, the products of combustion expand over the blades of the turbine which generates torque on the shaft. Each gas turbine contributes roughly 293 MW to the overall plant output. The thermal block of the GT26B gas turbine contains the compressor, two combustion chambers, a high-pressure and a low-pressure turbine, inside a common <b>outer</b> <b>housing.</b> The main feature of the GT26 gas turbine is sequential combustion. The gas turbine incorporates two combustors that operate simultaneously and sequentially, providing higher thermal efficiencies with lower temperatures and emissions.|$|E

50|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> of the FOEP is a pressure-tight {{canister}} 181⁄16 inches (458.8 mm) {{in diameter}} and 18½ inches (470 mm) long. The bottom closure and removable top lid are both slightly domed to prevent implosion should pressure reversals be encountered. The inner assembly structure is fastened to a support ring approximately 6 inches {{from the bottom of}} the canister and consists of upper and lower bulkheads joined by a cylinder. Cutouts in the cylinder permit access to the centrifuge, which houses the frogs. Near the top of the canister are two electrical feed-through receptacles for the power supply and data line.|$|E
50|$|The Atkinson cycle {{can be used}} in a rotary engine. In this configuration, an {{increase}} in both power and efficiency can be achieved when compared to the Otto cycle. This type of engine retains the one power phase per revolution, together with the different compression and expansion volumes of the original Atkinson cycle. Exhaust gases are expelled from the engine by compressed-air scavenging. This modification of the Atkinson cycle allows the use of alternative fuels such as diesel and hydrogen. Disadvantages of this design include the requirement that rotor tips seal very tightly on the <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> wall and the mechanical losses suffered through friction between rapidly oscillating parts of irregular shape.

50|$|As the firebox {{heats up}} {{due to the}} {{operation}} of the burners, it radiates heat into the room through the porous glass face that separates the firebox from the inside of the room. At the same time, it transfers heat through the surrounding metal walls into the empty space in between itself and the <b>outer</b> <b>housing.</b> This heat transfer creates a convection process inside of the empty space that is very similar to the one that takes place inside of the firebox. Built into the design of the room facing side of the unit are two vents, one at the top and one at the bottom. Once the air in the empty space begins to heat up, convection pushes this heated air further up in the chamber until it is eventually pushed out through the top vent. This phenomenon works in the same way to draw air in through the bottom vent. As the hot air is pushed out, space is emptied in the chamber behind the firebox, which then draws cold air in through the bottom vent.|$|E
50|$|Bowden cables can {{cease to}} {{function}} smoothly, particularly if water or contaminants {{get into the}} housing. (Modern lined and stainless steel cables are less prone to these problems; unlined housings should be lubricated with a light machine oil.) In cold climates Bowden cable mechanisms are prone to malfunction due to water freezing. Cables also wear through use over a long time, and can be damaged through kinking or raveling. A common failure occurs on bicycles {{at the point where}} the housing enters a barrel adjuster; loose housing ends tend to fray the housing, making adjustments uncertain. Fraying due to fatigue is most likely if the cable passes over a pulley, which on bicycles is often below the recommended diameter, or where the cable is bent repeatedly where it attaches to the brake lever or caliper. A cable passing around a sharp bend tend to furrow the inner cable sleeve, leading to contact with the <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> and rub fraying. A frayed cable can suddenly break when force is applied strongly, e.g. during emergency braking.|$|E
5000|$|Automatic and semi-automatics {{typically}} use a {{centrifugal clutch}} which operates {{in a different}} fashion. At idle, the engine is disconnected from the gearbox input shaft, allowing both it and the bike to freewheel (unlike torque converter automatics, there is no [...] "idle creep" [...] with a properly adjusted centrifugal clutch). As the throttle is opened and engine speed rises, counterweights attached to movable inner friction surfaces (connected to the engine shaft) within the clutch assembly are thrown gradually further outwards, until they start {{to make contact with}} the inside of the <b>outer</b> <b>housing</b> (connected to the gearbox shaft) and transmit an increasing amount of engine power. The effective [...] "bite point" [...] is found automatically by equilibrium where the power being transmitted through the (still-slipping) clutch is equal to what the engine can provide. This allows relatively fast full-throttle takeoffs (with the clutch adjusted so the engine will be turning near its maximum-torque rpm) without the engine slowing or bogging down, as well as more relaxed starts and low-speed maneuvers at lower throttle settings and rpms.|$|E
