5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold <b>out</b> <b>until</b> XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} {{poisoning}} include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of gas appliances, keeping chimneys clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This should generally be carried <b>out</b> <b>until</b> symptoms {{are no longer}} present and the HbCO level is less than 10%. While hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E
5|$|In the Iberian peninsula, Crusader {{privileges}} {{were given}} to those aiding the Templars, the Hospitallers, and the Iberian orders that merged with the orders of Calatrava and Santiago. The Christian kingdoms pushed the Muslim Moors and Almohads back in frequent Papal-endorsed Iberian Crusades from 1212 to 1265. The Emirate of Granada held <b>out</b> <b>until</b> 1492, {{at which point the}} Muslims and Jews were finally expelled from the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Leicester having {{returned}} to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant, {{with the proviso}} that it be not carried <b>out</b> <b>until</b> she gave her approval. As {{there was no sign of}} her doing so, Burghley, Leicester, and a handful of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary's execution in the interest of the state. Leicester went to Bath and Bristol for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth's severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary's death.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{constant}} bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft {{were also}} used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica. They would land under fire at a small improvised grass landing strip, unloading ammunition and other supplies while keeping their engines running and taking off as soon as was possible. On 23 March, a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed. Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping ammunition to Rogatica but managed to return to base safely. As {{a result of the}} determined re-supply effort by the ZNDH, the Rogatica garrison succeeded in holding <b>out</b> <b>until</b> relieved by German-NDH forces on 17 April.|$|E
5|$|At 16:00 the {{regiment}} was attacked in force, but the Turks withdrew after suffering heavy casualties. But the British attack elsewhere had failed, and some units {{had been forced}} to retire, leaving {{the regiment}} exposed. They fought off attacks throughout the night, until 05:00 the next morning. Then for two hours they were harassed with sniper fire and hand grenades. Meldrum asked the brigade for reinforcements and more ammunition. There were no reserves of ammunition available and the only reinforcements were forty men from the 6th Battalion Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) who were sent to assist, but did not arrive until noon. At 14:00 Meldrum reported he could now hold <b>out</b> <b>until</b> nightfall and at 22:30 they were relieved {{by the rest of the}} Loyal Regiment and the 5th Battalion Wiltshire Regiment. In the day's fighting the regiment, from a total of 173 all ranks, had lost forty-three dead and seventy-four wounded.|$|E
