25|$|Probably {{the ones}} that {{hit me in the}} head later <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career were a lot more {{detrimental}} than the one that hit me in the chest. The fact that it has caused long-term effects - I was probably hit badly in the head three or four times in my career. To the point where it has now caused what they call post-traumatic epilepsy. It's not a full-blown epilepsy attack, but more of a dizzy spell, sort of a blackout type. Only in the last 12 months has this been identified. Medication has fixed it up.|$|E
500|$|Stefani's {{presence}} as a featured artist on the song received negative reviews from music critics. About.com's Ivan Rott {{commented that the}} song's funk-influenced sound [...] "definitely [...] ", but was disappointed in Stefani's contribution, finding its repetition tedious. Evan McGarvey of Stylus Magazine also found it repetitive, and described [...] "Can I Have It Like That" [...] as [...] "a brief distillation of everything calamitous about [...] and Chad Hugo's production style". The Guardian stated that Stefani's part was the only catchy hook <b>on</b> <b>In</b> <b>My</b> Mind, but added that it [...] "seems to be built around a one-line cast-off found on the Love. Angel. Music. Baby. factory floor." [...] Finding [...] "Can I Have It Like That" [...] a [...] "slow burner" [...] that offered a [...] "promising hint at what else is to come" [...] <b>on</b> <b>In</b> <b>My</b> Mind, Claire Simpson stated in her musicOMH review that Stefani's contribution was [...] "purely cosmetic and clearly a transparent means of getting her name on the single to not only boost her own credentials but to help draw Pharrell {{to the attention of}} her increasingly mainstream following." ...|$|E

Cuomo moved to simpler songwriting with less {{personal}} lyrics; he stated that Weezer's subsequent albums the Green Album (2001) and Maladroit (2002) were [...] "very intentionally not about me. Not {{about what was going}} <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, at least in a conscious way."

Aguilera recalls the domestic violence of her childhood as she sings, [...] "He took his anger out on her face, she kept all of her pain locked away". Nick Levine for Digital Spy said that [...] "Oh Mother" [...] is a [...] "retread" [...] of [...] "I'm OK", a song with the same topic from Aguilera's 2002 album Stripped.|$|E

The {{majority}} of the group arrived in London on March 13, but Redding had flown in days earlier for interviews, such as at [...] "The Eamonn Andrews Show". [...] When the crew arrived in London, the Beatles sent a limousine to pick them up. [...] Booking agent Bill Graham proposed that Redding play at the Fillmore Auditorium in late 1966. [...] The gig was commercially and critically successful, paying Redding around $800 to $1000 a night. It prompted Graham to remark afterwards, [...] "That was the best gig I ever put <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> entire life." [...] Redding began touring Europe six months later.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the lyrics {{on the album}} as [...] "just whatever is going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head...

Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, [...] "Those guys don’t have the best voices either, but they pull it off then I figured I could do it too," [...] he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences [...] "will always be there" [...] because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as [...] " [...] to so much stuff it just gets lost".|$|E
500|$|The Incredibles as {{a concept}} dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during {{a period in which}} he tried to break into film. Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life. During this time, Bird had inked a {{production}} deal with Warner Bros. Animation and {{was in the process of}} directing his first feature, The Iron Giant. Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life. He stated, [...] "Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I think that what was going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life definitely filtered into the movie." [...] After the box office failure of The Iron Giant, Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.|$|E

500|$|Together {{with his}} Beatles bandmate John Lennon and their wives, Harrison first took acid in March 1965. He likened the {{heightened}} awareness {{induced by the}} drug to [...] "a light-bulb [...] <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head" [...] and [...] "gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours". In addition, he credited LSD with being the catalyst for his interest in Indian classical music, particularly the work of Ravi Shankar, and Eastern spirituality. By the time Harrison wrote [...] "It's All Too Much", in 1967, the Indian sitar had temporarily replaced the guitar as his main musical instrument, as he received tuition from Shankar {{and one of the}} latter's protégés, Shambhu Das. As with his other songs from this period, however, such as [...] "Within You Without You" [...] and [...] "Blue Jay Way", Harrison composed the melody on a keyboard instrument. In the case of [...] "It's All Too Much", his use of Hammond organ allowed him to replicate the drone-like sound of the harmonium commonly heard in Indian vocal pieces.|$|E
500|$|Following the good-time fun of [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35", the Chicago blues-influenced [...] "Pledging My Time" [...] {{sets the}} somber tone {{that runs through}} the album. It draws on several {{traditional}} blues songs, including Elmore James' recording of [...] "It Hurts Me Too". For critic Michael Gray, the lines [...] "Somebody got lucky but it was an accident" [...] echo the lines [...] "Some joker got lucky, stole her back again" [...] from Robert Johnson's [...] "Come <b>On</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Kitchen", which is itself an echo of the Skip James 1931 recording [...] "Devil Got My Woman". Gray suggests that [...] "the gulping movements of the melodic phrases" [...] derive from the melody of [...] "Sitting on Top of the World", recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930. The couplet {{at the end of each}} verse expresses the theme: a pledge made to a prospective lover in hopes she [...] "will come through, too". Besides Dylan's vocals and improvised harmonica breaks, the song's sound is defined by Robbie Robertson's guitar, Hargus [...] "Pig" [...] Robbins's blues piano and Ken Buttrey's snare drum rolls. The song was released in edited form as the B-side of [...] "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35" [...] in March.|$|E
500|$|Fatboy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created for}} the first series of the EastEnders online spin-off EastEnders: E20 who also appear in the main show, along with ZsaZsa, Leon and Mercy. Fatboy, along with the other characters from E20, was created by the show's thirteen writers during a summer school run by the BBC in August 2009. Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said [...] "I am so excited to be on the show. It's an honour to now be part of a show that has been <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> house for as long as I have been alive. I am born and bred in the East End—a stone's throw from the real Albert Square. It feels like a homecoming. I love being part of a cast that feels like family and can't wait to have a scene in The Vic." [...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people. Norwood stated in 2013 that being from east London and playing a character from east London meant that he could [...] "bring the truth to that character from the knowledge I have. [...] try and bring the truth out of that instead of doing it from an outside perspective." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on to me about it or try and make me feel bad about everything that's going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E
500|$|... "Stronger" [...] is a dance-pop and electropop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Hal Leonard Corporation, it {{is set in a}} common time and has a moderately fast tempo of 116 beats per minute. Written in the key of A minor, it follows the chord progression Am–F–C-G/B. Clarkson's vocals span two octaves, from G3 to G5. The song begins with a [...] "rumbling guitar" [...] and a [...] "shimmering synth" [...] riff as Clarkson sings the opening line [...] "You know the bed feels warmer / Sleeping here alone." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the guitar riff in the verses is reminiscent of Clarkson's [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which narrates an anthem of personal reinvention, and dancing. The bridges contain pulsating beats with synth and electric guitar that display some elements of electronic sound. During chorus, the song explodes into an upbeat dance-pop number, complete with guitars and electronic drums as Clarkson sings [...] "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger / Stand a little taller / Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant felt nobody else could sell the song's [...] "ginormous chorus" [...] better than Clarkson. Lyrically, [...] "Stronger" [...] explores the theme of moving on from an inimical relationship. In an interview, Clarkson remarked that the song doesn't refer to a specific person, stating [...] "I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, I just think life is about relationships so I always write all about these different ones going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. And I don't have a filter, so it's pretty verbatim." [...] Jason Scott of Blogcritics felt that out of all tracks in Stronger, Clarkson's vocals are best and trendiest in [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)".|$|E
2500|$|The stanza's [...] "somebody got lucky" [...] {{offers a}} clue as to one of the song's inspirations.

2500|$|Ali and Frazier's first fight, {{held at the}} Garden on March 8, 1971, was {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Fight of the Century", due to the {{tremendous}} excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim as heavyweight champions.
