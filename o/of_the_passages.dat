Fearing {{unpleasant}} and even violent reprisals, Thomas Jefferson convinced {{him not to}} publish it in 1802; five years later Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had been}} accused of exhibiting a racist {{attitude}} toward Africans in an earlier story, Tintin in the Congo, and potentially hoped to exonerate himself from such criticism by depicting Tintin and Haddock freeing African slaves in The Red Sea Sharks. In preparing the latter story he had consulted a colleague who worked for an African-themed magazine, L'Afrique et le Monde ("Africa and the World"); they translated some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> that Hergé wished to include in the story into Yoruba. However, in January 1962 an article in the magazine Jeune Afrique criticised Hergé for a racist depiction of Africans in the story, an accusation that would be echoed in other publications. These claims focused on the African characters' simplistic use of pidgin language, which was similar to the speech patterns used in Tintin in the Congo.|$|E

An analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> of the chronicles directly quoted in Maha Yazawin shows that the referenced chronicles were most probably 16th century copies of the original chronicles, judging by their use of language, and most likely incomplete and partial copies, judging by their lack of specific dates, prior to the Toungoo period.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} {{undergone}} various recent renovations since the 1980s—when {{the first major}} renovation was carried out—but some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> still require repair or renovation. At the same time, a project was ongoing to air cool the station in conjunction with Metro-North Railroad's project to cool Grand Central Terminal. However, , only the Lexington Avenue Line station is air-cooled. The Lexington Avenue Line station, the 2009 South Ferry station, the 34th Street–Hudson Yards station, and the three constructed stations of the Second Avenue Subway are the only six artificially cooled stations in the New York City Subway. The Flushing Line platforms have been equipped with fans, but not an air-cooling system.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{and initial}} {{success of the}} rebellion took the Romans by surprise. The rebels incorporated combined tactics to fight the Roman Army. According to some historians, Bar Kokhba's army mostly practiced guerrilla warfare, inflicting heavy casualties. This view is largely supported by Cassius Dio, who wrote that the revolt began with covert attacks in line with preparation of hideout systems, though after taking over the fortresses Bar Kokhba turned to direct engagement due to his superiority in numbers. Only after several painful defeats in the field did the Romans decide to avoid open conflict and instead methodically besiege individual Judean cities. With the slowly advancing Roman army cutting supply lines, the rebels engaged in long-term defense. The defense system of Judean towns and villages was based mainly on hideout caves, which were created in large numbers in almost every population center. Many houses utilized underground hideouts, where Judean rebels hoped to withstand Roman superiority by the narrowness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> and even ambushes from underground. The cave systems were often interconnected and used not only as hideouts for the rebels but also for storage and refuge for their families. Hideout systems were employed in the Judean hills, the Judean desert, northern Negev, {{and to some degree}} also in Galilee, Samaria and Jordan Valley. As of July 2015 some 350 hideout systems have been mapped within the ruins of 140 Jewish villages.|$|E

500|$|Muzafer Sherif {{conducted}} an experiment, {{very similar to}} Lorge, in which he investigated how prestige affects the evaluation of literary materials. College {{students were asked to}} rank a set of prose passages according to their literary quality. Each passage also included the name of a well-known author. However, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> were actually written by the same author. [...] Participants rated the authors earlier in terms of their literary standing. Sherif found that passages that were identified with highly acclaimed authors received higher rankings.|$|E
500|$|The {{historic}} town centre still retains its medieval street pattern and many narrow passages. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages,</b> especially those that pass through buildings from one street to the next, are called [...] "" [...] (the word deriving from [...] "to shoot through" [...] from one street to another). Many specialist shops, traditional pubs and local restaurants {{can be found in}} the hidden corners, squares and lanes of Shrewsbury. Many of the street names have also remained unchanged for centuries and there are some more unusual names, such as Butcher Row, Longden Coleham, Dogpole, Mardol, Frankwell, Roushill, Grope Lane, Gullet Passage, Murivance, the Dana, Portobello, Bear Steps, Shoplatch and Bellstone.|$|E
500|$|Asch {{suggested}} that Sherif's {{results could be}} largely influenced from the environment of a laboratory experiment. Because the experiment was designed to have each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> have very few differences between them, participants were faced with a dilemma when asked to distinguish between them. The experimenter and other neighboring participants may appear to find the task obvious, so the participant attends to any clues that might help him make the decision. In fear of looking ridiculous, the participant might now approach the task as, [...] "Which of these am I expected to like and dislike?" [...] With the only information that varies being the author, the participant might make conclusions about the quotes based on this one piece of information that varies.|$|E

500|$|The current {{resurgence}} {{is located}} {{close to the}} base of the Dolomitic Conglomerate at the head of a short gorge formed by headward erosion with subsequent cavern collapse. The morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> is determined by the rock strata in which they are formed. The streamway in the outer part of the cave system that is formed within the Dolomitic Conglomerate is characterised by shallow loops linking low bedding chambers, or tall narrow passages, known as 'rifts', developed by phreatic solutional enlargement of fractured rifts. The streamway in the inner part of the system formed within the limestone is characterised by deep phreatic loops reaching depths as much as , with the water flowing down-dip along bedding planes and rising up enlarged joints. In the far reaches of the cave the passages descend to [...] below sea level.|$|E
500|$|History of a Six Weeks' Tour {{begins with}} a [...] "Preface", written by Percy Shelley, {{followed}} by the journal section. The journal consists of edited entries from the joint diary that Percy and Mary Shelley kept during their 1814 trip to the Continent, specifically those from 28 July to 13 September 1814. Of the 8,500 words in the journal section, 1,150 are from Percy's entries and either copied verbatim or only slightly paraphrased. Almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> describing the sublime are in Percy's words—passages describing God in nature, experiences of terror and awe, the transportation of the soul, and particularly {{the feeling of being}} overwhelmed by the majesty of nature, are Percy's. When Mary turned to her own entries, however, she significantly revised them; according to Jeanne Moskal, the editor of the recent definitive edition of the Tour, [...] "almost nothing of her original phrasing remains". She even included sections of Claire Clairmont's journal.|$|E
500|$|The event CGs were {{decided by}} Nakazawa {{based on the}} game's plot and script, and written down in a {{specification}} document given to the art team. Because this was done before the scenario was completely finished, there were some places that he {{when looking at the}} scenario as a whole realized would have benefited more from a CG than some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> that did get one, despite how he updated the specification document every so often throughout the development. Because of this, it was decided to add more CGs to several scenes for the game's [...] "Premium Edition" [...] re-release. A challenge in creating the CGs was that the art team did not understand the game's main plot twist, resulting in several finished CGs with mistakes that a person who does not know about the twist would not have noticed, that had to be fixed. For the background art, inspiration was drawn from the films Cube and The Abyss and the video game Resident Evil.|$|E

500|$|The {{station is}} in Down Street in Mayfair, just off Piccadilly {{and a short}} {{distance}} from Park Lane. It lies between Green Park (originally named Dover Street) and Hyde Park Corner on the Piccadilly line. It was opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP the precursor to the Piccadilly line) on 15 March 1907, {{a few months after the}} rest of the line opened. The delay was due to difficulties in purchasing the site for the station building and agreeing a safe layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> below ground with the Board of Trade. The surface building was designed by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London's (UERL's) architect Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station had a pair of Otis lifts, with the platforms located [...] below the street level of Piccadilly.|$|E
500|$|Mom & Me & Mom debuted {{at number}} 8 on The New York Times bestseller list {{the week of}} its release, April 21, 2013.

[...] Bernardine Evaristo of the British publication The Observer, {{in one of the}} few negative reviews of Mom & Me & Mom, calls the book [...] "a slight, anecdotal and badly edited book that rehashes stories from previous memoirs". [...] Evaristo questions the veracity of Angelou's anecdotes, and states that some of them contradict earlier versions. [...] Evaristo also believes that Mom & Me & Mom undermines Caged Bird, which she calls [...] "a ground-breaking triumph".|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} the newsletters, {{particularly}} in the period between 1988 and 1994 when Paul {{was no longer in}} Congress, contained material that later proved controversial. Topics included conspiracy theories, anti-government militia movements, and race wars. During Paul's 1996 congressional election campaign, and his 2008 and 2012 presidential primary campaigns, critics charged that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> reflected racist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic bigotry. In a 1996 interview, Paul did not deny writing the newsletters and defended some of their contents, but specified that he opposes racism. In March 2001, Paul said he did not write the commentaries, but stopped short of denying authorship in 1996 because his campaign advisers had thought it would be too confusing and that he had to live with the material published under his name. In 2011, Paul's spokesperson Jesse Benton said Paul had [...] "taken moral responsibility because they appeared under his name and slipped through under his watch." ...|$|E

500|$|F. W. Bateson {{emphasized}} in 1966 the poem's ability to capture truth: [...] "The Ode to a Nightingale had {{ended with the}} explicit admission that the 'fancy' is a 'cheat,' and the Grecian Urn concludes with a similar repudiation. But this time it is a positive instead of a negative conclusion. There is no escape from the 'woe' that 'shall this generation waste,' but the action of time can be confronted and seen in its proper proportions. To enable its readers {{to do this is}} the special function of poetry." [...] Ronald Sharp followed in 1979 with a claim that the theme of [...] "the relationship between life and art... receives its most famous, and its most enigmatic and controversial, treatment" [...] within the poem. In 1983, Vendler praised many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>passages</b> within the poem but argued that the poem was unable to fully represent what Keats wanted: [...] "The simple movement of entrance and exit, even in its triple repetition in the Urn, is simply not structurally complex enough to be adequate, as a representational form, to what we know of aesthetic experience – or indeed to human experience generally." [...] Later in 1989, Daniel Watkins claimed the poem as [...] "one of [...] most beautiful and problematic works." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics such as Malcolm Cowley and Delmore Schwartz {{describe}} {{mixed emotions}} about the religiosity of the poem.

F. B. Pinion believed that the fourth section of the poem caused [...] "Eliot more trouble and vexation than any passage of the same length he ever wrote, and is his greatest achievement in the Four Quartets." [...] E. M. Forster did not like Eliot's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem: [...] "Of course there's pain on and off through each individual's life... You can't shirk it and so on. But why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and sanctified by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and bullies? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer." [...] Writing in 2003, Roger Scruton wrote that in [...] "Little Gidding" [...] Eliot achieved [...] "that for which he envies Dante—namely, a poetry of belief, in which belief and words are one, and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language".|$|E
