25|$|The {{problem of}} finding a minimum vertex cover is a {{classical}} <b>optimization</b> <b>problem</b> in computer science and is a typical example of an NP-hard <b>optimization</b> <b>problem</b> that has an approximation algorithm. Its decision version, the vertex cover problem, was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems and is therefore a classical NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory. Furthermore, the vertex cover problem is fixed-parameter tractable and a central problem in parameterized complexity theory.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies robust {{solutions}} and semidefinite linear programming (SDP) relaxations {{of a class}} of convex polynomial <b>optimization</b> <b>problems</b> {{in the face of}} data uncertainty. The class of convex <b>optimization</b> <b>problems,</b> called robust SOS-convex polynomial <b>optimization</b> <b>problems,</b> includes robust quadratically constrained convex <b>optimization</b> <b>problems</b> and robust separable convex polynomial <b>optimization</b> <b>problems.</b> It establishes sums-of-squares polynomial representations characterizing robust {{solutions and}} exact SDP-relaxations of robust SOS-convex polynomial <b>optimization</b> <b>problems</b> under various commonly used uncertainty sets. In particular, the results show that the polytopic and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets, that allow second-order cone re-formulations of robust quadratically constrained <b>optimization</b> <b>problems,</b> continue to permit exact SDP-relaxations for a broad class of robust SOS-convex polynomial <b>optimization</b> <b>problems.</b> Research was partially {{supported by a grant from}} the Australian Research Council.

25|$|Radio {{resource}} management is often solved by scalarization; that is, {{selection of a}} network utility function that tries to balance throughput and user fairness. The choice of utility function has a large impact on the computational complexity of the resulting single-objective <b>optimization</b> <b>problem.</b> For example, the common utility of weighted sum rate gives an NP-hard problem with a complexity that scales exponentially {{with the number of}} users, while the weighted max-min fairness utility results in a quasi-convex <b>optimization</b> <b>problem</b> with only a polynomial scaling with the number of users.|$|E

30|$|Because of its simple algorithm, {{particle}} swarm optimization is easy to implement, and no gradient {{information is}} needed. The characteristics of small parameters are good for both continuous <b>optimization</b> <b>problems</b> and discrete <b>optimization</b> <b>problems,</b> especially because of their natural real-coded features are suitable for processing optimization [14]. In recent years, it has been became a hot topic {{in the field of}} intelligent optimization around the world. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was first applied to the optimization of nonlinear continuous functions and neural network training and was newly used to solve constrained <b>optimization</b> <b>problems,</b> multi-objective <b>optimization</b> <b>problems,</b> and dynamic <b>optimization</b> <b>problems</b> [8].|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} solve this problem with a {{numerical}} optimization technique, we must first transform this problem such that the critical points occur at local minima. This is done by computing the magnitude of the gradient of the unconstrained <b>optimization</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike other deep architectures, such as DBNs, {{the goal}} is not to {{discover}} the transformed feature representation.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the framework of}} qualitative <b>optimization</b> <b>problems</b> (or, simply, <b>optimization</b> <b>problems)</b> to represent preference theories. The formalism uses separate modules to describe the space of outcomes to be compared (the generator) and the preferences on outcomes (the selector). We consider two types of <b>optimization</b> <b>problems.</b> They differ {{in the way the}} generator, which we model by a propositional theory, is interpreted: by the standard propositional logic semantics, and by the equilibrium-model (answer-set) semantics. Under the latter interpretation of generators, <b>optimization</b> <b>problems</b> directly generalize answer-set optimization programs proposed previously. We study strong equivalence of <b>optimization</b> <b>problems,</b> which guarantees their interchangeability within any larger context. We characterize several versions of strong equivalence obtained by restricting the class of <b>optimization</b> <b>problems</b> that can be used as extensions and establish the complexity of associated reasoning tasks. Understanding strong equivalence is essential for modular representation of <b>optimization</b> <b>problems</b> and rewriting techniques to simplify them without changing their inherent properties. 1...|$|R

25|$|While the {{decision}} problem is NP-complete, the <b>optimization</b> <b>problem</b> is NP-hard, its resolution {{is at least}} as difficult as {{the decision}} problem, and there is no known polynomial algorithm which can tell, given a solution, whether it is optimal (which would mean that there is no solution with a larger V, thus solving the NP-complete decision problem).|$|E
25|$|Mathematical {{optimization}} {{is used in}} much modern controller design. High-level controllers such as model {{predictive control}} (MPC) or real-time optimization (RTO) employ mathematical optimization.

25|$|When {{decision}} making is emphasized, the objective of solving a multi-objective <b>optimization</b> <b>problem</b> is referred to supporting a decision maker in finding the most preferred Pareto optimal solution according to his/her subjective preferences. The underlying assumption is that one {{solution to the problem}} must be identified to be implemented in practice. Here, a human decision maker (DM) plays an important role. The DM is expected to be an expert in the problem domain.|$|E
25|$|A a deep {{stacking}} network (DSN) (deep convex network) {{is based}} on a hierarchy of blocks of simplified neural network modules. It was introduced in 2011 by Deng and Dong. It formulates the learning as a convex <b>optimization</b> <b>problem</b> with a closed-form solution, emphasizing the mechanism's similarity to stacked generalization. Each DSN block is a simple module that is easy to train by itself in a supervised fashion without backpropagation for the entire blocks.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{it is of}} {{interest}} {{to find out what}} is the immediate effect of a perturbation or knockout, since it takes time for regulatory changes to occur and for the organism to re-organize fluxes to optimally utilize a different carbon source or circumvent the effect of the knockout.
