5|$|As {{early as}} 1986, Barry Levinson {{intended}} {{to direct a}} film based {{on the life of}} Darin, and he began pre-production <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> in early 1997. When he eventually vacated the director's position, Spacey, along with Darin's son Dodd, acquired the film rights.|$|E
5|$|Development <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> {{began in}} 2011 after {{the rights to}} Isaacson's book were acquired. Sorkin wrote the {{screenplay}} with filming beginning in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> with editor Elliot Graham noting that {{he was working on}} existing footage while the film was still shooting. Daniel Pemberton served as the film's composer, with a focus dedicated to dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.|$|E
5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} word <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E

5|$|In May 1960, {{the then}} Oregon State College was {{advanced}} $19,000 {{by the federal}} government to plan for a new $2,170,000 building. The new building was designed by architects Hamlin & Martin, and the cost rose to $2.4 million by the time the school accepted bids <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> in April 1962. Ground was broken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> on May 1, 1962, with Shields Construction Company as the general contractor for the project.

However, the 'a patchy server' explanation was initially given <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project's</b> website.|$|R

5|$|All of the game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Shogo Sakai. Itoi saw Sakai as competing with Mother 2 composer Keiichi Suzuki for his fans. Itoi {{had to choose}} a composer from the development team who understood the series and could work full-time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> including other development duties. Thus, he could not choose Suzuki, who was outside the project, or Hirokazu Tanaka, who had become the president of Creatures. Sakai also understood the game's story intimately and named the Magypsies after musical terms. He worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky was set {{to direct}} an HBO series pilot called Hobgoblin.

5|$|As {{cinematic}} {{director of}} The Battle for Middle-earth II, Richard Taylor {{was responsible for}} designing the game's opening and closing sequences, as well as campaign and mission introductions and endings.

Taylor considered it essential to use good graphical and audio combinations when telling a story, and he was pleased to have Weaving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> as the primary storyteller.|$|E
50|$|The key {{difference}} between outcome mapping {{and most other}} project evaluation systems is its approach to the problem that a project's direct influence over a community only lasts {{for as long as}} <b>the</b> <b>project</b> is running, and developing agencies have difficulty in attributing resultant change in those communities directly to the actions of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> itself. <b>The</b> outcome mapping approach is to focus less <b>on</b> <b>the</b> direct deliverables of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> and to focus more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> behavioural changes in peripheral parties affected by <b>the</b> <b>project</b> team. Thus an outcome mapped project report will focus less <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project's</b> actual progress and more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project's</b> influence (both deliberate and unintended) during <b>the</b> <b>project's</b> progression.|$|R

Testing of the key technologies was successfully completed in November 2012, allowing Skylon's design to advance from its research phase to a development phase. An engine test facility is being built at Westcott and if all goes to plan, the first ground-based engine tests could happen in 2020, and Skylon could be performing unmanned test flights by 2025.|$|E
5|$|By April 2015, Marvel was {{developing}} a spin-off series of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. The series, which was {{being developed by}} Bell and writer Paul Zbyszewski, {{would be based on}} storylines occurring {{at the end of the}} second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and would receive its own pilot rather than a backdoor pilot. Though Palicki and Blood were reportedly in final discussions to headline the potential new series, ABC passed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> by May 7, 2015, when they announced their series renewals and cancellations, and new series pickups.|$|E
