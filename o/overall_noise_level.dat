On playback, the opposite process is applied (deemphasis), based on the relative signal component above 1 kHz. Thus as {{this portion of the}} signal decreases in amplitude, the higher frequencies are progressively more sharply attenuated, which also filters out the constant background noise on the tape when and where it would be most noticeable.|$|E
50|$|Flicker {{noise is}} found in carbon-composition {{resistors}} and in thick-film resistors, where it {{is referred to as}} excess noise, since it increases the <b>overall</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> above the thermal noise level, which is present in all resistors. In contrast, wire-wound resistors have the least amount of flicker noise. Since flicker noise is related to the level of DC, if the current is kept low, thermal noise will be the predominant effect in the resistor, and the type of resistor used may not affect noise levels, depending on the frequency window.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, the Advent Corporation {{combined}} Dolby B {{noise reduction}} system with chromium dioxide (CrO2) tape {{to create the}} Advent Model 200, the first high-fidelity cassette deck. Dolby B uses volume companding of high frequencies to boost low-level treble information by up to 9 dB, reducing them (and the hiss) on playback. CrO2 used different bias and equalization settings to reduce the <b>overall</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and extend the high frequency response. Together these allowed a usefully flat frequency response beyond 15 kHz for the first time. This deck {{was based on a}} top-loading mechanism by Nakamichi, then soon replaced by the Model 201 based on a more reliable transport made by Wollensak, a division of 3M, which was commonly used in audio/visual applications. Both featured an unusual single VU meter which could be switched between or for both channels. The Model 200 featured piano key style transport controls, with the Model 201 using the distinctive combination of a separate lever for rewind/fast forward and the large play and stop button as found on their commercial reel to reel machines of the era.|$|E

Effect of {{triangular}} tabs with circular perforations on {{the acoustic}} far-field of an axisymmetric jet issued from a convergent nozzle of exit diameter of 30. 16 mm was studied for both subsonic and sonic underexpanded cases.

OASPL plots showed that <b>overall</b> <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in subsonic jets increased due to the introduction of tabs except for far downstream angles where the <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> reduced by 2 dB. <b>Overall</b> <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in underexpanded jets decreased in all directions and at all jet mach numbers without the penalty of high frequency noise.

They were numbered 752-756.The VR3 was then the largest and most powerful Finnish locomotive.

Therefore, a screw-drive regulator was fitted.At speed there could be longitudinal movement, because locomotive had no bogie wheels, only 5 rigid axles.

The results indicate that a reduction of 15 dB (A) does result in less sleep disruption but only during sleep characterized by fast-wave electroencephalographic activity. During sleep characterized by slow-wave electroencephalographic activity, such a reduction in the sleep-disturbing properties of jet aircraft noise has little effect. Moreover, even when effective during fast-wave sleep, the decreased arousal produced by the lower noise levels is not subjectively appreciated by the individual in terms of his estimate of the quality of his night's sleep. Thus, reducing the <b>overall</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of jet aircraft flyovers by some 15 dB(A), is, at best, minimally beneficial to sleep...|$|E
