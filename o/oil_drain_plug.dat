50|$|Mid -1939 saw a {{complete}} revamp of Bedfords; {{with only the}} HC van continuing in production. The new range consisted of the K (30-40 cwt), MS and ML (2-3 ton), OS and OL (3-4 ton), OS/40 and OL/40 (5 ton) series, and the OB bus. Also on offer was a new 10-12 cwt van, the JC, derived from the new J Model Vauxhall car. Many of the trucks sold by Bedford between June and September 1939 were requisitioned for military use on {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War; many were abandoned after the retreat from Dunkirk, rendered useless to the enemy by removing the engine <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> <b>plug</b> and running the engine. Because the German armed forces in 1940 were, contrary to their popular image, desperately short of motor transport, many of these captured Bedfords were repaired and pressed into service alongside Opel Blitz (also part of GM) trucks by the German armed forces - although the Bedfords mainly filled second-line roles, including civil defence.|$|E

5000|$|Lisle's first {{automotive}} {{product was}} an aftermarket master vibrator for the Ford Model T engine, replacing the engine's four trembler coils with a cheaper and more easily adjusted single unit. It then introduced its first tool, an engine valve refacer, {{a type of}} lathe for reshaping a cylinder head's valve seats. In the 1930s they added a line of magnetic <b>oil</b> pan <b>drain</b> <b>plugs,</b> which were used in various pieces of military equipment in World War II.

5000|$|The correct fluid is a {{synthetic}} mineral oil, such as Pentosin ATF-1 or Volkswagen G 052 162 A2. 3.750 liters is usually sufficient for a filter change. The transmission fluid is checked {{from underneath the}} vehicle while running and the transmission in park. This must be completed before the transmission fully warms up. Once running, the <b>drain</b> <b>plug</b> {{on the bottom of}} the transmission oil pan is removed with a 5mm allen wrench. Some fluid will drip out whether oil level is full or low.

40|$|A {{solution}} {{has been}} proposed that ensures <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> from the discharge chamber to the pump inlet. The piston of a relief valve is controlled by a differential pressure resulting from Bernouilli effect. The start value of <b>oil</b> <b>draining</b> is {{to be controlled by}} the spring initial deflection and modification of the flow section in the outlet channel of the pump. By diminishing the spring force, 30 % reduction of the flow rate has been achieved. It is difficult to get more because of stability reasons.

50|$|In {{preparation}} for freezing temperatures, an in-ground swimming pool's pipes must be emptied. An above-ground pool {{should also be}} closed, so that ice does not drag down the pool wall, collapsing its structure. The plumbing is sealed with air, typically with rubber plugs, to prevent cracking from freezing water. The pool is typically covered to prevent leaves and other debris from falling in. The cover {{is attached to the}} pool typically using a stretch cord, similar to a bungee cord and hooks fitted into the pool surround. The skimmer is closed off or a floating device is placed into it to prevent it from completely freezing and cracking. Floating objects such as life rings or basketballs can be placed in the pool to avoid its freezing under the cover. Sand or DE filters must be backwashed, with the main <b>drain</b> <b>plug</b> removed and all water <b>drained</b> out. <b>Drain</b> <b>plugs</b> on the pool filter are removed after the filter has been cleaned. The pool pump motor is taken under cover. Winter chemicals are added to keep the pool clean. The innovation of a composite construction of fibreglass, with an epoxy coating and porcelain ceramic tiles has led to the Pre-form, Composite-type with significant advantages over older methods; however, it also has increased sensitivity to metal staining.|$|R

The drain intervals were determined using a tribotechnical diagnosis of collected samples of a motor oil from tractors. The analysis of the samples were processed in a laboratory and the dominant parameters that influence the wear of the oil were detected. On the basis of the application of a trend analysis were determined the reference values of the levels of oil degradation. After taking the evaluation and discussion of the results were defined <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> intervals for the tractors.

50|$|Magnetic filters use a {{permanent}} magnet or an electromagnet to capture ferromagnetic particles. An advantage of magnetic filtration is that maintaining the filter simply requires cleaning the particles {{from the surface}} of the magnet. Automatic transmissions in vehicles frequently have a magnet in the fluid pan to sequester magnetic particles and prolong the life of the media-type fluid filter. Some companies are manufacturing magnets that attach to the outside of an oil filter or magnetic <b>drain</b> <b>plugs</b> -- first invented and offered for cars and motorcycles in the mid-1930s -- to aid in capturing these metallic particles, though there is ongoing debate as to the effectiveness of such devices.|$|R

50|$|Mars 2M No.522 was {{launched}} at 10:33:00 UTC on 2 April 1969 atop a Proton-K 8K78K carrier rocket with a Blok D upper stage, flying from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81/24. One {{of the first}} stage engines caught fire almost immediately at liftoff. The remaining engines managed to compensate for about 30 seconds of flight, but the thrust section fire eventually resulted in loss of control. The Proton pitched over and began flying horizontally before ground controllers sent a manual shutoff command. The vehicle nosedived into the ground just outside the launch complex 41 seconds after launch. Subsequent examination found that a missing <b>drain</b> <b>plug</b> allowed nitrogen tetroxide to leak out and start a fire.|$|R
