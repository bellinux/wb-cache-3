40|$|One {{hundred and}} two {{patients}} with perforated duodenal ulcers over a 13 year period (1970 to 1982) have been prospectively followed-up {{at a special}} gastric clinic. Of the 37 patients with perforation of their acute ulcer, 34 were treated by <b>oversew</b> and three had an initial definitive operation (vagotomy and drainage). The remaining 65 patients presented with perforation of a chronic ulcer and 54 were treated by <b>oversew</b> and 11 underwent definitive surgery [...] nine had vagotomy and drainage and two had partial gastrectomies. Seven of the 34 patients (20. 5 %) with acute ulcer perforation treated by simple <b>oversew</b> subsequently required definitive ulcer surgery at a mean 17. 5 months after perforation and 31 of the 54 patients (57. 4 %) with chronic ulcer perforations required definitive surgery at a mean 27. 4 months after perforation.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{material}} effectiveness of oversewing the staple line following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. MATERIAL OF STUDY: A prospective randomized trial has been performed on 100 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Just before the intervention patients were randomized to receive (Group A) or not receive (Group B) a polypropylene 3 - 0 running oversewing suture of the staple line. RESULTS: By evaluating preoperative general demographics features and co-morbidities between group A and group B no statistical difference was observed. Main complications evaluated were fistol, bleeding and stenosis and there were no significant difference in fistulas occurrence (p = 0. 55) and bleeding (p = 0, 65) while on the other hand it has to be remarked how sleeve stenosis has been significantly higher when <b>oversew</b> is performed (p = 0. 04). DISCUSSION: Staple line leakage is a worrisome complication of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Despite some reports describe oversewing of the staple line as the solution to prevent such problem; other authors have demonstrated the incidence of leaks being the same in oversewed and not oversewed patients.

40|$|Introduction: Laparoscopic sleeve {{gastrectomy}} (LSG) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular bariatric procedures. The procedure is associated with serious staple-line complications such as bleeding, leaks, and stenosis. Aim: To determine whether <b>oversewing</b> the staple line, compared with clipping, in LSG reduces the incidence of postoperative bleeding. Material and methods: We conducted a parallel-group, prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 100 patients who underwent LSG for obesity at a single institution between May 2014 and August 2015. Patients were assigned to one of two groups for reinforcement of the staple line: the <b>oversewing</b> group (staple line <b>oversewn)</b> or the clipping group (staple line clipped). The primary outcome was reoperation for hemodynamic instability caused by staple-line bleeding within 72 h postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were operative duration, length of hospital stay, postoperative leaks, and postoperative stenosis. Results: Mean operative duration was longer in the <b>oversewing</b> group (78. 2 ± 20. 5 min) than in the clipping group (64. 1 ± 16. 5 min, p < 0. 001). Mean length of hospital stay was comparable in both groups. Postoperatively, there was no significant between-group difference in bleeding (<b>oversewing,</b> n = 0 vs. clipping, n = 2 (4. 6 %); p = 0. 21) or in stenosis and leakage (both outcomes: <b>oversewing,</b> n = 0, vs. clipping, n = 1 (2. 3 %); p = 0. 46). Conclusions : <b>Oversewing</b> the staple line prolongs operative duration. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of <b>oversewing</b> on staple-line bleeding, postoperative leakage and stenosis, or length of hospital stay...|$|R
40|$|Case Description - 3 {{horses were}} {{evaluated}} {{for signs of}} colic; cecocolic intussusception was detected. Clinical Findings - Abnormalities detected included diminished intestinal sounds, inflammatory leukogram, dehydration, unremarkable findings via rectal palpation, and ultrasonographic evidence of large intestine intussusception. Laparotomy revealed cecocolic intussusception. Treatment and Outcome - Cecal bypass via side-to-side ileocolic anastomosis without ileal transection was performed in each horse by use of an intraluminal anastomosis stapler device. Postoperative complications were minimal, and all horses recovered rapidly and were clinically normal at > 12 months after surgery. Clinical Relevance - Cecal bypass via side-to-side ileocolic anastomosis without ileal transection seemed to offer 2 potential advantages over traditional surgical techniques for treating this condition. The risk of abdominal contamination was far less than with techniques in which the colotomy is needed to enable resection of the cecum or techniques in which the ileum is transected.

He had recurrent episodes of UGIB during the prior nine months requiring multiple hospitalizations, over ten EGDs, a laparoscopy with pyloroplasty and <b>oversew</b> of gastric ulcer, and innumerable transfusions. On the current admission he presented with symptomatic anemia, melanotic stool, and confirmed UGIB with naso-gastric lavage. He required an emergent EGD, which revealed isolated gastric varices with evidence of recent bleeding but no active bleed. CT scan showed splenomegaly, varices around the spleen and stomach, a visibly patent splenic vein running through a pancreatic pseudocyst, and an unremarkable liver (See Figure 2). An ultrasound showed patent liver vessels with no abnormal flow patterns. GI service recommended evaluation for portal hypertension related to liver cirrhosis as well as Banti’s Syndrome (splenomegaly and portal hypertension without liver cirrhosis). Hepatology was consulted and performed a liver biopsy to fully rule out liver pathology {{as a source of}} portal hypertension. When all studies returned negative general surgery was consulted. General surgery felt that the etiology of UGIB was the pancreatic pseudocyst compression of the splenic vein causing left-sided portal hypertension and gastric variceal bleeding.

30|$|The first {{repair of}} a cardiac rupture {{following}} blunt trauma occurred in 1955; however, only {{a paucity of}} series reviewing the outcomes post-rupture have been undertaken since this initial case [1]. Mortality from cardiac rupture following blunt chest trauma {{has been reported to}} be as high as 81.3 % to 85 % [6, 7]. A 5 -year study of blunt cardiac rupture cases revealed that of the 32 cases reviewed, 20 presented in cardiac arrest (non-survivors), and of those who presented with vital signs, only 6 survived [5]. Another retrospective study of 160 autopsy cases showed that of the 40 fatalities from blunt chest trauma, approximately 5 [*]% made it to the hospital alive, with the majority dying at the scene (86 %) or during retrieval (approximately 8 %) [4]. Similar figures of 80 % early death have been reported in similar studies [1]. Shorr et al also reported a 100 % (39 / 39) unsuccessful resuscitative thoracotomy rate in presentations without vital signs [1]. Cardiac injury distribution following blunt chest trauma was widely varied in two large retrospective studies reviewed. Right atrial rupture accounted for 5 % and 40.6 %, left atrial rupture 10 % and 25 %, right ventricular rupture 15 % and 31.3 % and left ventricular rupture 10 % and 12.5 %, respectively [4, 5]. However, the literature reviewed described only three cases of cardiac rupture involving horses, with one case being mentioned by two separate reviews [1, 5]. No outcome regarding the twice-mentioned case was described. The second report, emphasising the use of post-mortem computed tomography (CT) imaging, described the fatal case of a 13 -year-old female who collapsed after being kicked by a pony. Resuscitative attempts were unsuccessful and the diagnosis was confirmed at post-mortem CT imaging, revealing a 3 -cm laceration of the left ventricle causing cardiac tamponade [1, 5, 6]. The third case, a 23 -year-old female, survived after suffering a 3 -cm laceration to the right atrium. This patient exhibited early classic signs of cardiac tamponade and was initially treated with pericardiocentesis and pericardial catheter insertion until definitive repair with <b>oversew</b> via sternotomy could be performed [8].|$|E

5000|$|In 1967, Matt Roberts, {{chief of}} the {{circulation}} department of the Washington University library, first documented the drawbacks of <b>oversewn</b> bindings. [...] It is especially threatening to books with acidic paper; the tight sewing in the gutter margin may cause shards of this paper, in its weakened, embrittled state, to tear and flake off. <b>Oversewn</b> bindings are also often very tightly bound, so {{it is difficult for}} books' spines to open fully and lie flat. From a conservation standpoint, a primary concern about <b>oversewing</b> is that it is essentially irreversible. In order for an <b>oversewn</b> text block to be re-bound again, more of the inside margin has to be cut or ground off. Some librarians believe that it is a hasty practice which favors cost over artifactual value, as original bindings may potentially be restorable.|$|R

40|$|There {{are only}} a few reports in the {{veterinary}} literature describing the use of stapling equipment and techniques for pulmonary surgery. These reports indicate that complications associated with these procedures are minimal. Although pulmonary lobectomy procedures originally described independent isolation and ligation of the hilar vessels, it became apparent that, {{with the use of the}} smaller staples, especially the ones designed for vascular use, this was unnecessary. Therefore, en bloc hilar stapling is the procedure of choice. This makes the surgical procedure extremely quick to perform. Similarly, there is no indication to routinely <b>oversew</b> staple lines when performing a partial lobectomy. This is a tedious procedure and may actually increase the chance of air leakage. If point areas of leakage do occur, these can be independently occluded either with sutures or individual vascular clips. Selecting the correct size of TA stapler and staples to create the correct length of staple line is critical. It is important that all the tissue to be ligated lie comfortably within the staple line. It is better to use a stapler that is too long and collect the extra staples on a sponge than to use one that is too short that results in leakage from nonstapled tissue. In general, the 4. 8 -mm staples should not be used for pulmonary surgery in the dog and cat. They do not compress the tissue enough to prevent leakage. For most complete lobectomies, where the hilus of the lung can be adequately isolated, the TA 30 V 3 is the stapler of choice. When performing a partial lobectomy, a longer stapler is often required. If a TA 55 or TA 90 is necessary, it should be used with 3. 5 -mm staples. Even though stapling techniques have made pulmonary surgical procedures safe, easy, and quick to perform, they are not totally free of problems and complications. Experience in the use of the equipment is essential, as is good surgical judgment as to when to use or not to use these techniques. The absence of reported clinical complications, either short- or long-term, attests to the success of these techniques.

50|$|Most library binders use {{a method}} of {{bookbinding}} called <b>oversewing</b> to secure the volumes. <b>Oversewing</b> involves cutting or milling off the spines of the volumes, creating a block of loose pages. Then the loose sheets are combined into small units or signatures, which are secured with overlock stitching. The separate signatures then get sewn together, creating a single book block. Often a piece of linen is glued to the book block spine for further support. The spine of the volume sometimes is rounded and backed to keep the spine from caving in. But if the paper of the volume is too fragile, or the book block is too thick, the spine is left flat. The book block is placed in a sturdy cover or case, with special paper covering the inside covers (Boardway 1993).|$|R

40|$|Librarians {{and library}} binders {{are no longer}} always able to specify the traditional, {{superior}} <b>oversewing</b> method for binding library books. This problem emerged due to economic pressures within several related industries resulting in a proliferation of economic, but often inferior, binding technologies. As libraries are only approximately ten to fifteen percent of total publishers 2 ̆ 7 sales, books cannot specifically {{be made for the}} library market. In addition, many of the new binding technologies yield books with insufficient inner margin space to prebind or rebind books utilizing the <b>oversewing</b> binding method. And finally, librarians, also faced with tight budgets, must find economic ways to bind library books. This study concentrated on investigating and determining the merits of two alternate binding methods PVA double fanning and cleat-lacing and quantitatively comparing them with <b>oversewing.</b> The binding performance comparison tests were for both openability and strength (internal) properties, two main concerns for the rigors of library use. It was hypothesized that 1) all three binding methods would yield different openability and binding strengths as the methods of fastening pages together work on different principles, 2) the strengths would be significantly influenced by two more main factors, paper and condition, and 3) the interactions of these three main factors (binding method, paper, condition) could significantly vary binding strength. Three different papers were tested: uncoated, dull, and glossy. The three conditions were new, used, and aged. Twenty-seven combinations of books were bound according to Class A, LBI Standard, specifications (except method of affixing pages) for testing. A new precise method of measuring openability was devised for this study called 2 ̆ 2 Openability Photocopy Test. 2 ̆ 2 The results, in general, proved that the PVA double fanned books opened better than both the cleat-laced and <b>oversewn</b> books, across all papers tested. The cleat-laced books opened slightly better than the <b>oversewn</b> volumes. Both <b>oversewn</b> and cleat-laced books were more consistent for openability than the PVA double fanned, across all papers. The Martini Page Pull and Flex Tester was used to determine binding strengths by recording the force necessary (pounds per linear inch) to pull single pages out of a binding. The strength test results were analyzed by the statistical method called 2 ̆ 2 analysis of variance. 2 ̆ 2 It was found that the critical (statistically significant) factors were the two main factors of binding method and paper but not condition. And it was further determined that the two-way interactions of paper/binding method, paper/condition, and binding method/condition also all vary the binding strengths significantly. The three-way multiple interaction effect, paper/binding method/condition, was not significant. All book combinations tested yielded binding strengths which exceeded 4. 0 lbs/in, a rating of 2 ̆ 2 Excellent 2 ̆ 2 by the Library Binding Institute. However, there was great variability above this level (a range of 4. 26 to 8. 50 lbs/in). In general, the PVA double fanned bindings had the greatest strengths, <b>oversewn</b> second best, and cleat-laced books had the lowest scores. Uncoated paper yielded books with the greatest strengths, dull paper second, and glossy paper gave the least binding strengths. Particular combinations of paper, binding method, and condition (two-way interactions) caused variations in binding strengths so the general conclusions did not always hold true. The results of the openability and strength tests were graphed and categorized in data tables. These graphs and tables can be used as an Optimum Binding Method Index for openability and strength for books of the dimensions and qualities set forth in this study. Librarians and library binders may now make more informed decisions in selecting a proper alternate binding method for a book, cleat-lacing or PVA double fanning...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether the use of staple line reinforcement (SLR) reduces staple line complications (SLC). Mechanical staple lines are essential for gastrointestinal surgery such as bariatric surgery. However, SLC, such as bleeding and leakage, still occur. The purposes of this study were to provide quantitative evidence on the relative efficacy of gastric SLR and to compare the rates of effectiveness of three commonly used methods. Methods A search of the medical literature in English lan-guage journals identified studies from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2013, using the following reinforcement types: (1) no reinforcement, (2) <b>oversewing,</b> (3) a biocompatible glycolide copolymer, and (4) bovine pericardium after gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomies. Types of reinforcement were compared using a random-effects model. Results This meta-analysis reviewed 16, 967 articles, extracting data on 56, 309 patients concerning leak and 41, 864 patients concerning bleeding. Over 40 % of patients had no reinforcement, resulting in the highest leak rate (2. 75 %) and bleed rate (3. 45 %). Overall, reinforcing with bovine peri-cardium had the lowest leak (1. 28 %) and bleed (1. 23 %) rates. Suture <b>oversewing</b> was better than no reinforcement but not as effective as bovine pericardium for leak (2. 45 %) and bleed (2. 69 %) rates. Buttressing with a biocompatible glycolide copolymer resulted in the second highest leak rate (2. 61 %) and a bleed rate of 2. 48 % but had significantly lower bleed rates than no reinforcement. Conclusions SLR provided superior results for patients com-pared to no reinforcement for reducing SLC. Buttressing with bovine pericardium resulted in the most favorable outcomes. The effectiveness of different methods used to reinforce the staple line in gastric surgery does not appear to be equal. Keywords Staple lines. Staple line leak. Staple line bleed.

Patient demographics, hospital stay, pancreatic fistula incidence (> or = 30 ml amylase-rich fluid/day on/after postoperative day 10), perioperative morbidity, and follow-up after discharge were compared with our initial series of patients (treated October 2001 -May 2003) who underwent <b>oversewing</b> only (n = 20). Indications, patient demographics, blood loss, and tolerance of an oral diet were similar. There were four (20 %) pancreatic fistulas in the "oversewn" group and none in the anastomosis group (p < 0. 05). Nonsurgical morbidity, in-hospital stay, and follow-up were comparable in both groups...|$|R
