5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, {{they did not}} {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included the building <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fountain</b> of Qasim Pasha (1527), {{the restoration of the}} Pool of Raranj, and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538.

5|$|The city's {{industrial}} base {{continued to grow}} in the post-war era partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC. Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium. In 1974, with the addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fountain</b> {{at the tip of the}} Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed.

5|$|Worship {{of various}} river gods {{in the area}} dates to the Late Bronze Age, when the first {{settlements}} were founded along the Sava River. Taurisci associated their river goddess Adsullata with the Savus. Altars or inscriptions dedicated to the river-god Savus have been found {{at a number of}} locations along the river course, including at the Zelenci Pools where the Sava Dolinka rises, and a number of Roman settlements and castra built along the Via Pannonia, the Roman road running from Aquileia to the Danube. The settlements include Emona, Andautonia and Siscia (near modern-day Ljubljana, Velika Gorica and Sisak respectively) upstream of the Kupa River confluence, and Marsonia, itself built atop a prehistoric settlement, Cibalae, Sirmium and Singidunum (in modern-day Slavonski Brod, Vinkovci, Sremska Mitrovica and Belgrade) downstream of the Kupa. Besides the altar found at the Zelenci Pools, inscriptions and sites dedicated to Savus have been found in remains of Emona, Andautonia and Siscia. Several years after 1751 completion of the Robba Fountain in Ljubljana, the three male figures sculpted as parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fountain</b> were identified as statues of the river gods of Sava, Krka and Ljubljanica. In the early 20th century, the fountain was named the Fountain of Three Carniolan Rivers.|$|E
