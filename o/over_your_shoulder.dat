The magazine included Balance of Power in its list of [...] "Our Favorite Games", calling it [...] "an impressive recreation of the world's geopolitical landscape ... call one too many bluffs and you'll see the chilling message You have ignited a nuclear war". Orson Scott Card, however, wrote in his review of the game that Crawford—"the best designer of simulation games I've seen"—was [...] "leaning <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulder</b> and bullying you into playing the game his way. He has a sweet delusion {{that as long as the}} United States is very nice and doesn't do anything to offend them, the Russians will go home. And if you don't play that way, why, he'll stop the game with a nasty remark about how the world was just destroyed by nuclear war". He added that since no nuclear war had been fought Crawford could not know what would cause one, and [...] "there are a lot of experts who claim that the Soviets seem to behave a lot nicer when we stand up to them than when we disarm", but that [...] " [...] is so sure he's right that Balance of Power isn't a game, it's propaganda".|$|E

6000|$|Ah, it's a great responsibility--particularly {{with that}} old cat Amoore {{looking at the}} lists <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulder.</b> And such a {{shocking}} thing happened last summer!

Here is your bandolier, slip that on first; there is your coat and hat. Now I will put the sling of the rifle <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulder.</b> There you are, complete, a Boer of the first water! I will carry the bottles and the bread.

6000|$|... "The Norfolk folk {{had been}} {{entertaining}} me on Tuesday with {{the account of}} a young savage Iroquois, Choctaw, or Virginian, who has lately been making a little noise in our quarter of the globe. He is an offshoot of that disreputable family of Esmond, Castlewood, of whom all the men are gamblers and spendthrifts, and all the women--well, I shan't say the word, lest Lady Ailesbury should be looking <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Both the late lords, my father told me, were in his pay, and the last one, a beau of Queen Anne's reign, from a viscount advanced to be an earl through the merits and intercession of his notorious old sister Bernstein, late Tusher, nee Esmond--a great beauty, too, of her day, a favourite of the old Pretender. She sold his secrets to my papa, who paid her for them; and being nowise particular in her love for the Stuarts, {{came over to the}} august Hanoverian house at present reigning over us. 'Will Horace Walpole's tongue never stop scandal?' says your wife <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulder.</b> I kiss your ladyship's hand. I am dumb. The Bernstein is a model of virtue. She had no good reasons for marrying her father's chaplain. Many of the nobility omit the marriage altogether. She wasn't ashamed of being Mrs. Tusher, and didn't take a German Baroncino for a second husband, whom nobody out of Hanover ever saw. The Yarmouth bears no malice. Esther and Vashti are very good friends, and have been cheating each other at Tunbridge at cards all the summer.|$|E
60|$|THESE dry {{details are}} of {{importance}} in one particular. They {{give me an}} opportunity of introducing one of the Mississippi's oddest peculiarities,--that of shortening its length from time to time. If you will throw a long, pliant apple-paring <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulder,</b> it will pretty fairly shape itself into an average section of the Mississippi River; that is, the nine or ten hundred miles stretching from Cairo, Illinois, southward to New Orleans, the same being wonderfully crooked, with a brief straight bit here and there at wide intervals. The two hundred-mile stretch from Cairo northward to St. Louis {{is by no means}} so crooked, that being a rocky country which the river cannot cut much.|$|E
50|$|Other {{than the}} use of leis on Lei Day, they are {{incorporated}} in special occasions such as graduations, weddings and birthdays. The tradition was brought over by Polynesian voyagers sailing from Tahiti. In the past, maile leis, {{known as one of}} the most sacred leis, was used in peace agreements between opposing peoples. In addition to wearing the lei as a source of beautification, the lei was a way to distinguish groups of people from one another. The lei comes with a set of unspoken rules such as wearing it <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> not removing it while around the person that gave you the lei, and refusing a lei is seen as disrespectful. Over the years the lei has grown to become an accepted symbol of Hawaii that greets many visitors each year.|$|R

"It {{were best}} that you fetched those you {{travelled}} in away, or rather that you returned unnoticed; and, {{as it is}} getting dark now, this can doubtless be managed; and, when you sally out, place that cloak <b>over</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> to hide <b>your</b> dress as a servitor, {{and go to the}} other inn, the Falcon. Say, there, that you are staying for a few days in Dunbar, having come here on business with me; and that I bade you go there, so that I might know where to send for you, if necessary.
