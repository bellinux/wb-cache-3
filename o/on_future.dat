2500|$|In many cases, {{options are}} traded <b>on</b> <b>futures,</b> {{sometimes}} called simply [...] "futures options". A put is {{the option to}} sell a futures contract, and a call is the option to buy a futures contract. For both, the option strike price is the specified futures price at which the future is traded if the option is exercised. Futures are often used since they are delta one instruments. Calls and options <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> may be priced similarly to those on traded assets by using {{an extension of the}} Black-Scholes formula, namely the Black–Scholes model for <b>futures.</b> For options <b>on</b> <b>futures,</b> where the premium is not due until unwound, the positions are commonly referred to as a fution, as they act like options, however, they settle like futures.|$|R

5|$|Chris Beveridge's {{review for}} Fandom Post was highly {{positive}} towards the anime series, {{calling it a}} dark horse contender {{as one of their}} top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series for breaking the supernatural approach other works usually take and liked the potential impact it could have <b>on</b> <b>future</b> events. However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect. Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been great if a different director or screenwriting was hired.|$|E
5|$|Controversy has {{continued}} {{in recent years}} with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House, a neo-Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board, {{to make way for}} the new Bath Bus Station.

As a result of the changes the city's status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009. The decision was made to let Bath keep its status, but UNESCO has asked to be consulted <b>on</b> <b>future</b> phases of the Riverside development, saying that the density and volume of buildings in the second and third phases of the development need to be reconsidered.

The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit.

The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras <b>on</b> <b>future</b> weather satellites.

The boiler was intended to become a standard component for use <b>on</b> <b>future</b> SECR locomotive designs, thereby reducing building times and improving organisation at the works. The size was constrained by the heavier axle-loading of Maunsell’s proposed 2-6-4 tank locomotive variant of the Nclass, the Kclass, and was consequently smaller than was otherwise possible on the 2-6-0 chassis. The need to reduce overall weight also meant that the latter would feature lightly braced frames.|$|E
