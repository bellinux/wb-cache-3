40|$|Pur po se: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the expression of different nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) in primary and recurrent pterygia and to investigate the probable role of any nitric oxide synthase on pterygium recurrence. Ma te ri als and Met hod: Specimens of 40 primary pterygia and 10 recurrent pterygia excised during pterygium surgery were included in the study. Also, 15 normal conjunctiva of medial limbus obtained from patients free of pterygia and removed during other <b>ophthalmologic</b> <b>surgeries</b> formed the control group. Specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for general histological and morphologic evaluation. The distribution of n-NOS, e-NOS and i-NOS were analyzed using indirect immunoperoxidase staining. Re sults: Histological evaluation of specimens revealed that the epithelium in primary and recurrent pterygia groups was thicker compared to that in the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in both primary pterygium and control groups, immunoreactivity was positive for all NOSs in both epithelium and connective tissue. For recurrent pterygium group, NOS immunoreactivity could be detected moderately for n-NOS in the epithelium and weakly for e-NOS in both epithelium and connective tissue. However, in recurrent pterygium samples, i-NOS immunoreactivity was lacking in both epithelium and connective tissue. Dis cus si on: These data are the first to demonstrate that NOS expression may differ between primary and recurrent pterygia. Meanwhile, continuous expression of n-NOS with suppression of i-NOS and e-NOS may be an important step in the recurrence process of pterygia. (Turk J Ophthalmol 2012; 42 : 166 - 71...|$|R

40|$|A {{shock wave}} is a {{pressure}} wave with high amplitude and a velocity above sound. Man {{is exposed to}} shock waves (SWs) in connection with trauma, e. g. explosions and high-energy missiles and medical treatments such as extracorporeal lithotripsy (ESWL). A major consequence of SWs is blood vessel injury. The ensuing detachment of endothelial cells (EC) and rupture of basal membranes partially explain the hemorrhages, thrombus formation and tissue edema, seen after SW exposure. Additional effects on endothelial cell functions are, however, conceivable in order to explain the panorama of injury, which might proceed to multiple organ failure. The flyer-plate technique is an established method to detonate explosives. This thesis describes how the flyer-plate technique was modified to expose cell monolayers to precise SWs, in ordinary cell culture wells. Mean peak amplitudes generated were 23 MPa or 104 MPa, depending on the experimental setting. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used for cell experiments. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in SW injury we assessed the role of two suggested factors, viz. cavitation bubbles and reactive oxygen species (ROS). HUVECs exposed to SWs only, could not be distinguished from controls with regards to morphology or cell viability. Yet, a sub-lytic cell membrane injury was indicated. HUVEC cultures exposed to SWs plus cavitation (SWC) exhibited discrete endothelial lesions. Within the lesion area cell detachment, cell membrane damage and cell death was observed. A dose- response relationship between cavitation and cell injury was demonstrated. No protective effects of ROS scavengers were shown. To gain further insight into the pathophysiology of SW tissue injury we assessed the effects of SWs or SWC on the adhesion molecules P-selectin, E-selectin and ICAM- 1 as well as cytoskeletal organization. A previous study had shown that H 2 O 2 can induce reversible disassembly of tubulin and vimentin filaments. No significant effects of SWs per se, on the studied parameters, were observed. A sequential induction of P- selectin, E-selectin and ICAM- 1 expression was shown in samples exposed to SWC. The induction of E- selectin and ICAM- 1 was preceded by nuclear translocation of the NFkappaB subunit p 65, implicating transcriptional regulation of this response. Destruction of actin, tubulin and vimentin filaments was seen in cells within the main lesion area. Cells peripheral to this area displayed disassembly of dense peripheral bands and formation of actin stress fibers, implying enhanced monolayer permeability in this region. Finally, we studied the cytoskeletal reorganization in relation to endothelial regeneration after SWC injury. It was shown that endothelial lesions, caused by SWC, exhibited impaired endothelial regeneration rate compared to mechanically produced lesions used as controls. This SW effect {{could be related to}} hampered cytoskeletal redistribution of tubulin- and actin filaments at the lesion border. In conclusion the flyer-plate technique can be used to expose cell monolayers to reproducible SWs. Our experimental model separates the effects of SWs from the effects of SWC. SWs per se caused cell membrane injury without affecting cell viability. Endothelial cell detachment and lytic cell injury, previously described in relation to explosions, high-energy missile trauma, laser angioplasty, <b>ophthalmologic</b> laser <b>surgery</b> and ESWL, was, however, linked to the generation of cavitation. Finally, SWC lesions were associated with a pro-inflammatory reaction as well as impaired endothelial regeneration rate, which may be attributed to changes in cytoskeletal functions...|$|R
40|$|When the {{eye socket}} {{is exposed to}} severe blunt trauma the {{pressure}} in the socket increases. As a protection mechanism to prevent the eye from disruption, the thin bony walls surrounding the eye fracture. Such a fracture is called Blow Out Fracture (BOF). It {{is well known that}} a significant BOF needs surgical treatment otherwise it may lead to double vision and aesthetic deformities such as sunken eye. Furthermore, small BOF are not considered to need any surgical treatment and will heal without any remaining symptoms. It is highly important to differentiate which patients need to be operated on or which do not. This {{has been the subject of}} several studies over the past few decades. The overall aim of this thesis has been to identify which patients with BOF need an operation and which do not require an operation to prevent functional and aesthetic disorders. In paper I we found that the amount of displaced orbital tissue (herniation) and the relative change in the orbital volume due to trauma may be insufficient predictors to use when differentiating if a patient needs surgical or non-surgical treatment. In Paper II we concluded that there is a clear agreement that surgery within 24 h is needed when motility of the eye is hindered. Regarding the management of the remaining patients with BOF, there are considerable differences in opinion between the surgeons, specialties and countries, despite existing recommendations. In paper III we found that in the case of entrapment with restriction of eye motility, there is a need for surgical treatment performed by an experienced surgeon as soon as possible, but not necessarily within 24 h. Furthermore, we found that double vision due to eye motility restriction caused by impingement is not an <b>ophthalmologic</b> emergency and <b>surgery</b> is recommended if the diplopia and eye motility is not improved over time. We also found that the surgical reduction of all impinged or entrapped tissue is at least as important as surgical timing for the outcome. In paper IV-V we performed prospective cohort and controlled randomized studies on patients with BOF. We found a significant correlation between CT scan findings on presentation to aesthetic outcome, namely patients who developed cosmetic problems compared to those patients who did not develop any cosmetic problems. We could therefore conclude that BOF patients with the following findings have a substantial risk for the development of cosmetic deformities and surgical treatment needs to be considered: •	Isolated inferior wall fracture with a herniation < 1. 0 ml and a fracture area ≥ 2. 3 cm 2. • Isolated inferior wall fracture with a herniation ≥ 1. 0 ml and a fracture distance from inferior orbital rim to the posterior edge of the fracture ≥ 3. 0 cm. • Inferomedial fracture with a herniation ≥ 0. 9 ml. We also found that double vision in BOF, without eye motility limitation, is due to edema and it is not an indication for surgery. The statement that, sunken eye (enophthalmus) will lead to double vision could not be supported by our data. On the contrary, none of the patients with late enophthalmus had double vision and none of patients with double vision had enophthalmus. Furthermore, we found that delayed correction of BOF appears to have the same aesthetic outcome as early corrections, if the surgical correction is performed immediately after the aesthetic deformities are discovered. Therefore, BOF patients require a close follow-up of, as a suggestion 1 and 3 months post-injury. In this project, we have provided an algorithm based on available evidence to predict which patients with BOF benefit from surgical vs non-surgical treatment. In summary, when deciding whether to operate or not on a BOF, it is important to recognize that a surgical indication upon functional impairment is limited to muscle motility restriction due to entrapment or impingement. Other functional impairment is generally benign and will resolve over time. Regarding the decision making around surgical treatment due to aesthetic deformities, patient´s involvement is crucial since the patient´s experience of the importance of facial asymmetry is individual and this may differ from the surgeons´ opinion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In 2001, the {{observed}} annual mortality from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in Switzerland increased {{from less than}} 1. 5 to 2. 6 per million inhabitants. An underlying cause could not be identified. Methods To analyse potential risk factors for sCJD in Switzerland, close relatives of 69 sCJD-patients and 224 frequency age-matched controls were interviewed in a case-control study using a standardised questionnaire. 135 potential risk factors including socio-demographics, medical history, occupation and diet were analysed by logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and education. Results sCJD patients {{were more likely to}} have travelled abroad, worked at an animal laboratory, undergone invasive dental treatment, orthopaedic surgery, <b>ophthalmologic</b> <b>surgery</b> after 1980, regular GP visits, taken medication regularly, and consumed kidney. No differences between patients and controls were found for residency, family history, and exposure to environmental and other dietary factors. Conclusion Although some factors were significantly more frequent among sCJD-cases, this study did not reveal specific explanations for the increased incidence of deaths due to sporadic CJD observed in Switzerland since 2001. Results have to be interpreted with caution due to multiple testing and possible recall bias in association with a long incubation period. The most plausible reason for the increase in Swiss sCJD cases after 2000 is an improved case ascertainment. Therefore, underreporting of cases might well have occurred before the year 2001, and the "real" yearly incidence of sCJD might not be lower than, but rather above 2 per million inhabitants. </p...|$|E

Results Searches conducted from 2006 to 2011 resulted in identification of thirty-five Canadian businesses currently marketing various kinds of medical travel. The research project began with what seemed to be the straightforward goal of establishing how many medical tourism companies are based in Canada. Refinement of categories resulted in the identification of eighteen businesses fitting the category of what most researchers would identify as medical tourism companies. Seven other businesses market regional, cross-border health services available in the United States and intranational travel to clinics in Canada. In contrast to medical tourism companies, they do not market holiday tours in addition to medical care. Two companies occupy a narrow market niche and promote testing for CCSVI and “Liberation therapy” for multiple sclerosis. Three additional companies offer bariatric surgery and cosmetic surgery at facilities in Mexico. Four businesses offer health insurance products intended {{to cover the cost of}} obtaining privately financed health care in the U. S. These businesses also help their clients arrange treatment beyond Canada’s borders. Finally, one medical travel company based in Canada markets health services primarily to U. S. citizens.

40|$|The book is {{organised}} in {{two main}} parts: Part I and Part II and into several chapters. The Part I includes two chapters. The first one, by the Editor, deals with basic theory, which is described following the historical steps by eminent scientists, from Herschel, to Nobili, Melloni, Stefan, Boltzmann, Planck and others. The radiation mechanisms {{with the most}} important parameters, which {{play a key role}} in acquisition and interpretation of thermal images are recalled and discussed. A section is devoted to detectors used for infrared technology. The main steps in detectors development following the technological progress are also drawn. The second chapter is by Roberto Rinaldi of the Infrared Training Center (ITC) by Flir Systems in Milan (Italy). This chapter is concerned with an overview of infrared imaging devices from the first prototype developed in 1958 to the multitude of models, which are today available. The historical evolution of the infrared technology is traced within the key features of each model. In particular, some basic characteristics and performance are described which may help the reader in the choice of the most appropriate device for the specific application. Part II is subdivided into four sections and many chapters. The first section regards applications to medicine (Chap. 1) and veterinary (Chap. 2). The study of the temperature of the human body has been associated with health as far back as the 1 st century BC, when Hypocrites, (the father of medicine), used the sense of touch to skin surface temperature anomalies and to determine the health of his patients. Still today, monitoring the body temperature variation, aides in both diagnosis and treatment planning. Chapter one was prepared by Boris G. Vainer of the Institute of Semiconductor Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This chapter reports on the IRT’s state of art in medicine with methodological approaches and a variety of applications such as in the diagnosis of breast cancer, in <b>ophthalmologic</b> <b>surgery,</b> in cardiovascular surgery, in the visualization of ischemic tissues and in many others. Chapter two presents application and use of infrared thermography in farm animals and veterinary medicine. This chapter was supplied by Petr Kunc and Ivana Knizkova of the Institute of Animal Science - University of Prague (The Czech Republic). The addressed areas include reproduction, thermoregulation, animal welfare and the milking process. The application of IRT to veterinary medicine is particularly useful to predict inflammation since, contrary to human beings, animals cannot reveal any symptom before the illness has become important. Section two includes a chapter on the use of Infrared thermography in foodstuff conservation by Klaus Gottschalk of the Leibniz-Institut für Agrartechnik Potsdam (Germany). It is shown the usefulness of IRT to control the conservation conditions of fruits and vegetables. The main advantage of using an infrared device lies in the possibility to control and improve the climate, which is essential in prolonging the shelf life of crops. Section three regards applications of IRT to industrial engineering. The first chapter, prepared by Giovanni M. Carlomagno of the Department of Aerospace Engineering - University of Naples Federico II (Italy), is an overview on IRT to thermo-fluid-dynamics. After recalling the first historical attempts in measuring heat transfer coefficients, this chapter describes the most useful heat flux sensors, supplies information about thermal restoration of data and shows several examples of convective heat transfer measurements in complex fluid flows, ranging from natural convection to hypersonic regime. The attention of chapter two is focused on the application of IRT to combustion. This contribution is by Christophe Allouis and Rocco Pagliara of the Combustion Institute CNR in Naples (Italy). It is demonstrated the usefulness of an infrared imaging system for understanding fluid-dynamics phenomena associated with combustion processes in turbine burners. The third chapter by Ralph A. Rotolante of Vicon Infrared in Boxborough, MA (USA) regards the use of IRT for nondestructive inspection purposes. The main pulse and lockin techniques are described with some application examples including also the inspection of real aircraft parts. Indeed, a remote imaging system offers many advantages over other methodologies since it is fast and two-dimensional with safeguard of the part integrity. Section four is concerned with the application of IRT in architecture and civil engineering. This is a relevant topic for infrared thermography applications after Building Regulation (2007) for Conservation of Fuel and Energy. A chapter by Ermanno Grinzato of CNR-ITC in Padua (Italy) reports some examples of structural analysis aided by IR thermography. In particular, it is stressed the impressive help, which is given to the comfort monitoring by the distributed temperature map measured by an infrared device. The attention goes also to the possibility, using a novel method, to “see” the environmental main quantities as air temperature, relative humidity and velocity, obtained from thermographic readings. Besides those herein described, an infrared imaging system can be advantageously used for many other applications. Infrared thermography is an excellent condition monitoring tool to assist in the reduction of maintenance costs on mechanical equipment. One of the biggest problems in mechanical systems is heat generated by friction, cooling degradation, material loss or blockages. The infrared technique allows for the monitoring of temperatures and thermal patterns, on a wide variety of equipments including pumps, motors, bearings, pulleys, fans, drives, conveyors etc, and while the equipment is online and running under full load. Information acquired from thermographic images enable a company to predict equipment failure and to plan corrective actions before a costly shutdown, equipment damage, or personal injury occurs. What it is more, the inspection can be performed far away from any dangerous condition without additional costs in terms of workers health care. However, it has to be pointed out that infrared thermography is still not completely exploited. It could be employed in a lot of other novel applications; it is only a matter of fantasy and skill...|$|E
