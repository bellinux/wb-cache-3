5|$|After Neil Bartlett's {{discovery}} in 1962 that xenon can form chemical compounds, {{a large number}} of xenon compounds have been discovered and described.

5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2.

It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
5|$|After the {{withdrawal}} from the Kingdom of Hungary, the Mongol forces halted at Sarai (now Russia) on the Volga River where their leader, Batu Khan set up his own capital. Henceforth, the steppes between the rivers Dnieper and Danube were {{under the influence of}} the Mongols of the Volga, known as the Golden Horde. From the 1260s, a relative of Batu, Nogai Khan settled at Isaccea on the Lower Danube and became the absolute master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighboring</b> regions.

5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighboring</b> electric grid.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighboring</b> districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E
5|$|The Turkic-speaking Bulgars {{arrived in}} the territories west of the river Dniester around 670.

They soon imposed their authority over some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighboring</b> tribes. The great variety in burial rites evidences the multi-ethnic character of the Bulgarian Empire. Even the Bulgars were divided in this respect; some of them practiced inhumation and others cremation. Initially, a sharp distinction existed between the Bulgars and their subjects, but the Slavicization of the Bulgars soon began.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} these four territories to be {{incorporated}} into Imerina was Fanongoavana, then a principality ruled by Andriampanarivofomanjaka. Continual threats to his kingdom's security led Andriampanarivofomanjaka to secretly travel to the Rova of Antananarivo to pledge submission to Andriamasinavalona. He was accompanied by seven advisers who eloquently communicated their master's willingness to acknowledge Andriamasinavalona as his king. Andriamasinavalona accepted this offer and sealed the union of their territories by marrying Andriampanarivofomanjaka to his sister, Ranavalontsimitovy. Andriampanarivofomanjaka then returned to his realm, announced the union to his people, and then spoke with the leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighboring</b> Bezanozano people to successfully persuade them to join the kingdom and benefit from Andriamasinavalona's protection.|$|E
5|$|Ernst {{had been}} a canon at Cologne since 1570. He had the support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighboring</b> Duke of Jülich and several allies within the Cathedral Chapter. Although {{supported}} by both the papacy and his influential father, a 1571 effort to secure for him the office of coadjutor of the electorate of Cologne had failed once Salentin had agreed {{to abide by the}} Trentine proceedings; as the coadjutor bishop, Ernst would have been well-positioned to present himself as Salentin's logical successor. Since then, however, he had advanced in other sees, becoming bishop of Liège, Freising and Hildesheim, important strongholds of Counter-Reformation Catholicism. He was a career cleric, not necessarily qualified to be an archbishop {{on the basis of his}} theological erudition, but by his family connections. His membership in several chapters extended the family influence, and his status as a prebendary gave him a portion of revenues from several cathedrals. He had been educated by Jesuits and the papacy considered collaboration with his family as a means to limit the spread of Lutheranism and Calvinism in the northern provinces.|$|E
5|$|Old Louisville is {{also home}} to the Ferguson Mansion, built by Edwin Hite Ferguson. Ferguson {{commissioned}} the Louisville architectural firm of Cobb and Dodd—the same firm responsible for designing the Seelbach Hotel and the new capitol building in Frankfort—to design his home in 1901. Construction of the mansion took four years (1901–1905) and cost $100,000, which was approximately ten times the cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighboring</b> Victorian homes. At the time, the mansion was the most expensive home in Louisville. In the 1920s, the Fergusons sold the home to the Pearson family, and it served as the Pearson Funeral Home until the mid-1970s. The house also provided the headquarters for John Y. Brown, Jr.'s successful 1979 gubernatorial campaign. In 1986, the mansion became the headquarters of The Filson Historical Society.|$|E

5|$|Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking}} for ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was {{produced}} {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded crucibles of beryllium, magnesia and graphite. To produce uranium metal, they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighboring</b> elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, uranium did not behave this way. In June 1942 they then tried reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They then tried aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E
5|$|The Ridwan-Farrukh-Turabay {{alliance}} {{treated the}} territories of Palestine and, at times, Transjordan, as hereditary fiefdoms. During troublesome periods, the three families would unite their forces to confront challenges from rebels or local rivals. The military relationship between them originated with {{the protection of}} the annual hajj caravan. When a particular governor was assigned the role of amir al-hajj, it would require him to depart from his sanjak for extended time periods. In order to protect their districts from Bedouin raids, tax evasion and personal property damage, departing governors normally entrusted their authority with the rulers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighboring</b> sanjak. For example, in 1589, Ridwan Pasha requested Assaf ibn Turabay to temporarily replace him as governor of Damascus, beginning a tradition that lasted well into the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{nuclear fission}} {{properties}} of berkelium {{are different from}} those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighboring</b> actinides curium and californium, and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Specifically, berkelium-249 has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of 710 barns for thermal neutrons, 1200 barns resonance integral, but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons. In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250. In principle, berkelium-249 can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a fast breeder reactor. Its critical mass is relatively high at 192kg; it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope.|$|E
