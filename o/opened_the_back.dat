This building, where the full overhaul of steam locomotives once took place, is most notable for its size. It is two football fields long and nearly three stories tall. However, {{it may be}} most notable for the words [...] "Be Careful," [...] standing some three feet tall, visible from nearly anywhere on {{the north end of}} the site. In 2009, the museum <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> Shop to the public for the first time, with an access ramp on the south end. Behind-the -Scenes tours and special events often feature a full Back Shop tour.|$|E

Shields IV, heir to a wealthy Du Pont executive, {{accompanied}} a friend to a house on Vernon Street in the Ingleside district {{to pick up a}} rug. Shields had <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the station wagon and was making room in the cargo area for the rug when he was shot repeatedly. A witness later testified that she saw a black man rushing up Vernon Street {{at the time of the}} shooting.

60|$|So {{saying he}} <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of {{his watch and}} exposed a girl's {{photograph}} pasted {{on the inside of}} the case. Corry Hutchinson gazed at it with admiration welling up in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|It was no easy job {{to get to}} the woodshed, for {{the wind}} was still blowing furiously. When they <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door of the Lodge the snow came {{swirling}} in, almost blinding them.|$|E

60|$|By {{the time}} he had {{finished}} his preparations and stowed all his electrical belongings in his various pockets, it was nearly midnight and the house was quiet. So Rob stole down stairs in his stocking feet and noiselessly <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door.|$|E
60|$|Not at first, but soon, {{little by}} little, the suspicion, wild and {{unreasonable}} as it was, stole into his brain. He drew out his watch with hands that almost balked him by their trembling, and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> case. There {{was a picture}} there--a photograph fixed to the inner side.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, {{when they}} were back in town, Keawe bade the {{boatswain}} wait for him at the corner, by the old calaboose, and went forward up the avenue alone to the door of his house.

60|$|It {{was night}} at Marygreen, {{and the rain}} of the {{afternoon}} {{showed no sign of}} abatement. About the time at which Jude and Arabella were walking the streets of Christminster homeward, the Widow Edlin crossed the green, and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door of the schoolmaster's dwelling, which she often did now before bedtime, to assist Sue in putting things away.|$|E
60|$|The {{children}} {{had been sent to}} bed, and Ella soon followed, though it was not yet ten o'clock. To gratify her passionate curiosity she now made her preparations, first getting rid of superfluous garments and putting on her dressing-gown, then arranging a chair in front of the table and reading several pages of Trewe's tenderest utterances. Then she fetched the portrait-frame to the light, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> took out the likeness, and set it up before her.|$|E
60|$|Left alone, Irene put {{her hand}} to the ribbon {{around her neck and}} drew from her bosom an old-fashioned oval gold locket, as big as any {{ordinary}} watch but thinner. She opened the front of the ease and kissed her mother's picture, as was her nightly custom. Then she <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and drew out a tightly folded wad of paper. This she carefully spread out before her, when it proved to be the old letter she had found in the book.|$|E

Another will be in readiness to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door, as soon as they return.|$|R

6000|$|... "Now for it," [...] whispered Jack. He <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door softly, and we darted out. A {{streak of}} pale {{light on the}} horizon {{indicated}} the approach of day. We tried {{to close the door}} behind us, but we heard the butler choke, gasp, and shout {{at the top of his}} voice, [...] "Hi! hallo!" [...] At the same instant the old dinner-gong sent a peal of horrible sound through the house, and we took to flight filled with unutterable terror.|$|E
6000|$|Just as {{they must}} have been {{starting}} for that [...] "one more run," [...] I <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door and fled into the night, with the bookful of banknotes in my bosom, the silver spoons in my pocket, and the cat in my arms. I threaded my way easily enough through the familiar obstacles in the backyard, and was out in the pitch darkness of the moor before I heard the second shock, and the crash which told me that the whole door had given way.|$|E
60|$|I {{handed him}} over the watch with some slight feeling of {{amusement}} in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> and examined the works, first with his naked eyes {{and then with a}} powerful convex lens. I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back.|$|E
50|$|The Super Controller is an {{accessory}} for the Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. It {{was released by}} Bandai and was a plastic clip-on device {{that was supposed to}} allow the player to have a better NES playing experience. The original NES controller could be inserted inside by snapping <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> Super Controller still allowed the player to use the original A, B, Start, and Select buttons on the NES controller; the only difference was an arcade stick-like knob that fit over the D-pad of the original NES controller.|$|R

60|$|He dropped {{softly to}} the ground again. Taking off his shoes, and putting them in his pockets, he ascended {{the two or three}} steps which led to the half-open back garden door. Arrived in the passage, he could just hear them talking upstairs. They were no doubt still absorbed in their troubles; he had only the servant to dread. The {{splashing}} of water in the kitchen informed him that she was safely occupied in washing. Slowly and softly he <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> parlour door, and stole across the room to the nurse's chair.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned away}} from the stove, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door, and walked with a more {{determined}} step through the passage to the sitting-room. But here he halted again on the threshold with a quick return of his old habits of caution. The door was slightly open; apparently his angry outbreak of an hour ago had not affected the spirits of his daughters, for he could hear their hilarious voices mingling with those of the strangers. They were evidently still fortune-telling, but this time it was the prophetic and divining accents of Mr. Rice addressed to Clementina which were now plainly audible.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{we are in}} the fields, {{clear of}} the house, keep close by my side, and even try to keep step with me. What you have to say, say NOW; there must be no talking to betray our position--we must go silently, and you'll have enough to do to {{exercise}} your eyes and ears. I shall stand between you and any attack, but I expect you to obey orders without hesitation." [...] He <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> door, motioned to Cato to pass out, followed him, locked the door behind them, and taking the negro's arm walked beside the low palings {{to the end of the}} garden, where they climbed the fence and stood upon the open field beyond.|$|E
