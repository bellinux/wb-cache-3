5|$|On August29, an area {{of weather}} {{developed}} directly into a tropical storm, skipping the tropical depression stage. Katrina steadily intensified as it headed west-northwest, gradually turning to the northwest. It peaked in intensity on September3 as a Category4 hurricane with winds of , the second highest of the season. Katrina then headed westward and rapidly weakened. It was downgraded into a tropical storm on September5 and a depression on September6. The last advisory was issued on September7 when Katrina dissipated. Although the hurricane brought Category3-equivalent winds to Socorro Island on September2, no damage was reported there <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the current}} owner Charles Spencer professes to have never {{witnessed}} a ghost at Althorp <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else,</b> {{over the years}} numerous ghostly sightings {{have been reported in}} the mansion. In the mid 19th century the Dean of Lincoln was invited to stay at the property by Fredrick, 4th Earl Spencer. He complained the following morning that during the night a figure dressed as a groom (believed to be the ghost of the deceased servant of the 3rd Earl) had entered his room holding candles and checking that they were snuffed out around the bed. Margaret Douglas-Home professed to being aware of a ghost of a girl with grey slippers in the gallery.|$|E
25|$|The Nuenonne had no {{permanent}} settlements at Sullivans Cove, <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> in Tasmania, living as nomadic hunter-gatherers.

60|$|It must {{be owned}} that Mr. Warrington {{continued}} to be witty the next morning. He sent a note to Mr. Will begging to know whether he was for a ride to town <b>or</b> <b>anywheres</b> <b>else.</b> If he was for London, that he would friten the highwaymen on Hounslow Heath, and look a very genteel figar at the Chocolate House. Which letter, I fear, Mr. Will received with his usual violence, requesting the writer to go to some place--not Hounslow.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the final}} EIS, (released on September 15, 2016) the flight plans were still unclear, with only long term 2050 (international expansion) flight paths outlined.

25|$|The {{earliest}} Résistance organisations had {{no contact}} with the western Allies, and received no material aid from London <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else.</b> Consequently, most focused on generating nationalist propaganda through the distribution of underground newspapers. Many of the major movements, such as Défense de la France, were centred around their newspapers. Even after they became more intensively activist, propaganda and the cultivation of positive morale remained, {{until the very end}} of the war, their most important concerns.|$|E
25|$|As far as Lange is concerned, he was {{the biggest}} murderer I have ever known. To {{write a book about}} him would {{definitely}} not be enough. As he is dead, it is no use talking about him. I would, however, mention {{that he was one of}} the most notorious anti-Semites in the 20th century. He hated Jews so much that he could not look at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several years later, he parted {{ways with}} the Delaware General Assembly which had passed a {{resolution}} asking Delaware's congressmen to vote against any extension of slavery. Horsey did not feel U.S. Congress {{had the right to}} prohibit slavery in Missouri, <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> in the Louisiana Purchase, and so supported the Missouri Compromise. Understanding the unpopularity of this position he did not seek reelection when his term ended. During the 16th Congress, he served as Chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{club was}} {{described}} by Charles Graves, writing of London clubs in Leather Armchairs (1963), as [...] "the only one in London, <b>or</b> possibly <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> in the world, which has a separate room - and a large one at that - devoted solely to backgammon".|$|R
6000|$|But I {{will add}} {{one or two}} remarks on this point also.

50|$|There {{were also}} discussions between the Duke and Danti about {{building}} a canal to place Florence in communication with both the Mediterranean and the Adriatic. However, this grandiose plan never got underway before Cosimo's death in 1574. The following year Cosimo's son, Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici, forced Danti to leave Florence (in late September 1575) on an uncertain morals charge. It is not known precisely why Francesco exiled Danti, but the Dominican had no trouble finding work <b>or</b> patrons <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> in Italy, although he never returned to Florence before his death.|$|R
25|$|The {{first major}} test of West's {{political}} outlook was the Bolshevik Revolution. Many {{on the left}} saw it {{as the beginning of}} a new, better world, {{and the end of the}} crimes of capitalism. West regarded herself as a member of the left, having attending Fabian socialist summer schools as a girl. But to West, both the Revolution and the revolutionaries were suspect. Even before the Bolsheviks took power in October 1917, West expressed her doubts that events in Russia could serve as a model for socialists in Britain <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

25|$|Neither {{sentinel}} {{lymph node}} biopsy nor other diagnostic tests should be performed to evaluate early, thin melanoma, including melanoma in situ, T1a melanoma or T1b melanoma ≤ 0.5mm. People with these conditions are unlikely to have the cancer spread to their lymph nodes <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> and already have a 97% 5-year survival rate. Because of these things, sentinel {{lymph node biopsy}} is unnecessary health care for them. Furthermore, baseline blood tests and radiographic studies should not be performed only based on identifying this kind of melanoma, as there are more accurate tests for detecting cancer and these tests have high false-positive rates. To potentially correct false positives, gene expression profiling {{may be used as}} auxiliary testing for ambiguous and small lesions.|$|E
5000|$|SRE's format {{was not so}} much {{a format}} as a hybrid of formats.

While the PAMS jingles were the resung version of those heard on WABC in New York City, the high-power [...] "bannerline" [...] news presentation had been lifted from WFUN in Miami, Florida and the DJs were using the heavy echo and the forced approach of stations such as KBOX in Dallas, Texas.|$|R
5000|$|I {{of course}} never {{intended}} my term to imply policies like capital account liberalization (...I quite consciously excluded that), monetarism, supply-side economics, or a minimal state (getting the state out of welfare provision and income redistribution), which I {{think of as}} the quintessentially neoliberal ideas. If that is how the term is interpreted, then we can all enjoy its wake, although let us at least have the decency to recognize that these ideas have rarely dominated thought in Washington and certainly never commanded a consensus there <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> much <b>else...</b>|$|R

25|$|Upon arrival, the sheriff's deputies {{sealed off}} the spring with crime-scene tape. Ben's tanks, wet suit and other diving {{equipment}} were not present {{and there were}} no signs of a struggle near his truck <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> he could have been. His wallet, with almost $700 in cash, and cell phone were in the cab of his truck; dive logs showed that he had explored the cave and a map he made was also found. At the Santa Rosa Beach house officers found his dog, hungry from having been unfed for two days. Based on these circumstances, police and dive shop employees assumed that he had never resurfaced and had in all probability drowned somewhere in the cave trying to get out. Cadaver dogs alerted on the water surface, further supporting that theory.|$|E
25|$|Les Baigneuses is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 105 x 171cm (41.3 by 67.3 inches), signed Albert Gleizes and dated 1912, lower left. This work, painted {{at the outset}} of 1912, represents a series of naked elegant women at various points in the landscape foreground, their reflections along with the blue of the sky echoing off the water at the lower edge of the canvas. Beyond the bathers can be observed protruding rock-like formations or boulders—with highlights of primary color—that appear to espouse elements of the foreground. Above these cliffs are found several deciduous woody plants of the genus Populus. Though native to many areas of the Northern Hemisphere, the Poplar, with its fastigiate branches tapered towards the top, is especially iconic of the western suburbs of Paris (la banlieue ouest) where Gleizes lived, 24 Avenue Gambetta, Courbevoie. The Gleizes family moved to Avenue Gambetta in 1887. Towards the end of the 19th century and extending through the early 20th century, Courbevoie witnessed a rapid growth in population, and a surge in the development of crafts, industry and transport (including rail). Of course, such a scene of naked bathers would have been unthinkable in Courbevoie, <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> near the Parisian capital.|$|E
500|$|In early 2008, a {{group of}} MKs {{wrote a letter to}} the Prime Minister asking that the tomb be renovated: [...] "The {{tombstone}} is completely shattered, and the holy site is desecrated in an appalling manner, the likes of which we have not seen in Israel <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> in the world." [...] In February, it was reported that Israel would officially ask the Palestinian Authority to carry out repairs at the tomb, but in response, vandals set tires on fire inside the tomb. In December 2008, Jewish workers funded by anonymous donors painted the blackened walls and re-built the shattered stone marker covering the grave.|$|E
25|$|Clites {{recognized}} that these journeying players need {{an incentive to}} come back to St. Louis for their summer months. Their parents likely prefer it, and the availability of a familiar job increases, but that is not enough.

If Mahrt and Clites could make the domestic product equal <b>or</b> better than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else,</b> people would willingly come back home.|$|R
5|$|The west door, {{actually}} in {{the south side of}} the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, <b>or</b> indeed <b>anywhere</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R

500|$|One {{of the key}} {{problems}} for the early phase of the U.S. air program in Laos {{was the lack of}} forward air control (FAC) that would have pinpointed ground targets in the rugged, jungle-covered terrain for strike aircraft.

In 1963 the Air Force dispatched four [...] "sheep-dipped" [...] Air Commandos of the Combat Control Teams to Laos to work with the CIA. Combat Control Teams consisted of personnel who parachuted into a forward zone and provided air control for the aerial delivery of another unit (usually paratroops).|$|E
500|$|While {{urbanisation}} {{can pose}} a threat to koala populations, the animals can survive in urban areas provided enough trees are present. Urban populations have distinct vulnerabilities: collisions with vehicles and attacks by domestic dogs kill about 4,000 animals every year. Injured koalas are often taken to wildlife hospitals and rehabilitation centres. In a 30-year retrospective study performed at a New South Wales koala rehabilitation centre, [...] trauma (usually resulting from a motor vehicle accident or dog attack) was found to be the most frequent cause of admission, followed by symptoms of Chlamydia infection. Wildlife caretakers are issued special permits, but must release the animals back into the wild when they are either well enough or, in the case of joeys, old enough. As with most native animals, the koala cannot legally be kept as a pet in Australia <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{second half}} of the film was shot in the city of London. Karan chose to set the film there due to his fondness for the city. He added, [...] "I could have based my plot in New York City <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else.</b> But London is kind of close to my heart. I like to weave my films around London." [...] Shooting {{locations}} include the Wales Millennium Centre, Bluewater in Kent, Blenheim Palace, St Paul's Cathedral and the banks of River Thames. The outdoor scenes of the Raichand family mansion were shot at Waddesdon Manor. The crew faced enormous difficulties while filming an emotional scene between Jaya Bachchan and Khan at the Bluewater Complex, as a massive crowd had gathered there to watch them at work. The situation, eventually, got worse and the complex officials asked them to wrap up the shoot within two hours.|$|E
50|$|Adulteration and falsification {{are serious}} {{problems}} in the global tea trade; as of 2004, the amount of tea sold as Darjeeling worldwide every year exceeds 40,000 tonnes, while the annual tea production of Darjeeling itself is estimated at only 10,000 tonnes, including local consumption. To combat this situation, the Tea Board of India administers the Darjeeling certification mark and logo (see right). Protection of this tea designation is similar in scope to the {{protected designation of origin}} used by the EU for many European cheeses.

500|$|Maurice Thompson, who was {{literary}} editor of The Independent for twelve years, noted in 1891 that her poetry had [...] "a strange mixture of rare individuality and originality". Some critics hailed Dickinson's effort, but disapproved of her unusual non-traditional style. Andrew Lang, a British writer, dismissed Dickinson's work, stating that [...] "if poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme. The {{wisdom of the}} ages {{and the nature of}} man insist on so much". Thomas Bailey Aldrich, a poet and novelist, equally dismissed Dickinson's poetic technique in The Atlantic Monthly in January 1892: [...] "It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and grotesque fancy. She was deeply tinged by the mysticism of Blake, and strongly influenced by the mannerism of Emerson ... But the incoherence and formlessness of her— versicles are fatal ... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (<b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else)</b> cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar".|$|E

But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, <b>or</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>else,</b> and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if I could do it with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{observations}} made during wreck dive expeditions in 2010 - 2012, {{in order to}} investigate the ecological relevance of shipwrecks on the Dutch Continental Shelf (dcs). Shipwrecks are biodiversity hotspots. The number of species recorded on shipwrecks {{is similar to the}} number of species found in soft bottoms of the entire dcs. The soft substrates, however, represent a vastly larger habitat on the dcs than the shipwrecks. Amongst many other taxa, juvenile and large Atlantic cod, linear skeleton shrimp, goldsinny wrasses and leopard spotted gobies were found in the shipwreck habitats. The presence of these important species and their absence from many other habitats, illustrate that shipwrecks function as key habitats, nurseries, and refugia that are rare <b>or</b> absent <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> in the Netherlands...|$|R
