40|$|Digital {{images are}} used almost {{exclusively}} instead of film to capture visual information across many scientific fields. The colorimetric color representation within these digital {{images can be}} relayed from the digital counts produced by the camera {{with the use of}} a known color target. In image capture of magnified images, there is currently no reliable color target that can be used at multiple magnifications and give the user a solid understanding of the color ground truth within those images. The first part of this dissertation included the design, fabrication, and testing of a color target produced with optical interference coated microlenses for use in an off-axis illumination, compound microscope. An ideal target was designed to increase the color gamut for colorimetric imaging and provide the necessary 2 ̆ 2 Block Dye 2 ̆ 2 spectral reflectance profiles across the visible spectrum to reduce the number of color patches necessary for multiple filter imaging systems that rely on statistical models for spectral reflectance reconstruction. There are other scientific disciplines that can benefit from a specialized color target to determine the color ground truth in their magnified images and perform spectral estimation. Not every discipline has the luxury of having a multi-filter imaging system. The second part of this dissertation developed two unique ways of using an interference coated color mirror target: one that relies <b>on</b> <b>multiple</b> light-source <b>angles,</b> <b>and</b> one that leverages a dynamic color change with time. The source multi-angle technique would be used for the microelectronic discipline where the reconstructed spectral reflectance would be used to determine a dielectric film thickness on a silicon substrate, and the time varying technique would be used for a biomedical example to determine the thickness of human tear film...|$|R
40|$|Surface albedo {{is one of}} the {{critical}} parameters required by studies of surface energy balance and climate models. Albedo is defined as the ratio of outgoing radiances to incoming irradiances over hemispherical view-illumination geometry. Remotely sensed albedo is usually based <b>on</b> <b>multiple</b> view <b>angle</b> observations <b>and</b> a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. The accuracy of remotely sensed albedo depends on a variety of factors of which the main ones are the accuracy of atmospherically corrected observations, the reliability of observations, and the validity of the applied BRDF model. Fine spatial resolution airborne and satellite data are valuable for the validation of coarse spatial resolution satellite albedos as they may be validated using field measurements with higher reliability. In this study, a variety of remote sensing data and field measurements were used to estimate, validate and analyse albedo at different spatial resolutions. The main aim was to validate the MODIS albedo product under UK conditions using the methods of direct and indirect comparisons with other available data. The source of the fine spatial resolution data used was the NCAVEO Field Campaign 2006 that took place at the Chilbolton calibration test site in southern England. The CHRIS/PROBA albedo was used as a fine spatial resolution (34 m) albedo map to investigate the spatial variation of albedo. The results of this investigation provided valuable information about the possibility of the extension of the obtained albedo map from CHRIS/PROBA data. The MODIS albedo product with a coarser spatial resolution (500 m), relative to the NCAVEO datasets, was compared with the CHRIS/PROBA albedo map to examine the effect of spatial scale on the accuracy of albedo (direct comparison). The uncertainties in the obtained albedo maps, from both MODIS and CHRIS/PROBA, were mainly examined by testing the accuracy of the input reflectance data and the applied BRDF model (indirect comparison). The results showed the accuracy of the MODIS albedo product inferior to that claimed by the MODIS team. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

A few years back, fingerprint verification was done only in criminal investigations. Now fingerprints and face images are widely used in bank tellers, airports, and building entrances.

Facial features heavily change with illumination <b>and</b> orientation <b>angle,</b> leading to increased false rejection as well as false acceptance.

In this {{paper we propose a}} method for using multiple cameras to simultaneously view an object from <b>multiple</b> <b>angles</b> <b>and</b> at high resolutions. We show that our probabilistic method for combining the camera views, which can be used with many choices of single-image object detector, can significantly improve accuracy for detecting objects from many viewpoints. We also present our own single-image object detection method that uses large synthetic datasets for training. Using a distributed, parallel learning algorithm, we train from very large datasets (up to 100 million image patches). The resulting object detector achieves high performance on its own, but also benefits substantially from using multiple camera views. Our experimental results validate our system in realistic conditions and demonstrates significant performance gains over using standard single-image classifiers, raising accuracy from 0. 86 area-under-curve to 0. 97.

These techniques tend to be only limited in feature resolution by the camera resolution, apparent object size and number of cameras. If the users face is 50 percent of the working area of the camera and a camera has megapixel resolution, then sub millimeter facial motions can be detected by comparing frames. Recent work is focusing on increasing the frame rates and doing optical flow to allow the motions to be retargeted to other computer generated faces, rather than just making a 3D Mesh of the actor and their expressions.|$|R
