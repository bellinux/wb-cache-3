Bohemond, RaymondIII of Tripoli, ThorosII of Armenian Cilicia, and Constantine Kalamanos joined their forces and marched to Harenc, compelling Nur ad-Din to retreat.|$|E

5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> in Islam.|$|E

5|$|The history text Zubdat-al Tawarikh, {{dedicated}} to Sultan Murad III in 1583, narrates {{a story of}} Uzair's grief for the destruction <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b> His grief {{is said to have}} been so great that God took his soul and brought him back to life after Jerusalem was reconstructed. In the miniature accompanying the manuscript, the building on the lower right depicts the rebuilt city <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> in the form a typical sixteenth-century Ottoman building with a dome and an arched portico.

5|$|After Saladin conquered {{almost the}} whole Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> {{in the second}} half of 1187, Sibylla, Queen <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> sought shelter in Tripoli, which became a center of her supporters.

He started his military campaign against Tripoli in May 1188, but the arrival of the fleet of William II of Sicily saved the town. After Saladin captured Tortosa and Jabala (present-day Tartus and Jableh in Syria) in July, only Tripoli, Krak des Chevaliers, and the citadel at Tortosa remained under Christian rule in the county.|$|E

5|$|During their conquests, the Crusaders {{established}} the Latin Rite crusader {{states of the}} Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, and the County of Edessa.

After the retaking <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> most of the crusaders returned home. This left the crusader kingdoms vulnerable from Muslim reconquests during the Second and Third Crusades.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1940s {{through the}} 1960s, the Triangle was the {{commercial}} and cultural heart <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German-Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele. Following the reunification <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> in 1967 {{and the expansion of}} the city away from the downtown core, the commercial viability of the Triangle declined. The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets of the Triangle to an open-air pedestrian mall in 1982. Over the next two decades, outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing the reputation of the Triangle as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis.|$|E
