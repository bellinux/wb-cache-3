40|$|Purpose. The safety, tolerability, and {{pharmacokinetics}} of intravenous (i. v.) montelukast sodium (Singulair®, MK- 0476), and {{the oral}} bioavailability <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> in healthy males and healthy females were studied. Methods. This was a two-part study. Part I was a four-period study in males of rising i. v. doses <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> (3, 9, and 18 mg) administered as 15 -minute constant-rate i. v. infusions (Periods 1 - 3), {{followed by a}} 10 -mg oral tablet dose <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> (Period 4) under fasting conditions. Part II was a four-period study in females of i. v. montelukast sodium (9 mg) infused over 15 and 5 minutes (Periods 5 and 6, respectively) or injected as a bolus over 2 minutes (Period 7), followed by a 10 -mg oral tablet dose <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> (Period 8). Plasma samples were collected and analyzed by HPLC. Results. In males (N = 6), as the i. v. dose <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> increased from 3 to 18 mg, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> from time 0 to infinity (AUC) increased proportionately. The mean values of plasma clearance (CL), steady-state volume of distribution (V(ss)), plasma terminal half-life (t(1 / 2)), and mean residence time in the body (MRT(i. v.)) <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> were 45. 5 ml/min, 10. 5 l, 5. 1 hr, and 3. 9 hr, respectively, and remained essentially constant over the i. v. dosage range. Following oral administration of a 10 -mg tablet <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium,</b> the AUC, maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), time when C(max) occurred (T(max)), apparent t(1 / 2), mean absorption time (MAT), and bioavailability (F) <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> averaged 2441 ng · hr/ml, 385 ng/ml, 3. 7 hr, 4. 9 hr, 3. 4 hr, and 66 %, respectively. Following i. v. administration of 9 mg <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> to females (N = 6), the values of CL, V(ss), t(1 / 2), and MRT i. v. averaged 47. 6 ml/min, 9. 6 l, 4. 5 hr, and 3. 6 hr, respectively. Following oral administration of a 10 -mg tablet to females, the mean AUC, C(max), T(max), apparent tin, MAT and F were 2270 ng · hr/ml, 350 ng/ml, 3. 3 hr, 4. 4 hr, 2. 6 hr, and 58 %, respectively. These parameter values were similar to or slightly smaller than those in healthy males receiving the same i. v. and oral doses. Conclusions. The disposition kinetics <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> were linear. Gender {{had little or no}} effect on the kinetics <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium.</b> Safety results from this study indicate that intravenous doses <b>of</b> montelukast <b>sodium</b> from 3 to 18 mg and a 10 -mg oral dose are well tolerated.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to extracellular fluid, cytosol {{has a high}} concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration <b>of</b> <b>sodium</b> ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss <b>of</b> <b>sodium</b> and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E

40|$|Metam sodium is {{the most}} widely used soil {{fumigant}} in the United States. The primary breakdown product <b>of</b> metam <b>sodium</b> in soil is methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), an active pesticidal agent with a high toxicity and a great potential for volatilization. Reducing atmospheric emissions of MITC is therefore critical to maintain air quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the rate and efficiency of conversion <b>of</b> metam <b>sodium</b> to MITC in soil and to investigate the potential of using surface water sealing to reduce MITC emissions. The conversion <b>of</b> metam <b>sodium</b> to MITC was a rapid abiotic decomposition process. At typical field application rates, the conversion efficiency depended on the initial content <b>of</b> metam <b>sodium</b> in soil, but was independent of soil moisture, soil type, and soil atmospheric conditions. A soil column system was used to measure the emission and distribution of MITC after subsurface and surface application <b>of</b> metam <b>sodium.</b> Volatilization flux and cumulative emission loss of MITC was substantially reduced with surface water sealing compared to uncovered soil columns after subsurface application <b>of</b> metam <b>sodium.</b> When metam sodium was surface applied in simulated chemigation, surface water sealing was ineffective, suggesting the need for additional emissions reduction practices when metam sodium is broadcast. Overall, the results of the column experiment indicate that surface water sealing with subsurface application <b>of</b> metam <b>sodium</b> may be an effective and economical strategy to reduce MITC emissions while maintaining pest control efficacy. r 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
