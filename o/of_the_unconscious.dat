5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious.</b> That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E
25|$|Freud had greatly {{admired his}} {{philosophy}} tutor, Brentano, {{who was known}} for his theories of perception and introspection, as well as Theodor Lipps {{who was one of the}} main contemporary theorists of the concepts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> and empathy. Brentano discussed the possible existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> mind in his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874). Although Brentano denied its existence, his discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> probably helped introduce Freud to the concept. Freud owned and made use of Charles Darwin's major evolutionary writings, and was also influenced by Eduard von Hartmann's Philosophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unconscious</b> (1869).|$|E
25|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> {{was central}} to Freud's account of the mind. Freud {{believed}} that while poets and thinkers had long known of the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious,</b> he had ensured that it received scientific recognition {{in the field of}} psychology. The concept made an informal appearance in Freud's writings.|$|E
50|$|Critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{collective}} <b>unconscious</b> concept {{have called}} it unscientific and fatalistic, or otherwise very difficult to test scientifically (due to <b>the</b> mythical aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious)</b> for those faith-based scientists. Proponents {{suggest that it is}} borne out by findings of psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology.|$|R

25|$|When Dada reached Paris, it was avidly {{embraced by}} a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the {{writings}} of Sigmund Freud, particularly by his notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> mind. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> mind through the use of automatic writing, chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of Frottage, collage, and decalcomania, the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamed images were to become the key techniques {{through the rest of the}} 1930s.|$|E
25|$|His {{reputation}} as a philosopher was established by his first book, Philosophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unconscious</b> (1869; 10th ed. 1890). This success was {{largely due to the}} originality of its title, the diversity of its contents (von Hartmann professing to obtain his speculative results by the methods of inductive science, and making plentiful use of concrete illustrations), its fashionable pessimism and the vigour and lucidity of its style. The conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unconscious,</b> by which von Hartmann describes his ultimate metaphysical principle is, fundamentally, not as paradoxical as it sounds, being merely a new and mysterious designation for the Absolute of German metaphysicians.|$|E

40|$|Introduction-Many {{systems of}} {{telephone}} triage {{are being developed}} (including NHS Direct, general practitioner out of hours centres, ambulance services). These rely {{on the ability to}} determine key facts from <b>the</b> caller. Level <b>of</b> consciousness is an important indicator after head injury but also an indicator of severe illness. Aims-To determine the general public's understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term <b>unconscious.</b> Methods-A total of 700 people were asked one of seven questions relating to their understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term <b>unconscious.</b> All participants were adults who could speak sufficient English to give a history to a nurse. Results-Correct understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term <b>unconscious</b> varied from 46. 5 % to 87. 0 % for varying parameters. Those with English as their first language had a better understanding (p< 0. 01) and there was a significant variation with ethnicity (p< 0. 05). Conclusions-Understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term <b>unconscious</b> is poor and worse in those for whom English is not a first language. Decision making should not rely on <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> questions using technical terms such as unconscious, which may have a different meaning between professional and lay people...|$|R
25|$|Archetypes {{abound in}} {{contemporary}} films and literature {{as they have}} in creative works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, being <b>unconscious</b> projections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> that serve to embody central societal and developmental struggles in a media that entertain as well as instruct. Films are a contemporary form of mythmaking, reflecting our response to ourselves and the mysteries and wonders of our existence.|$|R
25|$|While Jung {{worked on}} his Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unconscious),</b> {{tensions}} became manifest between him and Freud because of their disagreements over the nature of libido and religion. Jung de-emphasized the importance of sexual development {{and focused on the}} collective unconscious: the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> that contains memories and ideas that Jung believed were inherited from ancestors. While he did think that libido was an important source for personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not believe that libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality. Jung believed his personal development was influenced by factors he felt were unrelated to sexuality.|$|E

25|$|The Unconscious is both Will and Reason (the latter concept also {{interpreted}} as Idea) and the absolute all-embracing ground of all existence. Von Hartmann thus combines pantheism with panlogism {{in a manner}} adumbrated by Schelling in his positive philosophy. Nevertheless, Will and not Reason is the primary aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unconscious,</b> whose melancholy career {{is determined by the}} primacy of the Will and the latency of the Reason. Will is void of reason when it passes from potentiality to actual willing. The original state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unconscious</b> is one of potentiality, in which, by pure chance, the Will begins to strive. In the transition state, called that of the empty Will, there is no definite end. Acting on its own, the Will creates absolute misery.|$|E
40|$|Causation, {{continues}} to evoke {{a storm of}} controversy. Following is the second {{in a series of}} articles wherein Sheldrake presents his ideas for amplifying Jung's concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> and archetypal psychology. He concluded his first article with these words: The approach I am putting forward is very similar to Jung's idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious.</b> <b>The</b> main difference is that Jung's idea was applied primarily to human experience and human collective memory. What I am suggesting is that a very similar principle operates throughout the entire universe, not just in human beings. If <b>the</b> kind <b>of</b> radical paradigm shift I am talking about goes on within biology? if <b>the</b> hypothesis <b>of</b> morphic resonance is even approximately correct? then Jung's idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> would become a mainstream idea: Morphogenic fields and <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> would completely change <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> modern psychology. SOCIETY AS SUPERORGANISM In Part II of this essay, I want to explore some ideas about the social and cultural aspects of morphic fields and morphic resonance. A familiar comparison might be that of a hive of bees or a nest of termites: each is like a giant organism, and the insects within it are like cells in a superorganism. Although comprised of hundreds and hundreds of individual insect cells, the hive or nest functions and responds as a unified whole...|$|R

40|$|This Essay {{on modern}} {{progress}} spins out of Marxism {{a theory of}} time about which Marxism itself has remained largely unconscious.

25|$|André Masson's {{automatic}} drawings of 1923 {{are often used}} as {{the point of the}} acceptance of visual arts and the break from Dada, since they reflect the influence of the idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> mind. Another example is Giacometti's 1925 Torso, which marked his movement to simplified forms and inspiration from preclassical sculpture.|$|E
25|$|Erickson {{frequently}} drew {{upon his}} own experiences to provide {{examples of the}} power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> mind. He was largely self-taught. A great many of his anecdotal and autobiographical teaching stories were collected by Sidney Rosen in the book My Voice Will Go With You. Erickson identified many of his earliest personal experiences as hypnotic or autohypnotic.|$|E
25|$|In {{attempting}} to construct such an umbrella theory, Rivers accepted that the unconscious exists {{and that the}} contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> are entirely inaccessible to a person except through the processes of hypnosis, dreaming, or psychoanalysis. Rivers further defined the unconscious as a repository of instincts and associated experiences (i.e. memories) which are painful or not useful to the organism.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> {{cannot be}} studied by using direct approaches, it is, {{according}} to Jung at least, a useful hypothesis. His postulated unconscious {{was quite different}} from the model that was proposed by Freud, despite the great influence that <b>the</b> founder <b>of</b> psychoanalysis had on Jung. The most well-known difference is <b>the</b> assumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> (see also Jungian archetypes), although Jung's proposal of collective unconscious and archetypes was based on <b>the</b> assumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> psychic (mental) patterns. These patterns include conscious contents—thoughts, memories, etc.—from life experience. They are common for all human beings. His proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vast collective <b>unconscious</b> was his concept of synchronicity, that inexplicable, uncanny connectedness that we all share.|$|R

50|$|At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century, {{psychoanalysis}} was created, {{and film}} happened to follow shortly afterward. André Breton, <b>the</b> founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Surrealist movement, saw {{film as a}} means <b>of</b> engaging <b>the</b> <b>unconscious.</b> Since films {{had the ability to}} tell a story using techniques such as superimposition, and slow motion, the Surrealists saw this as mimicking dreams.|$|R
25|$|The set is the {{internal}} attitudes and {{constitution of the}} person, including their expectations, wishes, fears, and sensitivity to the drug. This factor {{is especially important for}} the hallucinogens, which have the ability to make conscious experiences out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious.</b> In traditional cultures, set is shaped primarily by the worldview, health and genetic characteristics that {{all the members of the}} culture share.|$|E
25|$|Freud {{initiated}} the psychoanalytic critique of Surrealism with his remark that what interested him {{most about the}} Surrealists was not their unconscious but their conscious. His meaning was that the manifestations of and experiments with psychic automatism highlighted by Surrealists as the liberation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> were highly structured by ego activity, similar to {{the activities of the}} dream censorship in dreams, and that therefore it was in principle a mistake to regard Surrealist poems and other art works as direct manifestations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious,</b> when they were indeed highly shaped and processed by the ego. In this view, the Surrealists may have been producing great works, but they were products of the conscious, not the unconscious mind, and they deceived themselves with regard to what they were doing with the unconscious. In psychoanalysis proper, the unconscious does not just express itself automatically but can only be uncovered through the analysis of resistance and transference in the psychoanalytic process.|$|E
25|$|The Yogacara {{school of}} Mahayana Buddhism (starting from the 3rd to 5th century CE) {{extended}} these ideas into {{what has been}} called a Buddhist theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unconscious</b> mind. This concept was termed the ālaya-vijñāna (the foundation consciousness) which stores karmic seeds (bija) and undergoes rebirth. This theory was incorporated into a wider Yogacara theory of the Eight Consciousnesses and is also held in Tibetan Buddhism.|$|E
50|$|As {{modern humans}} {{go through their}} process of individuation, moving out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{collective}} <b>unconscious</b> into mature selves, they establish a persona—which can be understood simply as that small portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective psyche which they embody, perform, and identify with.|$|R

50|$|Although civilization leads {{people to}} disavow their links with <b>the</b> mythological world <b>of</b> uncivilized societies, Jung argued that aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{primitive}} <b>unconscious</b> would nevertheless reassert themselves in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> superstitions, everyday practices, and unquestioned traditions {{such as the}} Christmas tree.|$|R
25|$|The magazine's criticism, {{edited by}} Floyd Dell, was cheekily titled (at {{least for a}} time) “Books that Are Interesting.” Dell’s {{perceptive}} reviews gave accolades {{to many of the}} most notable books of the time: An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution, Spoon River Anthology, Theodore Dreiser’s novels, Carl Jung’s Psychology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unconscious,</b> G. K. Chesterton’s works, Jack London’s memoirs, and many other prominent creations.|$|E
25|$|Dreams occur mainly {{during the}} rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep and are composed of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations. Although more {{research needs to be}} done on this subject, dreams are said to be linked to the unconscious mind. Thought suppression has an influence on the subject matter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious</b> mind and by trying to restrain particular thoughts, there is a high chance of them showing up in one's dreams.|$|E
25|$|The neo-Freudians, a group {{including}} Alfred Adler, Otto Rank, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan and Erich Fromm, rejected Freud's {{theory of}} instinctual drive, emphasized interpersonal relations and self-assertiveness, and made modifications to therapeutic practice that reflected these theoretical shifts. Adler originated the approach, although his influence was indirect {{due to his}} inability to systematically formulate his ideas. Neo-Freudian analysis places more emphasis on the patient's relationship with the analyst and less on exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unconscious.</b>|$|E
50|$|Genotropism is <b>the</b> working {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> familial <b>unconscious,</b> <b>the</b> quantitative sharing <b>of</b> genes across <b>the</b> generations <b>of</b> family.

25|$|Archetypes are innate {{universal}} pre-conscious psychic dispositions {{that form}} the substrate from which <b>the</b> basic themes <b>of</b> human life emerge.

40|$|Our {{representations}} {{of women have}} their origins in <b>the</b> myths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past. According to Jung, myths are <b>the</b> symbolic expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> that expresses itself through archetypes. Archetypes are thus images that pass across generations: instruments <b>of</b> collective thought. <b>The</b> main archetypes we deal with {{in this article are}} the Mother and the Anima, or men s feminine principle. Using Jung's concept of archetype to analyse women s iconographic representations allows us to combine <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collective <b>unconscious</b> with that of social representations. Whereas Moscovici s theory of social {{representations of}}fers us <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> analysing beliefs about women through history, Jung's perspective reveals us <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> analysing <b>the</b> myths constructed around women as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archetypes people use to give sense to reality...|$|R
