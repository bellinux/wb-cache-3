5|$|The {{hurricane}} had {{devastating effects}} on the places it hit. It killed at least 1,000people directly, {{and a total of}} 1,800 people. At that time, it was Mexico's worst natural disaster in recent times. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> was in Colima and Jalisco. A preliminary estimate of property damage was $280million (1959USD).|$|E
5|$|After Jonathan Martin's arson {{attack on}} York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, there were {{proposals}} by the dean and chapter {{to take the}} opportunity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> to restructure {{the interior of the}} building. Etty was prominent in the effort to resist the redesign and to restore the building to its original state. A campaign led by Etty and other York luminaries was successful, and the plans were eventually defeated in February 1831.|$|E
5|$|Although the Croatian {{government}} sponsored reconstruction {{efforts in}} and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003. Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately, in order to punish the Serb community. Human Rights Watch noted that, of 4,000 homes that had been rebuilt, {{none of them were}} inhabited by Serbs. Unemployment was high because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of the town's major industries, and many of the inhabitants could not sell their houses. Most houses and many of Vukovar's historic buildings had been restored by 2011.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> from the war, the new ports of Fulton and Rockport were {{developed}} in the later 1860s. At first, Rockport {{was intended as a}} deep-water port, but after a series of mishaps, Aransas Pass was selected when deepening was approved in 1879. By 1912, a 100 feet wide and 8½ feet deep channel was operational. After hurricanes ransacked the port in 1916 and 1919, the United States Army Corps of Engineers chose Corpus Christi as the preferred deepwater port for the lower Gulf coast.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of food crops, many civilians {{were forced to}} leave the hills and {{surrender}} to the TNI. Often, when surviving villagers came down to lower-lying regions to surrender, the military would execute them. Those who were not killed outright by TNI troops were sent to receiving centers for vetting, which had been prepared in advance {{in the vicinity of}} local TNI bases. In these transit camps, the surrendered civilians were registered and interrogated. Those who were suspected of being members of the resistance were killed.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> {{required}} and cost {{involved in the}} proposed plans {{the majority of the}} Ringway Plans had stagnated by 1973. However, local Members of Parliament (MPs), including Toby Jessel, MP for Twickenham, complained the project should not be cancelled, as the existing South Circular was completely unacceptable to traffic. The plans were scrapped after Labour won the GLC election that year.|$|E

5|$|By August 8, the 50,000-watt {{standard}} wave {{station on}} Saipan the OWI radio station, broadcast a similar message to Japan every 15 minutes about Hiroshima, stating that more Japanese cities would face {{a similar fate}} {{in the absence of}} immediate acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and emphatically urged civilians to evacuate major cities.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite risings, a movement to restore Stuart King James II of England to the throne, the British government enacted a series of laws that attempted to speed the process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of the clan system.

Most of the legislation was repealed {{by the end of the}} eighteenth century as the Jacobite threat subsided.|$|E

5|$|The Pechenegs {{destroyed}} the Hungarians' dwelling places. Those {{who survived the}} double attack left the Pontic steppes and crossed the Carpathians {{in search of a}} new homeland. The memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> brought by the Pechenegs seems to have been preserved by the Hungarians. The Hungarian name of the Pechenegs (besenyő) corresponds to the old Hungarian word for eagle (bese). Thus the 14th-century Hungarian chronicles' story of eagles compelling the Hungarians' ancestors to cross the Carpathians most probably refers to the Pechenegs' attack.|$|E
5|$|Advance Wars: Days of Ruin was {{intended}} to have a darker atmosphere and more serious tone {{in contrast to the}} previous installments in the series, and features a new storyline independent of the previous games. Set amidst a post-apocalyptic world, the story focuses on the Rubinelle 12th Battalion, one of the surviving remnants of the military of the country of Rubinelle, which had been locked in a century-long war with its rival, Lazuria, prior to a devastating global meteor shower. In the aftermath, the Battalion devotes itself to saving any other survivors of the disaster, despite the shattered nations renewing their war against each other and an uncurable disease ravaging both sides. Meanwhile, a mysterious faction with unknown motives takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> and pushes both sides deeper into conflict from behind the scenes.|$|E

5|$|After {{the return}} of Alsace to French rule in 1918, the new {{director}} of the Musée des beaux-arts and the Musée des arts décoratifs, Hans Haug (1890–1965), put major efforts into presenting the Palais Rohan as a coherent whole again. Strasbourg suffered during World War II, and on 11August 1944 the palace was damaged by British and American bombs. After the war, restoration measures were soon undertaken {{under the supervision of}} the architects Robert Danis (1879–1949) and Bertrand Monnet (1910–1989), but in 1947 a fire broke out and devastated a significant part of the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts. This fire was an indirect consequence of the bombing raids: because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> inflicted on the palace, the building had suffered from damp, which was treated with welding torches, and poor handling of these caused the fire.|$|E
5|$|Although L'Hermite {{achieved}} minor successes against individual British shipping, his {{force was}} too small to have a serious impact on British trade in the region and the promised reinforcements failed to materialise in the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of the Cadiz fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, ten days before L'Hermite sailed although before news of the battle had reached Lorient. In early January 1806, L'Hermite managed to capture a small British naval brig but was still unable to make any significant impact on British trade operations. In the spring of 1806 L'Hermite withdrew across the Atlantic, taking on supplies and effecting repairs in neutral Brazil. During the return journey to France in August 1806, the squadron was caught in a major hurricane and one frigate was severely damaged, limping to a port in the United States for repairs. The rest of the squadron continued on to France, L'Hermite reaching Brest in his flagship Régulus. The other frigate was intercepted by a British blockade squadron on 27 September 1806 and captured in the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} at Dwarka, both {{on shore}} and offshore in the Arabian Sea, {{have been performed}} by the Archaeological Survey of India. The first investigations carried out on land in 1963 revealed many artifacts. Excavations done at two sites on the seaward side of Dwarka brought to light submerged settlements, a large stone-built jetty, and triangular stone anchors with three holes. The settlements are {{in the form of}} exterior and interior walls, and fort bastions. From the typological classification of the anchors it is inferred that Dwarka had flourished as a port during the period of the Middle kingdoms of India. Coastal erosion was probably the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> of what was an ancient port.|$|E
