25|$|As Britain rose in naval {{power and}} settled {{continental}} North America and some {{islands of the}} West Indies, they became the leading slave traders. At one stage the trade was the monopoly of the Royal Africa Company, operating out of London. But, following {{the loss of the}} company's monopoly in 1689, Bristol and Liverpool merchants became increasingly involved in the trade. By the late 17th century, <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>four</b> ships that left Liverpool harbour was a slave trading ship. Much of the wealth on which the city of Manchester, and surrounding towns, was built in the late 18th century, and for much of the 19th century, was based on the processing of slave-picked cotton and manufacture of cloth. Other British cities also profited from the slave trade. Birmingham, the largest gun-producing town in Britain at the time, supplied guns to be traded for slaves. 75% of all sugar produced in the plantations was sent to London, and much of it was consumed in the highly lucrative coffee houses there.|$|E

Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>four</b> New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York.

[...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I {{wanted to go back to}} public service.

2500|$|According to Havard, {{casualty}} trends {{were changing}} with {{the employment of}} modern weaponry. [...] Hard-jacketed rifle bullets were deadly at greater ranges. Despite this fact, the number of soldiers killed in action by the rifle diminished due to the increased effectiveness of artillery. [...] The advancements in field artillery technology made it necessary for battle lines to be farther apart, resulting in rifles being outside of their effective ranges. [...] The increased accuracy of modern artillery pieces led to increased ratios of artillery casualties. [...] In some battles during the war, fifty percent of casualties {{were the result of}} artillery fire. [...] Havard claimed that during Russo- Japanese War, both belligerents experienced higher levels of casualties than had been noted in earlier wars, with a great ratio of killed to wounded. [...] According to Havard, <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>four</b> soldiers wounded during the conflict died from their wounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} {{of such a}} large number of refugees, especially when Somalia's total population at the time was 4.1 million (UN estimates) meant that virtually <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>four</b> people in Somalia was a refugee. The Barre regime exploited the {{presence of}} such {{a large number of}} refugees as means of seeking foreign aid, as well as a vehicle to displacing those deemed hostile to the state, notably the Isaaqs, Human Rights Watch noted that: [...] "Northerners [...] were dismissed from and not allowed to work in government offices dealing with refugee affairs, so that they would not discover the truth about the government's policies. Instead refugees, registered with UNHCR were given jobs in the offices dealing with refugee matters."As the state became increasingly reliant on international aid, aid resources allocated for the refugees caused further resentment from the local Isaaq residents, especially as they felt no effort was made on the government's part to compensate them for bearing the burden of the war. Furthermore, Barre heavily favoured the Ogaden refugees, who belonged to the same clan (Darod) as him. Due to these ties, the Ogaden refugees enjoyed preferential access to [...] "social services, business licenses and even government posts." ...|$|E
