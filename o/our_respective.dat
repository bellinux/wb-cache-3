The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on <b>our</b> <b>respective</b> hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods has shown that the hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.|$|E

Previous studies of behaviour and activity in public space have focused on architectural or anthropological considerations, but this article fills a gap in research, by addressing the subject area from a user-focused design approach, offering new perspectives to existing and new audiences. It draws on ‘experience design’ models (e. g. those of IDEO, Tangerine) examining the dialogue of users’ and stakeholders’ experiences of objects/ environments; using models which have not been extensively applied to design of details in public space.

5000|$|Normative moral relativists believe {{not only}} the meta-ethical thesis, but that it has {{normative}} implications on {{what we ought to}} do. They argue that meta-ethical relativism implies that we ought to tolerate the behavior of others even when it runs counter to our personal or cultural moral standards. Most philosophers do not agree, partially because of the challenges of arriving at an [...] "ought" [...] from relativistic premises. [...] Meta-ethical relativism seems to eliminate the normative relativist's ability to make prescriptive claims. In other words, normative relativism may find it difficult to make a statement like [...] "we think it is moral to tolerate behaviour" [...] without always adding [...] "other people think intolerance of certain behaviours is moral". Philosophers like Russell Blackford even argue that intolerance is, to some degree, important. As he puts it, [...] "we need not adopt a quietism about moral traditions that cause hardship and suffering. Nor need we passively accept the moral norms of <b>our</b> own <b>respective</b> societies, {{to the extent that they}} are ineffective or counterproductive or simply unnecessary." [...] That is, it is perfectly reasonable (and practical) for a person or group to defend their subjective values against others, even if there is no universal prescription or morality.

In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel nonparametric method for {{simplifying}} piecewise linear curves and we apply this method as a statistical approximation of structure within sequential data in the plane. We consider the problem of minimizing {{the average length of}} se-quences of consecutive input points that lie on any one side of the simplified curve. Specifically, given a sequence P of n points in the plane that determine a simple polygonal chain consist-ing of n − 1 segments, we describe algorithms for selecting a subsequence Q ⊂ P (including the first and last points of P) that determines a second polygonal chain to approximate P, such that the number of crossings between the two polygonal chains is maximized, and the cardinality of Q is minimized among all such maximizing subsets of P. <b>Our</b> algorithms have <b>respective</b> running times O(n 2 logn) when P is monotonic and O(n 2 log 4 / 3 n) when P is any simple polyline. ...|$|R
40|$|New {{social science}} {{researchers}} often grapple {{with questions of}} scholarly identity and paradigm belongingness in a postmodern world. On one hand, there are perhaps more options than ever, in terms of philosophical orientations to research that are taken seriously across the landscape of social scholarly disciplines. On the other hand, however, these philosophical orientations (typically pre- sented as paradigms) have solidified {{to such a degree}} in writing and teaching on qualitative inquiry that they can feel confining, leading students to feel that more than one “paradigm” resonates with their personal sensibilities, and therefore to wonder where the points of tension actually lie between different orientations to research—for indeed, what is learned in the classroom about convergences and divergences between research perspectives is sometimes not borne out in our lived experiences in the field. In this critical review article, which is meant to be both a personal reflection and an analytical methodology exploration, the author engages in an exercise of “rethinking,” in which she questions earlier claims regarding the tension between two increasingly popular research approaches in her own field of tourism studies—namely, constructivism and critical theory—and attempts to interrogate what is really at stake between these perspectives. Ultimately, the author concludes that the tension between these two traditions may lie in a surprising place: it may not be ontological, and not necessarily even political, but pedagogical and care oriented. She then ponders the inherent challenge that lies in the tension between these two perspectives, in terms of the quest to forge a social research approach that is reflexive, critically and politically oriented, and respectful of participants and their lived experiences. By situating her analysis within the context of her own doctoral research project, she hopes not only to capture the analytical dimension of working at a methodological crossroads, but also to offer a window into the ways that such issues are worked through in <b>our</b> own <b>respective</b> and embodied research journeysPeer reviewedScholarly identityParadigm debateQualitative researchReflexivityResearch ethicsResearcher–participant relationshi...|$|R

Drawing on our own practices as artists and academics where we attempt to both subvert and use the rhetoric and structure of institutional knowledge production, either by creating mock Institutes and Departments or working with processes of ruination and institutional collapse, we will discuss a recent {{rise in the number of}} artists and artists' projects which are occupying Institutional structures in order to ‘place’ ambiguous, complex, conceptual and/or contradictory forms of practice, in particular we will look at such projects as The Institute of Beasts, Entropic Union, The Department of Wrong Answers and the Faculty of Invisibility. <b>Our</b> own <b>respective</b> practices demonstrate a knowing relationship to the impossibility of housing what Jon Thompson has described as the “mysterious ontological terrain within which all art must find itself” But if this terrain were a place, what would it look like and how do our current institutions access it without closing it down. How do we, as both artists and academics place and house complexity? Could the institute itself, as a place of articulation, examination, deconstruction and interrogation, be 'in ruins'? These questions become more ever more critical if we are to create new sites and places for art and education, and new institutions for new forms of practice and relationships between art and society. We will speculate on the ‘possibility of place’ re-imagining itself and what a new form of institution might look or even ‘feel’ like. We will discuss the potential of ‘place’ which is dedicated to the housing of its own impossibility and cite examples of recent practices and projects related to the concept of The Institute of Ruin is an idea in the making, the suggestion of a place which is not yet a 'place', a place which is always destroying and re-imagining itself anew...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: A {{consecutive}} {{series of}} 28 "operated" juxtafacet cysts is reported. We emphasize the clinical and radiological aspects leading to diagnosis. We also discuss {{the results of}} the surgical treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical information and radiological studies involving 28 patients were analyzed. Each patient has been operated on by decompressive laminectomy and resection of the cyst. The diagnosis was always confirmed by a pathological examination. The cyst most frequently occurred at the L 4 -L 5 level (n = 18), and seldom at the L 5 -S 1 (n - 6) or L 3 -L 4 (n - 4) levels. RESULTS: The differential diagnosis from other pathological causes responsible for a radicular compression could not be done by physical examination. Spine X-rays or myelogram were nonspecific. Computed Tomography or CT-myelography could help in the diagnosis but MR imaging was the most sensitive. In <b>our</b> series, the <b>respective</b> sensitivities of these techniques are 56, 42 and 77 %. The preoperative diagnosis was correct in 18 patients (64 %). The cyst was sometimes adherent to the underlying dura, then significantly increasing the risk of dural tear and spinal fluid leak, especially when located at L 3 -L 4 level. Surgical ablation lead to a complete recovery or an important improvement in 26 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of the juxtafacet cyst of the lumbar spine is better achieved by MRI. Surgery is the gold standard treatment, safe and long-term effective. When a total cyst removal with an internal facetectomy are performed, recurrence is exceptional. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{information}} technologies, {{and intelligent}} learning systems, are both emergent technologies {{that will likely}} have a transforming impact on <b>our</b> society. The <b>respective</b> underlying fields of research [...] quantum information (QI) versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) [...] have their own specific challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in {{a growing body of}} recent work, researchers have been probing the question to what extent these fields can learn and benefit from each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our "big data" world. Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence {{in a world that is}} described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments, and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating machine learning and artificial intelligence in the quantum domain.
