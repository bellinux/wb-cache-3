40|$|In our always-evolving world, {{financial}} literacy and inclusion are crucial {{in the development}} of sustainable welfare and a more transparent and fairer society. We cannot forget that the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 that has continued across the world to this day has financial illiteracy {{as one of the most}} aggravating factors. The main challenge for many consumers worldwide is that the requirements of adequate {{financial literacy}} skills have been steadily increasing over time. Individuals have to take a wide range of financial decisions and unfortunately, they sometimes overlook or simply do not know the risk attached with the decisions they are making until it is too late. The main challenges for financial literacy at the micro-level, meso-level, and macro-level are over deference to the financial industry, lack of financial <b>knowledge,</b> <b>overconfidence</b> about financial <b>knowledge,</b> lack of government initiatives, frameworks and regulations, lack of life-cycle planning and interesting and fascinating ways to teach financial literacy skills...|$|R
40|$|People {{feel they}} {{understand}} complex phenomena with far greater precision, coherence, and depth {{than they really}} do; {{they are subject to}} an illusion—an illusion of explanatory depth. The illusion is far stronger for explanatory knowledge than many other kinds of knowledge, such as that for facts, procedures or narratives. The illusion for explanatory knowledge is most robust where the environment supports real-time explanations with visible mechanisms. We demonstrate the illusion of depth with explanatory knowledge in Studies 1 – 6. Then we show differences in <b>overconfidence</b> about <b>knowledge</b> across different knowledge domains in Studies 7 – 10. Finally, we explore the mechanisms behind the initial confidence and behind overconfidence in Studies 11 and 12, and discuss the implications of our findings for the roles of intuitive theories in concepts and cognition...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the ability of {{students}} to appreciate the extent of their own knowledge is essential to enable them to appreciate where gaps may exist and prompt the development of remedial learning strategies. This article reports on a study investigating this capability in which 307 business undergraduates provided 7525 judgements on the state of their own knowledge in respect of issues addressed in their study programme. The findings indicated a general tendency for <b>overconfidence</b> in <b>knowledge,</b> which was more evident in those studying on the first year of their degree programme than students in their second year. These findings suggest that effective learning may be hampered by students’ ignorance of gaps in their knowledge, particularly {{in the early stages of}} academic programmes, and that they may benefit from interventions to assist them in developing a better appreciation of their current state of knowledge...|$|R

Behavioral explanations typically allude to the social preferences, where an individual’s utility is directly affected by another’s outcome, as the driver of the trusting investments and reciprocal returns. We hypothesize that, in part, these decisions are determined by an individual’s financial literacy. Experimental evidence is coupled with an innovative financial literacy assessment, which measures general competence, numeracy skills, and <b>overconfidence</b> in one’s <b>knowledge.</b> Results indicate that overconfidence is a significant determinant of behavior. Specifically, overconfident individuals make larger contributions in the investment game. We also document that there is an escalated effect in overconfident individuals who also exhibit risk loving preferences...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{literacy}} {{may not be}} {{as effective}} as previously thought in protecting against fraud victimisation. It does not inoculate investors from persuasion or social engineering tactics used by offenders to secure investment in fraudulent schemes. In fact, recent research indicates that <b>overconfidence</b> in investment <b>knowledge</b> may make individuals more susceptible to fraud. Using boiler room fraud as a case study, this article introduces the PREY (Profiled, Relational, Exploitable and Yielding) model to capture the psychological tactics used by fraud perpetrators to influence the thoughts and decisionmaking processes of individuals. The PREY model operationalizes the tenets of social engineering and demonstrates how such tactics could be re-engineered to increase the effectiveness of fraud prevention within the financial literacy context.

40|$|Research on people’s {{confidence}} in their general knowledge has to date produced two fairly stable effects, many inconsistent results, and no comprehensive theory. We propose such a comprehensive framework, the theory of probabilistic mental models (PMM theory). The theory (a) explains both the overconfidence effect (mean confidence is higher than percentage of answers correct) and the hard-easy effect (over{{confidence in}}creases with item difficulty) {{reported in the literature}} and (b) predicts conditions under which both effects appear, disappear, or invert. In addition, (c) it predicts a new phenomenon, the confidence-frequency effect, a systematic difference between a judgment of confidence in a single event (i. e., that any given answer is correct) and a judgment of the frequency of correct answers in the long run. Two experiments are reported that support PMM theory by confirming these predictions, and several apparent anomalies reported in the literature are explained and integrated into the present framework. Do people think they know more than they really do? In the last 15 years, cognitive psychologists have amassed a large and apparently damning body of experimental evidence on <b>overconfidence</b> in <b>knowledge,</b> evidence that is in turn part of an even larger and more damning literature on socalled cognitive biases. The cognitive bias research claims that people are naturally prone to making mistakes in reasoning and memory, including the mistake of overestimating their knowledge...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{consistently}} observed that people are generally overconfident in their judgments or decisions and that <b>overconfidence</b> in general <b>knowledge</b> is typically stronger among Asian than among Western subject groups. However, scientists, {{whose job is to}} produce neutral and objective knowledge, are expected to be immune to overconfidence and to be independent of cross-cultural variation. The authors conducted an email survey to determine whether well-trained scholars are really immune to the overconfidence bias and whether cross-cultural variations in overconfidence exist among scientists from different language backgrounds. Contrary to the authors&# 39; expectations, scientists who published their works in Science or Nature were inaccurate, overconfident, likely to nominate the journal they published in to have a greater impact factor, and easier to generate supportive rather than opposite arguments for their own conclusions. The authors also found that Chinese-speaking authors exhibited greater overconfidence but generated fewer arguments than did their English-speaking counterparts, which is consistent with Yates, Lee, and Shinotsuka&# 39;s argument recruitment model. The pervasive overconfidence and its cross-cultural variations suggest that an academic author may not communicate his or her conclusions to readers in an impartial and value-free manner, and therefore, the job of detecting bias is hoped to be taken and done well by the reader...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experiment}} that brings together psychological measures of competence and overconfidence with laboratory economic measures of individual valuations of uncertainty. We examine the valuations of risky and ambiguous lotteries in a financial decision context. The experiment can be viewed in two parts. The first part replicates an experimental design reported by Heath and Tversky (1991) but within a financial market context. This part produces two measures: 1) competence, the perception of feeling knowledgeable or competent in an area and 2) overconfidence, the well documented result that many individuals overestimate their ability. These measures, together with an indicator of objective knowledge, were used to explain elicited certainty equivalents {{in the second part of}} the experiment. Certainty equivalents were elicited for lotteries that were contingent on the price movements of real stock and bond funds, the price changes of simulated virtual funds, and pure risk lotteries. These represent three different levels of uncertainty: two-sided ambiguity, one-sided ambiguity and pure risk. Our results show a significant relationship between individual overconfidence and competence measures and elicited values of lotteries in a financial decision context. Further, the interaction of <b>overconfidence,</b> competence and <b>knowledge</b> measures with gender produce nearly opposite effects. risk, ambiguity, overconfidence, gender, financial decision making, economic experiments...|$|R
40|$|Background. This paper's {{starting}} point is the recognition (descriptive not normative) that, {{for the vast majority}} of day-to-day clinical decision-making situations, the 'evidence' for decision-making is experiential knowledge. Moreover, reliance on this knowledge base means that nurses must use cognitive shortcuts or heuristics for handling information when making decisions. These heuristics encourage systematic biases in decision-makers and deviations from the normative rules of 'good' decision-making. Aims. The aim of the paper is to explore three common heuristics and the biases that arise when handling complex information in clinical decision-making (overconfidence, hindsight and base rate neglect) and, in response to these biases, to illustrate some simple techniques for reducing the negative influence of heuristics. Discussion. Nurses face a limited range of types of uncertainty in their clinical decisions and draw primarily on experiential knowledge to handle these uncertainties. This paper argues that experiential knowledge is a necessary but not sufficient basis for clinical decision-making. It illustrates how <b>overconfidence</b> in one's <b>knowledge</b> base, being correct 'after the event' or with the benefit of hindsight, and ignoring the base rates associated with events, conditions or health states, can impact on professional judgements and decisions. The paper illustrates some simple strategies for minimizing the impact of heuristics on the real-life clinical decisions of nurses. Conclusion. The paper concludes that more research knowledge of the impact of heuristics and techniques to combat them in nursing decisions is needed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the relationship (termed overconfidence) between subjective confidence in judgements and objective reality, to determine and clarify {{the nature of}} influencing factors. Chapter 1 examines whether predictions of future behaviour for oneself are less overconfident than those for a partner. Chapter 2 studies the influence of base rates and the desirability of the outcome on overconfidence in behavioural predictions, and whether people can accurately estimate population base rates. Chapters 3 and 4 then progress to ask whether individual characteristics (such as field dependence, probabilistic reasoning ability, and self-esteem) of the person making the judgements are related to <b>overconfidence</b> in general <b>knowledge</b> tasks and behavioural predictions. Chapter 5 investigates whether feedback can affect overconfidence. A questionnaire based methodology was used. The results indicated that overconfidence is strongly related to task difficulty, which varies according to the person being predicted for and the base rate. It was found that predictions about another person were more overconfident than predictions for oneself. It was also shown that maximum overconfidence occurred at mid base rates with underconfidence at extreme base rates. Higher overconfidence in predictions was found for events which were positive in outcome than those with negative outcomes. Large variations in individuals’ overall overconfidence occurred, but no evidence was found to link this with the individual differences studied. Finally, feedback did not reduce overconfidence on average, but did reduce overconfidence over time for consistently hard questions, but not for easy questions. Issues raised by this thesis are examined in the Discussion...|$|R
40|$|While some {{research}} about confidentiality {{in social work}} has been undertaken, this study {{is believed to be}} the first which explores what social workers actually know about confidentiality Eighty-seven social workers in St. John’s, Newfoundland, responded to a questionnaire designed to measure their ability to discern violations of confidentiality in hypothetical situations. – The results of the study indicate that the social workers studied had deficits in their knowledge about confidentiality. Further, the respondents displayed <b>overconfidence</b> about their <b>knowledge,</b> being significantly more confident than they were correct. The evidence demonstrates a positive relationship between education and ability to make correct decisions with regard to the vignettes. – The major concern emanating from this study is that in balancing the right of the individual to privacy with often competing societal interests, social workers make unnecessary errors on both sides because they lack existing knowledge to guide their decision-making. The results have negative implications for the social worker – client relationship in terms of trust, and the development of the profession itself as relates to ethics. This is of particular relevance in Canada, where the profession of social work is attempting to assert its status with some vigor. The results of this study are a pointed indication of the need for better training in the principles underlying confidentiality and their application in practice. It is only with improved knowledge of confidentiality that the social work profession’s secret, namely, that little is clearly understood by many social workers about confidentiality, can be transformed to its desired status of the professional secret so as to protect the interests of individuals and of society...|$|R
40|$|An {{appreciation}} {{of the extent of}} one's own knowledge is known as metaknowledge and {{it has been argued that}} students' ability to distinguish between what they know, and what they do not, is an important influence on academic success. However, previous research suggests a general tendency for individuals to display <b>overconfidence</b> in their <b>knowledge,</b> by overestimating how much they know. This study assessed the ability of learners studying business in higher education to appreciate the extent of their own knowledge and investigated the association between this capability and academic achievement. It therefore contributes towards answering broader questions regarding how well individuals are able to assess their own capabilities and what the implications of this are. Quantitative methodology was employed and multiple-choice tests used to investigate how accurately students were able to assess the extent of their knowledge of issues addressed in their study programmes. Analysis of over 12, 500 judgements provided by 508 respondents revealed a general tendency for overconfidence and indicated that this was greater for males, older participants and particularly, for Chinese students. Consequently, interventions designed to moderate overconfidence may be particularly valuable for these sub-groups. In terms of its potential implications for learning, the research indicated that better metaknowledge was positively associated with higher levels of academic performance, particularly for those in their first year studying at the university. Consequently, while metacognitive skills, such as accurate self-monitoring, are typically poorly addressed in business schools, the findings from this study suggest that initiatives to improve self monitoring accuracy may be effective in enhancing student learning. Additionally, such interventions have other potential benefits for learners, since metacognitive monitoring skills may also usefully inform lifestyle decisions, as well as improving the chances of success in business and may therefore be particularly beneficial for business students...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to find out whether Finnish mutual fund {{managers}} are prone to behavioral biases. Additionally, some opinions of the mutual fund managers are asked in relation to overconfidence and investing. The following behavioral biases are investigated in this paper: overconfidence, disposition effect, self-attribution bias, house money effect, status quo bias, and illusion of <b>knowledge.</b> <b>Overconfidence</b> is further divided into better-than-average effect and overconfidence on a general level. Three of these studied behavioral biases have been found from mutual fund managers, or similar, before and they are: overconfidence, disposition effect, and house money effect. Thus, better-than-average effect, self-attribution bias, status quo bias, and illusion of knowledge have not been studied on mutual fund managers before. Therefore, this study tries to fill this gap in behavioral finance literature and provide valuable information to asset management industry about behavior and decision making of the Finnish mutual fund managers. As the research method a quantitative questionnaire was selected. Target population for this survey was Finnish mutual fund managers working in Finland. Collecting the sample began in the beginning of December 2014 and the final answers were received on seventh of February 2015. Primary contact method was by phone. A total of 35 banks or asset management companies were contacted and 23 of these participated in the survey. There were in total of 57 mutual fund managers that completed the questionnaire. This gives a response rate of approximately 26 %. It can be stated that this unique sample is a good representation of the entire population of the Finnish mutual fund managers. When analyzing the sample statistical methods were used. Most important information provided is histograms that present the percentage distribution of answers for each question and claim. In order to investigate how the different answers are related a Pearson's correlation matrix was used. Based on my results it seems that Finnish mutual fund managers are prone to behavioral biases. On average it appears that the survey participants are subject to better-than-average effect, status quo bias and illusion of knowledge. Clearly more than half of the participants show quite strong signs of status quo bias and illusion of knowledge. There is also evidence that 44 % of the participants might be subject to disposition effect to some extent. Furthermore, 23 % of the Finnish mutual fund managers possibly exhibit, at least weakly, house money effect. Instead, the evidence is rather clear that the participants are not prone to overconfidence on a general level. Findings of the self-attribution bias are disregarded since it is possible that the respondents misunderstood how to answer questions related to it. The participants' opinions about overconfidence, on the other hand, suggest that overconfidence indeed is present in the work of the Finnish mutual fund managers...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{value is}} an {{important}} determinant of consumers’ post-use behaviour, for example satisfaction, repeat purchase and word of mouth. The existing research mainly looks at the factors associated with the product and service providers to improve consumer value. Few studies {{on the role of}} the consumer in shaping consumer value have found consumer knowledge to be an important element in shaping consumer value. Adopting critical realism, this PhD expands this area of knowledge by investigating knowledge miscalibration (i. e., the inaccuracy in subjective knowledge) as a significant antecedent of consumer value. Most of the time, consumers’ perceptions of what they think they know (i. e., subjective knowledge) has been shown to be different from what they actually know (i. e., objective knowledge). Thus, subjective knowledge is usually inaccurate. This inaccuracy in subjective knowledge relative to objective knowledge is called knowledge miscalibration. Although the effect of knowledge miscalibration on consumers’ purchasing decisions has been investigated in the consumer behaviour literature, its role in the use stage of consumption has received much less attention. The aim of this research is to examine the effect of knowledge miscalibration on product or service use, and more specifically on the value consumers derive from actually using products or services (i. e., value-in-use). In this research a critical realism paradigm is pursued, implying that reality exists in the three domains of the empirical, the actual and the real. The research starts with observing regularity in the empirical domain (i. e., consumer value) followed by imagining the causal power in the actual and the real domains (i. e., knowledge miscalibration), shaping the research question. A retroductive strategy is followed, firstly by proposing the effect of knowledge miscalibration on consumer value and secondly by conceptually and empirically testing this relationship. This research conceptualises that knowledge miscalibration influences consumer value dimensions, described as efficiency, excellence, play and aesthetics. It is suggested that underconfidence (i. e., knowledge miscalibration where subjective knowledge is deflated) and <b>overconfidence</b> (i. e., <b>knowledge</b> miscalibration where subjective knowledge is inflated) influence consumer value dimensions differently as they generate different consequences in use. Therefore, a conceptual model is developed that describes the effect of knowledge miscalibration (i. e., overconfidence and underconfidence) on the dimensions of consumer value. The empirical part of the research is designed by conducting a covariance-based study and an experimental investigation in order to gain both internal and external validity. The covariance-based investigation is conducted in the context of amazon. com online shopping. Knowledge miscalibration and consumer value dimensions are measured in this study. This study supports the negative effect of underconfidence on efficiency, excellence, play and aesthetics and the negative effect of overconfidence on play. The experimental investigation is designed in the context of prezi. com, an online dynamic presentation creation website that enables its users to move between slides, words and images during their presentations. In this study, overconfidence and underconfidence are manipulated and their effects on the dimensions of consumer value are examined. The findings of this study show that underconfidence negatively influences efficiency, excellence and aesthetics, while overconfidence negatively impacts excellence, play and aesthetics. Overall, this PhD concludes that knowledge miscalibration negatively influences the dimensions of consumer value, with the exception of overconfidence impacting efficiency. The contradictory results of the covariance-based study observed in the experimental study can be explained through its inability to account for reciprocal relationships (i. e., where consumer value dimensions also impact knowledge miscalibration) and the existence of a third variable affecting both independent and dependent variables. Furthermore, the context of the experimental study (employing a new consumption task) is proposed to be the main reason for the lack of support for the effect of underconfidence on play...|$|R
