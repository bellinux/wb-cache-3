40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>ions</b> on hydroxide precipitation of copper; zinc, lead, chromium and nickel metals individually {{as well as in}} mixed metals. The treatment method used was chemical precipitation using calcium hydroxide as the precipitation agent in the existence <b>of</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>ions</b> as one <b>of</b> the pollutants. The experiment was initially performed with the preparation of synthetic wastewater stocks that were diluted according to the experimental requirements. pH values of the solution were then initially reduced to pH 2 using nitric acid. 50 mL aliquots of sample were obtained at each pH increment and filtered through 0. 45 mm porous cellulose nitrate membranes. The procedure was then repeated by adding ferric chloride solutions as a polluting metal. The alkaline medium was found to be the most suitable for metal precipitation purposes since all the optimum pH for all five metals occurred at alkaline medium. The minimum solubility of individual hydroxide precipitation for Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb and Cr were 2. 34 - 5. 4 mgL- 1, 0 - 10. 78 mgL- 1, 1. 35 - 16. 51 mgL- 1, 2. 34 - 10. 89 mgL- 1 and 1. 09 - 5. 38 mgL- 1 respectively.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The patent literature describing {{the development of the}} foil electroforming technology has been reviewed. A review of the literature covering the development of iron plating electrolytes has also been completed. A detailed study of the effects of solution parameters on the conductivity of iron chloride solution and the effect of addition of a number of 'conductivity salts' has been carried out. The operation of a pilot plant for the continuous production of iron foil has. been investigated and the parameters of foil production characterised. Preliminary cathodic polarization studies were made at low current densities on the iron chloride electrolyte showing the effects of temperature on the system. A number of possible materials for use as insoluble anodes have been investigated using anodic polarization to determine· their behaviour in the aggressive hot iron chloride electrolyte environment. The possibility of reducing depassivation of the cathode by the addition of a less aggressive anion was studied but no significant improvement achieved. For a more detailed and controlled study of the hot iron chloride electrolyte, a closed, divided-cell incorporating a rotating-cylinder electrode was designed and constructed to operate near to the boiling polnt. of the electrolyte. The cell enabled a more rigorous-study of the electrolyte to be made as the solution parameters could be better controlled. The concentration of the ferric ion in the solution could be reduced and held constant while other factors could be measured. This system has been used to demonstrate the electrochemical reduction <b>of</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>ion</b> in addition to demonstrating that chemical reduction of the electrolyte was feasible and to study the effect <b>of</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>ion</b> concentration on cathode current efficiency.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to CCK 8, where tyrosine sulphation or phosphorylation increased the stoichiometry <b>of</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>ion</b> binding from 1 to 2 without greatly affecting the affinity (Baldwin et al. 2008), tyrosine sulphation or phosphorylation of gastrin 17 {{had no effect}} on the stoichiometry <b>of</b> <b>ferric</b> <b>ion</b> binding, but enhanced the affinity of gastrin 17 for the first ferric ion, and reduced the affinity for the second ferric ion. This difference is not unexpected as the gastrin binding site consists of three of the five glutamate residues, while the CCK 8 SO 4 binding site involves the two aspartate residues, and the CCK 8 PO 4 binding site the phosphate group itself (Baldwin et al. 2008). In terms of receptor binding, tyrosine sulphation enhanced the affinity, while phosphorylation reduced the affinity, of CCK 8 for both the CCK 1 and CCK 2 receptors (Baldwin et al. 2008). In contrast, while tyrosine sulphation enhanced the affinity of gastrin 17 for the CCK 2 receptor, phosphorylation had no effect. Although the generalization that modification of tyrosine profoundly affects the binding of ferric ions is valid, the differences between two such closely related peptides as gastrin 17 and CCK 8 indicate that the exact binding details will have to be determined for each peptide individually.|$|E
