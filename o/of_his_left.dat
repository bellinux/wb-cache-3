5|$|Davis's renewed {{service in}} the Senate was {{interrupted}} in early 1858 by an illness that began as a severe cold and which threatened him with the loss <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> eye. He was forced to remain in a darkened room for four weeks. He spent the summer of 1858 in Portland, Maine. On the Fourth of July, Davis delivered an anti-secessionist speech on board a ship near Boston. He again urged {{the preservation of the}} Union on October 11 in Faneuil Hall, Boston, and returned to the Senate soon after.|$|E
5|$|Deprived <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> wing (still {{in pursuit}} of the Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before {{breaking}} into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Thordendal, who {{was working}} as a carpenter, severed the tip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in a router accident. As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's {{fingertip}} was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery. The Selfcaged EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{at the age}} of 20, he {{was sent}} to the frontline, where he took {{photographs}} of life in the trenches with a lightweight camera (a Goerz Tenax). Most of these photographs were destroyed during the violence of the Hungarian Revolution of 1919. Wounded in 1915 by a bullet, Kertész suffered temporary paralysis <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> arm.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Armstrong {{was working}} at his farm near Lebanon, Ohio. As he jumped off {{of the back of}} his grain truck, his wedding ring got caught in the wheel, tearing off the tip <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> hand's ring finger. He {{collected}} the severed digit and packed it in ice, and surgeons reattached it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. In February 1991, a year after his father had died, and nine months {{after the death of his}} mother, he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at Aspen, Colorado.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while {{chopping}} firewood. Gangrene set in, and {{his right}} leg was amputated below the knee. It spread to his left leg, and part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> foot was amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair. The disease eventually proved fatal, and he died on 20 August 1997. He was {{survived by his wife}} Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons. A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{ended the}} {{first-class}} matches with 1,922 runs at 71.18 including seven centuries, ranking him second in runs only to Bradman (2,428 at 89.92) and substantially ahead of third-placed Hassett (1,563 at 74.42). He did so despite being troubled by a {{split between the}} first and second fingers <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> hand, caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour.|$|E

5|$|On January 7, 1989, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center {{to repair a}} Dupuytren's contracture of the ring finger <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> hand. The surgery lasted {{for more than three}} hours and was performed under regional anesthesia. This procedure was done just thirteen days before he left office. For this reason he had a hand and finger bandage the day of his farewell speech and the day of the inauguration of George H. W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt's final {{start of}} the year came on July 23, in a game he won against Minnesota. After the start, the Royals moved him to the bullpen to try to fix his blister problems. The move was {{originally}} thought to be temporary. While in the bullpen, on August 3, he got his career first save in a 20 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On August 21, the Royals announced that Affeldt would {{spend the rest of the}} year in the bullpen. Two days later, he got another save against Minnesota. He picked up two more saves before the end of the year and finished with a 76 record and a 3.93 ERA. After the season, to try to help with his blister problems, he had part of a fingernail on the middle finger <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> hand removed. Also, the Royals announced that if he developed blister problems again, he would be sent to the bullpen for good.|$|E
5|$|Another {{surviving}} {{victim was}} customer Jeff Schaffart, 34, who was treated and released at UNMC for {{a gunshot wound}} to the left arm and the little finger <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> hand. The Omaha Police Department announced on December 22, 2007, that Mandy Hyda, 34, received a bruise when a bullet fragment struck her left leg. She was neither transported nor treated for the injury. It was initially reported that there were five people injured (not including Hyda), but two of those at the scene who were sent to local hospitals were sent {{for reasons other than}} being shot by Hawkins.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's long {{histories}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office. Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years, Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> ventricle. He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Ben showed a {{developed}} vocabulary. In 1860, {{he was sent}} to Bethany, a boarding school in Edgefield where he became a star student, and he remained there after the American Civil War began. In 1863, he came home for a year to help his mother pay off debts. He returned to Bethany in 1864, intending a final year of study prior to entering the South Carolina College (today, the University of South Carolina). The South's desperate need for soldiers ended this plan, and in June 1864, still not yet 17, he withdrew from the academy, making arrangements to join a coastal artillery unit. These plans were scuttled as well when he fell ill at home. A cranial tumor led to the removal <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> eye, and it was not until 1866, months after Confederate forces had disbanded, that Ben Tillman was again healthy.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} 2016–17 season, Parker lost {{longtime}} teammate Tim Duncan to retirement. The Spurs finished {{the season with}} a 61–21 record, as they registered back-to-back 60-win seasons {{for the first time in}} franchise history. Parker played 63 games and averaged 10.1 points per game, his lowest average since his rookie season. In the 2017 playoffs, the Spurs were once again matched with Grizzlies in the first round. San Antonio again defeated Memphis 4–2, with Parker averaging 16.3 points per game in the series. After scoring 18 points in Game 2 of the second round, a win against the Houston Rockets, Parker left the game with a rupture <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> quadriceps tendon that will preclude his return to the playoffs and may miss eight months. Game 3 of the series marked San Antonio's first postseason game without Parker since 2001, which ended an NBA record of 221 straight playoff appearances for Parker.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 the new railway {{opened and}} by the end of the year was {{carrying}} freight. Bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of traffic carried by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade depression. However Bradshaw's tactics led to a sharp decline in profits. At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the Macclesfield Canal in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands. In November 1831 Bradshaw suffered a stroke, as a result of which he lost the use <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> arm and leg, and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.|$|E
5|$|In late 1873, Brunner {{suffered}} a paralysis <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> side which {{prevented him from}} working. By mid-April 1874, he had sufficiently recovered to begin soliciting the provincial government for suitable employment. However, {{on the morning of}} 22 April he {{suffered a}} stroke and died few hours later. His funeral service was held at Nelson Cathedral and was attended by several hundred people. A large Māori contingent, including his long-time friend Kehu, was also present. Brunner was buried at Wakapuaka Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, who moved to England soon after his death. She lived with her brother until her death in 1895. The couple had no children.|$|E
