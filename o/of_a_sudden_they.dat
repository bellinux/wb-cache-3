2500|$|Despite {{the doubts}} about Lanier's {{portrayal}} as Chrissy, Silverman put {{the show on}} the network lineup, to air in March 1977, yet ordered {{a search for a}} new Chrissy. In an interview with The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation, Silverman said that Suzanne Somers barely made it {{as a member of the}} cast. [...] "I was very involved in the casting of Suzanne Somers. We did three pilots", he recalls, [...] "and the Chrissy character still wasn't right. We got to the day before we're starting the production of the series and we didn't have a Chrissy. I was so desperate, I took all the audition tapes and just kind of fast forwarded them. All <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>they</b> went by Suzanne Somers who I hadn't seen, but I recognized her from her appearance on The Tonight Show, I said 'back that up' and she was great. She's been passed on! And I said 'I don't understand. This girl could play that part, why was she been passed on?' and I couldn't get a straight answer. Anyway, we got her in that day and she was on the set tomorrow and she was terrific in that part. And that was an accident because she never should have gotten the part.". With Somers set in the role the third pilot hastily went into production in January 1977. NRW had initially thought about recasting Ritter at the last minute before the pilot taped. Although liked by test audiences, the producers felt Ritter's foolish and clumsy portrayal of Jack made his character seem somewhat effeminate; Barry Van Dyke, and future television director Michael Lembeck, who had originally auditioned for the now renamed Jack Tripper, were initially considered to take the role. Nonetheless Silverman championed for Ritter to stay on the show. The third pilot was accepted by ABC, and [...] was followed by five additional episodes for the show's spring tryout.|$|E

40|$|Global {{imbalances}} {{have become}} <b>a</b> major source <b>of</b> systemic {{risk to the}} global economy. They can have adverse repercussions in the {{short and long term}} on both surplus and deficit economies due to the potentially disruptive effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> adjustment. <b>They</b> can be amplified by short term speculation that prevents the real exchange rate to perform its adjusting role. The paper examines past and recent patterns of destabilizing short term speculative flows that have led to financial fragility and real costs for <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> various economies. China has been able to control large speculative inflows and <b>an</b> uncontrolled appreciation <b>of</b> its currency by employing non-monetary anti-inflationary policies, keeping interest rate low, and keeping tight control on the capital account. This policies may not be fully viable in the long run, but may be still of crucial importance while the country is strengthening its banking system and exchange rate market and should be coupled with globally coordinated policies to reduce global imbalances. Among the latter intermediate exchange rate regimes or regional cooperative schemes should be favoured.

As it was to serve TFM, the stretch of line [...] connecting Madrid to Arganda del Rey (the first extension of the Metro network outside Madrid proper), its interior resembles the regional Cercanías trains more closely than any other Metro trains: compact seats in couples set perpendicularly to the train walls, more places to grasp in case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> brake/acceleration, etc. <b>They</b> were also the first to include luminous panels stating their destination, as the line they service was effectively split in two stretches, and travellers had to switch trains at Puerta de Arganda.
