5|$|McCudden's {{fortunes}} {{changed in}} the new year. He dispatched a two-seater on 26 January and another on 2 February 1917. On 5 February he attacked a Albatros C.III returning from a photo-reconnaissance mission. Diving <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> to blind the gunner, he shot it down over the frontline where it was shelled by British artillery. Ten days later he engaged an Albatros escorted by a LFG Roland C.II. After a brief dogfight and pursuit, the Albatros escaped but he destroyed the Roland which crashed near Monchy. Twenty-four hours later McCudden was awarded the Military Cross for his fifth victory. His award was gazetted on 12 March.|$|E
5|$|It {{was felt}} that too long had elapsed {{in both cases}} between the German {{warships}} being spotted {{and the arrival of}} the strike force, and to rectify matters, it was decided to carry out reconnaissance in force, with formations of bombers being sent out over the North Sea to find and attack German warships. Their orders forbade them from attacking ships in port, infringing neutral airspace or even attacking German warships escorting merchant ships. A patrol on 29 September resulted in five Hampdens being shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109s, of II./JG 77, but an attack by 24 Wellingtons of No. 149, No. 38 Squadron RAF and No. 115 Squadron RAF on 3 December was more successful, claiming a German minesweeper sunk (confirmed by German archives), while defensive fire from the Wellington gun turrets repelled attacks by German fighters, shooting one down without loss to the bombers. The German pilot shot down was future German ace Günther Specht. He was shot down by Corporal Copley of No. 38 Squadron RAF. The German ships were the Brummer and the minesweeper M1407 both sunk by unexploded bombs passing through the ship. A German report stated the attack was cleverly executed from <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> and delivered to avoid the nearby civilian areas.|$|E

25|$|In {{people with}} {{naturally}} occurring dark skin, the tanning occurs with the dramatic mobilization of melanin upward in the epidermis and continues {{with the increased}} production of melanin.

25|$|Studies {{have found}} that sunburns and {{too much time in}} the sun can {{increase}} the risk factors for melanoma. This is in addition to those who have dysplastic nevi being at higher risk of this cancer (the uncertainty is in regard to acquiring benign moles). To prevent and reduce the risk of melanoma caused by UV radiation, the American Academy of Dermatology and the National Cancer Institute recommends staying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. standard time (or whenever one's shadow is shorter than one's height).

25|$|It {{became evident}} that the new fighters could make long, steep dives and that the fixed, {{synchronised}} machine gun was aimed by aiming the aircraft. The machine gun was belt-fed, unlike the drum-fed Lewis guns of their opponents. The Fokker pilots took to flying high and diving on their quarry, usually <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range. If the British aircraft had not been shot down, the German pilot could climb again and repeat the process. Immelmann invented the Immelmann turn, a zoom after the dive, followed by a roll when vertical, to face the opposite way, after which he could turn to attack again.|$|E
25|$|A dog-fight {{occurred}} {{near the}} Dorset coast, when 87 Squadron attacked the escort <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> and the squadron leader, John Dewar, hit the Bf110 of Staffelkäpitain Oberleutnant Gerhard Kadow; the aircraft crash-landed and Kadow tried to destroy his aircraft but {{was shot by}} approaching soldiers. Oberleutnant Hans-Joachim Göring, nephew of Hermann Göring and his gunner Unteroffizier Albert Zimmermann crashed into a cliff top at the Verne Citadel on the Isle of Portland, both being killed. Leutnant Friedrich-Wolfgang Graf von und zu Castell tried to help Göring but was killed, four Bf110s from 9. Staffel being lost with their crews. A Ju87 was destroyed and another force-landed, the light Stuka losses were {{a result of the}} Bf110s bearing the brunt of the attacks. One Hurricane was slightly damaged and its pilot unhurt. Hans-Joachim Göring was the first German fighter pilot to die on British soil. The British steamer Kylemount (704 GRT) was damaged off Dartmouth and the steamers Peru (6,961 GRT) and City of Melbourne (6,630 GRT) were damaged in Portland harbour. Eleanor Brooke (1,037 GRT) was damaged off Portland and the Dutch steamer Mies (309 GRT) was damaged south of Portland Bill.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} few weeks 609 Squadron had moved from RAF Northolt to RAF Middle Wallop.

Failing to find the convoy the Spitfires engaged German {{aircraft}} at [...] near Portland, England. Flying in R6634 Dundas led a diving attack <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> against Messerschmitt Bf 110s. Dundas claimed a Bf 110 destroyed though the damaged aircraft and its wounded pilot, Leutnant Krebitz, made it back to France, where the Bf 110 was severely damaged in a crash-landing. In late July while night-flying Dundas narrowly escaped with his life; coming into land, his wing struck an artillery emplacement. He landed without injury.|$|E
500|$|The {{plan was}} for Nos. 72 and 92 {{to engage the}} high escort. No. 603 Squadron RAF would arrive on the scene just {{afterward}} and get at the close escort (JG 3).

500|$|Eaton's combat {{career began}} inauspiciously, {{when he was}} shot down three times in the space of ten days.

After the fighting had died down he made his way over to the New Zealanders, who gave him a lift back to his air base. The second time he was shot down, his plane was struck by 88mm anti-aircraft fire, necessitating another crash landing, this time behind enemy lines. Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield. Two days later, his P-40 was hit by fire from an Me109 that dived at him from <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun.</b> He was able to glide back to base, [...] away, but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers. He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs, and managed to do so without mishap. His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism, and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty: [...] "I just couldn't see myself living when so many were dying.
