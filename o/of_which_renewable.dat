40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} on renewable energy sources integrated into the Romanian power system on the electrical network operation considering the reduction of electricity consumption {{with respect to the}} 1990 s. This decrease has led to increased difficulties in integrating the renewable energy sources into the power system (network reinforcements), as well as issues concerning the balance of production/consumption. Following the excess of certain proportions of the energy mix, intermittent renewable energy sources require the expansion of networks, storage, back-up capacities and efforts for a flexible consumption, in the absence <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>renewable</b> energy sources cannot be used or the grid can be overloaded. To highlight the difficulty of connecting some significant capacities installed in wind power plants and photovoltaic installation, the paper presents a case study for Dobrogea area that has the most installed capacity from renewable energy sources in operation...|$|E
40|$|Cyprus is {{an island}} in the Mediterranean Sea. It has an {{isolated}} electricity grid and energy system which is fully reliant on imported fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels for electricity generation has a negative impact on the environment due to the greenhouse gas emissions and importing the fuels places a huge burden on the economy of the country and a risk in terms of the electricity supply security of the island. One way to reduce dependency on imported fuels is to implement renewable energy solutions in the island. There are many studies assessing the availability of renewable energy sources, evaluating future electricity demand and investigating methods of demand reduction in Cyprus but there are a very limited number of studies specifically produced for Cyprus that address the integration and cost of renewable energy sources and explore their effects on the grid system. This thesis illustrates the big picture of Cyprus in terms of availability of exploitable renewable energy sources, current electricity generation and electricity demand characteristics. In order to address the grid code barrier, the grid codes of developed European countries are investigated. From this research, amendments to the current grid are produced. These additional mandatory codes will form the infrastructure for renewable energy projects and bring knowledge to the current system operator from other experienced countries. In addition renewable energy technologies worldwide are investigated in terms of output capacity, energy pricing, investment, and operation costs. Pricing and cost information is applied to the case of Cyprus. By further optimizing the technologies appropriately to Cyprus conditions, current and future cost analysis is produced. By producing reliable data on the cost and performance of renewable energy technologies the significant barrier to the uptake of these technologies is lowered. This will enable governments and financial bodies to arrive at an accurate assessment <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>renewable</b> energy technologies are the most appropriate for their particular circumstances...|$|E
40|$|Alternative energy sources, {{including}} wind energy, {{are often}} subject to scepticism. In general, society has a dual feeling about it, {{on the one}} hand the need is realised on the other hand a ‘not in my backyard‘ feeling is experienced. This combined with the ever changing attitude and approach of national and international politics, the renewable energy industry has difficulties to find its place in society. On a long term vision however the necessity of renewable energy sources is very clear since the supply of fossil fuels will, whether it is a sudden drop or a slow decline, eventually run out. The debate <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>renewable</b> energy source will eventually dominate in the long run is still ongoing. Looking back on the developments over the last decades wind energy has seen a dramatic increase in both the number of installed wind turbines and the amount of power produced by each. Wind turbine design has seen major changes developed by wind turbine manufacturers which increase the market potential by minimising the production, transportation, installation and maintenance costs. An effective way of reducing the costs of a wind turbine is {{to reduce the amount of}} material used for the production. This weight reduction could result in increased flexibility of the components which could introduce localised dynamic behaviour of the components, which in turn can lead to increased loading and wear and reduced reliability. Therefore an important aspect of the wind turbine design is adequate knowledge and prediction of its dynamic behaviour. A versatile modelling technique to determine this behaviour is that of dynamic substructuring and model reduction. The general paradigm of this technique is to divide the large and complex structure into smaller and less complex component models which are individually reduced or simplified. These reduced models are then assembled to form a model which can be used to obtain the global dynamic behaviour in a computationally efficient way. One of the difficulties often encountered using traditional reduction methods such as the Craig-Bampton and Dual Craig-Bampton methods is the accurate representation of the response to forced excitation of a component model, either via its interface or from an external force. In this thesis the modal truncation augmentation (MTA) method is proposed to overcome these limitations by augmenting the mentioned reduction methods. By doing so the reduction basis of component models are a priori enriched using special load dependent vectors. One of the more general difficulties encountered in dynamic substructuring and model reduction is to determine how to create the smallest possible reduced model which still is adequately accurate. This is determined by choosing the level of refinement of each component model. A higher level of refinement in general increases the accuracy of the model but also increases the simulation time and required storage space. To overcome these issues error estimation techniques based on a posteriori knowledge are proposed. These techniques use a conservative estimation of the error without knowledge of the exact response and can be used to determine which component models are to be refined to efficiently increase the overall accuracy. In addition to general wind turbine optimisation a trend is observed of ‘going offshore‘ where massive wind farms are installed producing large amounts of energy. This extension of the realm of wind turbines also gives rise to new engineering challenges. The structures used to support the turbines introduce a complex dynamic coupling between it and the turbine. This combined with the constant wind and wave excitation further increases the need for an accurate dynamic model. In line with this trend of going offshore an investigation is set up to apply the augmented reduction methods to the dynamic model of a jacket support structure which is attached to an 5 megawatt (MW) offshore wind turbine. By analysing the time varying wave loads applied to the jacket structure using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method, spatial force shapes are extracted and used to enrich its reduction basis with load dependent vectors. Using the same POD method, the dynamic response of this reduced model can be compared to that of the unreduced model and reduced models obtained using traditional methods. By doing so it is shown that the dynamic response using the augmented reduction methods gives improved results. In addition to this comparison the error estimation techniques are applied to the same model to test its usage in wind turbine engineering. It is shown that both the error on the dynamic response to an external harmonic load based on wave loads and the global eigensolutions can be conservatively estimated. Furthermore, the models are iteratively reduced to obtain an optimal level of refinement for each component model. This work shows that opportunities still lie in the development of a practical tool and further theoretical development of the error estimation techniques. Furthermore, combining the best of both worlds by using error estimation techniques combined with the MTA method could lead to more optimized wind turbine design, making wind energy a worthy contender in the battle for the new world energy supplier.

40|$|Increasing {{interest}} {{is currently being}} addressed to multi-energy systems in buildings. These systems integrate different energy sources, at least one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> is <b>renewable,</b> in order to cover the thermal and electrical loads of a building. Since the design and operation of such systems are very complicated for many reasons (e. g. the intermittent nature of the renewable sources, the highly interlinked system layouts), it is of the foremost importance to provide tools to help select the best system configuration and energy sources mix. A modelling approach to multi-energy systems in buildings, based on the energy hub concept is presented in this work. This approach allows the coupling between the energy demand and the energy supply in a building to be modelled in a synthetic way. The model was customised to be used at the concept stage of the building design, either as a system simulation tool or as a system selection tool. If the prices and {{the characteristics of the}} energy converters and of the energy-wares are known, it is possible, with a certain set of constraints, to determine the configuration that minimises the initial investment costs, the use of non-renewable sources or the life-cycle costs.

40|$|Abstract The global {{economic}} system {{depends on the}} sustainable use of natural resources some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> are <b>renewable</b> whilst the others are finite and non-renewable. There has been an increasing need to reduce the use of non-renewable resources particularly within the transportation sector, which is the major consumer of fossil fuels and thus {{responsible for most of}} the carbon dioxide emissions and pollution worldwide. High-Speed Rail (HSR) can provide a more sustainable and efficient use of energy and land whilst reducing emissions and pollution compared with road transport and other modes of transport. The reported research takes the form of an investigation and critical evaluation of key existing factors that influence the sustainability of HSR in terms of the efficient use of natural resources. From the evidence that has been gathered from different resources and related critical evaluation, conclusions can be made to show that the development of HSR systems will improve the sustainability of transport in general and reduces the amount of non-renewable natural resources used by the transport industry. The secondary data methodology has been used in this research supported by empirical evidences. Most of the data was gathered from the internet including in depth research of HSR in selected countries, available railway statistics and relevant European and Institutional publications. The main findings are that in many cases, HSR can bring a benefit for society by contributing to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions produced by the transport industry, reduces the consumption of raw materials, and increases the use of sustainable energy. The expected outcomes of this research will contribute to the development and advances of more sustainable HSR systems that can meet the growing demand for travel due to the continuing growth of the world population and the increasing activities related to business, leisure, and social needs...|$|R
