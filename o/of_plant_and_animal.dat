Adders, Britain's only native venomous snake, are seen on the Moss, and prey upon small rodents, such as voles. Many wild bird species inhabit Salta and the surrounding area, including larger species such as pheasants, which are also bred locally for hunting.|$|E
5|$|Over nine-tenths of {{the total}} biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence. More than 2 million species <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> life have been {{identified}} to date, and estimates of {{the actual number of}} existing species range from several million to well over 50million. The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis. The total number of species is in rapid decline.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{more typical}} {{locations}} across the Mojave Desert, {{many of the}} water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> species that are not found {{anywhere else in the}} world. The existence of these species is due largely to a unique geologic history and the process of evolution that has progressed in habitats that have been isolated from one another since the Pleistocene epoch.|$|E
5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a new {{emphasis}} on observing, classifying, and cataloging nature, 16th century natural philosophers in Europe began to establish extensive collections of fossil objects (as well as collections <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> specimens), which were often stored in specially built cabinets to help organize them. Conrad Gesner published a 1565 work on fossils that contained one of the first detailed descriptions of such a cabinet and collection. The collection belonged to a member of the extensive network of correspondents that Gesner drew on for his works. Such informal correspondence networks among natural philosophers and collectors became increasingly important {{during the course of the}} 16th century and were direct forerunners of the scientific societies that would begin to form in the 17th century. These cabinet collections and correspondence networks played an important role in the development of natural philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Daspletosaurus {{lived in}} a vast {{floodplain}} along the western shore of the interior seaway. Large rivers watered the land, occasionally flooding and blanketing the region with new sediment. When water was plentiful, the region could support a great deal <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> life, but periodic droughts also struck the region, resulting in mass mortality as preserved in the many bonebed deposits found in Two Medicine and Judith River sediments, including the Daspletosaurus bonebed. Similar conditions exist today in East Africa. Volcanic eruptions from the west periodically blanketed the region with ash, also resulting in large-scale mortality, while simultaneously enriching the soil for future plant growth. It is these ash beds that allow precise radiometric dating as well. Fluctuating sea levels also resulted {{in a variety of}} other environments at different times and places within the Judith River Group, including offshore and nearshore marine habitats, coastal wetlands, deltas and lagoons, in addition to the inland floodplains. The Two Medicine Formation was deposited at higher elevations farther inland than the other two formations.|$|E
5|$|Dissolved {{oxygen in}} fresh water is {{measured}} {{to indicate the}} health <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including {{the mouth of the}} Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of Christmas, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek. Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Proto-globalization {{distinguished}} {{itself from}} modern globalization {{on the basis}} of expansionism, the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period of proto-globalization is marked by such trade arrangements as the East India Company, the shift of hegemony to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Year War, and a rise of new commoditiesâ€”most particularly slave trade. The Triangular Trade made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the western hemisphere. The transfer <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> crops and epidemic diseases associated with Alfred Crosby's concept of The Columbian Exchange also {{played a central role in}} this process. Proto-globalization trade and communications involved a vast group including European, Muslim, Indian, Southeast Asian and Chinese merchants, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.|$|E

5|$|South Florida is a {{transitional}} zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones, {{resulting in a}} wide variety <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> life. The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, that are not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay salinity varies accordingly, with lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland and transitional zones. It has adapted well to urban environments {{and is a}} common city bird in Sydney, Canberra and Perth. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> material, as well as food waste from urban areas. In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated {{with the presence of}} sheep, and it has been blamed for killing lambs. However, this is very rare, and the raven most often scavenges for afterbirth and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb faeces. The Australian raven is territorial, with pairs generally bonding for life. Breeding takes place between July and September, with almost no variation across its range. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree, or occasionally in a man-made structure such as a windmill or other building.|$|E
5|$|The process {{involves}} procedurally-generated {{basic elements}} like elevation, rainfall, mineral distribution, drainage and temperature. For example, a high-rainfall and low-drainage area {{would make a}} swamp. Areas are thus categorized into biomes, which have two variables: savagery and alignment. They have their own specific type <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> populations. The next phase is erosionâ€”which the drainage simulates. Rivers are created by tracing their paths from the mountains (which get eroded) to its end which is usually an ocean; some form into lakes. The salinity field defines oceans, mangroves or alluvial plains. Names are generated for the biomes and rivers. The names depend on the area's good/evil variable (the alignment) and though in English, they are originally {{in one of the}} four in-game languages of dwarves, elves, humans and goblins; these are the four main races in any generated world.|$|E

5|$|The Mesolithic {{lasted from}} 9000 BCE (rapid climate warming) to 5500 BCE (arrival of first farmers from the Danube River area). It {{was the last}} period when the food {{production}} economy was entirely opportunistic, based on assimilation <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> material found in nature, that is gathering and hunting. Because of warmer temperatures, complex forest ecosystems and wetlands developed and this natural diversity necessitated new hunting and fishing strategies. As new populations entered Poland from the west, hunters and fishermen working individually or in small groups had to pursue single large and small animals using traps, javelins, bows and arrows, boats and fishing equipment, and utilizing dogs. Women engaged in gathering of such products as roots, herbs, nuts, bird eggs, mollusks, fruit or honey, which possibly was {{even more important than}} hunting. Mesolithic human settlements became quite numerous {{and by the end of}} this period the economy of harvesting nature became very highly developed. Tools and devices were made of materials such as stone (flint strip mines have been found at the northern edge of ÅšwiÄ™tokrzyskie Mountains), bone, wood, horn, or plant material for rope and baskets, and included such fine utensils as fishing hooks and sewing needles. Animal figurines were made of amber. At least during the later Mesolithic, the dead were placed in graves and outfitted with familiar objects of their surroundings. One such well preserved grave of an apparent tool-maker, together with his tools and other items, was found in JanisÅ‚awice near Skierniewice and dated 5500 BCE.|$|E
