5|$|Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on {{an earlier}} four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student. At that time, the main {{characters}} {{that make up the}} student council were instead members of the drama club. However, Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, and she decided {{it would be easier to}} manage a cross-dressing character if he was in the student council. Before creating Himegoto, Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys, but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys. When she proposed the idea of Himegoto, she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls, which Tsukudani herself wanted to read. In this way, she thought that a variety <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>people</b> would enjoy it.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of places of worship in Summer Hill. St Patrick's Catholic Church was built in 1874, and is the oldest known {{building}} in the suburb. There is also a small primary school associated with the church and located next to it. The building was originally a private home known as Kelvin Grove, and owned by Mrs Jane Drynan. Much of the exterior of the church is original but none of the internal walls were retained when the building was converted into a church. Following Drynan's death, Kelvin Grove was owned or leased by a succession <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>people,</b> including the Haberfield real-estate developer Richard Stanton, Croydon brick-maker William Downton, and two sisters named Freeman (one of whom was a nurse). In the 1920s and 1930s Kelvin Grove may have been used as a nursing home. The first mass was celebrated in Kelvin Grove on St Patrick's day 1946, giving the church its name.|$|E

25|$|What can {{be viewed}} as a success by those inside and outside the church from this focus is a higher level of {{cooperation}} and friendliness among churches and denominations. It is very common for those working on international fields to not only cooperate in efforts to share their gospel message, but view the work of their groups in a similar light. Also, with the increased study and awareness <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>people</b> groups, western mission efforts have become far more sensitive to the cultural nuances of those they are going to and those they are working with in the effort.|$|E
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk to a lot <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>people</b> at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E

25|$|Hertzog {{decided to}} retire {{as leader of}} the HNP in 1977, and gave his {{farewell}} address on 27 May of that year. He officially retired on 28 May 1977, and was followed by Jaap Marais as party leader. During his retirement, Hertzog could devote more time to his numerous business endeavors and his hobby of gardening. In a press interview in 1979 he opined as follows: “In my view our political landscape is developing {{in the direction of a}} large, new conservative party which will consist <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>people</b> who are still currently trying to tread their own path. It can be a party consisting of the Treurnicht people in the NP, the Connie Mulder people, the HNP and definitely also conservative English speakers.” This proved to be prophetic, as in 1982 a massive split occurred within the ruling National Party, and the Conservative Party came into being, with Andries Treurnicht as leader.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{simplicity}} {{depends on}} the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>people).</b> Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require brokers and mutual funds to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% {{of the amount of}} the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers {{at the end of the}} period. Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies.|$|E
25|$|The {{comparative}} use of Census Bureau data, {{as well as}} most {{sources of}} demographic income data, has been questioned by statisticians for being unable to account for 'mobility of incomes'. At any given time, the Census Bureau ranks all households by household income and then divides this distribution of households into quintiles. The highest-ranked household in each quintile provides the upper income limit for each quintile. Comparing changes in these upper income limits for different quintiles is how changes are measured between one moment in time and the next. The problem with inferring income inequality on this basis is that the census statistics provide only a snapshot of income distribution in the U.S., at individual points in time. The statistics do not reflect the reality that income for many households changes over time – i.e., incomes are mobile. For most people, income increases over time as they move from their first, low-paying job in high school to a better-paying job later in their lives. Also, some people lose income over time because of business-cycle contractions, demotions, career changes, retirement, etc. The implication of changing individual incomes is that individual households do not remain in the same income quintiles over time. Thus, comparing different income quintiles over time is like comparing apples to oranges, because it means comparing incomes <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>people</b> at different stages in their earnings profile.|$|E

Then in 2014 began charges and counter-charges between university officials and former learning specialist Mary Willingham, including disputes about statistics and methods of analysis by Willingham alleging that certain student-athletes are not academically qualified for college. Additionally, former basketball player Rashad McCants, {{a member of the}} North Carolina basketball team that won the 2005 NCAA championship, said that he took substandard classes and had much of his classwork done by tutors. As a result of these revelations, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed the university on probation for one year, which ended in June 2016. The NCAA completed its investigation in October of 2017, finding no violations of the NCAA's rules and imposing no athletic punishments. It affected a variety <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>people</b> in different ways, including coaches, players, judges, politicians, academics, rivals, whistleblowers, lawyers, alumni, mascots, college administrators, the NCAA, state governors, and journalists. The controversy sparked debate as to whether the university was educating some of its student-athletes properly and the role of NCAA Division I athletics in colleges.|$|E
