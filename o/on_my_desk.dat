500|$|At his {{confirmation}} hearings in 2017, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recalled being moved by reading Sumner's gravestone {{as a law}} student at Harvard. Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. I keep them <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, I can ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power to be that man." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1961, John Houbolt {{had sent}} a paper advocating lunar orbit {{rendezvous}} (LOR) to Robert Seamans, the deputy administrator of NASA. As Shea remembered, [...] "Seamans gave a copy of Houbolt's letter to Brainerd Holmes [...] Holmes put the letter <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> and said: Figure it out." [...] Shea {{became involved in the}} lunar orbit rendezvous decision {{as a result of this}} letter. While he began with a mild preference for earth orbit rendezvous, Shea [...] "prided himself", according to space historians Murray and Cox, [...] "on going wherever the data took him". In this case, the data took him to NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where he met with John Houbolt and with the Space Task Group, and became convinced that LOR was an option worth considering.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} the 1992 {{election}} MacKenzie {{used the}} front-page headline [...] "If Kinnock Wins Today, Will The Last Person To Leave Britain Please Turn Out The Lights", accompanied by a picture of Kinnock's head superimposed over a lightbulb. While the paper initially supported the government of John Major, because it appeared that Major himself shared the ideological hostility of Thatcher towards European integration, this soon changed. Following the UK's forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992, according to MacKenzie, Major telephoned him to ask about how the paper would report the story. While Major has denied the conversation ever took place, MacKenzie has claimed his response was: [...] "Prime Minister, I have <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> in front of me a very large bucket of shit which I am just about to pour all over you." ...|$|E

Stick that valise <b>on</b> top <b>my</b> <b>desk....</b> Sit down, Mr. Wrenn. You see, it's like this: I'll tell you in confidence, you understand. This letter from Bryff ain't worth the paper it's written on. He ain't got any right to be sending out men for cattle-boats. Me, I'm running that. I deal direct with all the Boston and Portland lines. If you don't believe it just {{go out in the}} back room and ask any of the cattlemen out there." ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{think of}} that view, so {{variously}} spacious in effect, I am back there, and this sunlit paper might be lamp-lit and lying <b>on</b> <b>my</b> old <b>desk.</b> I see it all again, feel it all again. In the foreground is a green shaded lamp and crumpled galley slips and paged proofs and letters, two or three papers in manuscript, and so forth. In the shadows are chairs and another table bearing papers and books, a rotating bookcase dimly seen, a long window seat black in the darkness, and then the cool unbroken spectacle of the window. How often I would watch some tram-car, some string of barges go from me slowly out of sight. The people were black animalculae by day, clustering, collecting, dispersing, by night, they were phantom face-specks coming, vanishing, stirring obscurely between light and shade.|$|R
40|$|Walking {{through the}} supermarket, I see the avocados. I {{know they are}} avocados. Similarly, {{if you see a}} pumpkin <b>on</b> <b>my</b> office <b>desk,</b> you can know it’s a pumpkin from its looks. The {{phenomenology}} in such cases is that of “just seeing” that such and such. This phenomenology might suggest that the knowledge gained is immediate. This paper argues, to the contrary, that in these target cases, the knowledge is mediate, depending as it does on one’s knowledge of what the relevant kind of thing looks like. To make the case requires examining the nature of knowing what Fs look like. Is such knowledge to be understood as knowledge of a fact, or rather as a kind of ability? From the conclusion that the knowledge in the target cases is not immediate, the paper concludes that perception does not afford us immediate knowledge concerning objects’ kinds.

50|$|As I lay on {{the floor}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back, the brick wall behind <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> blew out. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion. The wall fell <b>on</b> <b>my</b> legs; I could not feel them. I thought they were gone. The office filled with smoke, dust, and tear gas. What {{happened}} was that the blast first blew in the window and then traveled up an air shaft from the first floor to behind <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> We had had tear gas canisters on the first floor. The blast set them off so that the air rush that came up through the shaft brought the tear gas with it and also collapsed the wall.|$|R

60|$|I {{am working}} {{through a series}} of readings, widely {{dispersed}} through England, Scotland, and Ireland, and am so constantly occupied that it is {{very difficult for me to}} write letters. I have received your highly esteemed note (forwarded from my home in Kent), and should have replied to it sooner but that I had a hope of being able to get home and see your present first. As I have not been able to do so, however, and am hardly likely to do so for two months to come, I delay no longer. It is safely awaiting me <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own <b>desk</b> in <b>my</b> own quiet room. I cannot thank you for it too cordially, and cannot too earnestly assure you that I shall always prize it highly. The terms in which you send me that mark of your remembrance are more gratifying to me than I can possibly express to you; for they assure me that there is nothing but goodwill left between you and me and a people for whom I have a real regard, and to whom I would not wilfully have given an offence or done an injustice for any worldly consideration.|$|R
