It is assumed that orthogonally polarized photons would be equally deflected by the gravitational field of a nonrotating mass.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel {{planar array}} antenna for {{multi-band}} linear polarization discrimination is proposed. The proposed array antenna consists of 12 patch elements and a double-balanced multiplier. A slot-ring and four diodes {{used in the}} multiplier also act as an antenna and amplitude detector, respectively. Furthermore, slot lines which are parts of feeding circuits also act as slot antennas. The Both-sided MIC technology is effectively employed to realize the feeding circuit which eliminates the extra impedance matching circuit. The array antenna is realized in a very simple and compact structure as all the antenna elements, feeding circuit and the multiplier/amplitude detector are arranged {{on both sides of}} a substrate.

40|$|Due to {{the mirror}} {{symmetry}} breaking, chiral structures show fantastic electromagnetic (EM) properties involving negative refraction, giant optical activity, and asymmetric transmission. Aligned electric and magnetic dipoles excited in chiral structures contribute to extraordinary properties. However, the chiral structures that exhibit n-fold rotational symmetry show limited tuning capability. In this paper, we proposed a compact, light, and highly tunable anisotropic chiral structure to overcome this limitation and realize a linear-to-circular polarization conversion. The anisotropy is due to simultaneous excitations of two different pairs of aligned electric and magnetic dipoles. The 3 D omega-like structure, etched on two sides of one PCB board and connected by metallic vias, achieves 60 % of linearto- circular conversion (transmission) efficiency at the operating frequency of 9. 2 GHz. The desired 90 -degree phase shift between the two <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> components is {{not only from the}} finite-thickness dielectric substrate but also from the anisotropic chiral response slightly off the resonance.

We {{have studied the}} injected optical power required for PS {{as a function of}} the frequency detuning between the injected light and the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> of the VCSEL. For a wide range of bias currents applied to the device, the injected power required for the occurrence of PS exhibited a minimum and a plateau with respect to the frequency detuning. The minimum (plateau) was found at negative (positive) frequency detuning. The bistable behavior of the polarization is described. Our experimental results confirm the theoretical predictions of Sciamanna and Panajotov. The levels of the minimum and the plateau were observed to increase as higher bias currents were applied to the VCSEL. A first theoretical and experimental observation of the disappearance and further appearance of PS when increasing the injected power in long-wavelength VCSELs is described.

By taking advantage of computational imaging techniques, the light measured by each single-pixel detector can reconstruct a 2 D image for a specific linear polarization state.
