5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem {{could not be sure}} how she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the males}} and females become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate after the age of four to five years. Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying to rub his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E
5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with black hair held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist. Her usual fighting outfit, in which she has appeared {{in most of the}} games, is a type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless upper garment, baggy pants (slit at the sides), arm guards, and a mask that conceals the lower half of her face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages wrapped around her shins, ankles and instep. Ibuki's alternative, everyday costume is a blue-and-white Japanese schoolgirl uniform, or casual clothes—in the same color scheme—with a chain of miniature kunai knives and a fake tanuki tail, introduced in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

5|$|If a P. schultzi female is mature, a male P. schultzi {{will try}} to copulate with her, or cohabit with a subadult female and copulate while she is moulting. They usually mate on a web or on a {{dragline}} made by the female, and P. schultzi typically copulates for about 100seconds, while others in the genus can take several minutes or even several hours. Females try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. Contests between Portia females are violent, and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60seconds. Sometimes, one female knocks the other <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. When hunting, P. schultzi mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk that any other females, males, or juveniles {{of the same species}} may contend for the same prey.|$|E
5|$|In Vagrant Story, the Iocus priesthood of {{the kingdom}} of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, {{although}} they follow the teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde. Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia, and bore the rood <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic, seeing it as an abomination, and yet its higher members continue to use it behind the scenes. This hypocrisy is revealed {{over the course of the}} story, though it goes unresolved.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, {{he gave her a}} big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E

5|$|In early {{drafts of}} Final Fantasy VII, Tifa {{was to be}} a {{background}} character. Her role in AVALANCHE was to add support behind the scenes, and to cheer everyone up after missions, as well as having a particular fondness for Cloud. She was also supposed to have a large scar <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> caused by Cloud, and partial amnesia from the incident when she had received it. A scene intended to imply herself and Cloud having sex was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but it was replaced with a toned down version by Kitase in which a risqué line is followed by a fade to black. In an interview Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become such an issue at the time.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Voyagers {{exposure to the}} swarm, Kes (Jennifer Lien) begins eating abnormally, including insects and soil. In sickbay, she has a fever, a dangerously elevated pulse and blood pressure, and a tumorous growth <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> She resists the ’s (Robert Picardo) treatment and locks herself in his office, finally relenting only to explain to Captain Janeway that she's undergoing the elogium: the Ocampa mating cycle. This process only happens once and usually affects Ocampa between four and five years old—but Kes is not even two. Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and Kes agonize over whether to have children and the ramifications of becoming parents. After discussing children and family with Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ), Neelix decides he's ready to be a father, while Kes has instead decided against it. Ultimately, because the Doctor believes the elogium was artificially induced by the creatures' proximity to the ship, it may come upon her again later in her life when she is ready.|$|E
5|$|Megan {{receives}} backlash from Kate for {{not following}} procedure, but clay found in both Lizzy and Joe's pockets match. Samantha realizes that Joe found {{the crime scene}} of Lizzy's murder; the tennis courts at her school. Kate and Megan study her body and find a hand impression <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> which matches {{one of her friends}} Heather Clayton (Meg Chambers Steedle). Heather killed Lizzy after she broke her finger during a lacrosse game. Lizzy's body was found elsewhere, meaning Heather had help moving the body, so Megan finds out that Lou helped Heather. Lou also admits killing Joe, as he was getting too close to the truth. After they arrest them, Megan revisits her mother Joan, asking to exhume her father’s body. Joan declines the request, telling Megan to leave him be. Megan and Samantha revisit Helen and Becky, revealing that Joe had an undiagnosed brain disorder, causing the emotional distance from the two, telling them that Joe helped solve the Lizzy Adler case.|$|E

5|$|Sen discovers paper shikigami {{attacking a}} dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku transformed. When a grievously-injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. When she reaches Haku, a shikigami that stowed away <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> {{transforms}} into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She transforms Yubaba's baby son Boh into a mouse, creates a decoy baby and turns Yubaba's bird creature {{into a tiny}} bird. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. After Haku dives to the boiler room with Sen and Boh on his back, she feeds him part of the dumpling, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.|$|E
5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed with her head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E
5|$|The next arc, Summer, reveals {{events that}} {{occurred}} in the summer of one thousand years before the Dream arc, taking place in the Heian period. Kannabi no mikoto, or Kanna, {{is one of the last}} winged beings in Airs fictional setting and is held as a prisoner in her own castle. Since she bears wings <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> she is not permitted to leave the castle walls or see her mother, who is in a similar situation elsewhere. With Ryūya, a member of her samurai guard, and Uraha, a fledgling telekinetic, Kanna escapes and traverses feudal Japan to find her mother. However, the rest of the guard and a sect of Buddhist monks follow them. After catching up, they place a curse on Kanna where she must endure constant reincarnation and death whenever she finds love; Misuzu is one such reincarnation.|$|E

5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna the beetle <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to turn left again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make that turn, but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck and let it hit her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to turn left out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message into her ear for the Doctor. The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. The beetle falls off of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E
5|$|The character's backstory is {{explored}} {{throughout the}} sixth season of Desperate Housewives. Angela de Luca lived in New York City with her mother, Rose De Luca (Suzanne Costallos). At age eighteen, she {{dropped out of}} college, where she was enrolled as an engineering major, and joined a band of eco-terrorists, led by Patrick Logan (John Barrowman), with whom she became romantically involved. Patrick asked her to build a bomb {{that would be used}} against a corporate company. On November 10, 1991, the eco-terrorist group bombed a building that was supposedly empty; however, they unintentionally killed a man named Shawn. Angela sustained a large scar <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> {{as a result of the}} explosion. Consumed with guilt over having killed an innocent man, Angela agreed to run away with a private investigator (Jeffrey Nordling) who had been pursuing the terrorist group. Later, Angie discovered she was pregnant with Patrick's child. She and the private investigator raised Patrick's son as their own and moved several times, living under various aliases, in an attempt to evade both Patrick and the FBI.|$|E
5|$|The female may {{be offered}} food by the male during {{courtship}}. He has a brief courtship display {{in which the}} neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in the grass, is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.|$|E

5|$|Yui {{is a big}} fan and {{initially}} an assistant to Girls Dead Monster. She {{is known to be}} hyperactive and talks extremely fast. Hinata finds Yui annoying, which results in bouts {{between the two of them}} though in truth, they truly care about one another, saying that had they met before they died, they would have fallen in love with one another. She wears a devil tail and shackle bracelets on her wrists, giving her an image of an imp or devil. She also has wings hidden by her hair <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> After Iwasawa's departure, Yui becomes the new rhythm guitarist and vocalist of Girls Dead Monster, as well as its leader. Yui plays a Gibson SG Special electric guitar. She later becomes a part of the main SSS, following them along on missions, though she does not contribute much. In life, she was hit by a car and was paralyzed from a young age as a result. Her regret was not being able to do anything with her body. Otonashi helps fulfill most of her wishes that include many things she saw on TV when she was alive, although it is Hinata who fulfills her last desire to be married by proposing to her.|$|E
