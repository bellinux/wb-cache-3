40|$|The slow-scale linear noise approximation: an accurate, reduced {{stochastic}} {{description of}} biochemical networks under timescale separation conditions Philipp Thomas 1, 2, 3, Arthur V Straube 1 and Ramon Grima 2, 3 * Background: It {{is well known}} that the deterministic dynamics of biochemical reaction networks can be more easily studied if timescale separation conditions are invoked (the quasi-steady-state assumption). In this case the deterministic dynamics of a large network of <b>elementary</b> <b>reactions</b> are well described by the dynamics of a smaller network of effective reactions. Each of the latter represents a group of <b>elementary</b> <b>reactions</b> in the large network and has associated with it an effective macroscopic rate law. A popular method to achieve model reduction in the presence of intrinsic noise consists of using the effective macroscopic rate laws to heuristically deduce effective probabilities for the effective reactions which then enables simulation via the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). The validity of this heuristic SSA method is a priori doubtful because the reaction probabilities for the SSA have only been rigorously derived from microscopic physics arguments for <b>elementary</b> <b>reactions...</b>|$|R
