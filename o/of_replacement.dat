5|$|By the 1980s, the 40-year-old Class 86 and Class 91 trains were in need <b>of</b> <b>replacement.</b> NSB {{described}} them as unable to satisfy demands {{in terms of}} economy, comfort or speed. Class 92 was bought to take over all passenger transport on the Røros Line and on the Nordland Line south of Grong. The 15 two-car units cost NOK200 million and were built by Duewag in Germany.|$|E

At Piccadilly Circus, {{one of the busiest}} stations on the system, Holden designed (1925–28) a spacious travertine-lined circulating concourse and ticket hall below the roadway of the junction from which banks of escalators gave access to the platforms below.|$|E

By 1968, the old wooden Main Stand was in poor condition and in need <b>of</b> <b>replacement.</b> At a cost of £80,000, today's Main Stand was erected and opened by Minister for Sport and former referee Denis Howell. In 1979, the terracing on the Cowshed and Paddock was concreted. The Tranmere suite was added to the Main Stand in 1988, with further bars and executive suites added soon after.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers {{possessed the}} first overall {{pick in the}} NFL Draft, {{and used it to}} select University of Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde. The Buccaneers {{appeared}} changed and won four games early in the season, but they notably lost large leads in later games and fell from playoff contention after midseason. The season was marked by a 1987 players' strike in which regular play was interrupted for a month, while the NFL owners fielded teams <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> players.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of {{different species of}} plants in ecological communities including forests and grasslands may be determined {{in part by the}} level of defensive compounds in the different species. Since the cost <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> of damaged leaves is higher in conditions where resources are scarce, it may also be that plants growing in areas where water and nutrients are scarce may invest more resources into anti-herbivore defenses.|$|E
5|$|For a long time, {{bivalves}} {{were thought}} to be better adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks as an example <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. All this has been broadly disproven, though; rather, the prominence of modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.|$|E
5|$|However, in August 2016, LTA {{has placed}} this {{refurbishment}} programme on hold after acquisition of SMRT rail assets in August 2016 {{due to the}} concerns and issues with older trains.

5|$|Iguanodon teeth are, as {{the name}} suggests, like those of an iguana, but larger. Unlike hadrosaurids, which had columns <b>of</b> <b>{{replacement}}</b> teeth, Iguanodon only had one replacement tooth at a time for each position. The upper jaw held up to 29 teeth per side, with none {{at the front of}} the jaw, and the lower jaw 25; the numbers differ because teeth in the lower jaw are broader than those in the upper. Because the tooth rows are deeply inset from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is believed that, as with most other ornithischians, Iguanodon had some sort of cheek-like structure, muscular or non-muscular, to retain food in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{teeth are}} {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> teeth grow in a groove {{on the inside of}} the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Mexican league incident, Robert Murphy, a former {{negotiator}} for the National Labor Relations Board, attempted {{to organize the}} Pittsburgh Pirates into a guild for purposes of collective bargaining. Murphy decried the reserve clause in player contracts that gave team owners unlimited control over the player's services, and demanded more rights for players, including the right of contract {{and the right of}} salary arbitration. Chandler worked with Pirates officials to avoid a threatened strike by the players. Part of Chandler's intervention included organizing a team <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> players as a contingency plan; the team would have included Honus Wagner, who was 72 years old at the time.|$|E

5|$|The Panzer IV {{continued}} {{to play an important}} role during operations in 1943, including at the Battle of Kursk. Newer types, such as the Panther, were still experiencing crippling reliability problems that restricted their combat efficiency, so much of the effort fell to the 841 Panzer IVs that took part in the battle. Throughout 1943, the German army lost 2,352 Panzer IVs on the Eastern Front; some divisions were reduced to 12–18 tanks by the end of the year. In 1944, a further 2,643 Panzer IVs were destroyed, and such losses were becoming increasingly difficult to replace. Nevertheless, due to a shortage <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> Panther tanks, the Panzer IV {{continued to}} form the core of Germany's armored divisions, including elite units such as the II SS Panzer Corps, through 1944.|$|E
5|$|The President {{was coming}} into {{increasing}} conflict with Congress on {{the handling of}} the Zone, including the unusual consolidation of power. In addition to not officially restructuring the Commission, Congress increasingly fought or raised questions about the appointments <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> commissioners. In November 1905, Panama was visited by Poultney Bigelow, a lecturer and writer for the American Geographical Society, who wrote a scathing report on progress in the Canal Zone—a report that was well-publicized in the States. This report criticized the efficiency of the work being performed as well as the quality of its management. Magoon countered this negative press by stressing that Bigelow had visited the Zone for less than two days, one of which was Thanksgiving Day, and that work was naturally lax on the holiday.|$|E
5|$|The inexperienced Ferdinand {{was a poor}} choice <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> for the capable Charles, having neither {{maturity}} nor {{aptitude for}} the assignment. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, day-to-day decisions {{were placed in the}} hands of Mack, equally ill-suited for such an important assignment. When Mack was wounded early in the campaign, he was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army.|$|E

5|$|There were {{changes for}} the 1st Armoured Regiment, and for the Australian Army, with the {{abolition}} of National Service {{after the end of}} Australian involvement in Vietnam depleting its strength to the point where training was severely restricted until it was reinforced during 1974. Meanwhile, the reserve 1st/15th RNSWL and 8th/13th VMR had both continued to operate a small number of Centurions in the early 1970s; however, they were both later re-roled and equipped with M113s, while the later was eventually disbanded. The last CMF armoured regiment gave up its tanks in 1971, leaving the regular 1st Armoured Regiment as the only tank unit in the Australian Army. Meanwhile, the Centurions were mechanically worn-out, and although additional vehicles had been acquired from New Zealand and British Army stocks, by 1972 the fleet was in need <b>of</b> <b>replacement.</b>|$|E

Restoration was completed by a 300 strong volunteer group, including 14 retired ex-Northrop employees who had been involved in the original N-3PB production line. The complex restoration required the construction <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> parts primarily by templating many damaged or corroded original aircraft components {{in order to create a}} complete airframe. In November 1980 the restored N-3PB was gifted to Norway by the Northrop Aircraft Corporation and the San Diego Aerospace Museum.
