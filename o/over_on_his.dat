Machine FX worked on replacing {{a few shots}} of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps <b>over</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> motorcycle {{to make it look}} more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The Man Who Knew Too Much.

25|$|Malla {{is known}} as the {{dependable}} batsman of Nepal's team who likes to build the innings under pressure. He has been an important member of the national team and has contributed to many of Nepal's historic successes. He holds the record of hammering six '4s' in an <b>over</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> way to scoreing the fastest half-century for Nepal in One-Day matches off just 17 deliveries against Saudi Arabia in the 2012 ACC Trophy Elite. He then scored 212 runs with the impressive average of 42, including 2 fifties, which helped Nepal to win the title for the first time. His 86 runs against Canada in the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, 66 runs against USA in the final of 2012 Division Four, 76* against Qatar in the 2008 ACC Trophy Elite, 75 important runs against USA in the 2008 Division Five, and 67* off just 21 balls against Karnataka Institute of Cricket (India), (SAARC Under-25 Twenty20 Cup 2011) are some of the more memorable innings of his career.|$|E

25|$|In , Senna {{became the}} {{youngest}} ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events. Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, {{the likes of which}} littered the team's history, was no longer a serious competitor. In preseason testing, Senna made public misgivings about the car's competitiveness with the new Honda V12, stating that the engine was not as powerful as the prior year's V10. Senna won the first four races as his rivals struggled to match his pace and reliability. By midseason, Nigel Mansell in the Williams-Renault was able to put up a challenge. Before the Mexican Grand Prix, Senna was injured in a jet-skiing accident near São Paulo for which he required stitches {{on the back of his}} head. During qualifying for that Grand Prix, he attempted to take the banked 180-degree Peraltada corner (Mexico City circuit's fastest corner) faster than normal, ending up spinning off the track and rolling over the car after crashing into a tyre barrier. At the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Senna's car had come to a halt on the final lap, but he was not left stranded out on the circuit, as race-winner Mansell pulled <b>over</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> parade lap and allowed the Brazilian to ride on the Williams side-pod back to the pits. During the Spanish Grand Prix, Senna and Mansell went wheel-to-wheel with only centimetres to spare, at over 320km/h (200mph) down the main straight, a race which the Briton eventually won.|$|E
25|$|Returning to {{his native}} Germany, Schmeling won three of his next four fights, with one draw, {{including}} knockout wins over first Walter Neusel, then another redeeming his previous loss to Steve Hamas. However, many among the American press and fans remained unmoved {{on the idea of}} rooting for Schmeling in light of the Nazi Party's behavior. Articles continued to be published declaring the German 'washed up,' a 'has been,' or a 'Nazi puppet.' When he was matched with undefeated black sensation Joe Louis in 1936 for the German's first fight on American soil in more than two years, he was clearly the betting underdog, considered a name opponent for Louis to roll <b>over</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> route to the title. Nevertheless, he was number two contender for the title behind Louis. Prior to the match, Schmeling carefully studied films of Louis's prior fights, dissecting apparent flaws in the Detroit fighter's technique. Among the weaknesses he noticed was the fact that Louis lowered his left hand after throwing a left jab. In the ring, Schmeling exploited this subtle flaw to his own advantage, countering nearly every Louis jab with his best punch, the right cross. The fight proved to be a competitive, hard-hitting affair for the first three rounds, but, in the fourth, a counter right from the German dropped Louis {{for the first time in}} his career. Though Louis rose, he was badly dazed for the remainder of the fight. For a further eight rounds, Schmeling battered Louis, often standing toe-to-toe with the vaunted puncher and landing that same right hand to the jaw repeatedly. In the twelfth, he sent the American tumbling to the floor once more, and this time Louis could not recover. He was counted out on the floor, and Schmeling had scored the most talked-about sports upset of the year.|$|E

Quite a different spectacle was offered following Mansell's victory in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Senna's car had stopped on the final lap, but, rather than leave his rival stranded out on the circuit (the two had actually come to blows in the pits following their first lap tangle during the 1987 Belgian Grand Prix and were hardly close friends), Mansell pulled <b>over</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> victory lap and allowed Senna to ride on the Williams sidepod back to the pits.|$|E

Initial reactions to the pronouncement of his death were of shock and sadness, as many blacks believed that Washington was the only top Chicago official who would address their concerns.

I think he had just fired as I reached Colonel Washington, for the Marine who followed me into the aperture made by the ladder received a bullet in the abdomen, from which he died in a few minutes. The shot might have been fired by someone else in the insurgent party, but I think it was from Brown. Instinctively as Brown fell I gave him a saber thrust in the left breast. The sword I carried was a light uniform weapon, and, either not having a point or striking something hard in Brown's accouterments, did not penetrate. The blade bent double.|$|E

[...] All these surround us in gay confusion, and are just about being brought into order, so there is nothing to be touched or understood, and with the chesnut-alley in full blossom, and the rushing Danube, which bears us <b>over</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, there is no enduring the Gallery of Art." ...|$|E
