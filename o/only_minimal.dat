5|$|Casual games can {{be played}} with <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> equipment– a basic game {{can be played}} on almost any open area of {{reasonable}} size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its close}} {{proximity}} to islands along its path, Dovi caused <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> damage. Oceanic swells and storm surge were felt in some coastal areas. Strong winds were reported in the southern Cook Islands and Niue. Damage to banana plantations on Palmerston Island was reported, but Dovi caused no fatalities.|$|E

5|$|A general {{hospital}} {{is located in}} {{the eastern side of the}} city. Modern health care facilities exist only in Bangui but are poor, providing <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city for sexual services pose a major risk of spreading the disease to other parts of the country. The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E
5|$|In Fakaofo, {{the storm}} surge from Percy damaged a sea wall and caused major beach erosion. One house was {{destroyed}} while others were severely damaged. Percy also damaged much of the coconut harvest and 50% of the livestock {{were killed by the}} cyclone. Atafu also suffered similar damage as the storm damaged a UHF tower and several storage sheds. Damage to crops was also significant as the storm damaged much of the banana and pandanus harvests. The schools in Atafu suffered <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> damage (mostly wind damage).|$|E

5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists {{almost entirely of}} grass, with <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E
5|$|North Korea's lack {{of large}} airstrips and {{aircraft}} meant it conducted <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> air resupply, mostly critical items being imported from China. Other than this, however, aircraft played almost {{no role in}} North Korean logistics. The North Koreans were also not able to effectively use sea transport. Ports in Wonsan and Hungnam {{could be used for}} the transport of some troops and supplies, but they remained far too underdeveloped to support any large-scale logistical movements, and the port of Inchon in the south was difficult to navigate with large numbers of ships.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April, Lorraine and her {{two sisters}} were {{transferred}} to Alexandria. On 10 June, Italy declared war on France; by that time, both Bretagne and Provence had {{moved back to the}} western Mediterranean. Lorraine was the only French capital ship in the eastern Mediterranean, though she was joined by four British battleships and an aircraft carrier. On the night of 20–21 June, Lorraine formed the center of an Anglo-French task force, with the cruisers , , and , for a bombardment of Italian positions at Bardia. The operation, which caused <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> damage, was the last combined British and French naval operation before the French surrender.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of its existence, it {{followed}} a 7,165-mile (13,280-km) path from the eastern Pacific to the western Pacific {{and back to the}} central Pacific, lasting 31days in total. Because it existed in both the eastern and western Pacific, John was one of a small number of tropical cyclones to be designated as both a hurricane and a typhoon. Despite lasting for a full month, John barely affected land at all, bringing <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> effects to the Hawaiian Islands and the United States military base on Johnston Atoll. Its remnants later affected Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Plans were {{formulated}} on 6 September {{to transport}} the British 1st Airborne Division to Taranto from their base in North Africa. They would {{take advantage of the}} Italian surrender to capture the port and establish anti-aircraft defences. What was left of the Italian fleet still using the harbour was expected to have left beforehand. The Allies believed that the division would face <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> opposition and would be able to overcome any resistance with the limited naval support available, as Taranto was outside the range of Allied fighter aircraft based in Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E

5|$|Some {{robotics}} {{research is}} exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} by TJ Doherty at The Loft in Irving Park, Chicago, where Tweedy had recorded Loose Fur's Born Again in the USA {{and most of}} Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. In an interview with Billboard, the band revealed that the album would be less experimental than the two previous albums and more influenced by The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and The Rolling Stones. Also, unlike the previous albums, the album was made with <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> involvement of Jim O'Rourke; the album which was produced with very few overdubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{class had}} greatly {{improved}} handling characteristics over the preceding Nassau class. The Helgolands were much better sea boats {{and did not}} suffer from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did. The ships were responsive to the helm, and had a tight turning radius, and lost <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> speed during swells. The ships lost up to 54% of their speed at hard rudder, and would heel up to 7°. For comparison, the earlier Nassaus lost up to 70% speed and held a 12° heel with the rudder hard over.|$|E

5|$|The success {{led to a}} {{much more}} ambitious {{offensive}} operation named Polyarnaya Zvezda (Polar Star) {{less than two weeks}} later. That operation had the aim of decisively defeating Army Group North, lifting the siege altogether, but it achieved <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> progress. Soviet forces made several other attempts in 1943 to renew their offensive and completely lift the siege, but made only modest gains in each one. The corridor remained in range of German artillery and the siege was only over on January 27, 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy {{in the late}} 3rd and early 4th centuries. By the 4th century, the thin and lightweight tubed vaulting had become a vaulting technique in its own right, rather than simply serving as a permanent centering for concrete. It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy. Arranging these terracotta tubes in a continuous spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans, but required <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> centering and formwork. The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example.|$|E
5|$|By 1800, the British and French {{had been}} at war for seven years and the British {{dominated}} the sea, following {{a number of significant}} victories over the French, Dutch and Spanish fleets. Off every French port, large squadrons of British ships of the line and frigates awaited French movements and whenever possible intercepted and destroyed French merchant vessels and warships. While British trading ships travelled in large, well-armed convoys, French ships were forced to slip between harbours to avoid the British blockade. To counter British control of the seas, the French periodically despatched squadrons of ships to raid British trade lanes, particularly off West Africa and in the South Atlantic, where the stretched Royal Navy maintained <b>only</b> <b>minimal</b> forces.|$|E
