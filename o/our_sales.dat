[...] "Wherever I have turned {{during the last}} few months I seem to have encountered the opposition of your father's millions. <b>Our</b> <b>sales</b> are going down day by day. The great advertisers are practically ignoring us. We are losing money fast. That is what happens to any one who dares to raise a finger against the accursed idols of this country. Three of the greatest advertisement contractors have given us notice that they have struck off our paper from their list. It is your father's doings, Stella. I had hoped something from this illness of his, but the thing goes on. Do you know whether he is really laid up, or whether {{this is part of a}} scheme?" ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{time had}} elapsed since the {{overturning}} of the wagon, and I had seen nothing of Lucille Haldane, when, one evening, I visited Bonaventure at her father's request. All had gone {{well in the}} interval. The last bushel of grain had been threshed and sold, and the balance of my debt to Lane, with every surcharge his ingenuity could invent, wiped out. Haldane, who remained some time in Winnipeg with Boone, had also concluded operations successfully, for, as he had foreseen, once the turning point was passed he had no lack of allies eager to assist in plundering the vanquished, and, before these had satisfied their rapacity {{he had been able}} to unobtrusively cover most of <b>our</b> <b>sales</b> without advancing prices. Boone explained that the new assailants considered the purchases a last effort on the part of the company's supporters. Also--because there is little mercy for the beaten--impoverished storekeeper and plundered farmer commenced to air their grievances, and it became evident that the company, or those whom it financed, had occasionally exceeded the limits of the law.|$|E

60|$|The fearful {{financial}} panic hit {{the book}} heavily, for we published {{it in the}} midst of it. But nevertheless in the 8 weeks that have now elapsed since the day we published, we have sold 40,000 copies; which gives L3,000 royalty to be divided between the authors. This is really the largest two-months' sale which any American book has ever achieved (unless one excepts the cheaper editions of Uncle Tom's Cabin). The average price of our book is 16 shillings a copy--Uncle Tom was 2 shillings a copy. But for the panic <b>our</b> <b>sale</b> would have been doubled, I verily believe. I do not believe the sale will ultimately go over 100,000 copies.|$|R

We ordered three busts of that sort from Gelder & Co., of Stepney. They are all sold now. To whom? Oh, I daresay by consulting <b>our</b> <b>sales</b> book we could very easily tell you. Yes, we have the entries here. One to Mr. Harker you see, and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Laburnum Lodge, Laburnum Vale, Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of Lower Grove Road, Reading. No, I have never seen this face which you show me in the photograph. You would hardly forget it, would you, sir, for I've seldom seen an uglier. Have we any Italians on the staff? Yes, sir, we have several among our workpeople and cleaners. I daresay they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to. There is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book. Well, well, it's a very strange business, and I {{hope that you will}} let me know if anything comes of your inquiries." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had plenty}} of {{occupation}} {{for the remainder of}} that day. Yaap arrived with his 'brigade of sleighs' about noon, and I went in search of Guert, in whose company I repaired once more {{to the office of the}} contractor. Horses, harness, sleighs, provisions and all were taken at high prices, and I was paid for the whole in Spanish gold; joes and half-joes being quite as much in use among us in that day as the coin of the realm. Spanish silver has always formed our smaller currency, such a thing as an English shilling, or a sixpence, being quite a stranger among us. Pieces of eight, or dollars, are our commonest coin, it is true, but we make good use of the half-joe in all heavy transactions. I have seen two or three Bank of England notes in my day, but they are of very rare occurrence in the colonies. There have been colony bills among us, but they are not favourites, most of our transactions being carried on by means of the Spanish gold and Spanish silver, that find their way up from the islands and the Spanish main. The war of which I am now writing, however, brought a great many guineas among us, most of the troops being paid in that species of coin; but the contractors, in general, found it easier to command the half-joe than the guinea. Of the former, when all <b>our</b> <b>sales</b> were made, Dirck and myself had, between us, no less than one hundred and eleven, or eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars in value.|$|E

40|$|In this appendix, {{we provide}} details on model estimation, results, and {{robustness}} checks {{to check the}} appropriateness of the assumptions made for model specification. MODEL ESTIMATION PROCEDURE Recall that some of the unknown parameters in <b>our</b> brand <b>sales</b> model are specified as category- and brand-specific while others are not (see Equation 6 in the paper). To estimate this model we have data available for 2, 831 brands over a period of 21 quarters starting in quarter 4 / 2000 until quarter 4 / 2005. Since the brand sales model includes lagged sales the first quarter is inherently lost. In addition, we note that many brands are launched later than quarter 4 / 2000 and a few brands are withdrawn from the market during the observation period. As a result, we have an unbalanced panel data set amounting to eventually 47, 308 observations which we can use for estimation. Hence, we have on average 16. 7 quarters per brand and 32. 9 brands per category (86 categories) available. <b>Our</b> brand <b>sales</b> model incorporates brand-specific effects which reflect brand heterogeneity in the market. Considering only own and competitive marketing expenditure variables, a fixed-effects specification would require estimating ~ 8, 500 own brand sales effect...|$|R
