40|$|We {{propose a}} digital {{holographic}} interference analysis method {{based on a}} 2 -frame phase-shifting technique for measuring an <b>optical</b> <b>mirror</b> surface. The technique using 2 -frame phase-shifting digital interferometry is more efficient than multi-frame phase-shifting techniques because the 2 -frame method {{has the advantage of}} a reduced number of interferograms, and then takes less time to acquire the wanted topography information from interferograms. In this measurement system, 2 -frame phase-shifting digital interferograms are acquired by moving the reference flat mirror surface, which is attached to a piezoelectric transducer, with phase step of 0 or π/ 2 in the reference beam path. The measurements are recorded on a CCD detector. The optical interferometry is designed on the basis of polarization characteristics of a polarizing beam splitter. Therefore the noise from outside turbulence can be decreased. The proposed 2 -frame algorithm uses the relative phase difference of the neighbor pixels. The experiment has been carried out on an <b>optical</b> <b>mirror</b> which flatness is less than λ/ 4. The measurement of the <b>optical</b> <b>mirror</b> surface topography using 2 -frame phase-shifting interferometry shows that the peak-to-peak value is calculated to be about 0. 1779 μm, the root-mean-square value is about 0. 034 μm.

In this technology, semiconductor laser are cleaved in the air, {{and the surface}} oxide layer is removed with a low energy ion source, immediately flowed by coating the facet with 20 nm of thin ZnSe passivation layer. The function of the passivation layer is to protect semiconductor laser facet, and prevent impurity particles diffusing to the facet. Finally the facet is coated with oxidative optical film. The test results of semiconductor laser output power show that output power with the coated ZnSe passivation layer method is 12 % higher than coated Si passivation layer, and 36 % higher than that coated oxidative optical film. The device coated oxidative optical film is failed when current is 4. 1 A, and the device coated with Si passivation layer is failed when current is 4. 8 A, the final failed of the device is coated ZnSe passivation layer.
