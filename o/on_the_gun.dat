5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun,</b> it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
5|$|After an April 21, 1995, {{court hearing}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents {{took him into}} custody as they {{continued}} their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off {{by the arrival of}} police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crisis}} eased, New Jersey was {{released}} {{to continue her}} interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, New Jerseys crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment, and deficiencies discovered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> line were remedied. According to official reports, though, reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise: on 22 August 1969 the United States Secretary of Defense released {{a list of names}} of ships to be inactivated; {{at the top of the}} list was New Jersey. Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain Robert C. Peniston.|$|E

5|$|In October 1917, Emden {{was serving}} as the {{flagship}} of Commodore Paul Heinrich, the commander of torpedo-boats assigned to Operation Albion. For the initial assault on 12 October, Emden was tasked with bombarding a Russian gun emplacement at Pamerort; Heinrich was given command of the landings there. At 06:08, Emden opened fire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> battery. Her first two salvos fell short, but the third hit and disabled the telephone wires and speaking tubes, which rendered central control of the Russian guns impossible. By 07:00, the Russian guns were silenced and German troops began to go ashore unopposed. Two {{and a half hours}} later, a pair of Russian destroyers attempted to intervene, but Emden engaged them and drove them off.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{election}} date was set as September 10, national organizations {{on both sides}} of the gun-control debate started to weigh in. On the recall, pro-gun rights side was the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> control side was the Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Mayor Bloomberg. Morse went door-to-door in an effort to gain voter support and both sides of the campaigns accused the other side of mud-slinging. Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, noting that he had been cleared of those allegations. Giron supporters were accused of misrepresenting the issue as a choice on women's rights and abortion.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the four}} ships were {{launched}} in 1915 and the fourth in 1916. Work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> turrets lagged, and it became evident that Russian industry {{would not be able}} to complete the ships during the war. The Russian Revolution of 1917 put a stop to their construction, which was never resumed. Although some consideration was given to finishing the hulls that were nearest to completion, they were all eventually sold for scrap by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Navy proposed in 1925 to convert Izmail, the ship closest to completion, to an aircraft carrier, but the plan was cancelled after political maneuvering by the Red Army led to funding not being available.|$|E

5|$|As rations {{and water}} dwindled, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were made}} on 10 June to rescue {{the men in the}} stranded barge with support from artillery and aircraft. While Corsairs flew close support missions, Beaufort and Mitchell bombers dropped life rafts but the survivors were unable to reach them due to machine-gun fire. Further casualties occurred when, in the early morning of 11 June, a Japanese soldier managed to reach the vessel and fired upon the occupants with a machine-gun, killing two and wounding others before he was killed himself. Shortly after this a Japanese anti-tank gun fired two shells at the landing craft, destroying its stern. Further shots were prevented when Australian artillery ranged in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun,</b> having been directed by Captain John Whitelaw, an artillery observer on one of two landing craft that had been despatched with canvas assault boats, crewed by engineers from the 16th Field Company.|$|E

25|$|Bamber's defence team {{challenged}} the evidence over the years. They alleged that a police log suggested that Bamber's father had indeed {{called the police}} that night, and that the silencer {{may not have been}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> during the attacks. The silencer evidence was unreliable, they argued, because the silencer was found in a farmhouse cupboard by Bamber's relatives weeks after the murders, and they stood to inherit the estate if he was convicted.|$|E
25|$|Suffering {{from the}} effects of at least 65 hits, Astoria fought for her life. A bucket brigade battled the blaze <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> deck and the {{starboard}} passage forward from that deck, and the wounded were moved to the captain's cabin, where doctors and corpsmen proceeded with their care. Eventually, however, the deck beneath grew hot and forced the wounded back to the forecastle. The bucket brigade made steady headway, driving the fire aft on the starboard side of the gun deck, while a gasoline handy-billy rigged over the side pumped a small stream into the wardroom passage below.|$|E
25|$|The Paris Gun was {{a weapon}} like no other, but its {{capabilities}} {{are not known}} with full certainty. This {{is due to the}} weapon's apparent total destruction by the Germans {{in the face of the}} final Allied offensives. Figures stated for the weapon's size, range, and performance varied widely depending on the source—not even the number of shells fired is certain. With the discovery (in the 1980s) and publication (in the Bull and Murphy book) of a long note <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> written shortly before his death in 1926 by Dr. Fritz Rausenberger, who was in charge of its development at Krupp, the details of its design and capabilities were considerably clarified.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{claimed that}} Bembenek {{was the only}} person with the motive, means and opportunity to carry out the crime. The strongest evidence was two human hairs found at the crime scene, which matched ones taken from the hairbrush of the defendant. The gun used to kill Christine Schultz turned out to be Bembenek's husband's off-duty revolver. The prosecution claimed that Bembenek {{was the only person}} besides Fred Schultz who had access to this weapon. Blood was found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> Bembenek supposedly also had access to a key to Christine Schultz's home. There were no signs of a break-in and no valuables taken. Schultz's eldest son, however, stated that Bembenek was not the person who had held up their house and shot his mother.|$|E
25|$|O'Bannon {{got under}} way for Japan on 28 September and reached Yokosuka on 7October and Subic Bay on the 15th. She {{returned}} to the war zone with Constellation (CVA-64) and operated as plane guard on Yankee Station through 4November. After a fortnight's respite at Subic Bay and Hong Kong, O'Bannon sailed to Da Nang for shore bombardment. She visited Taiwan early in December but returned to the fighting on the 15th to provide gunfire support {{just south of the}} DMZ. Two days later, she helped to rescue the crew of an American plane that had been hit over the DMZ and had managed to crash just off shore. An enemy battery shelled the destroyer during the operation but failed to score. As 1967 ended, O'Bannon was still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> line supporting allied ground forces.|$|E
25|$|Caffell {{had spent}} time in a {{psychiatric}} hospital being treated for schizophrenia months before the murders. The police believed that she was responsible until Bamber's girlfriend told them he had implicated himself. The prosecution case included {{that there was no}} evidence that Bamber's father had telephoned him. They argued that the father was too badly injured to have spoken to anyone; that there was no blood on the kitchen phone; and that he would have called the police, not Bamber. They also argued that the silencer was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> when the shots were fired, and that Caffell's reach was not long enough to hold the gun and silencer at her throat and press the trigger. In addition she was not strong enough, they said, to have overcome her father in what appeared to have been a violent struggle in the kitchen.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous use of <b>the</b> field <b>gun</b> in terms of {{advanced}} tactics was Napoleon Bonaparte's use of very large wheels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> {{that allowed them to}} be moved quickly even during a battle.
