5|$|Lycia <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> {{strategic}} position between Europe and the Near East. The Greek and Persian worlds met in Lycia, and the Lycians were {{heavily influenced by}} both. At one period Persian influence would dominate and at another, Greek, resulting in Lycian culture being an amalgam of both.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split {{does not seem to}} have been driven by competition for resources but instead by the fact that each species adopted a different ecological niche and <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> different trophic level.|$|E

Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government, which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.|$|E

He was the academic assistant to two presidents of the University of California, and sat on numerous advisory panels and boards.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> rare {{position}} in seventeenth-century England, {{as a person}} of common birth who rose {{to a position of}} high status as an independently wealthy, unmarried woman running a substantial business enterprise.

From south to north, the 10th, 3rd, 15th, 13th, and 1st Divisions <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> wide line encircling Taegu from Tuksong-dong and around Waegwan to Kunwi. The KPA planned to use the natural corridor of the Naktong valley from Sangju to Taegu as its main axis of attack for the next push south, so the divisions all eventually moved through this valley, crossing the Naktong at different areas along the low ground. Elements of the DPRK 105th Armored Division also supported the attack.|$|E

5|$|For ease of {{training}} and fleet conversion, de Havilland designed the Comet's flight deck layout {{with a degree of}} similarity to the Lockheed Constellation, an aircraft that was popular at the time with key customers such as BOAC.

The navigator <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> dedicated station with a table across from the flight engineer.|$|E

5|$|Fort Stanwix <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> {{strategic}} western portage {{known as}} the Oneida Carrying Place (site of modern Rome, New York) between the Mohawk River, which flowed southeast to the Hudson River, and Wood Creek, whose waters ultimately led to Lake Ontario. Built by the British in 1758 during the French and Indian War on the only dry ground in the area, the fort had fallen into disrepair. When the American Revolutionary War widened in 1776 to include the frontier areas between New York and the Province of Quebec, the site again became strategically important.|$|E
5|$|General Courtney Hodges' U.S. First Army liberated {{the region}} south of Brussels and Maastricht in early September 1944. While two corps of the First Army were {{concentrated}} elsewhere, VIII Corps <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> {{long stretch of}} the front from the area south of Liège, across the Ardennes and into Luxembourg. The length of the deployment meant that the Corps' front line was only lightly defended, leaving it vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|In Byzantium, the {{elementary}} school teacher <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used). However, the grammarian and rhetorician, teachers responsible for the following two phases of education, were more respected. These used classical Greek texts like Homer's Iliad or Odyssey and {{much of their time}} was taken with detailed word-for-word explication. Books were rare and very expensive and likely only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students.|$|E

5|$|La Blanca <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> {{frontier}} zone between the northeastern and southeastern Petén regions {{and the site}} {{is dominated by the}} acropolis, an especially well built palace complex. The city appears to have been an administrative centre with comparatively little emphasis upon religious or ceremonial activity. It is likely that La Blanca was a subsidiary of a major Maya city such as Yaxha or Naranjo, given the complete absence of hieroglyphic texts and sculpted monuments, and archaeologists presume that La Blanca served as a frontier post or trading centre.|$|E
5|$|On April 21, 1981, four EPB commandos {{were able}} to extract $348,000 from a Wells Fargo armored car, with the group later noting {{that it would be}} spent in their cause. In November 1981, the EPB detonated {{explosives}} in AEE substations in Santurce, a district of San Juan. When 350 families that <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> makeshift village in Carolina, Puerto Rico, were removed by the police, the EPB warned the governor that they would retaliate. Afterwards, they made an offensive against the police that resulted in twelve injured and one dead policeman.|$|E

This operation led the United States to form a defense agreement with Taiwan, effectively preventing the communists from completely defeating the Kuomintang.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{understanding}} of Iguanodon {{has evolved over}} time as new information has been obtained from fossils.

As one of the first scientifically well-known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has <b>occupied</b> <b>a</b> small but notable place in the public's perception of dinosaurs, its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains.|$|E
