25|$|Most of {{the signal}} cabins on the broad gauge lines were to a BNCR hipped roof design by Berkeley Dean Wise that was {{introduced}} c1889. They had a brick base with wooden superstructure but usually also a brick back wall to the <b>operating</b> <b>floor.</b> A principal feature of these cabins was the overhanging roof supported by large eaves brackets which served to protect the window sashes from the weather. Newer cabins to the traditional design, such as those at Larne Harbour and Coleraine, omitted the eaves brackets but retained a distinctive appearance.|$|E
500|$|Kellex's {{design for}} the main process {{building}} of K-25 called for a four-story U-shaped structure [...] long containing 51 main process buildings and 3 purge cascade buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively, within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately {{or as part of}} a single cascade. When completed, there were 2,892 stages. The basement housed the auxiliary equipment, such as the transformers, switch gears, and air conditioning systems. The ground floor contained the cells. The third level contained the piping. The fourth floor was the <b>operating</b> <b>floor,</b> which contained the control room, and the hundreds of instrument panels. From here, the operators monitored the process. The first section was ready for test runs on 17 April 1944, although the barriers were not yet ready to be installed.|$|E
50|$|The main {{entrance}} to most Lever Frame signal boxes is via {{a set of}} stairs to the <b>operating</b> <b>floor,</b> this is usually true regardless {{of the type of}} signalling system in use, and is because much of the equipment used to signal trains needs to be held in a room close to, and usually below, the <b>operating</b> <b>floor,</b> the frame room. In some signal boxes these stairs cannot be seen and are constructed inside the building {{as in the case of}} local boxes Droitwich, Worcester Shrub Hill, Worcester Tunnel Junction & Evesham.

50|$|The {{earliest}} signal boxes housed {{mechanical lever}} frames. The frame was usually {{mounted on a}} beam beneath the <b>operating</b> <b>floor.</b> Interlocking {{was attached to the}} levers, which ensured that signals showed the correct indication with regard to the points and were operated in the right order. Wires or rods, connected at one end to the signals and points and at the other to levers in the signal box, ran alongside the railway.|$|E
50|$|The first {{signal box}} was {{provided}} on the seaward platform beside {{the north end}} of the waiting room but this was replaced by a new two-storey signal box on 9 September 1920 on the opposite platform. So as to fit on the narrow platform the brick-built lower storey which contained the interlocking equipment was narrower than usual, with the upper storey was vaulted out from this to give a full size <b>operating</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

50|$|The north wall {{has some}} {{horizontal}} {{holes in it}} next to the track and at sleeper height, these are to enable iron rods that connect to the points and steel cables that connect to the signals to leave the box. The holes have soft plastic flaps in them to impede access to rats. All lever frame signal boxes have to have these openings and therefore all have visiting members of the rat and mouse population, who live in local drains and water courses. These are usually tolerated because {{there is little to}} damage and they very rarely climb up to the <b>operating</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>operating</b> <b>floor</b> is {{occupied}} by two large, almost semi-circular, control panels with their inner surfaces facing each other {{like a pair of}} punctuation parentheses '( [...] )'. These consist of a large overview diagram that displays all the track and signals and positions of trains outside, essential to the punctual operation and regulating of traffic in such a complex and busy area. In front of the overview diagram are the control panels/desks which also mimic the almost semi-circular layout of the overview diagram. In {{the middle of the floor}} is a large oval dais that has two banks of work panels/desks that face the overview diagram. This is where the signalling centre supervisor and other operating staff work.|$|E
50|$|After 31 May 1890 the LSWR {{opened its}} {{independent}} line to Plymouth, running broadly {{parallel to the}} South Devon line as far as Tavistock, but crossing over; after Tavistock it diverged westward to reach Plymouth via Bere Alston. It constructed its own Lydford station, immediately adjacent to the South Devon station, with a broad, shared, central island platform. The connecting line remained in place until 1895, although it was only used for wagon exchange. The two stations were operated separately until March 1914 when a joint economy initiative led to common operation here. In 1916 the separate signal boxes were abolished, control passing to a new common signal box that had two lever frames, {{one on each side}} of the <b>operating</b> <b>floor,</b> for the respective routes.|$|E

50|$|The {{main power}} station {{building}} is 235 ft long and 72 ft wide. In order {{to accommodate the}} vertical shafts of the machines, 140,000 tons on rock were excavated, and the building extends 110 ft below the <b>operating</b> <b>floor,</b> which is at ground level. There are four lower floors, and working downwards, these are the alternator floor, the turbine floor, the pump floor and the pump basement. The height of the building above ground level is 65 ft. The main building is flanked by two single storey blocks, the southern one used for the control room and the northern one for administration. The main building is steel framed with an inner brick wall and a cavity. The outer wall is faced with local stone, of a type which {{has been used for}} a number of significant buildings in the Vale of Ffestiniog, but it proved difficult to find a source. A disused quarry was tracked down with help from retired quarrymen, but there was insufficient stone to complete the project, and it was problematic to use modern extraction methods. Some of the stone was therefore sourced from a second quarry.|$|E
50|$|The {{signal box}} at the station is a Smith and Yardley type 1 brick box opened in December 1875, almost {{certainly}} timed to service the new connections to short sidings that were opened that winter, these works being checked and then approved with minor modifications by the Board of Trade inspector in documentation dated February 1876. One interesting requirement was that the wicket gates had to be locked by levers in the signal cabin and this basic protection can now be dated with certainty to that time. The box, one of three types, was supplied by Manchester-based Emily Sophia Yardley, a widow who had taken over her late husband's ironmongery business, together with her step-brother William Smith, who was recorded in the April 1861 Census records as being an 'engineer' aged 21. The extension to the goods yard at the station by the early 1900s, together with new loop lines and increased signalling, brought about an enlargement of the lever frame in the signal box. Inserting this new frame probably required the partial removal {{of some of the}} front brickwork of the 1875 cabin. This can be seen today in the distinct contrast between much older brick lower down and a quite different brick face on the upper area. The signal box has an <b>operating</b> <b>floor</b> which is 8ft 7in above the platform level, according to early LYR Engineer's Office drawings. Bromley Cross signal box formerly acted as a 'fringe' to the power boxes at Preston (which controls the line to Blackburn) and Manchester Piccadilly (which supervises the passing loop and line south towards Bolton) - their train description systems were incompatible with each other and so the box here was retained to act as a link between them. Its sole use now is to supervise the adjacent pedestrian foot crossing and the protecting signals (with four working levers), since the interface between the two signalling centres has been upgraded so that they can communicate directly.In circa 2004 the signal box was modernised with timber work replaced in PVC (the windows were replaced in a different pattern), and new steel steps and an oversized metal safety cage finally added. In November 2016 the foot crossing was entirely renewed, also the short timber-topped former link platform running under the front of the signal box removed, so exposing the lowest brick layers of the box {{for the first time in}} many decades.|$|E
