5|$|By September 1, the facility, {{like the}} Superdome, was {{completely}} <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> declared unsafe and unsanitary. However, {{even though there}} were thousands of people who were evacuating at the center, along with network newscasters, pleading desperately for help on CNN, FOX, and other broadcast outlets, FEMA head Michael Brown and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff both claimed to have no knowledge of the use of the Convention Center as a shelter until the afternoon of September 1.|$|E
5|$|The post-credits scene {{puts the}} player {{in control of}} Six's last stand against {{overwhelming}} Covenant forces. After sustaining heavy damage, Six drops his or her shattered helmet and is <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> killed. Decades later, Six's helmet remains on the grassy plains of a now-restored Reach. A narration by Halsey eulogizes Noble Team, who ultimately enabled humanity's victory over the Covenant.|$|E
5|$|After {{a six-week}} voyage, the team arrived in Plymouth, England on 8 September 1905. After finally {{arriving}} in England, the side opened their tour against Devon. Cunningham {{played in the}} match which was won easily by the New Zealanders 55–4. Devon were expected to pose a serious challenge, but were <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> only managed to score a drop-kick. A series of large victories followed against domestic opposition throughout England, {{and by the time}} the All Blacks played their first Test match against Scotland, the team had played and won nineteen matches, and scored 612 points while conceding only 15.|$|E

5|$|Duncan initiates {{the player}} into the Grey Wardens through a {{dangerous}} ritual called the Joining, which involves imbibing Darkspawn blood. The recipient is either killed or imbued with the powerful darkspawn essence, the Taint, granting them {{the ability to}} sense Darkspawn and a rudimentary connection into their hive mind. Afterwards, the player and fellow Grey Warden, Alistair, are tasked with lighting a beacon {{at the top of}} the fortress to signal Loghain's men into charging the horde's flank. However, upon arriving, Loghain abandons the battlefield with his army, leaving Cailan, Duncan, and their army to be <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> slain by the Darkspawn, who seize control of Ostagar and begin advancing into southern Ferelden.|$|E
5|$|In 468, Leo chose Basiliscus {{as leader}} of the famous {{military}} expedition against Carthage. The invasion of the kingdom of the Vandals {{was one of the greatest}} military undertakings recorded in the annals of history, a combined amphibious operation with over ten thousand ships and one hundred thousand soldiers. The purpose of the operation was to punish the Vandal king Geiseric for the sacking of Rome in 455, in which the former capital of the Western Roman Empire was <b>overwhelmed,</b> <b>and</b> the Empress Licinia Eudoxia (widow of Emperor Valentinian III) and her daughters were taken as hostages.|$|E
5|$|She {{starts a}} {{relationship}} with neighbour Jim Branning (John Bardon), but when he proposes, she is <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> leaves Walford. Jim perseveres and when they go on the London Eye one Christmas Eve, he proposes again and she accepts. They decide {{that they will have}} a platonic marital relationship. Dot is diagnosed with kidney cancer and decides not to tell anyone except her friend Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman). She initially refuses treatment and plans to die quietly, but is eventually persuaded to undergo chemotherapy and makes a full recovery.|$|E

The police shoot his flamethrower pack and it explodes. Thomas, Costa, J.B., and Dax flee with the other guests as Thomas' house burns and the SWAT team moves in to retake the neighborhood. The neighborhood is left aflame.|$|E
5|$|Troilus, however, {{after he}} had learned of his father's {{intention}} {{to go ahead and}} release Briseida and restore her to the Greeks, was <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> completely wracked by great grief, and almost entirely consumed by tears, anguished sighs, and laments, because he cherished her with the great fervour of youthful love and had been led by the excessive ardour of love into the intense longing of blazing passion. There was no one of his dear ones who could console him.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{fearing a}} {{possible}} night encounter with Japanese surface forces, and believing Yamamoto still intended to invade, {{based in part}} on a misleading contact report from the submarine , Spruance changed course and withdrew to the east, turning back west towards the enemy at midnight. For his part, Yamamoto initially decided to continue the engagement and sent his remaining surface forces searching eastward for the American carriers. Simultaneously, he detached a cruiser raiding force to bombard the island. The Japanese surface forces failed to make contact with the Americans because Spruance had decided to briefly withdraw eastward, and Yamamoto ordered a general withdrawal to the west. It was fortunate Spruance did not pursue, for had he come in contact with Yamamoto's heavy ships, including , in the dark and considering the Japanese Navy's superiority in night-attack tactics at the time, there is a very high probability his cruisers would have been <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> his carriers sunk.|$|E

5|$|Here the Japanese {{held the}} high ground in well-concealed {{positions}} that had clear fields of fire into the narrow gorge below. With no other options, the 16th Brigade was forced to assault the Japanese defences frontally, advancing straight up the gorge. Amidst torrential rain and stiff defence, progress was slow as each defensive position had {{to be dealt with}} individually. As the water level in the creek rose steadily, the troops came under heavy mortar fire and were attacked with grenades lobbed from the heights above. The supply situation grew desperate too, but by 28 October the 2/3rd Battalion had managed to work its way around the Japanese right flank in preparation for an attack. In the afternoon, the battalion launched its attack, breaking through the Japanese outposts and into the main position. The defenders were <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> many of them abandoned their weapons as they fled. That night, the remaining Japanese withdrew from the position. The 16th Brigade lost 72 killed and 154 wounded in this action.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1943, his forces {{advanced}} forward towards the Belarusian city of Vitebsk. One of the key elements to Bagramyan's success was {{that many of the}} soldiers were part of veteran units that had been trained in the Arctic regions of Siberia, enabling them to easily push through entrenched defenses the Germans had spent months preparing. Among the key locations imperative to reach Vitebsk was the small town of Gorodok, which served as a communications hub that the Germans had heavily fortified. Despite the heavy defense preparations, Bagramyan was able to utilize his heavy artillery and air support from the Red Air Force in late December to bombard the town and then launch a three-pronged attack from the ground. The German garrison was <b>overwhelmed,</b> <b>and</b> by 24 December, two infantry divisions and one tank division had surrendered. In Moscow, the news of the victory at Gorodok prompted a 124-cannon salute in honor of Bagramyan and the First Baltic Front.|$|E
5|$|On 24 December 2016, it was {{announced}} that Rowland would replace Jessie J as a coach on the sixth season of The Voice Australia, that aired in early 2017.

5|$|Other {{diversion}} operations included 40 Lancasters, 19 Halifaxes and 35 Vickers Wellingtons from No. 7 Group RAF flying {{toward the}} Frisian Islands. Some aircraft withdrew owing to mechanical difficulties but 91 dropped 3,721 bundles of Window over the North Sea. Five Halifaxes, three B-24 Liberators and eight B-17 Flying Fortress also assisted with jamming operations. The USAAF committed 24 B-24s to bomb Emden {{in support of}} the main force. In the final pre-amble to the main attack No. 100 Group committed 10 Halifaxes and six Mosquitos to drop target markers over Meppen to mislead German ground controllers into believing it was the target. The bombers struck Ladbergen, and the canal burst its banks, the safety gates were <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> canal boats were stranded. The attack lasted just 25 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{conversion}} of London to Christianity in the early 7thcentury, the city's dead had been buried {{in and around the}} local churches. With a limited amount of space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials, and the remains of the previous occupants transferred to charnel houses for storage. From the 14th century onwards the charnel houses themselves were <b>overwhelmed,</b> <b>and</b> exhumed bones were scattered where they had been dug up or reburied in pits. Despite this practice, by the mid 17thcentury the city was running seriously short of burial space. A proposal by Christopher Wren to use the reconstruction following the 1666 Great Fire of London as an opportunity to cease burials in the churchyards and establish new cemeteries outside the city was approved by the King and Parliament but vetoed by the Corporation of London, and burials continued at the newly rebuilt churches.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{military}} {{suffered a}} series of defeats during {{the early months of}} the Pacific War. The 8th Division and RAAF squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the British Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller Japanese invasion force which landed on 7 December. The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singapore at the end of January, but was forced to surrender on 15 February after the Japanese captured much of the island. Smaller Australian forces were also <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> defeated during early 1942 at Rabaul, and in Ambon, Timor, and Java. The Australian town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the Japanese on 19 February, to prevent it from being used as an Allied base. Over 22,000 Australians were taken prisoner in early 1942 and endured harsh conditions in Japanese captivity. The prisoners were subjected to malnutrition, denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards. As a result, 8,296 Australian prisoners died in captivity.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Atlanta was {{a battle}} of the Atlanta Campaign fought during the American Civil War on July 22, 1864, just {{southeast}} of Atlanta, Georgia. Continuing their summer campaign to seize the important rail and supply center of Atlanta, Union forces commanded by William Tecumseh Sherman <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> defeated Confederate forces defending the city under John Bell Hood. Union Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson was killed during the battle. Despite the implication of finality in its name, the battle occurred midway through the campaign, and the city did not fall until September 2, 1864, after a Union siege and various attempts to seize railroads and supply lines leading to Atlanta. After taking the city, Sherman's troops headed south-southeastward toward Milledgeville, the state capital, and on to Savannah with the March to the Sea.|$|E
5|$|The British {{airborne}} forces landed {{some distance from}} their objectives and were quickly hampered by unexpected resistance– especially from elements of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions. Only a small force was able to reach the Arnhem road bridge while {{the main body of}} the division was halted on the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, XXX Corps was unable to advance north as quickly as anticipated due to the destruction of the bridge at Son, and failed to relieve the airborne troops according to schedule. After four days, the small British force at the bridge was <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> the rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket north of the river– where they could not be sufficiently reinforced by the Poles or XXX Corps when they arrived on the southern bank, nor by the RAF's resupply flights. After nine days of fighting, the shattered remains of the British 1st Airborne Division were withdrawn in Operation Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began on}} 23 June as the English army {{attempted}} to force {{its way across}} the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park. Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − {{at the back of his}} army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>and</b> its leaders were unable to regain control.|$|E
