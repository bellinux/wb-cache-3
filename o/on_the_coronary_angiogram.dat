40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} {{elucidate}} the clinical {{factors related to}} the development of no-reflow phenomenon after successful coronary reperfusion in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUNDMyocardial contrast echocardiography revealed that the no-reflow phenomenon is observed in some patients with a reperfused AMI, and those patients usually have poor functional and clinical outcomes. It is still unknown what clinical factors are related {{to the development of}} the no-reflow phenomenon. METHODSMyocardial contrast echocardiography was performed 15 min after successful coronary reperfusion therapy in 199 patients with an anterior wall AMI who underwent successful coronary reperfusion with primary coronary angioplasty within 24 h after the onset of AMI. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of the no-reflow phenomenon. RESULTSSeventy-nine patients showed the no-reflow phenomenon. Univariate analysis indicated that pre-infarction angina within 48 h before symptom onset, Killip class, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grade 0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram,</b> <b>the</b> number of abnormal Q-waves and the wall motion score (WMS) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> echocardiogram obtained at hospital admission are related to the no-reflow phenomenon. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that all of these factors, except for Killip class, are independent predictive factors of the no-reflow phenomenon. CONCLUSIONSDevelopment of the no-reflow phenomenon is related to the severity of myocardial damage (number of Q-waves), the size of the risk area (WMS) and the occlusion status of infarct-related artery. In addition, ischemic preconditioning (pre-infarction angina) seems to be the factor that attenuates the no-reflow phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne year {{survival}} and event-free survival rates were analyzed in 342 patients with {{acute myocardial infarction}} who were consecutively enrolled in a treatment protocol of early intravenous thrombolytic therapy followed by emergency coronary angioplasty. Ninety-four {{percent of the patients}} achieved successful reperfusion, including 4 % with failed angioplasty whose perfusion was maintained by means of a reperfusion catheter before emergency bypass surgery. The procedural mortality rate was 1. 2 % and the total in-hospital mortality rate was 11 %. Ninety-two percent of surviving nonsurgical patients who underwent repeat cardiac catheterization were discharged from the hospital with an open infarct-related artery. The related cumulative 1 year survival rate for all patients managed with this treatment strategy was 87 %, and the cardiac event-free survival rate was 84 %. The 1 year survival for hospital survivors was 98 % and the infarct-free survival rate was 94 %. Multivariable analysis identified the following factors as independent predictors of subsequent cardiovascular death: cardiogenic shock, greater age, lower ejection fraction, female gender and a closed infarct-related vessel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram.</b> Among patients with cardiogenic shock, despite a 42 % in-hospital mortality rate, only 4 % died during the first year after hospital discharge.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} assess the endothelial {{function}} of long-term coronary artery lesions in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Background. The vascular function of <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> arteries in children with long-term KD remains uncertain. We report our findings of the vascular response of <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> arteries to intracoronary injection of acetylcholine (ACh) in patients with KD. Methods. A total of 35 patients (25 patients with KD and 10 control subjects) were examined using coronary angiography. Individual arteries were divided into four groups according {{to the type of}} <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> artery lesion: group 1 consisted of 25 sites with regressed aneurysms. These aneurysms had developed in the acute stage but had subsequently regressed and demonstrated normal findings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> follow-up <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram.</b> Group 2 consisted of 24 sites with persistent aneurysms. Group 3 involved 60 angiographically normal sites in the same patients as those in group 1 or 2. Group 4 consisted of 30 sites in control subjects who had congenital heart disease with normal coronary arteries. During coronary angiography we infused 15 μg of ACh chloride into <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> artery. <b>The</b> lumen diameters were measured using a cine videodensitometric analyzer to study the distensibility of <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> artery wall. Results. The mean (±SD) change in diameter was an increase of 11. 71 ± 12. 34 % in group 3 (coronary arteries without lesions in patients with KD) and 12. 21 ± 9. 71 % in the control group, demonstrating marked vasodilation in both groups. In contrast, the changes in the regressed aneurysms of group 1 and in the persistent aneurysms of group 2 were − 2. 65 ± 12. 12 % and − 0. 08 ± 6. 51 %, respectively, demonstrating no change or mild vasoconstriction. The change in groups 1 and 2 was significantly less than that in group 3 or in the control group. Group 3 showed no significant difference from the control group. Conclusions. These findings suggest that long-term coronary artery lesions, even after aneurysm regression, may have impaired endothelial function.

40|$|AbstractThe {{utility of}} {{ergonovine}} testing for {{coronary artery spasm}} was assessed in 3, 447 patients with angiographically insignificant (≤ 50 % diameter stenosis) or no coronary artery disease. No patients clinically had Prinzmetal's variant angina. Overall, 4 % had a positive ergonovine test result, defined by spasm causing ≥ 75 % focal stenosis. Complications related to ergonovine use occurred in 11 patients (0. 03 %). In a training sample of 1, 136 patients (studied between 1980 and 1984), two independent predictors of spasm were found by using multivariate analysis: the amount of visible coronary artery disease <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> (p < 0. 0001) and a smoking history (p = 0. 001). A model to predict spasm based on these variables was validated in a test group of 2, 311 patients who received ergonovine from 1985 to 1989. This model allowed the identification of a subset of 480 patients in the validation sample who had a 10 % positive test rate compared with a 2 % positive test rate in the remaining patients. These results should permit clinicians who use provocative testing in the catheterization laboratory to reserve testing for the subset of this group of patients {{most likely to have}} abnormal findings...|$|E
40|$|Although ST segment {{shift is}} {{a marker of}} {{myocardial}} ischemia, some patients have no ST segment shift during {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA). The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate myocardial perfusion and metabolism in adaptation for ischemia using 201 TI and 123 I-BMIPP dual exercise stress myocardial single photon emission computed tomog-raphy (SPECT) (dual stress SPECT). In 28 patients with coronary artery disease, dual stress SPECT was performed 3 weeks before PTCA. Early and delayed images were obtained at 5 minutes and at 3 hours after termination of ergometer stress, respectively. During PTCA, 12 -lead ECG was recorded, and a significant ST segment shift was defined as more than 1 mm elevation or a depression of the J-point at the first ballooning. No collateral circulation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> or 201 TI filling on the delayed images were observed on any of the target regions of PTCA. Patients were divided into 2 groups: with (Group A: n = 15) and without (Group B: n = 13) significant ST segment shift during PTCA. A redistribution of TI was observed in 14 (93 %) of Group A and 10 (77 %) of Group B patients. Incidence of BMIPP redistribution was significantly higher in Group B (11 [85 %]) than in Group A (3 [20 %]) (p < 0. 05). Redistribution of BMIPP means suppression of fatty acid metabolism during exercise stress. Augmentation of glucose metabolism is speculated to be an energy source in ischemic preconditioning...|$|E
40|$|In 60 {{consecutive}} patients undergoing {{vein graft}} surgery the angiographic appearances of <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> vessels {{were compared with}} those of the vessels at operation. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> basis of lumen diameter at the potential sites for grafting it was possible to predict with reasonable accuracy from examination of the angiogram which vessels were large enough to be grafted.

The predictive value of the angiographic assessment was similar for branches thought to be too small (predictive value 74 %) and for those considered sufficiently large (predictive value 85 %) to receive a vein graft. Disease of the vessel walls was found at surgery (66 % of coronary branches examined) more frequently than was predicted from the angiographic appearances (33 %).

40|$|As an investigational fibrinolytic {{agent for}} acute {{myocardial}} infarction, intravenous recombinant {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (rt-PA) has been administered primarily in tertiary care and university centers. To determine the value of early initiation of such therapy, two satellite community hospital emergency rooms were established for use of rt-PA and the experience was compared among 142 consecutive patients who were transferred to a regional center for acute cardiac catheterization after intravenous rt-PA therapy. In Group I (n = 19), patients received rt-PA after interhospital transport to the regional center, but before cardiac catheterization. In Group II (n = 70), rt-PA therapy was initiated by the helicopter physician and nurse team after their arrival at the local community hospital emergency room. Group III patients (n = 53) had rt-PA administered in the local community hospital by the emergency room physician. Group III patients had earlier initiation of therapy (2. 1 ± 0. 8 hours in Group III versus 3. 8 ± 1. 2 hours in combined Groups I and II, p < 0. 001) and an increased rate of infarct vessel recanalization <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 90 minute <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> (81 in Group III versus 67 % in combined Groups I and II, p = 0. 057).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{hypertensive}} {{patients with}} typical chest pain but absence of coronary stenosis the coronary microcirculation may be impaired, thus, our study aimed to appraise, in these subjects, {{the role of}} the coronary microcirculation, assessed by Myocardial Blush Grade (MBG) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Frame Count (TFC). METHODS: A total of 95 subjects with chest pain and uninjured coronary arteries were recruited into the study: 80 subjects were hypertensive while 15 subjects were normotensive. The hypertensive subjects were divided into two subgroups: hypertensive subjects with positive scintigraphy and hypertensive subjects with negative scintigraphy. The TFC, a quantitative method of assessing coronary artery flow, the MBG, an assessment of the level of tissue perfusion, and the Total Myocardial Blush Score (TMBS), the sum of the myocardial blush grades of each coronary territory, were evaluated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> of every patient. RESULTS: The TFC was higher (p< 0. 05) in hypertensive subjects than in normotensive subjects. The MBG and the TMBS were lower (p< 0. 05) in hypertensive subjects than in normotensive subjects. The TFC was higher (p< 0. 05) in positive scintigraphy than in negative scintigraphy. The MBG was lower (p< 0. 05) in positive scintigraphy than in negative scintigraphy. The Spearman rank correlation test showed that the TFC and the MBG was inversely associated.

40|$|ObjectivesThis {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} whether a fractional flow reserve (FFR) -guided SYNTAX score (SS), termed “functional SYNTAX score” (FSS), would predict clinical outcome better than the classic SS in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BackgroundThe SS is a purely anatomic score based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> and predicts outcome after PCI in patients with multivessel CAD. FFR-guided PCI improves outcomes by adding functional information to the anatomic information obtained from the angiogram. MethodsThe SS was prospectively collected in 497 patients enrolled in the FAME (Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) study. FSS was determined by only counting ischemia-producing lesions (FFR ≤ 0. 80). The ability of each score to predict major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 year was compared. ResultsThe 497 patients were divided into tertiles of risk based on the SS. After determining the FSS for each patient, 32 % moved to a lower-risk group as follows. MACE occurred in 9. 0 %, 11. 3 %, and 26. 7 % of patients in the low-, medium-, and high-FSS groups, respectively (p < 0. 001). Only FSS and procedure time were independent predictors of 1 -year MACE. FSS demonstrated a better predictive accuracy for MACE compared with SS (Harrell's C of FSS, 0. 677 vs. SS, 0. 630, p = 0. 02; integrated discrimination improvement of 1. 94 %, p < 0. 001). ConclusionsRecalculating SS by only incorporating ischemia-producing lesions as determined by FFR decreases the number of higher-risk patients and better discriminates risk for adverse events in patients with multivessel CAD undergoing PCI.

Until now, this syndrome has been reported only in Japanese patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe 13 white patients who presented with this syndrome over the previous four years. RESULTS: All but one of the patients were women {{with a mean age of}} 62 years. Eight of them presented with chest pain, of whom six had cardiogenic shock. In nine patients a triggering factor was identified: emotional stress in three, trauma in one, pneumonia in one, asthma crisis in one, exercise in two, and cerebrovascular accident in one. In all patients left ventriculography showed very extensive apical akinesia ("apical ballooning") in the absence of a significant coronary artery stenosis, not corresponding with the perfusion territory of a single epicardial coronary artery. Mean maximal creatine kinase MB and troponin rise were 27. 4 microg/l (range 5. 2 - 115. 7 microg/l, median 16. 6 microg/l) and 18. 7 microg/l (range 2. 0 - 97. 6 microg/l, median 14. 5 microg/l), respectively. Six patients were treated with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. One patient died of multiple organ failure. On necropsy, no myocardial infarction was found.

40|$|ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND -: Experimental {{studies have}} shown that {{ultrasound}} contrast agents enhance the effectiveness of thrombolytic agents in the presence of ultrasound in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we have launched a clinical pilot study, called "Sonolysis", to study this effect in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction based on proximal lesions of the infarct-related artery. METHODS/DESIGN -: In our multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial we will include patients between 18 and 80 years of age with their first ST-elevation myocardial infarction based on a proximal lesion of the infarct-related artery. After receiving a single bolus alteplase 50 mg IV (Actilyse(R) Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH), a loading dose of aspirin 500 mg, and heparin 5000 IU in the ambulance according to the prehospital thrombolysis protocol, patients, following oral informed consent, are randomized to undergo 15 minutes of pulsatile ultrasound with intravenous administration of ultrasound contrast agent or placebo without ultrasound. Afterwards coronary angiography and, if indicated, percutaneous coronary intervention will take place. A total of 60 patients will be enrolled in approximately 1 year. The primary endpoints are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> and consist of TIMI flow, corrected TIMI frame count, and myocardial blush grade. Follow-up includes 12 -lead ECG, 2 D-echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and enzyme markers to obtain our secondary endpoints, including the infarct size, wall motion abnormalities, and the global left ventricular function. DISCUSSION -: The Sonolysis study is the first multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial investigating the therapeutic application of ultrasound and microbubbles in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients.

Of the 1, 414 lesions (509 patients) in the FFR-guided arm of the FAME study, 1, 329 were successfully assessed by the FFR and are included in this analysis. ResultsBefore FFR measurement, these lesions were categorized into 50 % to 70 % (47 % of all lesions), 71 % to 90 % (39 % of all lesions), and 91 % to 99 % (15 % of all lesions) diameter stenosis by visual assessment. In the category 50 % to 70 % stenosis, 35 % were functionally significant (FFR ≤ 0. 80) and 65 % were not (FFR > 0. 80).

40|$|Although {{recognized}} as an important feature of atherosclerotic coronary disease, {{little is known about}} the frequency and prognostic importance of distal embolization during primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. As part of a randomized trial of thrombolysis vs primary angioplasty, 178 patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with primary angioplasty. In these patients the occurrence of distal embolization after angioplasty was assessed. Embolization was defined as a distal filling defect with an abrupt 'cutoff' in one of the peripheral coronary artery branches of the infarct-related vessel, distal to the site of angioplasty. We analysed myocardial blush grade, ST-T segment elevation resolution, enzymatic infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with and without distal embolization. Clinical information was collected for a mean of 5 years. Distal embolization was present in 27 patients (15. 2 %). Mean age and gender were not different from patients without distal embolization. Angiographic success (thrombolyis in myocardial infarction flow grade 3 and residual stenosis < 50 %) after primary angioplasty was less frequently observed in patients with distal embolization (70 % vs 90 %, P < 0. 01). Myocardial blush and ST-T segment elevation resolution after angioplasty were reduced when distal embolization was present. Patients with distal embolization had a larger enzymatic infarct size (mean cumulative lactate dehydrogenase measured over 72 h, 1612 vs 847, P < 0. 05) and a lower left ventricle ejection fraction at discharge (42 % vs 51 %, P < 0. 01). Long-term mortality was higher in patients with distal embolization (44 % vs 9 %, P < 0. 001). Distal embolization in patients treated with primary angioplasty is visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> in 15. 2 % of patients. It is related to reduced myocardial reperfusion, more extensive myocardial damage and a poor prognosis. Additional pharmacological interventions and/ or mechanical devices should be studied to prevent and/or treat distal embolizatio...|$|E

Results: <b>The</b> analysis of <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiograms</b> showed that out of the 17 left ventricular segments 9. 5 ± 1. 9, 3. 3 ± 2. 4 and 4. 2 ± 2. 5 were supplied by the left anterior descending, the left circumflex and <b>the</b> right <b>coronary</b> artery, respectively. A highly significant correlation was found between the angiographic and both the CT and the autopsy determination of the number of left ventricular segments (r= 0. 97 and 0. 94, p< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{selective}} hand {{injection of}} contrast media into <b>the</b> right <b>coronary</b> artery of a middle-aged male by Doctor F. Mason Sones on October 30, 1958 {{introduced a new}} era in Cardiovascular Medicine. It is the purpose of this presentation to portray the pivotal role <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> has played in creating some of the epochal events and discoveries that have characterized the march of progress in the field of cardiology over the past five decades. As the first reliable in vivo marker for the presence of obstructing <b>coronary</b> lesions, <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> importantly led to our first studies of the natural history of patients with CAD. The motion studies afforded by cineangiography also permitted dynamic visualization of the contracting ventricle which led to the concept of regional wall motion abnormalities being characteristic of CAD and provided some of our earliest understanding of left ventricular dysfunction. <b>The</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> also provided <b>the</b> stimulus for the development of aorto-coronary bypass surgery that was introduced by Dr. Rene Favaloro in May 1967. Subsequently, Dr. Andreas Gruntzig astounded the cardiology world by reporting his new percutaneous method of achieving revascularization (PTCA). <b>The</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> provided <b>the</b> road map necessary for the successful deployment and application of this balloon technology that was soon to rival CABG surgery. The thrombolytic era was heralded in July 1979 when Dr. Peter Rentrop documented the successful reperfusion of a coronary artery in a 57 -year old man by first recanalizing the occluding thrombus with a guidewire and then infusing the proteolytic enzyme, streptokinase directly into the artery. Within a year, DeWood made the angiographic observation that spontaneous regression of the totally occluding thrombus occurred among patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> arteriography within <b>the</b> first 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction. This led to <b>the</b> earliest studies <b>on</b> clot lysis by fibrinolytic agents and also {{paved the way for the}} balloon catheter to be used as a mechanical means of achieving <b>coronary</b> reperfusion in <b>the</b> acute setting. In the 1980 s it was realized that vigorous lipid lowering with statin drugs did little to effect regression of the established atherosclerotic lesion but it did result in a dramatic decrease in subsequent clinical cardiovascular events. Similar observations were made by Little and others that acute coronary occlusion resulted more often from young, non-obstructing atheromatous lesions than it did from high grade obstructive lesions. This incriminated rupture of the soft, lipid rich atheromatous plaque as the most common mechanism leading to acute MI. In the closing decade of the past century, estimates of coronary blood flow using TIMI flow grades and TIMI frame rates led to the central unifying concept that the early restoration of normal flow (TIMI grade 3) was linearly related to survival after reperfusion therapy whether it be achieved pharmacologically or mechanically. <b>The</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angiogram</b> was also integral in establishing antiplatelet therapy as the preferred pharmacotherapeutic agents to be used in association with stent deployment compared to coumarin drugs in preventing stent thrombosis. Although <b>the</b> <b>coronary</b> catheter is now used to deliver newer intracoronary devices such as intravascular ultrasound, velocity probes, gene probes and eluting catheters, it has served as the one indispensable form of coronary imaging for five successive decades. As such it has provided far more than is implied by the term "lumenology" and can rightly be called the lumen de lumine, the light of lights, for cardiovascular medicine...|$|R

The procedural risk during PCI in patients with single coronary ostium is high. Moreover, the angulation and course of the culprit artery also pose a challenge.
