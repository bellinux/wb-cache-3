In the middle there is the bride dancing with an older man, her father. On the right of the work, there is a musician playing on a pijpzak, who is watching the dance from the side. Judging by the writing utensils hanging <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belt,</b> he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a hanging tablecloth decorated with a crown and beneath it is the bride's table. Before her table, money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat.|$|E
5|$|His {{investigations}} angered many in Mexico's {{political elite}} {{and made him}} a frequent target of death threats. Buendía took the death threats he received very seriously and thereby carried a pistol, either <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belt</b> or in a leather pocket. Prior to his death, Buendía wrote extensively on the alleged corruption within Mexico's Petroleum Workers Union; the allegations of wrongdoings of Jorge Díaz Serrano, former leader of Pemex, the national oil company; and Arturo Durazo Moreno, {{the former head of}} Mexico City's police force. Buendía also criticized the role of the U.S. government and the CIA in Mexico, and often published names of American officials involved in secret operations. Although he was quick to publish controversial reports, Buendía's direct reporting was respected and generally considered reliable given his access to top Mexican officials. He was the most-read journalist in Mexico's print media, and is often cited by newspapers and journalists as the most influential political columnist in Mexico of {{the second half of the}} 20th century.|$|E

He explained that he [...] "got stuck on this idea of the hero never fires a gun, but he just has a bunch of tools <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belt,</b> like a power drill or a can of pressurized Freon, a screwdriver.

Ophelia also becomes concerned when Eddie, in the heat of battle, transforms into a winged creature, an effect Eddie decides to use to his advantage at the time.|$|E

[...] In his book, Planet Simpson, Chris Turner calls it the best episode of the series, saying [...] "Episode 9F15 of The Simpsons should be taught in schools, in history, economics, social studies, literature and art class. It's flawless". He also called it [...] "the funniest half-hour in TV history", and provided a full analysis of the episode, only criticizing the chalkboard and couch gags. He maintains that he chose the episode as best ever before Entertainment Weeklys list was published.|$|E

2500|$|Nugent {{was born}} in 1840 in County Cavan, Ireland, and entered the Marine Corps from Charleston, Massachusetts on February 8, 1858. Nugent served on several {{different}} ships until {{he was assigned to}} the marine detachment aboard the steamer [...] as an orderly sergeant. On June 15, 1863, while serving aboard Fort Henry, Sergeant Nugent was placed in charge of a small group and sent to reconnoiter an area along the Crystal River in Florida. When they were six miles up the river they discovered a small breast works. Nugent left their boat with two men and with the other four assaulted the enemy fortification. A woman was among the enemy force so he ordered his men not to fire so that she would not be injured. Although they withheld their fire they were able to drive the enemy force from their fortification, forcing them to seek safety in the swamp. The rebel officer took one shot hitting Nugent in his cap box <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>belt,</b> not injuring him. When the enemy was pushed from their fortification and forced to retreat into the swamp for safety they left weapons and equipment and documents behind that Nugent and his Marines were able to capture. Nugent’s party took the weapons and items they needed and destroyed the rest so they couldn’t be used again by the enemy before returning to their vessel. On July 30, 1863, Nugent was involved in another incident off Depot Key, Florida, when he {{and other members of the}} ship's crew captured a boat containing 2 men and a woman with their baggage. They were in danger of drowning and were Unionists trying to escape from the locals. [...] For these incidents he was recommended for the United States highest decoration for bravery, the Medal of Honor.
