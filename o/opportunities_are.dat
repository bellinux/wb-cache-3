Though most Italian universities have classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.|$|E

5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage <b>opportunities</b> <b>are</b> fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest rates between two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Systematic {{analysis}} {{and understanding of}} error recovery can provide hospitals with the necessary information to improve their resilience. Because errors will always crop up and 100 % safety can never be achieved, health care systems {{should be able to}} prevent patient harm by timely and effective error recovery. In this paper we identified absent, missed and failed recovery opportunities in 56 medication errors, of which 52 resulted in severe patient harm or patient death. At least one recovery <b>opportunity</b> <b>was</b> present in nearly all of the medication errors. In the set of 52 full-blown accidents 127 recovery <b>opportunities</b> <b>were</b> identified. Of these, 94 recovery <b>opportunities</b> <b>were</b> planned recovery opportunities; 33 recovery <b>opportunities</b> <b>were</b> unplanned recovery <b>opportunities.</b> For these recovery opportunities the underlying failure factors were identified and classified according to the Eindhoven Classification Model. The majority of the failure factors underlying the planned recovery <b>opportunities</b> <b>were</b> organisational failure factors; the majority of the failure factors underlying the unplanned recovery <b>opportunities</b> <b>were</b> human failure factors. From this study it can be concluded that accidents can be used as an alternative data source to near misses for the {{analysis and}} understanding of error recovery. ...|$|R

They wear a uniform and work {{together}} in patrols of four to ten boys with an elected patrol leader. Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors. The advancement system provides opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance. Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as role models and mentors, but they are expected to plan their own activities within the troop and to participate in community service. <b>Opportunities</b> <b>are</b> provided for leadership training with practical application.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical <b>opportunities</b> <b>are</b> based on the previous strategy of play. A game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E

In this paper, equity of <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> defined and measured through the theoretical framework of the social opportunity function, a concept similar to the social welfare function. The functional and graphical distribution of <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> discussed through the generalized Lorenz curve and the Bonferroni curve, while complete ranking of distributions is achieved through their related numerical indices: the concentration index and the Bonferroni index of opportunity, respectively. The concepts of relative and absolute measures of equity of <b>opportunity</b> <b>are</b> then introduced and a social opportunity index that considers both the amount and distribution of <b>opportunity</b> <b>is</b> developed.

More than 2,500 students participate in competitive clubs, intramural sport leagues, and tournaments. <b>Opportunities</b> <b>are</b> offered at multiple skill levels across a variety of sports. Dalhousie has six competitive sports clubs and 17 recreational clubs. Dalhousie's Agricultural Campus operates its own varsity team, called the Dalhousie Rams. The Rams varsity team participates in the Atlantic Collegiate Athletic Association, a member of the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association. The Rams varsity teams include badminton, basketball, rugby, soccer, volleyball, and woodsmen.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning <b>opportunities</b> <b>are</b> dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage <b>opportunities</b> <b>are</b> eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E
