5|$|In 1938, Hitler {{decided that}} the old Reich Chancellery was not big enough to house the {{ministries}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich.</b> He assigned his favorite architect Albert Speer to build the new Chancellery.

5|$|Once in power, Adolf Hitler soon {{banned the}} Social Democratic Party and other {{political}} organizations. Concerned for his family's safety, Kellner moved {{to the town of}} Laubach in Hesse, where he became the chief justice inspector: the judicial officer in charge of the administration of the courthouse. When Hitler ordered the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Kellner began his secret diary to record the crimes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 50th {{birthday}} of Adolf Hitler on 20 April 1939 was celebrated {{as a national}} holiday throughout Nazi Germany {{and other parts of}} the world. Gifts and telegrams of congratulations were received from all over Germany and allied countries, although the Western Allies ignored the event diplomatically. The birthday celebration saw, amongst other events, the largest military parade in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich,</b> with army, air force, navy and SS units, numbering almost 50,000 men.|$|E

5|$|The Rommel myth, {{also known}} as the Rommel legend, as a term used by {{critical}} historians, refers to common depictions of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in popular culture and academic writings as an apolitical, brilliant commander, and a victim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich</b> due to his participation in the 20 July plot against Adolf Hitler. According to critical historians, such depictions are not accurate.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich,</b> Hess was {{nominated}} to serve {{again as a}} judge in Düsseldorf but declined, as he {{did not wish to}} work alongside former colleagues who {{had been part of the}} Nazi judicial system. He started a new career in the railways in 1946, and from 1949–55 served as President of the German Federal Railways Authority in Frankfurt am Main. He was awarded a Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and was given a plaque of honour by the city of Frankfurt in 1970. He died there on 14 September 1983.|$|E
5|$|Since {{his early}} youth {{he was very}} {{enthusiastic}} about flying and volunteered for military service in the Luftwaffe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich</b> on 10 December 1935. There he participated {{in a number of}} exercises and was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) of the Reserves on 1 December 1936. In his civilian life, Brändle attained a pilot license and worked as a flight instructor. As an instructor, he trained roughly 150 students and logged more than 6,000 starts and 8,000 flight hours before he became a military aviator. In addition to his passion for motor power flight, he also was a glider pilot.|$|E

50|$|Additional charges at {{his trial}} {{included}} unlawful deportation and abetting execution.

5|$|Sélestat became French {{again after}} the First World War, during which almost a {{thousand}} inhabitants died. It was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich</b> during the Second World War. Its liberation took three months and ended in February 1945. The town is a recipient of the War Cross 1914–1918 and War Cross 1939–1945. Sélestat has experienced steady demographic and economic growth since 1945. Its population almost doubled between 1946 and 1999 and two industrial parks were built to accommodate new large factories. The service industry has enriched the town's economy since the 1970s {{with a large number}} of small businesses.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German language: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its {{variants}} {{were the}} highest awards in the military <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich.</b> Recipients are grouped by grades of the Knight's Cross. During or shortly after World War II, 318 German sailors and servicemen of the Kriegsmarine received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Of these, 316 presentations were formally made. Two recipients received the award after 11 May 1945, when Großadmiral Karl Dönitz ordered a cease of promotions and illegalized subsequent awards. The final two recipients are therefore considered to have received the medal without legal authority.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} 882 Oak Leaves {{recipients}} {{is based on}} the analysis and acceptance of the order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR).

After 23 aerial victories as heavy fighter pilot, he received the German Cross in Gold and was then posted to Jagdgeschwader 5 (JG 5—5th Fighter Wing) in September 1942.

5|$|David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English Holocaust denier {{and author}} {{who has written}} on the {{military}} and political history of World War II, {{with a focus on}} Nazi Germany. His works include The Destruction of Dresden (1963), Hitler's War (1977), Churchill's War (1987), and Goebbels: Mastermind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich</b> (1996). In his works, he argued that Hitler did not know of the extermination of Jews or, if he did, opposed it. Though Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents.|$|E
50|$|Under French rule from 1797 to 1814, {{the former}} “administrative parish” became a mairie (“mayoralty”). From 1815 to 1817, the Brombach Pflege was Prussian, from 1817 to 1937 part of Oldenburg, and for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich’s</b> time in power, Prussian again.

5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich</b> {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and that he should not be held personally responsible for its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not be held responsible for the content of the film.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's {{personal}} masseur Felix Kersten {{claimed that}} the former even contemplated resettling the entire Dutch population, some 8 million people in total at the time, to agricultural lands in the Vistula and Bug River valleys of German-occupied Poland as {{the most efficient way}} of facilitating their immediate Germanization. In this eventuality he is alleged to have further hoped to establish an SS Province of Holland in vacated Dutch territory, and to distribute all confiscated Dutch property and real estate among reliable SS-men. However this claim was shown to be a myth by Loe de Jong in his book Two Legends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich.</b>|$|E
5|$|Louise {{inspired}} {{the establishment of}} a conservative women's organization known as Königin-Luise-Bund, often shortened to Luisenbund ("Queen Louise League") in which her person achieved an almost cult-like status. The group's main purpose was to promote patriotic feelings among German women, and it emphasized the family and German morality. The Königin-Luise-Bund was active {{during the time of the}} Weimar Republic and the first years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Reich.</b> Despite having actively supported the National Socialist movement since its early stages all through their accession to power in 1933, the Queen Louise League was nonetheless disbanded by the Nazis in 1934, as they viewed it as a hostile organization.|$|E
