5|$|At this time, the {{existing}} infantry battalions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Citizens</b> Force were redesignated {{to perpetuate the}} numerical designations of the AIF, and although {{an attempt was made}} to allocate these designations based on regional considerations, ultimately this was not always possible and ultimately when the 3rd Division was re-established, only two of its component battalions—the 37th and 39th Battalions—had previously been assigned to the division.|$|E
40|$|Theories {{of dignity}} have to {{navigate}} between two conceptions: <b>the</b> egalitarian idea <b>of</b> {{human dignity and}} <b>the</b> old idea <b>of</b> dignitas, connected with hierarchy, rank, and office. One possible way <b>of</b> bridging <b>the</b> {{gap between the two}} is to talk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dignity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizen.</b> In modern republics and democracies, <b>the</b> dignity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> extends to a large sector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population and connotes something about <b>the</b> general quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relation {{between the government and the}} governed. This chapter first explores Immanuel Kant’s account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dignity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizen,</b> and then it pursues <b>the</b> implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dignity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> for modern society and modern theories of human dignity. Though <b>the</b> dignity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> and human dignity are not the same concept, they are congruent in many respects and the former casts considerable light on the latter — in particular on the connection between dignity and responsibility and dignity and transparency in social and political relations...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis on}} <b>the</b> <b>Citizen</b> {{participation}} in community activities deals with <b>the</b> applicable legislation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> participation in community activities and afterwards it evaluates <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> participation in governance in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Louny and gives proposals {{and recommendations for}} higher extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> participation. <b>The</b> first chapter comprises a legal entity status of municipalities, their scope of authority and characteristic of particular administrative bodies. The second chapter deals with a definition of basic terms and an analysis of specific ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizen</b> participation. <b>The</b> third chapter, falling within <b>the</b> practical part <b>of</b> this bachelor thesis, is concerned with an analysis of a voter turnout and <b>the</b> established ways <b>of</b> <b>citizen</b> participation in <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Louny and proposes further alternatives <b>of</b> cooperation between <b>the</b> city and its citizens...|$|R

The two units were subsequently delinked in 1939 when the new 26th Australian Infantry Battalion was raised in Queensland as Australia mobilised for war.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I {{the units}} that had been raised {{as part of the}} AIF were disbanded, and the focus of Australian defence {{planning}} returned once more to the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Citizens</b> Forces. To this end, a review of defence requirements in 1920 established the need for Australia to be able to field a force of approximately 270,000 men {{in the event of a}} war, of which half of this would be maintained in peacetime through compulsory enlistment. It was also decided that the Citizens Force would be re-organised along the lines of the AIF, adopting the divisional structure of the AIF units and maintaining their battle honours. The AIF officially ceased to exist on 1 April 1921 and the new organisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Citizens</b> Forces was adopted a month later; this saw the reorganisation of the 88 infantry battalions and five pioneer regiments that had been established under the 1918 scheme, the abolition of infantry regiments and the re-establishment of the 60 infantry battalions that had existed within the AIF, as well as various other units, such as light horse regiments, as well.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} the division was disbanded in December 1945 {{as part of the}} demobilisation process, but was it later re-raised in 1948 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Citizens</b> Military Force. It subsequently served through the Cold War as a reserve formation until 1991 when the division was disbanded for a final time as the Australian Army was restructured and the focus of Australian field force operations shifted from the divisional-level to brigades.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the 2nd Battalion was re-raised as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Citizens</b> Military Force in 1948. In 1960, it {{was reduced}} to a company-level {{formation}} but was re-formed as a battalion of the Royal New South Wales Regiment in 1965. It remained on the Australian order of battle until 1987 when it was amalgamated with the 17th Battalion, to form the 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, a unit which remains part of the Australian Army Reserve today.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, the {{decision}} was made to perpetuate the numerical designations and battle honours of the AIF by re-raising the AIF units as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Citizens</b> Force. This was done by reorganising the existing Citizens Forces units so that they would adopt the identity of the AIF units that had been recruited within their regions and in which many of the pre-war citizen soldiers had served. This was designed so as to maintain the regional identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Citizens</b> Forces units, as well as the honours and traditions of the AIF units. In this time the 6th Battalion was re-raised from personnel drawn from six existing units: all of the 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment; as well as part of the 29th Light Horse Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment; the 5th Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment and the 5th Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment. Through these units, the battalion gained a complex lineage, including that of the 64th Infantry, a unit that could trace its lineage back to 1854 and claimed to be the oldest infantry unit in Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Australia's {{part-time}} military force, {{under the}} guise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Citizens</b> Military Force (CMF), was re-raised. At this time, only two divisions were formed along with other supporting units. The 2nd Battalion {{was one of those}} units that was re-established, returning to the order of battle in April 1948, as part of the 2nd Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, these battle honours were {{entrusted}} to the 17th/18th Battalion (North Shore Regiment), {{which had been}} formed in 1948, when Australia's part-time military force was re-raised under the guise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Citizens</b> Military Force. Through a series of re-organisations, these battle honours were passed to the 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, an Australian Army Reserve infantry battalion that is currently based in central New South Wales.|$|E

The common people however also proved unwilling to contribute, and rioted in favour of an accommodation with the Ottomans, when the news spread that they had offered a peaceful settlement, provided that the Despot Andronikos left the city.|$|E
