Divided into four thematic parts, this book largely focuses on the post-Cold War period, which has seen a notable upsurge in commemorative activity relating to the Second World War and significant qualitative changes in its character. The first part explores the enduring utility and the limitations of the national frame in France, Germany and China. The second explores transnational transactions in remembrance, looking at memories of the British Empire at war, contested memories in East-Central Europe and the transnational campaign <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Japan?s</b> former ?comfort women?. A third section considers local and sectional memories of the war and the fourth analyses innovative practices of memory, including re-enactment, video gaming and Holocaust tourism.

40|$|TRIANGULAR COOPERATION is a {{relatively}} recent mode of development cooperation.

At the same time, it poses several risks that could further complicate international development coopera-tion. To make full use of its potential, it is important to con-ceive it as a learning process, to identify the interests of the three parties involved, and to apply the internationally agreed principles of aid effectiveness. When these principles are applied, triangular cooperation can enrich international de-velopment cooperation. 2 Actors and factors TRADITIONAL DONORS engaged in triangular cooperation make up roughly two thirds of the DAC membership with Japan {{at the top of the}} list, followed by Germany, Spain, Canada, and the rest.
