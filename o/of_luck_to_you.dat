The candy is in fine shape and will be consumed rapidly. The box it came in {{must have been the}} plaything of every baggage-smasher from Providence to the Southwest. How it held together is one of those miracles. The PO here marked it “Received in Bad Order,” but {{as long as it was}} bad order and not bad odor, who cares? All of us fellows here sure appreciate it, I assure you. Do not let that peaceful scene above [etched landscape with cowboy and horse at top of stationery] fool you. Maybe at some times of the year a cowboy could sit down and watch the cattle from a hill, but right now he would freeze to death. The cattle and the horses have thick, shaggy coats and for the last two weeks they have had a tough time finding anything to eat because of all the snow. Of course I have had to do more driving around the country the last two months than ever before and none of the trucks have cabs. You might think it would build a fellow up but it doesn’t. Just wears him out. And to think I went to Bryant so I could get a soft job, inside, and wouldn’t have to be tough at all. But I can’t kick. I’m still in a good country.

Best <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> Steve! Last week, the CM Specialist Group of British Computer Society (BCS CMSG) hosted a special event on Agile-versus-Traditional Configuration Management [1]. Presenters discussed the impact of agile methods to traditional SCM and posed the question: Is there a need for Agile CM- and what is it? This month, we describe what we believe are {{the root causes of}} some key differences between agile and traditional development, and how they change certain assumptions SCM has about software development. Should I be worried about Agile Development? Agile development practices can significantly impact software development practices. Of course, any significant process change is ultimately a change in the organization’s culture. And underlying any cultural change is a set of values and beliefs that define and sustain the change in behaviors and mindsets. How will such changes affect us as SCM professionals? • Should SCM professionals be worried about agile projects running out of control? • Should agile teams be worried about SCM cramping their style and entangling them in red tape...|$|E

But I did write you soon after receiving some camel cigarettes. If for some reason the letter did not reach you, I would like to express my thanks again now and also let you know that you have the correct address.

Here at Miami Beach we have plenty of bathing facilities, but during the summer the temperature of the water reaches 85 or 88 degrees, and after a swim you are not refreshed like you lucky folks are a home. There is one break we get here in Florida though, and that is we can go bathing and lay on the beach wile you are wrapped up in heavy winter clothing to keep warm. The ocean temperature averages around 70 or 75 degrees in the winter and it sure feels good. Even this simmer we are getting the breaks. So far the hottest day we have had has been 86 and I’ve seen by the Providence Papers that you have had much warmer days even though you can look forward to a cool day now and then.

You see around the first of August, I left the states for overseas duty and after some 2 ½ months I finally arrived at my destination, some where in India. The land of enchantment and untold mysteries, with its mystic beauties, sets a throb in any travelers heart. All of the boys over here have found India an unforeseen paradise. India at dawn, India at dusk never loses its magnificence as the sun slowly rises or sets in the sky over this picturesque land. When I did get here I had a bundle of mail 1 foot high. Your letter was on top, although I {{did not know it}} was yours. It was put in a war tmpt. envelope because it had so many different addresses on it. It followed me from Ft. Harrison, Ind. to Homestead, Fla, then to Miami, then up to New York, where it was sent overseas. It was wonderful news hearing about those Bryant fellows who were found after reported missing. We all hope and pray that many more of our boys missing in action will be found. Thanks a log for the list of fellow’s addresses. I often wondered where they all went too. Things in India arn’t [sic] so bad though. We get all the cigarettes and tobacco we need, we usually get a ration of American beer each week, besides, gum, candy, toilet articles, and magazines. We’ve seen several U. S. O. shows direct from the States, including Jack Benny and his cast. Every so often we see an all G. I. show, which really are good. We have several short wave radios and we get broadcasts from the United States, England, Italy, South America, and dear old Japan, (all propaganda). In closing I would like to say {{to the members of the}} B. S. C. that you have my heartiest congratulations on the work you are doing for the fellows in the Armed Forces.
