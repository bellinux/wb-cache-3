40|$|Independent {{advocacy}} has had {{an impact}} on promoting the rights of children and young people and breaking down some of the barriers that <b>obstruct</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to achieve social justice and engage in decision-making. Advocacy has also been considered an important social work skill. However, the development of independent advocacy and changes in the delivery of health and social care services have {{had an impact on}} how far social workers now feel able to directly advocate for service users. Social workers currently operate with a context of bureaucracy and marketisation that has become increasingly regulated and controlled by central government. This paper examines the tensions faced by social workers in managing their advocacy role through a discussion of advocacy in relation to children and young people. By examining the concepts of 'best interests' and the welfare of the child the paper considers dilemmas for social workers committed to advocating for children and young people. It argues that a wider culture of advocacy is needed that utilises social work advocacy {{and at the same time}} recognises how and when to access independent advocacy support. Social workers should reclaim their advocacy role and support independent advocacy to ensure that a culture of advocacy underpins the future delivery of services...|$|E

The authors analyze how battering impacts the work and employability of women from various employment levels and backgrounds. Data were obtained through qualita-tive interviews with 19 residents of a domestic violence shelter, some of whom had obtained substantial education and built solid and lucrative careers prior to being abused.

Young child mortality rates in rural areas are also higher {{than they are in}} urban areas. Elderly citizens also tend to live in rural areas disproportionately, which <b>obstructs</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to receive healthcare. Finally, Bhuttarai reports that people living in rural areas tend to spend more money on health care than do city dwellers.|$|R
40|$|Ecological concepts, and in {{particular}} population dynamics, {{has been found to}} be among the most difficult topics in biology. Some researchers pointed to students' relatively weak mathematical background as the main source of learning difficulties. This paper reports on an investigation of pupil's (n= 73) reasoning about the ecological phenomena by using an iconic modelling tool, WorldMaker. The simulations eliminated the need for understanding of mathematical equations, and made the ecological concepts much more accessible to some children. However, many of the pupils reasoned from an anthropocentric perspective that <b>obstructed</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to predict ecological phenomena which requires systems thinking.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the SLAC program for fire safety and life safety. Fire safety addresses {{the design and}} management of SLAC’s physical assets {{to minimize the risk}} of fire. Life safety addresses the design and management of building exit pathways to allow safe and effective evacuation of buildings under all emergency conditions, including fires. It is the intent of SLAC to provide a level of fire protection and fire suppression capability sufficient to minimize losses from fire and related hazards, consistent with the best class of protected property in private industry. 1. 1 Hazards/Impacts Uncontrolled fires have the potential to injure personnel, destroy property, and disrupt operations. In the event of an emergency, improper building exiting arrangements can threaten the safety of building occupants by <b>obstructing</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to leave the building promptly and safely. Each DOE national laboratory has a distinctive mix of facilities that defines its predominant fire hazards. The facilities that most distinguish SLAC are its particle accelerators, associated photon sources, and related research programs. The facilities and equipment supporting these accelerators introduce distinctive fire hazards and challenges, including the following...|$|R
40|$|Speaking is a {{language}} skill {{that is highly}} affected by human psychology (Haidara, 2014). Each individual has their own problems {{in the learning process}} and each problem is different from the other. That is why, most learners find it difficult to express themselves in {{a language}} that is not their mother tongue. This research paper investigates the effect of methodological strategies implemented in order to help students to overcome the fear of speaking in English. The study also reflects data collection, includes an observation guide, an interview and a survey analyzed descriptively. In the interviews and survey both students and teacher share their opinions about the factors that affect learners’ speaking performance. Findings indicate that the methodological strategies the teacher uses are appropriate with the level of knowledge students have. Those strategies can help them greatly because they participate actively and voluntarily. Also, the factors that <b>obstruct</b> <b>their</b> speaking <b>ability</b> evolution are fear of making mistakes and classmates criticism...|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} have recently introduced several incisive reforms {{in higher education}} sector, aiming at improving its performance through the introduction of “business-like” management practices into public organisations (BOGT and SCAPENS, 2012). The main aims of these reforms were enhancing institutional autonomy and stressing quality assurance and accountability (NEAVE, 1988; OECD, 2003, 2009; EURYDICE, 2000; 2008), producing several relevant effects, such as a different relationship between central government and each state university, the decentralisation of responsibilities and, especially, an increased attention given to financial budgeting. In particular, central governments are reducing their financial support to universities (as well as local governmental entities), declaring that future assignments of funds {{will be based on}} assessments of their performance. By this way, a dominant topic in the literature in recent years is the augmented use of performance information in the public sector. Generally speaking, even if there are divergent opinions about the effectiveness of performance-based accountability structures, scholars have pointed out that these performance-based mechanisms could support, in some ways, both reform state budgets and change service delivery (Hunt, 2008; Kelly et al, 2010). This reform movement aims to get universities out from under bureaucratic regulations, which in the past have <b>obstructed</b> <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> to respond to societal demands, {{and at the same time}} to hold them accountable for serving the stakeholders’ needs. Different pieces of research have investigated the effectiveness of these performance-based reforms through both case studies (BANTA et al, 1996) and comprehensive and thorough analyses of public colleges and universities (RABOVSKY, 2012). Assuming as background studies concerning the above-mentioned link between performances and funding, this study would contribute to current literature by investigating the key theoretical elements and methods used to analyze financial conditions and financial distress of public universities, while previous literature has mainly focused on local governmental entities (CARMELI, 2003, 2008; JONES and WALKER, 2007) ...|$|R
