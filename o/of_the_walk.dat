5|$|Striding Edge is {{a notorious}} {{accident}} spot among hikers and scramblers. In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge {{up to the}} summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and a snow cornice, and {{can be the most}} dangerous part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk.</b> Without an ice axe or crampons this presents a serious obstacle. In January 2008 two walkers died after falling from the ridge in separate incidents. Another walker died after falling from Striding Edge in May 2008.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round. The union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full-time workers being made redundant and {{a significant increase in}} the number of part-time staff. The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail stopped talking to staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not stopped talking to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Star Trek, he was {{nominated}} for Hugo Awards for two television movies, Genesis II and The Questor Tapes. In addition to awards, Roddenberry also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame following a campaign by the fan clubs of Star Trek, which sought to have each fan donate a dollar towards the overall $3500 cost of upkeep. Following these donations, the Committee in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Walk</b> of Fame voted Roddenberry in. The star was unveiled on September 4, 1985, at the 6600 block, near {{to the corner of}} Hollywood Boulevard and Las Palmas.

25|$|Barry Pilton's book gives a more lighthearted and {{personal}} account of completing the Pennine Way, with a foreword by Mike Harding. Mark Wallington's book Pennine Walkies (in {{which the author}} is accompanied by his dog) is another humorous personal story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk,</b> as is Walking Home by Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage, who walked north-to-south along the Pennine Way without money, relying on his 'earnings' from nightly poetry readings along the way. Movement artists Tamara Ashley and Simone Kenyon performed {{the entire length of}} the trail in August 2006; their book documents the performance and invites readers to create their own interpretations of the landscapes along the way.|$|E

25|$|The Pennine Way {{has long}} been popular with walkers, and in 1990 the Countryside Commission {{reported}} that 12,000 long-distance walkers and 250,000 day-walkers were using {{all or part of}} the trail per year and that walkers contributed Â£2million (1990) to the local economy along the route, directly maintaining 156 jobs. The popularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> has resulted in substantial erosion to the terrain in places, and steps have been taken to recover its condition, including diverting sections of the route onto firmer ground, and laying flagstones or duckboards in softer areas. These actions have been generally effective in reducing the extent of broken ground, though the intrusion into the natural landscape has at times been controversial.|$|E
25|$|After the 2012 English cricket season had finished, Boyce {{set out to}} {{walk the}} length of Great Britain on a route from John o' Groats to Land's End {{in order to raise}} money and promote {{awareness}} for mental health charity Mind. Although not suffering himself, he was inspired to raise awareness about depression after the suicides of sportsmen Gary Speed and Peter Roebuck. He was also frustrated by people such as Piers Morgan showing a lack of comprehension about depression and how it can impact on {{people from all walks of}} life. He started the walk in September and completed it in December. For part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> he was joined by fellow cricketers, including Paul Nixon.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 season also {{marked the}} first played in BryantâDenny Stadium after the {{completion}} of the north endzone expansion. The $47 million expansion increased its overall capacity to 92,138 (then the 5th largest on-campus stadium), added several new luxury boxes and saw the completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Walk</b> of Champions off University Boulevard. The Walk of Champions, at the time, featured statues of the four national championship Alabama head coaches: Wallace Wade, Frank Thomas, Bear Bryant and Gene Stallings. At that time a fifth space was left vacant for a future statue, and on April 16, 2011, the University unveiled a statue of Nick Saban for winning the 2009 national championship at that location.|$|E

At one point the estate put a 3.5 metre high locked gate at the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walk</b> at Invervar. Since the 2003 legislation, the estate has built a car park for walkers at Invervar which only holds eight cars and they request that walkers go elsewhere when the car park is full {{in an effort to}} keep a limited number of walkers on the hills. The estate have also requested that the round of the CÃ rn Mairg Munros is done from west to east (clockwise) to lessen disturbance to deer management.|$|E
