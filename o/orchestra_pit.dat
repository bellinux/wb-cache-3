5|$|Beyond the {{decorative}} {{features of the}} building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built. An ascending <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> and independent Wurlitzer organ platform allowed the musicians to be raised up to main stage height or to <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> level from the basement below. The ventilation system had thermostatic controls throughout the building, and allowed the air to be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.|$|E
5|$|On January 23, 1977, while touring {{in support}} of Radio Ethiopia, Smith accidentally danced off a high stage in Tampa, Florida, and fell 15 feet into a {{concrete}} <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit,</b> breaking several neck vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes were}} made during the renovation. The {{vertical}} marquee which had marked the theatre's presence from 1926 to 1980, was removed, the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> and auditorium seating were rebuilt, the dressing rooms moved, and the technical systems updated. However, the furniture, fixtures and interior signage were retained. Even the paint was carefully restored to its original luster. The renovation made it suitable again for live performances and filled Seattle's need for a touring Broadway musical venue. Renovation work was completed without federal, state, or local funds.|$|E

50|$|The Cabot's architects were Funk and Wilcox, who {{had already}} {{made a name for}} {{themselves}} with the Athenaeum and the Strand Theatre (Dorchester, Massachusetts). Back then, movie palaces included fully equipped stages because film showings were often preceded by live acts—vaudeville. They were also built with <b>orchestra</b> <b>pits</b> for musicians who accompanied the silent films and the stage production.|$|R
5|$|The Wagga Wagga Civic Theatre {{was officially}} opened in 1963 {{at a cost}} of ₤165,000. During its design and {{construction}} and again after opening the theatre was the subject of severe criticism. Critics lamented the destruction of rose gardens removed to allow construction, the size of the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit,</b> the amount of seating (497 seats) as well as the design of the feature mural. A considerable refurbishment was carried out in the 1990s and now the theatre is {{regarded as one of the}} best in regional Australia, playing host to national and international touring acts.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{the leading}} {{members of the}} LPO {{organisation}} were Jurowski, Andrés Orozco-Estrada (principal guest conductor), Pieter Schoeman (leader), Magnus Lindberg (composer in residence) and Timothy Walker (chief executive and artistic director). Seventeen of the orchestra's principal players held professorships at British conservatoires, including the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. In addition to its regular concerts at the Festival Hall, and its annual season in the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> at Glyndebourne, the LPO has residencies at the Congress Theatre, Eastbourne and the Brighton Dome, and tours in Britain and overseas remain {{an important part of}} the orchestra's schedule.|$|E
5|$|A third {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1868 {{at a cost of}} £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.|$|E
50|$|Goldrich {{has played}} the {{keyboards}} in Broadway <b>orchestra</b> <b>pits,</b> including Avenue Q, Oklahoma!, Bombay Dreams, Grand Hotel and conducted at Titanic. With Marcy Heisler, {{she has written}} songs for the Disney characters Winnie-the-Pooh, Timon and Pumbaa; they are also contributors to the Disney Channel's Johnny and the Sprites. She composed the music of Dear Edwina. She currently composes for Wonder Pets on Nickelodeon.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pit</b> <b>orchestra</b> {{cannot be}} seen by all {{audience}} members. However, audience members in higher seats can see the pit musicians; as such, a typical <b>pit</b> <b>orchestra</b> {{in front of a}} stage cannot truly be considered to be hidden from the audiences' view. In some venues, there is no orchestra {{out in front of the}} stage; in this case, the <b>pit</b> <b>orchestra</b> may play in a room near the stage or backstage, watching the conductor's gestures using a video monitor. While a <b>pit</b> <b>orchestra</b> that is located out of sight of the audience is technically an offstage ensemble, there is no intent on the part of the producers to deceive the audience.|$|R
50|$|In the pit, {{the walls}} are {{specially}} designed {{to provide the best}} possible acoustics, ensuring that the sound of the orchestra flows through the entire venue without overwhelming the performance on stage. Many <b>orchestra</b> <b>pits</b> are also designed to have reasonably low decibel levels, allowing musicians to work without fears of damaging their hearing. Typically, a small platform in the pit accommodates the conductor, so that he or she can be seen by all of the musicians, who may sit in chairs or on bleachers, depending on the design of the pit.|$|R
5|$|In {{his early}} pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, {{the size of}} the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> had {{restricted}} Offenbach to an orchestra of 16 players. He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, timpani and percussion and a small string section of seven players. After moving to the Salle Choiseul he had an orchestra of 30 players. The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly. Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion. When they were available he wrote for cor anglais, harp, and, exceptionally, Keck records, an ophicleide (Le Papillon), tubular bells (Le carnaval des revues), and a wind machine (Le voyage dans la lune).|$|E
5|$|In early 1976, Brynner {{received}} {{an offer from}} impresarios Lee Gruber and Shelly Gross to star, in the role that he had created 25 years before, in a U.S. national tour and Broadway revival. The tour opened in Los Angeles on July 26, 1976, with Constance Towers reprising the role of Anna. On opening night, Brynner suffered so badly from laryngitis that he lip-synched, with his son Rock singing and speaking the role from the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit.</b> The production traveled across the United States, selling out every city it appeared in and finally opening in New York at the Uris Theatre (today the Gershwin Theatre) on May 2, 1977. The production featured Martin Vidnovic as Lun Tha, and Susan Kikuchi danced the part of Eliza, recreating the role that her mother, Yuriko, had originated. Yuriko both directed the production and recreated the Robbins choreography. Sharaff again designed costumes, and Michael Kermoyan reprised {{the role of the}} Kralahome, while June Angela was Tuptim. The run lasted 696performances, almost two years, during which each of the stars took off three weeks, with Angela Lansbury replacing Towers and Kermoyan replacing Brynner. The production was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical.|$|E
5|$|At the Conservatoire Massenet studied solfège with Augustin Savard and {{the piano}} with François Laurent. He pursued his studies, with modest distinction, until the {{beginning}} of 1855, when family concerns disrupted his education. Alexis Massenet's health was poor, and on medical advice he moved from Paris to Chambéry in the south of France; the family, including Massenet, moved with him. Again, Massenet's own memoirs and the researches of his biographers are at variance: the composer recalled his exile in Chambéry as lasting for two years; Henry Finck and Irvine record that the young man returned to Paris and the Conservatoire in October 1855. On his return he lodged with relations in Montmartre and resumed his studies; by 1859 he had progressed so far as to win the Conservatoire's top prize for pianists. The family's finances were no longer comfortable, and to support himself Massenet took private piano students and played as a percussionist in theatre orchestras. His work in the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> gave him a good working knowledge of the operas of Gounod and other composers, classic and contemporary. Traditionally, many students at the Conservatoire went on to substantial careers as church organists; with that in mind Massenet enrolled for organ classes, but they were not a success and he quickly abandoned the instrument. He gained some work as a piano accompanist, in the course of which he met Wagner who, along with Berlioz, was one of his two musical heroes.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century it was {{standard}} {{to have the}} first and second violins on opposite sides (violin I, cello, viola, violin II), rendering obvious the crossing of their parts in, for example, the opening of the finale to Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony.If space or numbers are limited, cellos and basses can be put in the middle, violins and violas on the left (thus facing the audience) and winds to the right; this is the usual arrangement in <b>orchestra</b> <b>pits.</b> The seating may also be specified by the composer, as in Béla Bartók's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta, which uses antiphonal string sections, one {{on each side of the}} stage. In some cases, due to space constraints (as with an opera <b>pit</b> <b>orchestra)</b> or other issues, a different layout may be used.|$|R

25|$|The current theatre has a {{proscenium}} stage, and accommodates {{a variable}} <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> on 2 lifts - which reduces the stall seating. The audience is seated on four levels: stalls (501), grand circle (252), upper circle (249) and gallery (247).|$|E
25|$|Caruso {{created the}} role of Dick Johnson in {{the world premiere of}} Puccini's La fanciulla del West on 10 December 1910. The {{composer}} conceived the music for Johnson with Caruso's voice specifically in mind. With Caruso appeared two more of the Met's star singers, the Czech soprano Emmy Destinn and baritone Pasquale Amato. Toscanini, then the Met's principal conductor, presided in the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Tamworth Capitol Theatre is {{fitted with}} a 405-seat {{auditorium}} with two levels of tiered seating, professional theatre lighting, a full sound system, dressing rooms, an <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit,</b> and fly tower, and is fully air conditioned. It is a multifunctional space for live theatre and cinema productions. It has significantly added to the existing cultural facilities {{in the region and}} provides a forum for live theatre, including dance, drama, music, educational activities, conferences and community events.|$|E
5|$|Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly {{attracted}} by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists {{a great number of}} locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in <b>orchestra</b> <b>pits</b> as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices.|$|R
50|$|Since World War II the {{contrabass}} trombone in F {{with two}} valve attachments has been primarily {{in use in}} orchestras, though the 18′ B version is still used by many. Originally due to reasons of limited space conditions in opera <b>orchestra</b> <b>pits,</b> the bell section was provided with a coil to reduce {{the length of the}} bell bow, but since the 1970s the long, straight form has taken precedence. Through the combination of both valves, the extension handle on the outer slide also became redundant and the instrument is provided with five or six working positions on the slide. Valve tuning combinations are E/B, D/B, or more rarely D/C.|$|R
5000|$|Amherst is {{well known}} for the high quality of their music program.

25|$|The Eisenhower Theater, on {{the north}} side, seats about 1,163 and is named for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who signed the National Cultural Center Act into law on September 2, 1958. It {{primarily}} hosts plays and musicals, smaller-scale operas, ballet and contemporary dance. The theater contains an <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> for up to 35 musicians that is convertible to a forestage or additional seating space. The venue reopened in October 2008, following a 16-month renovation which altered the color scheme and seating arrangements.|$|E
25|$|The Linbury Studio Theatre is a flexible, {{secondary}} performance space, constructed {{below ground}} level within the Royal Opera House. It has retractable raked seating and a floor {{which can be}} raised or lowered to form a studio floor, a raised stage, or a stage with <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit.</b> The theatre can accommodate up to 400 patrons and host {{a variety of different}} events. It has been used for private functions, traditional theatre shows, and concerts, as well as community and educational events, product launches, dinners and exhibitions, etc., {{and is one of the}} most technologically advanced performance venues in London with its own public areas, including a bar and cloakroom.|$|E
25|$|This uses {{low-voltage}} {{electricity to}} transmit {{the action of}} the organ keys to the pipes. Earlier church instruments used a mechanical linkage of rods and wires to connect the keys to the pipes. With the new system, the console (also known as a key-desk) could be placed at virtually any distance from the organ's pipes and could be somewhat portable, as just an electrical cable and flexible wind line connected the console with other parts of the instrument. This also allowed the console to achieve its ubiquitous place—on an elevator platform in front of the stage, low in the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> for accompanying the film, and rising majestically to stage height for organ solos.|$|E

50|$|The Philharmonic Orchestra is {{also known}} for its {{commanding}} standard as a <b>pit</b> <b>orchestra.</b> It has received good reviews for its work as a <b>pit</b> <b>orchestra</b> when engaged by the Singapore Dance Theatre and Singapore Lyric Opera. Since then, it has stopped collaborating with the Singapore Lyric Opera, and focuses more on presenting its own concerts, the latest of which included two Haydn symphonies.|$|R
25|$|All {{hostages were}} kept in the {{auditorium}} and the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> {{was used as a}} lavatory. The situation in the hall was nervous and it frequently changed depending on the mood of the hostage-takers, who were following reports in the mass media. Any kind of misinformation caused hopelessness among the hostages and new aggression among their captors, who would threaten to shoot hostages and blow up the building, but no major disasters took place during the siege. The gunmen let members of the audience make phone calls. One hostage used her mobile phone to plead with authorities not to storm the auditorium, as truckloads of police and soldiers with armored vehicles surrounded the building.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{recovery}} from a life-threatening fungal infection {{of his right}} lung in January 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement {{to start a new}} spate of albums and concerts. In March 1977, after videotaping a concert at the Ambassador Theater in Pasadena for CBS to commemorate his 50th anniversary in show business, and with Bob Hope looking on, Crosby fell off the stage into an <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit,</b> rupturing a disc in his back requiring a month in the hospital. His first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977 (the day singer Elvis Presley died); when the power went out during his performance, he continued singing without amplification.|$|E
25|$|The ballet {{became famous}} for Nijinsky's leap {{through one of}} the two large windows {{at the back of the}} stage. The height of the leap was an {{illusion}} though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through the window on the sixth step. The skirting board (base board) under the window was very low, giving the illusion that the leap was higher than it actually was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. No one in the audience saw Nijinsky land. It looked like he would soar on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit</b> who held the penultimate chord. In doing so, the leap was given a sense of great length and height.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} {{was as much}} a source of trouble as the internal conflicts. As early as 1991, a few of the 36,000 Burgundy limestone plaques covering the facade began to fall, which led to the installation of safety nets over some external walls in 1996; they were dubbed [...] "condoms with holes" [...] by the disgruntled Director. Several other major renovations had to be carried out in the following years, including that of the soundproofing structure and of the <b>orchestra</b> <b>pit’s</b> acoustics, each time with complex and sometimes judicial procedures to determine who was responsible. The facade problems were not solved until 2009 with the installation of new plaques made of composite material and attached differently.|$|R
