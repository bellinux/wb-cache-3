5|$|The Indiana World War Memorial Plaza is {{an urban}} feature located in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, {{originally}} built {{to honor the}} veterans of World War I. The five-city-block plaza was conceived in 1919 {{as a location for}} the national headquarters of the American Legion and a memorial to the state's and nation's veterans. At {{the north end of the}} plaza is the American Legion Mall, which is the site of the administration buildings of the Legion, as well as a memorial cenotaph.

The industry produces technologically complex components and engages in some research and development activities, an example <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> new Volkswagen Jetta model with up to 70% of parts designed in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The Cathedral on {{the central}} square (Plaza de Armas) is a sight that ranks {{as high as the}} Palacio de La Moneda, the Presidential Palace. The {{original}} building was built between 1784 and 1805, and architect Joaquín Toesca was in charge of its construction. Other buildings surrounding the Plaza de Armas are the Central Post Office Building, which was finished in 1882, and the Palacio de la Real Audiencia de Santiago, built between 1804 and 1807. It houses the Chilean National History Museum, with 12,000 objects that can be exhibited. On the southeast corner of the square stands the green cast-iron Commercial Edwards building, which was built in 1893. East <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> colonial building of the Casa Colorada (1769), which houses the Museum of Santiago. Close by is the Municipal Theatre of Santiago, which was built in 1857 by the French architect Brunet of Edward Baines. It was badly damaged by an earthquake in 1906. Not far from the theatre is the Subercaseaux Mansion and the National Library, one of the largest libraries of South America.|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: [...] "Whatever I have done... getting hooked on heroin {{is not one of}} them."

Soon after the story of his arrest became public, he drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments: [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> establishment fighting back...

500|$|Cowell, who had {{encountered}} Ornstein while studying in New York, would pursue a similarly radical style {{as part of}} a grand intellectual and cultural mission, which also involved ambitious writings on music theory and publishing and promotional efforts in support of the avant-garde. Ornstein, the vanguard iconoclast of American classical music, followed a much more idiosyncratic muse: [...] "I'm guided entirely by just my musical instinct as to what I feel is consequential or inconsequential." [...] Evidence <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fact that, even {{at the height of his}} ultra-modernist notoriety, he also wrote several lyrical, tonal works, such as the First Sonata for Cello and Piano: [...] " [...] was written in less than a week under a compulsion that was not to be resisted", Ornstein later said. [...] "Why I should have heard this romantic piece at the same period that I was tumultuously involved in the primitivism of [...] is beyond my understanding."
