500|$|In April 2004, {{producers}} {{were concerned}} that the family were losing popularity with viewers, and {{a decision was made}} to write Pooja Shah out of the show for a while, but to bring her back with a sexier image to rival Michelle Ryan, who played Zoe Slater. Shah expressed a dislike of her character, saying [...] "I'm fed up with it now. Kareena's too dowdy. I wanted Kareena to be different, to stand out. If I'm completely honest, I can't stand her – she just grates <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerves.</b> She hasn't got many friends, but then I wouldn’t be her friend if I met her." [...] The family had failed and rumours began that the entire family would be killed off in a house fire. A further attempt to [...] "spice up" [...] the family was made in July 2004 by bringing back character Sasha Perkins, played by Jemma Walker, and having her move in with the Ferreiras.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Amanda Root for The Musical Express magazine, Ullman was asked about critics labeling the show 'non-sexist humour.' Did it exist? [...] "Not unless it’s cleverly done. When we did Three of a Kind we kept getting sketches sent in about me as a traffic warden, or me being a busty barmaid. Writers that have no idea about women - their typical way of starting a sketch is to say, Tracey is sitting there, filing her nails and chewing gum, as if all girls are stupid. Sketches beginning like that used to really get <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerves.</b> But {{as soon as we}} found the right team of writers, they weren’t into that sort of thing, so it worked out OK." [...] She went on to win her first BAFTA Award in the category of Best Light Entertainment Performance for Three of a Kind in 1984.|$|E
2500|$|While Rieber's {{personal}} connection to Tim gave the character {{a sense of}} realism, it also {{was a source of}} frustration for the writer: he later said, [...] "I've found it difficult to like Tim now and then. [...] Of course he gets <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerves.</b> [...] He's a lot like someone I spent years learning not to be." [...] This dislike led to a perceived decline in the quality of the book as Rieber wrote his final batch of issues, with the character of Tim often sidelined in the stories in favor of his girlfriend, Molly. This preference also affected Tim's character in other ways, as Rieber requested that Molly not be used in the book after his departure to allow him to develop his own projects using her — causing the in-story break up of the two young lovers that led to them not seeing each other for many years.|$|E
5000|$|... “This was an {{absolute}} pleasure to read, and an easy story to get into. I had no trouble getting lost in the pages and the storyline. Aine P. Massie has a very unique writing style which I found very pleasant. The characters never once got <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerve.</b> I quite enjoyed reading about them.” - Kyanara Night @ Kyanara’s Mad Reviews ...|$|R
60|$|And there, {{you will}} say, was {{an end of}} the matter. I am (you will say) {{naturally}} obtuse, cowardly, and mentally deficient. I was, moreover, unused to pageants; I felt frightened {{in the dark and}} took a man for a spectre whom, in the light, I could recognise as a modern gentleman in a masquerade dress. No; far from it. That spectral person was my first introduction to a special incident which has never been explained and which still lays its finger <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Bushwick {{sat down}} {{before the fire}} and rubbed his shins with his two hands unrestfully, drawing in a long breath between his teeth. [...] "These things get <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> sometimes. I shouldn't want the ghost-dance to fail." ...|$|R

60|$|There {{are times}} when Martha Riddell gets <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerves.</b> She's a good-hearted woman, and she means well; but she rasps--rasps terribly.|$|E

6000|$|... "I did not chide Constance for her morbid fancies; as {{a matter}} of fact the same sensation, of being pursued by a {{persistent}} fretful wail, had been forcing itself <b>on</b> <b>my</b> rather over-tired <b>nerves.</b> For company's sake I hulloed to Esmé, who had lagged somewhat behind. With a few springy bounds he drew up level, and then shot past us.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913, a young {{architect}} named John Bruns {{is reported}} to have jumped from the Washington bridge and lived. He was quoted at his trial: [...] "Why, Your Honor, it was a nerve test. Some friends had been taunting me <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lack of <b>nerve</b> because I had never married, and as we talked over the matter I made a bet that I would dive from the bridge." ...|$|R

It is possible, in the state I am in now, that I may have unconsciously misinterpreted, or distorted, the {{circumstances}} that really took place.

If my fancy has exaggerated anything, if my memory is playing me false anywhere, I entreat you to stop me, and tell me of it.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} Mme. la Comtesse de Nolé called for news of Carissimo, and I {{could give her}} none. She cried, Sir, and implored, and her tears and entreaties got <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> until I felt ready to fall into hysterics. One more day and all my chances of a bright and wealthy future would have vanished. Unless the money was {{forthcoming}} on the morrow, the dog would be destroyed, and with him my every hope of that five thousand francs. And though she still irradiated charm and luxury from her entire lovely person, I begged her not {{to come to the}} office again, and promised that as soon as I had any news to impart I would at once present myself at her house in the Faubourg St. Germain.|$|R
60|$|As I {{approached}} the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself {{that the place}} had indeed {{been used as a}} habitation. A vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door. All was silent within. The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be prowling <b>on</b> the moor. <b>My</b> <b>nerves</b> tingled with the sense of adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked in. The place was empty.|$|R

6000|$|... "Five o'clock.--I was {{not mistaken}} in believing that <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> were all unstrung. Trifles {{that would not}} have cost me a second thought at other times weigh heavily <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mind now.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Baggs did not {{immediately}} answer. She snatched the bottle out of my hands--drank off another dram, shook her head at me, and ejaculated lamentably: [...] "My <b>nerves,</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerves!</b> what a heart of stone he must have to presume <b>on</b> <b>my</b> poor nerves!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked at}} the man. No {{ordinary}} dishonest cabman would think of creating so solid and colossal and creative a lie. And this man was not a dishonest cabman. If ever a human face was heavy and simple and humble, and with great big blue eyes protruding like a frog's, if ever (in short) a human face was all that a human face should be, it was the face of that resentful and respectful cabman. I {{looked up and down}} the street; an unusually dark twilight seemed to be coming on. And for one second the old nightmare of the sceptic put its finger <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerve.</b> What was certainty? Was anybody certain of anything? Heavens! to think of the dull rut of the sceptics who go on asking whether we possess a future life. The exciting question for real scepticism is whether we possess a past life. What is a minute ago, rationalistically considered, except a tradition and a picture? The darkness grew deeper from the road. The cabman calmly gave me the most elaborate details of the gesture, the words, the complex but consistent course of action which I had adopted since that remarkable occasion when I had hailed him outside Euston Station. How did I know (my sceptical friends would say) that I had not hailed him outside Euston. I was firm about my assertion; he was quite equally firm about his. He was obviously quite as honest a man as I, and a member of a much more respectable profession. In that moment the universe and the stars swung just a hair's breadth from their balance, and the foundations of the earth were moved. But for the same reason that I believe in Democracy, for the same reason that I believe in free will, for the same reason that I believe in fixed character of virtue, the reason that could only be expressed by saying that I do not choose to be a lunatic, I continued to believe that this honest cabman was wrong, and I repeated to him that I had really taken him at the corner of Leicester-square. He began with the same evident and ponderous sincerity, [...] "You hailed me outside Euston Station, and you said----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have come}} to offer--your sympathy. How {{delightful}} of you. The bishop got <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerves,</b> you know, and I really am not answerable for what I said. Catherine!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me if I seem unsympathetic, Ena," [...] he said. [...] "The fact is, {{everything}} has been getting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> {{for the last few}} days, and my luck seems dead out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell you the truth, Bill," [...] says I, [...] "this {{little he}} ewe lamb has {{somewhat}} got <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> too. We'll take him home, pay the ransom {{and make our}} get-away." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was no time}} {{to collect}} my wits. The guests were moving out to the dining-room. I took <b>my</b> <b>nerve</b> in <b>my</b> hand, crossed the room, bowed, and the next moment was walking through the hall with Jane's hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm. The hall was a good long one; I blessed the {{architect}} who had planned it. It gave me time to sort out my ideas.|$|R
60|$|It was a sorrowful experience, for {{a fallen}} horse is a horse in ruins {{and makes a}} most woful appeal upon one's sympathies. I went to bed tired out, stiff and sore from pulling <b>on</b> the rope, <b>my</b> hands blistered, <b>my</b> <b>nerves</b> shaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold <b>on,</b> Arthur, <b>my</b> boy," [...] he said, {{attempting}} to mask his anxiety with facetious utterance. [...] "This {{is too much}} all at once for yours truly. Give {{me a chance to}} get <b>my</b> <b>nerve.</b> You know I didn't want to come, an' I guess your fam'ly ain't hankerin' to see me neither." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, my friends, I'm serious," [...] she returned, earnestly. [...] "This awful {{place is}} getting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerves....</b> Mr. Neale here, {{he would have}} had to face a gun already but for me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} shall," [...] said Mr. Bennett decidedly. [...] "Music of {{that description}} {{happens to be}} the one thing which jars unendurably <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>nerves.</b> My nervous system is thoroughly out of tune." ...|$|E
50|$|Oh, <b>My</b> <b>Nerves</b> is a 1935 American short comedy film {{directed}} by Del Lord. It {{was nominated for}} an Academy Award at the 8th Academy Awards, held in 1935, for Best Short Subject (Comedy). The Academy Film Archive preserved Oh, <b>My</b> <b>Nerves</b> in 2012.|$|R
6000|$|Then he stopped, and chuckled in {{his usual}} dry manner. [...] "I {{was going to make}} Jordan the proposition--only I got to {{thinking}} and <b>my</b> <b>nerve</b> failed me. Guess I made my money hard in the free sealing days when we had trouble with everybody all the time, but I felt I'd sooner not offend Mrs. Jordan, and I might do it if I didn't fix things just as she told me.
