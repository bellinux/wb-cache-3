25|$|The {{objective}} of this festival is to make urban culture (graffiti, slam, street basketball, hip-hop dance, skateboarding) known to a wider public along with contemporary music (rap, rock, pop, electro) through various artistic and cultural events under the program.

The Hip Hop dance battle and the basketball tournament are open to girls (two girls and two boys by team for the 4 vs 4 battle {{and at least one}} girl by team for the 3 vs 3 basketball tournament).

25|$|Named {{after the}} theatre's first artistic director, Laurence Olivier, {{this is the}} main auditorium, {{modelled}} on the ancient Greek theatre at Epidaurus; it has an <b>open</b> <b>stage</b> and a fan-shaped audience seating area for 1100 people. A 'drum revolve' (a five-storey revolving stage section) extends eight metres beneath the stage and is operated by a single staff member. The drum has two rim revolves and two platforms, each of which can carry ten tonnes, facilitating dramatic and fluid scenery changes. Its design ensures that the audience's view is not blocked from any seat, and that the audience is fully visible to actors from the stage's centre. Designed in the 1970s and a prototype of current technology, the drum revolve and a multiple 'sky hook' flying system were initially very controversial and required ten years to commission, but seem to have fulfilled the objective of functionality with high productivity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} name of {{the temple}} complex, Chidambaram Tillai Nataraja-koothan Kovil, alludes to the environment of its location and its origins and significance in Saivite worship. The mangrove of ancient Tillai (தில்லை) trees (Exocoeria agallocha) of the forest surrounding the shrine {{when it was first}} built inspired the shrine's name and early artistic inspiration; the Tillai trees of the nearby Pichavaram wetlands, the second largest mangrove in the world, extends to the temple area. The shrine is venerated as Tillai ambalam (தில்லை அம்பலம் [...] ), literally meaning Tillai <b>Open</b> <b>Stage,</b> the open space surrounded by Tillai Vanam (தில்லை வனம்) (the Tillai forest) - the original name of this area. The {{name of the}} town of this shrine, Chidambaram comes from the Tamil word Chitrambalam (சிற்றம்பலம்) - [...] "small hall/stage"; also spelled Chithambalam (சிட்டம்பலம்), from citt/chitthu and ambalam - meaning [...] "wisdom of this open stage/atmosphere". The shrine is where some devotees believe they will attain liberation, or chitaakasam - [...] "wisdom/consciousness of the sky".

40|$|In 2011, the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) began {{a series}} of collaborations with {{established}} amateur theatre groups from across the UK. The initiative now known as <b>Open</b> <b>Stages</b> {{became one of the most}} ambitious educational outreach programmes ever run by the RSC, engaging hundreds of amateur theatre practitioners in a process of skills sharing and knowledge exchange. This article analyses the significance of the RSC’s <b>Open</b> <b>Stages</b> initiative and illustrates how the programme’s practical components were underpinned by an important reallocation of cultural capital from the RSC to their amateur partners. Reciprocally, this article explores what the RSC stood to gain from collaborating with amateur theatre-makers and thereby seeks to challenge the traditional hierarchy of professional vs. amateur theatre in twenty-first-century British culture...|$|R

60|$|As {{there was}} no greenroom in the Westervelt, the reading {{took place on the}} <b>open</b> <b>stage,</b> which was bleak and draughty.

All the men {{retained}} their overcoats, for the morning was miserably raw, and at Helen's positive command kept their heads covered; and the supernumerary women sat shivering in their jackets. Helen was regal in a splendid cloak of sable, otherwise there was little of the successful actress in her dress. At her suggestion a box-scene was set around them to keep off at least a part of the draught, and under these depressing conditions the reading proceeded.|$|E
