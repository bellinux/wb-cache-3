5|$|In {{training}} his men, al-Qassam {{stressed that}} maintaining good character was of paramount importance. As such, fighters should {{provide for the}} needy, aid people with illness, maintain good ties {{with their families and}} pray regularly to God. These virtues, he claimed, were prerequisites to being disciplined and fearless fighters. The moral component of al-Qassam's teachings were especially geared towards the young men of Haifa's labor slums who lived away from their families and who were exposed to activities considered immoral in Islam. He viewed marriage as key to preventing the moral corruption <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> managed to financially aid his more destitute supporters with their wedding expenses. He encouraged his men to grow beards as a sign of their commitment to jihad and to carry a Qur'an with them wherever they went. Although many of his followers had been illiterate, he taught them how to read and write using the Qur'an as their basis for learning. Al-Qassam also asked his fighters to engage in the spiritual exercises practiced by the Qadiriyya Sufi order and to recite Sufi chants before battle.|$|E

25|$|While {{promoting}} {{convenience and}} making church practice compatible with non-Utahns, this new schedule {{has been criticized}} for eroding fellowshipping opportunities among North American Latter-day Saint youth.

25|$|The mandore {{was known}} in Germany, prior to the {{invention}} of the Neapolitan mandolin. The mandolin spread to Germany with the visits of Italian mandolin virtuosi, including Achille Coronati. The mandolin gained popularity as a folk instrument, especially with the groups of youth participating in the German youth movement, which began in 1897. In the early 20th century the mandolin was popular in the Wandervogel movement (groups <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women, hiking and camping, singing and playing instruments), due to the instrument's small size.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Chinese {{are known}} to have made sacrifices <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women to river deities (Hebo), and to have buried slaves alive with their owners upon death as part of a funeral service.

During the Warring States period, Ximen Bao of Wei demonstrated to the villagers that sacrifice to river deities was actually a ploy by crooked priests to pocket money. In Chinese lore, Ximen Bao is regarded as a folk hero who pointed out the absurdity of human sacrifice.|$|E

500|$|An assault {{into the}} German states was essential, {{as far as}} French commanders understood, {{not only in terms}} of war aims, but also in {{practical}} terms: [...] the French Directory believed that war should pay for itself, and did not budget for the feeding of its troops.

Until 1796, wages were paid in the worthless assignat (France's paper currency); after April 1796, although pay was made in metallic value, wages were still in arrears. Throughout that spring and early summer, the French army was in almost constant mutiny: in May 1796, in the border town of Zweibrücken, the 74th Demi-brigade revolted.

500|$|The French citizen’s army, {{created by}} mass {{conscription}} <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> systematically divested of old men {{who might have}} tempered the rash impulses of teenagers and young adults, had already made itself onerous throughout France. One solution {{to the lack of}} discipline was to create demi-brigades, which included one brigade of veterans and one brigade of conscripts. Furthermore, it was an army entirely dependent for support upon the countryside it occupied. After April 1796, pay was made in metallic value, but pay was still in arrears. Throughout the spring and early summer, the unpaid French army was in almost constant mutiny: in May 1796, in the border town of Zweibrücken, a demi-brigade revolted. In June, pay for two demi-brigades were in arrears and two companies rebelled.

500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Spartan takeover, the exiled Thebans regrouped in Athens and, at the instigation of Pelopidas, prepared to liberate their city. Meanwhile, in Thebes, Epaminondas began preparing the young men {{of the city to}} fight the Spartans. In the winter of 379BC, a small group of the exiles, led by Pelopidas, infiltrated the city. They then assassinated the leaders of the pro-Spartan government, and supported by Epaminondas and Gorgidas, who led a group <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> a force of Athenian hoplites, they surrounded the Spartans on the Cadmeia. The following day, Epaminondas and Gorgidas brought Pelopidas and his men before the Theban assembly and exhorted the Thebans to fight for their freedom; the assembly responded by acclaiming Pelopidas and his men as liberators. The Cadmeia was surrounded, and the Spartans attacked; Pelopidas realised that they must be expelled before an army came from Sparta to relieve them. The Spartan garrison eventually surrendered on the condition that they were allowed to march away unharmed. The narrow margin of the conspirators' success is demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} Spartan garrison met a Spartan force on the way to rescue them as they marched back to Sparta. [...] Plutarch portrays the Theban coup as an immensely significant event: ...the subsequent change in the political situation made this exploit the more glorious. For the war which broke down the pretensions of Sparta and put an end to her supremacy by land and sea, began from that night, in which people, not by surprising any fort or castle or citadel, but by coming into a private house with eleven others, loosed and broke in pieces, if the truth may be expressed in a metaphor, the fetters of the Lacedaemonian supremacy, which were thought indissoluble and not to be broken.|$|E

2500|$|During this period, Alcala {{convinced}} hundreds <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> {{women that}} he was a professional fashion photographer, and photographed them for his [...] "portfolio."

2500|$|All {{occupants}} of the ground floor were seriously injured. In the first-floor corridor, some occupants decided to {{lie down on the}} ground to show that they offered no resistance. Nonetheless, police beat them and kicked them when they arrived. Soon, there were police officers on all four floors of the building, kicking and battering prone occupants. In one corridor, police ordered a group <b>of</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women to kneel, so that they could batter them around the head and shoulders more easily. Here, Daniel Albrecht, a 21-year-old cello student from Berlin, had his head beaten so badly that he needed surgery to stop bleeding in his brain. The police also used humiliation to cow the {{occupants of}} the school. An officer who stood spread-legged in front of a kneeling and injured woman, grabbed his groin and thrust it into her face. Another who paused amid the beatings and took a knife to cut off hair from his victims, including Nicola Doherty; the constant shouting of insults; the officer who asked a group if they were OK and who reacted to the one who said [...] "No" [...] by handing out an extra beating.|$|E
