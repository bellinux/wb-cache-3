5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> size and puts primary focus on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels {{rise in a}} less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance {{should be given to}} promoting exports.|$|E

The increase in demand for one industry will lead to an increase in demand for another industry due to complementarity of demands. As Say's Law states, supply creates its own demand.|$|E
