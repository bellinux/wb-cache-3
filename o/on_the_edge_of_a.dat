5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Roman Empire, Flanders became part of the Merovingian realm of Neustria. In the 9th century it became part of West Francia, forming a pagus within the kingdom of Charles the Bald. In 864, Cassel passed into the hands of Baldwin Ironarm, who expanded his holdings to become the first count of the County of Flanders. At the time, the town was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep bay of the North Sea, making it vulnerable to raids by the Vikings, who attacked and destroyed it in the 9th century. It was rebuilt by Baldwin's grandson, Arnulf I, in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|However, Denmark was not keen on peace {{after their}} recent successes and {{witnessing}} {{the weakness of}} the Swedish efforts. The Netherlands withdrew their blockade, but were soon convinced by Denmark to support them again. France and England intervened for Sweden and the situation was again teetering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major conflict. However, the Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested negotiated a peace treaty without any direct involvement by foreign powers. The conflict was resolved with the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660). Sweden returned Bornholm and Trøndelag to Denmark. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present day, and secured the Swedish dominium maris baltici.|$|E

5|$|Thanatos– The former God of Death, {{father of}} Erinys, and main {{antagonist}} of Ghost of Sparta. Ruler of the Domain of Death, Thanatos {{is responsible for}} imprisoning and torturing Kratos' brother Deimos. While Kratos and Deimos were battling, Thanatos snatched Deimos from the battle and dropped him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cliff. Deimos was saved by Kratos, who united with his brother to fight the God of Death, who transformed into a winged beast.

5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 24–33 by 6.6–8.8μm, {{and may be}} {{attached}} to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common. They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, and some have a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia (cystidia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from a spindle to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20–45 by 5–8.2μm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6–11 by 1.6–2.5μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is white when fresh, but becomes more cream-coloured when dry. The smooth spores are oval to ellipsoid, hyaline (translucent), non-amyloid (meaning {{they do not}} absorb iodine from Melzer's reagent), and {{typically}} measure 6.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are thin-walled, hyaline, and lack clamp connections at their bases. They are usually four-spored but occasionally two-spored, with sterigmata (projections that attach to the spores) up to 4μm long. The cheilocystidia (cystidia that occur <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gill) are mostly club-shaped, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 15–30 by 6–10μm.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 (2009) {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} African town of Kijuju in 2009, where a {{biological}} agent has turned local residents into zombies. Valentine has been missing since a fight with her commander-turned-double agent Albert Wesker, years before the game's events. The fight is shown in the game's Lost in Nightmares downloadable content (DLC), in which Redfield and Valentine search for Umbrella's founder, Ozwell E. Spencer, inside a mansion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cliff. Instead they find Wesker, who overpowers them. To save Redfield, Valentine tackles Wesker, and they both crash through a window and over the cliff. Their bodies are not recovered, and Valentine is declared dead. In fact she was injured by the fall and saved by Wesker, who then used her as a test subject in his experiments on mutagenic viruses.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} scene in which Eminem stands on the rooftop of the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York, saying the {{introductory}} lyrics. The video cuts between scenes where he raps on the rooftop and another scene where Eminem is trapped inside a dark basement. Eminem moves closer towards the edge of the building until he leaves to go downstairs as the chorus begins. He starts walking down Market Street in Newark and jaywalks across the street, avoiding vehicles that pass by. Eminem sees distorted reflections of himself on the window of a car; he continues on, only to be surrounded by a series of mirrors. Confused, Eminem tries to escape, and {{towards the end of the}} second chorus, he breaks through a mirror to find himself in the middle of the street. Interspersing scenes show Eminem as he tries to break out of the basement. As the camera zooms out, the viewers see him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> destroyed street while a subway tunnel can be seen below the road.|$|E
5|$|Work {{on the new}} {{fortification}} {{was completed}} in 1068. Probably at first a wooden keep was constructed, which was later replaced with a much stronger stone one. Lincoln Castle is very unusual in having two mottes, the only other surviving {{example of such a}} design being at Lewes. To the south, where the Roman wall stands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> steep slope, it was retained partially as a curtain wall and partially as a revetment retaining the mottes. In the west, where the ground is more level, the Roman wall was buried within an earth rampart and extended upward to form the Norman castle wall. The Roman west gate (on the same site as the castle's west gate) was excavated in the 19th century but began to collapse on exposure, and so was re-buried.|$|E

25|$|Field {{borders are}} bands or strips of {{perennial}} vegetation that is found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cropland field. Field borders help with runoff {{only when it}} flows over the strip. They’re very effective in benefiting spraying operations because they allow for extra room between adjacent fields. They also provide room for farming equipment to turn around. Field borders are effective in reducing wind and water erosion and provide great wildlife habitat.|$|E
25|$|Forstner bits, {{also known}} as Forstner flange bits or webfoot augers, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to the}} wood grain. Forstner bits can cut <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. Forstner bits were invented and patented by Benjamin Forstner in 1874.|$|E
