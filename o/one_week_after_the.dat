5|$|Armillaria gallica may {{itself be}} parasitized by other soil flora. Several {{species of the}} fungus Trichoderma, {{including}} Trichoderma polysporum, T.harzianum and T.viride, are able to attack and penetrate and the outer tissue of A.gallica rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae about <b>one</b> <b>week</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> initial infection. Entoloma abortivum is another fungus that can live parasitically upon A.gallica. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the E.abortivum hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development.|$|E
