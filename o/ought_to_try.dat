Brown's efforts in the {{election}} campaign to elect an African-American proved successful and Harold Wood {{was elected to the}} Westchester County Board of Supervisors. She wrote, [...] "At one point the plan we projected for electing a black to the County Board of Supervisors sounded so convincing we decided we really <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it... Harold Wood won the election to become the first back to serve on the Westchester County Board of Supervisors".|$|E
2500|$|In 1911, IWW leader William [...] "Big Bill" [...] Haywood {{was elected}} to the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, on which Hillquit also served. The syndicalist and the electoral socialist squared off in a lively public debate in New York City's Cooper Union on Jan. 11, 1912. Haywood {{declared}} that Hillquit and the socialists <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> [...] "a little sabotage {{in the right place at}} the proper time" [...] and attacked Hillquit for having abandoned the class struggle by helping the New York garment workers negotiate an industrial agreement with their employers. Hillquit replied that he had no new message rather than to reiterate a belief in a two-sided workers movement, with separate and equal political and trade union arms. [...] "A mere change of structural forms would not revolutionize the American labor movement as claimed by our extreme industrialists," [...] he declared.|$|E

60|$|Volumnia hastens {{to express}} her opinion that the {{shocking}} people <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>tried</b> as traitors and made to support the party.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a fool I'm {{making of}} myself!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "The idea of {{standing}} here raving when I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> mend matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} about that boat," [...] he remarked. [...] "Though I don't know {{that we could have}} done it, we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> pull her out." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Algie. Yes, Mr. Dowler {{was just}} saying he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and be made a {{director}} of the new railway.|$|E
6000|$|... "If we {{are going}} to be snowed up here we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> for some game," [...] said Chet. [...] "Maybe I can stir up some rabbits, or something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I can {{get down}} the hill well enough," [...] said Tom. [...] "But {{this appears to be}} a poor road. We <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to find {{something}} better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do that," [...] said Rectus, who {{looked as if}} he hadn't enjoyed himself. [...] "I didn't know you were so obstinate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course the}} man knew French. He <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>tried</b> {{him with that}} in the beginning. What did Hoskins say then?" [...] asked Elmore impatiently.|$|R
6000|$|... "But since you've come up again, you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be satisfied," [...] said Mrs. Lecks. [...] "And now," [...] she added, {{turning her}} face toward me, [...] "which way <b>ought</b> we <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> swim? and {{have we got}} everythin' {{we want to take}} with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you feel}} like that," [...] he said, [...] "I can't go. I shall tell Mother that I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and work. There's always the {{condition}} of the world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I suppose she's not {{past all}} hope. The older {{one is the}} more one <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try.</b> But, of course, I'm only joking about her. Would Miss Todd come {{if you were to}} ask her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my darling," [...] said Stanley, {{smiling at}} the {{simplicity}} of this plausible argument in favour of an idle life, [...] "don't {{you know that we}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to make others happy too, as well as ourselves?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Senator Arlen Specter, {{chairman}} of the Senate Judiciary Committee, commented: [...] "Where we have evidence, they <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>tried,</b> and if convicted, they <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be sentenced."

5000|$|His {{contempt}} for worldly riches {{is shown by}} his reply to Caligula who, wishing to corrupt him, offered him two hundred thousand sesterces. Demetrius replied, [...] "If he meant to tempt me, he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do so by offering his entire kingdom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know as it's light. But if {{the girls}} {{are going to keep}} on living in Boston and marry here, I presume we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to get them into society, some way; or ought to do something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That so?" [...] said Father; then, authoritatively: [...] "Peter, my boy, you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to {{make good}} here. Nothing I'd like better--if I had the time--than {{to grow up in}} a shoe-store in a nice, pretty village like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We really <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> {{to get out}} of here," [...] said Andy, {{after an}} hour had passed. [...] "I think it will snow again by night, and it would be rough to be snow-bound in such a place as this." ...|$|E
50|$|But {{before that}} date, Dariye filed an application, {{challenging}} {{the competence of}} the charges and {{the jurisdiction of the}} court. He argued that he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>tried</b> before a Plateau State High Court and not the FCT High Court.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about that, Miss Harvey. I only know that wheresoever cholera breaks out, it is some one's fault; and if deaths occur, some one <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>tried</b> for manslaughter--I had almost said murder, and transported for life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{that would}} be more than we could afford," [...] said Tom Selden. [...] "You <b>ought</b> just <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make the people about here {{subscribe}} to anything, and you'd see what trouble it is to raise money out of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} one ever does any good by {{starving}} {{as long as}} there is bread to eat. This isn't a romantic sort of thing, this payment of rents; but we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and find out what a man really owes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're right, sir; we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> {{our hands}} at a canoe. Pity we didn't do so before the native men was all killed. They knew what sort o' trees to use, {{and how to}} split 'em up into planks, an' all that sort o' thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good! You {{must say}} them to Celia, too. She likes to hear Lita praised. You {{and she and}} that little Barlow boy <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> for a prize, as the poets did in Athens. I'll {{tell you all about}} it some time. Now, you peg away at your hymn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> go and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> cheer him up,' said Miss Denby, {{gathering}} up the reins. 'Do {{you expect to}} go on keeping this toll-gate, Mr. Twitty?' ...|$|R
25|$|However, as Thomas {{states the}} {{rational}} model {{provides a good}} perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, {{it does not seem}} strange that “we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>trying</b> for rational decision-making”.|$|R
6000|$|Dick got confused. [...] "I did; I was a fool, but the {{way things}} had been going {{was too much for}} me. You <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make allowances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The trail leads {{straight}} toward that place," [...] said Theriere, [...] "so I suppose {{here is where}} they brought her, but which of the huts she's in now we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to determine before we make any attempt to rescue her. Well, by George! Now {{what do you think}} of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now if [...] "Shakespeare" [...] did all that, {{he was not}} the actor. The author, on Mr. Collins's showing, {{must have}} been a very sedulous and diligent student of Greek poetry, above all of the drama, down to its fragments. The Baconians assuredly <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to prove, from Bacon's works, that he was such a student.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{never give}} it a chance," [...] she said. Then {{suddenly}} all her passion of grief over him broke out. [...] "But it does matter!" [...] she cried. [...] "And you OUGHT to be happy, you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to be happy, to live to be happy. How could I bear to think your life wouldn't be a happy one!" ...|$|E
60|$|You did {{not intend}} to cast a slur upon the idea of competition?--Yes, very distinctly; I {{intended}} not only to cast a slur, but to express my excessive horror of the principle of competition, in every way; for instance, we <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> grow claret here, nor to produce silk; we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> produce coal and iron, and the French should give us wine and silk.|$|R
6000|$|This was {{precisely}} the class to which Washington belonged; but he was {{ready and willing to}} make the sacrifices required. [...] "I think the scheme a good one," [...] added he, [...] "and that it <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>tried</b> here, with such alterations as our circumstances render absolutely necessary." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1867, the Attorney-General for Ireland, Hedges Eyre Chatterton, issued {{guidelines}} to regulate which cases <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>tried</b> at tried at assizes rather than quarter sessions: treason, murder, treason felony, rape, perjury, assault {{with intent to}} murder, party processions, election riots, and all offences of a political or insurrectionary character.|$|R
