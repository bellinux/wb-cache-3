40|$|Abstract Background Little {{is known}} about the role European patient <b>organisations</b> play in the process of {{deciding}} on reimbursement for medicines. Therefore we explore the current role of patient <b>organisations</b> in the process of reimbursement for medicines in Western Europe. We focus in particular on collaboration between patient <b>organisations</b> and the pharmaceutical industry in this respect. Methods Sixty-eight patient <b>organisations</b> representing seven medical conditions, from ten Western European countries, were asked to participate in the study. The participating <b>organisations</b> reported their experiences in a web-based questionnaire. Results Twenty-one patient <b>organisations</b> completed the questionnaire (response rate: 31 %), of which ten (47. 6 %) demanded reimbursement for medicines. <b>Organisations</b> demanding reimbursement were larger than those not demanding reimbursement. The main aim of these <b>organisations</b> was to create better accessibility of medicines for patients. Most <b>organisations</b> limited themselves to single actions. Only two engaged in multiple actions. Almost all <b>organisations</b> had general policies on cooperation with the pharmaceutical industry, with autonomy as the key feature. The patient <b>organisations</b> said they were reasonably successful and almost always satisfied with their own role in the reimbursement process. Conclusion Our study has found that the role of European patient <b>organisations</b> in the reimbursement process still seems limited, especially for small patient <b>organisations.</b> </p...|$|R
