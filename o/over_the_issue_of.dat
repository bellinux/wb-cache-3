5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Zara Yaqob assumed the throne, the Ethiopian church had been divided <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Biblical Sabbath {{observance}} for roughly a century. One group, {{loyal to the}} Coptic bishops, believed that the day of rest should be observed only on Sunday, or Great Sabbath; another group, the followers of Ewostatewos, believed with their founder that both the original seventh-day Sabbath (i.e., Saturday, or Lesser Sabbath) and Sunday should be observed.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The breakdown {{in the relationship between}} the two eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E

5|$|In 1305, Edward and {{his father}} quarrelled, {{probably}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> money. The Prince had an altercation with Bishop Walter Langton, {{who served as the}} royal treasurer, apparently over the amount of financial support Edward received from the Crown. Edward I defended his treasurer, and banished his son and his companions from his court, cutting off their financial support. After some negotiations involving family members and friends, the two men were reconciled.|$|E
5|$|In May, Quisling was {{shattered}} {{by the death of}} his mother Anna, as the two had been particularly close. At the same time, the political crisis over Norwegian independence deepened, with Quisling threatening Terboven with his resignation <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> finance. In the end, the Reichskommissar agreed to compromise on the issue, but Quisling had to concede on the SS issue: A brigade was formed, but as a branch of the Nasjonal Samling.|$|E
5|$|In October 1849 the {{southern}} interests held a convention to discuss railroads in Memphis, {{in response to}} a convention in St. Louis earlier that fall which discussed a northern route. The Memphis convention overwhelmingly advocated the construction of a route beginning there, to connect with an El Paso, Texas to San Diego, California line. Disagreement arose only <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> financing. The convention president, Matthew Fontaine Maury of Virginia, preferred strict private financing, whereas John Bell and others thought that federal land grants to railroad developers would be necessary.|$|E
50|$|Under Jeremy Corbyn's {{leadership}} of the Labour Party, the GMB has clashed with <b>the</b> party <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> Trident renewal and fracking, {{both of which are}} opposed by Corbyn.|$|R
25|$|During the American Civil War, East Tennessee and her {{citizens}} were deeply divided <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> slavery, States' rights, and secession that {{ultimately led to}} Tennessee's break with the Union.|$|R
50|$|Stoughton {{subsequently}} {{became a}} Republican <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> union and abolition of slavery. He {{served in the}} Vermont Senate from 1862 to 1864 and was Senate President from 1863 to 1864.|$|R
5|$|In the 1895 gubernatorial election, Kentucky elected its first-ever Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Bradley {{was able}} to {{capitalize}} both on divisions within the Democratic Party <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Free Silver and {{on the presence of}} a strong third-party candidate, Populist Thomas S. Pettit, to secure victory in the general election by just under 9,000 votes. This election marked the beginning of nearly thirty years of true, two-party competition in Kentucky politics.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, White was in support of preserving the United States. In the United States presidential election of 1860, White supported Constitutional Union Party presidential candidate John Bell and his running mate Edward Everett. The Constitutional Union Party was formed by former Whig Party members seeking to avoid secessionism <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> slavery. In 1861, White voted for Union candidates to serve as delegates from Hampshire County in the Virginia secession convention, one of which was his son-in-law Colonel E.M. Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after their}} election, {{the divide between}} Chandler and Laffoon widened <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> {{implementing}} a state sales tax. Laffoon favored the tax; Chandler opposed it. As presiding officer of the state senate, Chandler worked with Speaker of the House John Y. Brown, Sr. to block passage of the tax. In retaliation, Laffoon's allies in the General Assembly stripped Chandler {{of some of his}} statutory power as lieutenant governor, after which they were able to pass the tax by a single vote in each house of the legislature.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} {{disagreements}} between <b>the</b> two countries <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> {{climate change and}} the Kyoto Protocol. The main point of friction between Tuvalu and the United States has been the latter's non-ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.|$|R

50|$|After {{the start}} of Suriname’s {{political}} self-government from the Netherlands in 1954, changes were instigated to the country’s monetary system; on 1 April 1957 the Central bank of Suriname was established in Paramaribo and took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issuing</b> <b>of</b> currency.|$|R
5|$|The {{reform of}} the {{administration}} of MIT began in 1930 with the appointment of Karl T. Compton as president. Bush and Compton soon clashed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> limiting the amount of outside consultancy by professors, a battle Bush quickly lost, but the two men soon built a solid professional relationship. Compton appointed Bush to the newly created post of vice president in 1932. That year Bush also became {{the dean of the}} MIT School of Engineering. The two positions came with a salary of $12,000 plus $6,000 for expenses per annum.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred {{came into}} {{conflict}} with King Coenwulf of Mercia <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> whether laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries. In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Cenwulf had not yet made peace with the archbishop, but by 809 {{they seem to have}} been on good terms; the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{there was}} only one {{political}} party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The party was, however, broken into three divisions that would later split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> slavery, but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was dominant in the beginning. The Noble party was in favor of slavery, and the Hendricks party was generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried to impeach Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's. After two months of debate in the House, and Jennings having destroyed the evidence of his role, the House of Representatives dropped the investigation and issued a resolution that confirmed Jennings in his position as governor.|$|E
5000|$|The Silver Republican Party was a United States {{political}} {{party in the}} 1890s. It was so named because it split from <b>the</b> Republican Party <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Free Silver" [...] and bimetallism. The main Republican Party supported the gold standard.|$|R

5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals {{was made possible by}} the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E
5|$|In his {{new role}} Nichols clashed with the AEC <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> whether it or the Department of Defense should have custody of nuclear weapons. The administration's policy {{remained}} firmly in favor of AEC control. This was tested during the Berlin Blockade, when Truman ordered B-29 bombers to Europe. For a time {{there was talk of}} calling off the Operation Sandstone nuclear weapons tests, but Nichols successfully argued for their continuation. In 1950, he became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense, overseeing the Nike Project. He was appointed Chief of Research and Development when it was reorganized in 1952. Nichols retired from the Army on 31 October 1953. For his services from 1948 to 1953, he was belatedly awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal in 1956.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September Cardinal Alberic, Bishop of Ostia, {{arrived at}} Carlisle where David had called {{together}} his kingdom's nobles, abbots and bishops. Alberic {{was there to}} investigate the controversy <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the Bishop of Glasgow's allegiance or non-allegiance to the Archbishop of York. Alberic {{played the role of}} peace-broker, and David agreed to a six-week truce which excluded the siege of Wark. On 9 April David and Stephen's wife Matilda of Boulogne met each other at Durham and agreed a settlement. David's son Henry was given the earldom of Northumberland and was restored to the earldom of Huntingdon and lordship of Doncaster; David himself was allowed to keep Carlisle and Cumberland. King Stephen was to retain possession of the strategically vital castles of Bamburgh and Newcastle. This effectively fulfilled all of David's war aims.|$|E

50|$|In 1914 and 1915, {{factional}} {{differences within}} the Finnish Socialist Federation erupted {{and led to}} a split of the federation. This controversy was a reprise of a similar fight which had swept the Socialist Party of America in 1912 and 1913, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> syndicalism and sabotage and the party's relationship to the radical industrial union, the Industrial Workers of the World.|$|R
5|$|The state {{legislature}} decided during Houston's third senatorial term not to re-elect him, so {{he ran for}} the office of Governor of Texas, losing to Hardin Richard Runnels. He was still in Washington when William (Willie) Rogers Houston was born on May 25, 1858, their last child born in the Woodland home. In order to satisfy creditors of his gubernatorial campaign debts, Houston was forced to sell the house to his political supporter J. Carroll Smith. He subsequently defeated incumbent Runnels with a second bid for the office during a period when the populace was bitterly divided <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> secession from the United States, and was sworn in December 31, 1859.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican in {{a heavily}} Democratic state, Bradley found little success {{early in his}} {{political}} career. He was defeated for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate twice each. After rising to national prominence with his speech seconding the presidential nomination of Ulysses S. Grant at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he was nominated for governor in 1887. Although he lost the contest to Simon Bolivar Buckner, he reduced the usual Democratic majority substantially. He was again nominated for governor in 1895. Capitalizing on divisions in the Democratic Party <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> free silver, he defeated Parker Watkins Hardin in the general election. His term was marked by political struggles and violence. He was an advocate for blacks and did much to advance their status in the state, but was unable to enact much of his reform agenda because of a hostile Democratic majority in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, he {{attended}} the first South-South conference in Abuja, Nigeria, there meeting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose government had recently awarded Morales the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights. Morales proceeded straight to Havana for a conference celebrating Castro's life, where he gave a speech arguing for stronger links between Latin America and the Middle East to combat U.S. imperialism. Under his administration, diplomatic relations were established with Iran, with Morales praising Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a revolutionary comrade. In April 2007 {{he attended}} the first South American Energy Summit in Venezuela, arguing with many allies <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> biofuel, which he opposed. He had a particularly fierce argument with Brazilian President Lula over Morales' desire to bring Bolivia's refineries – which were largely owned by Brazil's Petrobrás – under state control. In May, Bolivia purchased the refineries and transferred them to the Bolivian State Petroleum Company (YPFB).|$|E
