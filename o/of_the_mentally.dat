5|$|After {{going without}} a rabbi {{for another two}} years, in 1921 Temple Sinai hired Rudolph I. Coffee, an Oakland native and cousin of Judah Leon Magnes. Coffee was outspoken, and passionately {{advocated}} liberal causes: he supported disarmament, birth control, and {{separation of church and}} state, and opposed prohibition, antisemitism, and Tammany Hall. Along with other local rabbis Jacob Nieto and Jacob Weinstein, he demanded the release of labor leaders and accused bombers Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. He also supported California's compulsory sterilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> ill and mentally retarded, and eugenicist E. S. Gosney's advocacy on this issue.|$|E

Phua also led a committee that drew up a five-year plan to improve services for special needs children. The PAP studied their proposals and later implemented some, such as a National non-profit Special Needs Trust Fund. Laws were also drafted to prohibit abuse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> disabled and to allow parents to appoint someone to look after their special needs children after they die.|$|E

The law's creation and passage were spurred in part by testimony from Logan's parents, James Logan, Sr. and Karen Logan. The law allows a judge to order a mandatory psychiatric evaluation of a person, if the person presented a threat to themselves or to others.|$|E

5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> ill.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1945, the ACLU {{had taken a}} stand {{to protect the rights}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> ill, when it drafted a model statute {{governing}} mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 O'Connor v. Donaldson decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended Billie Boggs, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.|$|E
5|$|Reid {{occupied}} high-ranking cabinet {{positions in}} Greenfield's government {{and that of}} his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of eugenics through the sterilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> handicapped, which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.|$|E

5|$|Sampson's {{agenda for}} the 1930 session {{was lost in the}} fights over Ben Johnson and Cumberland Falls. His calls for funding the free {{textbook}} program, compulsory sterilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> ill, and restrictions on chain stores were ignored. Instead, the legislature continued eroding his gubernatorial powers, including the power to appoint members of the textbook commission. With nearly all of the governor's powers stripped away and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and a sales tax on retail stores. They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics {{praising the}} film's characters, story, faux trailers, and {{the performances of}} Stiller, Downey, Black and Tom Cruise, though the depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> handicapped was seen as controversial.

In its North American opening weekend, the film earned $26million and retained the number one position {{for the first three}} weekends of release. Downey received Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for his performance, with both him and Cruise receiving nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. The film grossed more than $188 million worldwide before its release on home video on November 18, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Alaska possessed no {{mental health}} {{treatment}} facilities prior {{to the passage of}} the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.|$|E

25|$|The {{reform was}} focused on <b>the</b> gradual dismantlement <b>of</b> {{psychiatric}} hospitals, which required an effective community mental health service. <b>The</b> object <b>of</b> community care was to reverse <b>the</b> long-accepted practice <b>of</b> isolating <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> ill in large institutions and to promote their integration in a socially stimulating environment, while avoiding subjecting them to excessive social pressures.|$|R
5|$|In the Soviet times, mental {{hospitals}} were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, {{a human rights}} activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who {{have been living in}} a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|E

40|$|A study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motor {{development}} and the corporal schema integration was carried out on 60 normal children aged between 6 and 10, and 40 slightly mentally handicapped children of 8 and 10 years <b>of</b> age. <b>The</b> deficiency at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> manual rapidity {{is the most important}} element concerning <b>the</b> motive debility <b>of</b> <b>mentally</b> handicapped children. <b>The</b> tests show that there is no parallelism between the motive retardedness and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> attainment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporal schema. In fact, <b>the</b> motor debility <b>of</b> 8 year old children is emphasized at <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 10 with reference to normal children. On the other hand, if, at <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 8, <b>the</b> <b>mentally</b> handicapped children have a lag <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporal schema acquisition, these children have nearly overcome their retardedness at <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 10. Therefore, one can conclude that <b>the</b> motor retardedness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slightly <b>mentally</b> handicapped children is not essentially due to a deficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporal schema integration.
