5|$|In 332BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt {{with little}} {{resistance}} from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the Macedonian Ptolemaic Kingdom, {{was based on an}} Egyptian model and based in the new capital city <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria.</b> The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a seat of learning and culture, centered at the famous Library <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria.</b> The Lighthouse <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria</b> lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city—as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.|$|E

5|$|In the 1830s, the District's {{southern}} territory <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria</b> {{went into}} economic decline {{partly due to}} neglect by Congress. The city <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria</b> was a major market in the American slave trade, and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the District, further depressing the economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia {{to take back the}} land it had donated to form the District, through a process known as retrocession.|$|E

5|$|Philo <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria,</b> Josephus and Seneca {{state that}} Caligula was insane, but {{describe}} this madness as a personality trait {{that came through}} experience. Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from. According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him {{to think he was}} a god. Philo <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria</b> reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37. Juvenal reports he was given a magic potion that drove him insane.|$|E

5|$|To fix the {{problems}} McClellan perceived in Washington's defenses, he directed Colonel Barnard {{to construct a}} continuous line from the Potomac north <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria</b> to a point west of the Aqueduct Bridge, {{one of the three}} bridges that crossed the Potomac River. By the time the Army of the Potomac was deployed for the Peninsula Campaign in March 1862, the line of defenses stretched completely around Washington, and extensions to the ring of defenses ensured the protection of the town <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria</b> and the Chain Bridge, the furthest west of the three bridges connecting Maryland and Virginia.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria,</b> Shahrbaraz and his forces {{extended}} Sasanian rule southwards along the Nile.

Shahrbaraz was sent over there to deal with him, but was eventually defeated by him.|$|E
5|$|At 6.41, Eusebius {{quotes a}} letter from Dionysius, bishop <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria,</b> to Fabius, bishop of Antioch, on the {{persecution}} at Alexandria under Decius.

5|$|British ships did not {{participate}} in any major wars in the ironclad period. The Royal Navy's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one-sided engagements like the bombardment <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria</b> in 1882. Defending British interests against Ahmed 'Urabi's Egyptian revolt, a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria.</b> A mixture of centre-battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day, forcing the Egyptians to retreat; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first, but inflicted little damage, killing only five British sailors. Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted, on the other hand, and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact. Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal, they might have quickly turned the tide, for the attacking British ironclads found it easy (for accuracy's sake) to simply anchor whilst firing—perfect targets for high-angle fire upon their thinly armored topdecks.|$|E
5|$|Hutchinson {{claimed that}} all {{materials}} were {{property of the}} British Crown, but French scholar Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire told Clarke and Hamilton that the French would rather burn all their discoveries than turn them over, referring ominously {{to the destruction of}} the Library <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria.</b> Clarke and Hamilton pleaded the French scholars' case to Hutchinson, who finally agreed that items such as natural history specimens would be the scholars' private property. Menou quickly claimed the stone, too, as his private property. Hutchinson was equally aware of the stone's unique value, and rejected Menou's claim. Eventually an agreement was reached, and the transfer of the objects was incorporated into the Capitulation <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria</b> signed by representatives of the British, French, and Ottoman forces.|$|E
5|$|In October 2011, the {{neighboring}} city <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria,</b> Virginia, approved plans to deploy 54 bicycles at six {{stations in the}} Old Town and Carlyle neighborhoods in 2012, then add six more stations in 2013. The cost {{of the first year}} would be $400,000, including operating costs of $100,440. The first eight Alexandria stations were deployed in August 2012.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the speeches, there are fifty-six prologues (openings of speeches). They were collected for the Library <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria</b> by Callimachus, who believed them genuine. Modern scholars are divided: some reject them, while others, such as Blass, believe they are authentic. Finally, six letters also survive under Demosthenes's name and their authorship too is hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been claimed that Heron's formula for calculating the area of a {{triangle}} from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes. However, the first reliable reference to the formula is given by Heron <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria</b> in the 1st century AD.|$|E
5|$|Next to the apse is a {{mural of}} Saint Cyril <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria,</b> captioned as “Saint Cyril the Philosopher”, the 9th-century missionary to the Slavs. Although the {{position}} and iconography of the portrait clearly identify it as an image of Cyril <b>of</b> <b>Alexandria,</b> the caption hints that the local population confused the two saints and Cyril the Philosopher was still well-remembered at the time. Other images painted in the church include these of the Dormition of the Mother of God (above the entrance), the Transfiguration of Jesus (under the vault), John Damascene, Cosmas of Maiuma, Archangel Michael (south of the entrance), Saint Constantine and Saint Helena (right of the entrance).|$|E

As Alexandria's mayor and as chairman <b>of</b> the <b>Alexandria</b> Committee, Mason was involved with the construction <b>of</b> the <b>Alexandria</b> branch <b>of</b> the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.
