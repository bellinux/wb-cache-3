5|$|After the Pacquiao fight, Cotto {{moved to}} the light middleweight division. On June 5, 2010, he fought against undefeated Israeli WBA Light Middleweight Champion Yuri Foreman at Yankee Stadium in New York City. Bob Arum had said that if Cotto were to win, he would become a front runner to defend the WBA belt against Manny Pacquiao in November. Cotto stated that he would {{consider}} {{a return to the}} welterweight division, in case <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> fight. Cotto ended up knocking Foreman down with a signature left hook to the body in the ninth round, after Foreman tore his knee, Cotto, claiming the WBA light middleweight title, his fourth overall in three different weight divisions.|$|E

25|$|Besides the War of Succession and the Hundred Years' War, France was in {{the midst}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> period. Several decades earlier, the Roman Papacy had moved to Avignon and would not return to Rome for another 33 years. The Avignon Papacy was then ruled by Pope Clement VI, who was aiding the French in their war against the English with Church funds. Also, in the year 1345, the famous Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was {{completed}} after nearly two centuries of planning and construction. On 24 March, a man named Guy de Chauliac observed a strange astronomical sign: the planets Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars conjoined in the sky under the sign of Aquarius. That same day the area experienced a solar eclipse. This sign was interpreted as foreboding by many, and Chauliac would later blame it for the Black Plague, which arrived less than five years later.|$|E

500|$|RPGFan's Ken Chu, despite {{finding the}} camera's {{movement}} speed awkward and disliking {{some aspects of}} the graphics, found the characters [...] "reasonably strong" [...] and generally praised the gameplay.

[...] GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann generally shared these points of praise with other reviewers, despite finding some aspects of gameplay potentially unbalanced and the graphics unappealing, said that [...] "if [...] can manage to get over these flaws, you'll find an RPG that dares to be different, but not at the sake <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> story and exciting gameplay." [...] A common point of praise with reviewers was the improved localization when compared to that of Persona, although opinions on the voice acting varied and faults in the grammar were mentioned.|$|E

500|$|British-Tamil {{recording}} artist M.I.A. {{was one of}} the songwriters of [...] "Elastic Love". According to her, [...] "Elastic Love" [...] was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album.

When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} to go in there and get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'.

500|$|The Kinks {{started out}} playing the then popular R and blues styles; then, under the {{influence}} of The Kingsmen's [...] "Louie Louie" [...] recording, developed louder rock and hard rock sounds — due to their pioneering contribution to the field, they have often been labelled as [...] "the original punks". Dave Davies was [...] "really bored with this guitar sound – or lack <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> sound" [...] so he purchased [...] "a little green amplifier ... an Elpico" [...] from a radio spares shop in Muswell Hill, and [...] "twiddled around with it", including [...] "taking the wires going to the speaker and putting a jack plug on there and plugging it straight into my AC3O" [...] (a larger amplifier), but didn't get the sound he wanted until he got frustrated and [...] "got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut round the cone ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played and I thought it was amazing." [...] The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into the Vox AC30, and the resulting effect became a mainstay in The Kinks' early recordings—most notably on [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] and [...] "All Day and All of the Night".|$|E

2500|$|Angra and {{neighboring}} Praia da Vitoria were the sites <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> {{episode of the}} American Civil War. Unable to break the blockade by US Navy ships of southern (Confederate) ports, and hoping to draw these blockading ships away to counter other perceived threats, the Confederate States of America had commerce raiders built in Britain and France. One of these left Liverpool in July 1862 {{in the guise of}} a [...] "merchant ship" [...] and rendezvoused with supporting ships in the harbor of Praia da Vitoria. This meeting-place was chosen because Portugal was neutral and the Azores were far away from pursuing US Navy ships. In that port and, later at Angra, cannon and other supplies of war were transferred aboard the new ship. The CSS Alabama was commissioned on 24 August 1862 just outside the harbor of Angra, and it left Terceira to begin its career as the most effective commerce raider in naval history.|$|E

2500|$|The {{script for}} the 1979 film Alien was {{initially}} drafted by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett. Dan O'Bannon drafted {{an opening in}} which the crew of a mining ship are sent to investigate a mysterious message on an alien planet. He eventually settled on the threat being an alien creature; however, he could not conceive <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> way for it to get onto the ship. Inspired after waking from a dream, Shusett said, [...] "I have an idea: the monster screws one of them", planting its egg in his body, and then bursting out of his chest. Both realized the idea had never been done before, and it subsequently became {{the core of the}} film. [...] "This is a movie about alien interspecies rape," [...] O'Bannon said in the documentary Alien Evolution. [...] "That's scary because it hits all of our buttons." [...] O'Bannon felt that the symbolism of [...] "homosexual oral rape" [...] was an effective means of discomforting male viewers.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Williams, his wife, and {{children}} {{lived in the}} house. [...] Williams often lounged on the widow's walk. [...] At this time, Galveston Island had few trees or tall buildings, and from the widow's walk Williams could see the Gulf. He could also watch the horse races at a nearby race track which he co-owned with McKinney. He installed a telescope on the widow's walk, pointed towards the harbor. [...] It was customary for ships to flash signals as they approached land to inform the harbormaster {{of the types of}} cargo they carried. [...] Williams used his telescope to examine approaching ships; if one flashed the signal <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> cargo, Williams would rush downtown to start trading. [...] This gave him a competitive advantage over other merchants, who did not learn of the cargo until the ship was closer to shore. [...] Partially {{as a result of this}} tactic, the McKinney & Williams commission house [...] "was considered one of the wealthiest and most influential establishments in Texas".|$|E
2500|$|Excavations in Tzippori, in {{the central}} Galilee region, six {{kilometers}} north-northwest of Nazareth, have uncovered a rich and diverse historical and architectural legacy that includes Assyrian, Hellenistic, Judean, Babylonian, Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, Crusader, Arabic and Ottoman influences. The site is especially rich in mosaics belonging to different periods. Major findings include {{the remains of a}} 6th-century synagogue, evidence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs. A Roman villa, considered the centerpiece of the discoveries, which dates to the year 200 CE, was destroyed in the Galilee earthquake of 363 CE. The mosaic floor was discovered in August 1987 during an expedition led by Eric and Carol Meyers, of Duke University digging with Ehud Netzer, a locally trained archaeologist from the [...] Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It depicts Dionysus, the god of wine, socializing with Pan and Hercules in several of the 15 panels. In its center is a lifelike image of a young lady, possibly Venus, which has been named [...] "The Mona Lisa of the Galilee." [...] Additional finds include a Roman theater on the northern slope of the hill, and the remains of a 5th-century public building, with a large and intricate mosaic floor.|$|E
