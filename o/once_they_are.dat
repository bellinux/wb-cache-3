5|$|In harmony it {{is often}} better {{for the sake of}} {{consistency}} to maintain a whole succession of clusters, <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> begun; since one alone, or even two, may be heard as a mere effect, rather than as an independent and significant procedure, carried with musical logic to its inevitable conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Bound for a London {{show from}} Liverpool, The Beatles escape {{a horde of}} fans ("A Hard Day's Night"). <b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> aboard the train and trying to relax, various interruptions test their patience: after a dalliance with a female passenger, Paul's {{grandfather}} is confined to the guard's van and the four lads join him there to keep him company. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr play a card game, entertaining some schoolgirls before arriving at their desired destination ("I Should Have Known Better").|$|E

Upgrades include as a wider fire spread, faster projectiles or higher damage. The player starts {{the game with}} three nuclear devices, which once used will eliminate all enemies from the screen. Jetman also {{has the ability to}} boost, which will temporarily make him move at a much faster speed, although boosts will need to recharge <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> depleted.|$|E
5|$|<b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> all assembled, the Simpson family {{sit down}} to Thanksgiving dinner. When Lisa places the {{centerpiece}} on the table, she argues with Bart about where it should go {{since there is no}} room left for the turkey. In the ensuing fight, Bart accidentally throws the centerpiece into the fireplace and it burns up. Devastated, Lisa runs to her room crying, while Bart is sent to his room by his parents for causing the incident.|$|E
5|$|The game's ending {{depends on}} the PC's choice. If the PC chooses to become a vampire, former allies turn against the PC. <b>Once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> defeated, Orbakh sends the PC to destroy the Ebon Claws. If the PC instead decides to keep the mask, Orbakh attacks; after his defeat, {{the leader of the}} Ebon Claws arrives with a group of {{followers}} and attacks the party. After the party is victorious, they kill the last of the Night Masks and free the player character from the cursed mask.|$|E

5|$|The ovary and {{attached}} pistil protrude {{from the top}} of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Two 1 millimeter anthers hang from recurved, 2 millimeter filaments behind the pistil. Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to the stigma of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5millimeter (in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1millimeter long seeds. The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens begin {{breeding}} <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{three years}} old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range {{around the country}} despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species {{with a wide range}} and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E

5|$|The {{cardinals}} hear two sermons {{before the}} election: one before actually entering the conclave, and one <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{settled in the}} Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant {{to lay out the}} current state of the Church, and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time. The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household and a member of the Capuchin Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the conclave.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Bynars discreetly {{create a}} catastrophic {{failure in the}} ship's warp core. Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are unable to locate Picard or Riker and, {{assuming}} them to already be on the Starbase, order an emergency evacuation. They set the ship to leave the Starbase and warp to a safe location before it would explode. However, <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> clear of the dock, the failure disappears and the ship sets course for the Bynar system, the planet Bynaus orbiting Beta Magellan. Data, La Forge, and Quinteros realize that the Bynars are still aboard the ship, but there are currently no other working vessels to follow them. Back on the Enterprise, Riker and Picard leave the simulation to find the ship empty and at warp to the Bynar system, with the ship's controls locked to the bridge. Fearing that the Bynars have taken over the ship for nefarious purposes, they set the ship to self-destruct in 5 minutes and then take the bridge by inter-ship transporter beam and find the Bynars there unconscious.|$|E

5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E
5|$|Scientist David Banner has {{the idea}} to create super {{soldiers}} by introducing modified DNA sequences extracted from various animals to strengthen the human cellular response, but General Thaddeus Ross denies him permission to use human subjects. Banner subsequently conducts the experiments on himself. After {{the birth of his}} son Bruce, he finds that his son may have inherited the effects and seeks a cure, but is stopped in the process. Following a traumatic event, Bruce remembers nothing of the incident, and has been raised by the Krenzlers. Years later, Bruce is a geneticist working with his girlfriend, Betty Ross, within the Berkeley Biotechnology Institute on nanomed research. The pair hopes to achieve instantaneous cell repair by using low level Gamma radiation exposure to activate the nanomeds <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> introduced into a living organism. During routine maintenance of their appropriated gamma-ray spectrometer, a circuit shorts and triggers the experiment's program sequence. Unable to prevent the machine from firing, Bruce throws himself in front of a colleague to shield the man and is exposed to a massive amount of gamma radiation.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but, <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The Sharia courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E
