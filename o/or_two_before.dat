5|$|Immature {{birds are}} {{distinguished}} by their smaller size, smaller, duller-brown bill, dark grey chin and throat, and absent or underdeveloped head plumes, often just {{a scattering of}} yellow feathers. The crest is fully developed in birds aged three to four years, a year <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>before</b> breeding age.|$|E
5|$|Like other newts, Triturus species {{develop in}} the water as larvae, and return to it each year for breeding. Adults spend one half to three {{quarters}} of the year on land, depending on the species, and thus depend on both suitable aquatic breeding sites and terrestrial habitats. After larval development in the first year, juveniles pass another year <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>before</b> reaching maturity; in the north and at higher elevations, this can take longer. The larval and juvenile stages are the riskiest for the newts, while survival is higher in adults. Once the risky stages passed, adult newts usually attain an age of seven to nine years, although individuals of the northern crested newts have reached 17 years in the wild.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A month <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>before</b> the {{breeding season}} begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E

25|$|The {{average age}} of onset of alcohol abuse was 29 years for the Core City men and 41 years for the College men. Full blown alcoholism, where it appeared, usually lasted a decade <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>before</b> sobriety was attained. The number of alcoholics {{increased}} steadily until age 40 {{and then began to}} decline at a rate of stable remission of 2 to 3% per year. Older alcoholics are relatively rare because of the rate of remission and a higher mortality rate.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{participation}} in a triathlon requires an athlete to register and sign up {{in advance of the}} actual race. After registration, racers are often provided a race number, colored swim cap, and, if the event is being electronically timed, a timing band. Athletes will either be provided or briefed on details of the course, rules, and any problems to look out for (road conditions, closures, traffic lights, aid stations). At a major event, such as an Ironman or a long course championship, triathletes may be required to set up and check-in their bike in the transition area a day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>before</b> the race start, leaving it overnight and under guard.|$|E

Gashade sees that the woman appears to be signaling to the man. Coley makes attempts to talk to the woman but she continually taunts and insults him. She also repeatedly refuses to answer any of Gashade's questions regarding the purpose of their journey.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} desperate Soviet {{citizens}} turned to crime {{as a way to}} support themselves in trying times. Most common was the theft of food and of ration cards, which could prove fatal for a malnourished person if their card was stolen more than a day <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>before</b> a new card was issued. For these reasons, the stealing of food was severely punished and a person could be shot for as little as stealing a loaf of bread. More serious crimes, such as murder and cannibalism, also occurred, and special police squads were set up to combat these crimes, though {{by the end of the}} siege, roughly 1,500 had been arrested for cannibalism.|$|E
50|$|One <b>or</b> <b>two</b> weeks <b>before</b> egg-laying, {{the animals}} become notably agitated, moving around to smell and dig in the soil, even tasting it, before {{choosing}} the ideal spot {{to lay the}} eggs. One <b>or</b> <b>two</b> days <b>before</b> egg-laying, the female takes on an aggressive, dominant behavior, mounting another animal as for copulation and making the same squeaking sound the male produces during copulation. The purpose for this behavior is to produce respect in the tortoise community, so that the female will not be disturbed by the others during egg laying. Further details of egg-laying behavior {{are the same as}} those detailed for the marginated tortoise.|$|R

25|$|Some {{people believe}} it was a {{military}} accident which was then covered up; there are records of parachute mines being tested by the Russian military in the area around the time the hikers were there. Parachute mines detonate a meter <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>before</b> they hit the ground and produce similar damage to those experienced by the hikers, heavy internal damage with very little external trauma. There were also glowing orbs reported in the sky in that general vicinity, possibly caused by such ordnance. This theory uses animals to account for the missing parts of Dubinina. People believe the bodies were moved; photos of the tent show that it was apparently erected incorrectly, something that these experienced hikers are unlikely to have done.|$|E
25|$|The Natchez {{are noted}} {{for being the}} only Mississippian culture with complex chiefdom {{characteristics}} to have survived long into the period after the European colonization of America began. Others had generally declined a century <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>before</b> European encounter. The Natchez are also noted for having had an unusual social system of nobility classes and exogamous marriage practices. It was a strongly matrilineal kinship society, with descent reckoned along female lines. The paramount chief named the Great Sun was always {{the son of the}} Female Sun, whose daughter would be the mother of the next Great Sun. This ensured that the chiefdom stayed {{under the control of the}} single Sun lineage. Ethnologists have not reached consensus on how the Natchez social system originally functioned, and the topic is somewhat controversial.|$|E
25|$|When the Seminole Nation raised protest {{over the}} murder, the US federal {{government}} threatened to intervene. John Ashley fled to New Orleans {{for a year}} <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>before</b> returning to Florida around 1914. He may have worked as a logger in Seattle and later claimed to have robbed a bank in Canada. Upon his return, he surrendered himself to authorities in West Palm Beach where he was imprisoned until his trial. Ashley may have hoped that a hometown jury might sympathize with him, however the local prosecutor petitioned the judge {{for a change of}} venue to Miami. Hearing of the prosecutor's plans, he decided to escape. According to contemporary accounts, Ashley was being escorted to his cell by Sheriff Baker's son, Robert C. Baker, when he suddenly broke away, ran out an unlocked door and climbed a 10-foot fence to freedom.|$|E
