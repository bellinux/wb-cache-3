Ten individuals with SCI participated in this study, in which two ES protocols with different duty cycles (1 : 1 s vs 1 : 4 s on-off) were applied in counterbalanced order using a custom-made garment with built-in electrodes.

5000|$|Different {{waveforms}} can be {{used for}} different electrosurgical procedures. For cutting, a continuous single frequency sine wave is often employed. Rapid tissue heating leads to explosive vaporization of interstitial fluid. If the voltage is sufficiently high (> 400 V peak-to-peak) the vapor sheath is ionized, forming conductive plasma. Electric current continues to flow from the metal electrode through the ionized gas into the tissue. Rapid overheating of tissue results in its vaporization, fragmentation and ejection of fragments, allowing for tissue cutting. In applications of a continuous wave the heat diffusion typically leads to formation of a significant thermal damage zone {{at the edges of the}} lesion. Open circuit voltage in electrosurgical waveforms is typically in the range of 300-10,000 V peak-to-peak. [...] Higher precision can be achieved with pulsed waveforms. Using bursts of several tens of microseconds in duration the tissue can be cut, while the size of the heat diffusion zone does not exceed the cellular scale. Heat accumulation during repetitive application of bursts can also be avoided if sufficient delay is provided between the bursts, allowing the tissue to cool down. The proportion of ON time to OFF time can be varied to allow control of the heating rate. A related parameter, duty cycle, is defined as the ratio of the ON time to the period (the time of a single <b>ON-OFF</b> <b>cycle).</b> In the terminology of electrical engineering, this process of altering an amplitude of a periodic waveform is called modulation.|$|R

The first step is a simulation model that predicts startup/shutdown characteristics. This model is used as a tool to understand the effect that the S-curve parameters has on the system cycle efficiency. Several key vapor compression system dynamics are identified as causes for increasing/decreasing system's cyclic efficiency.
