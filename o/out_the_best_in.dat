5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's non-program music, though well-crafted, {{does not}} rise to {{the same level of}} {{inspiration}} as his programmatic works; he needed fantasy to bring <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> him. The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann's Fourth extremely closely, and is slighter in its thematic material than his later compositions. The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of variations on less-than-the-best music that can lead to tedium.|$|E
5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> herself.|$|E

25|$|The English {{music critic}} John Steane, {{reviewing}} Simon Keenlyside's performance of this aria, wrote:Coming after the grave-diggers' scene, it is a tender yet bitterly repentant elegy on Ophelia's death. The soliloquy has no counterpart in Shakespeare and brings <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> both Thomas and Keenlyside. From the composer it {{draws on the}} graceful French lyricism {{we know from the}} tenor solos in Mignon, adding a more complex responsiveness to the opera-Hamlet's simpler nature. For the singer, it provides an opportunity to use the refinement of his art yet rise to phrases, high in the voice, where he can expand the riches of his tones and the most heartfelt of his feelings.|$|E

25|$|Nessler was {{initially}} joined on the broadcasts by color commentator Bill Walton and lead sideline reporter Michele Tafoya. The team of Nessler and Walton did two broadcasts together before ABC decided that Walton needed a partner (much {{like he had}} at NBC with Steve Jones) and assigned pre-game analyst Tom Tolbert to join the team. Nessler, Walton and Tolbert called most regular season games, and every network playoff game. Other games were called by the team of Brent Musburger and Sean Elliott. After suffering the worst ratings in NBA Finals history for the 2003 series, low ratings overall, and harsh criticism, ABC decided to retool the team. More to the point, during this particular period, Brad Nessler was accused by media analysts (among them, New York Times columnist Richard Sandomir) of not knowing game strategy well, lacking rhythm and enthusiasm in his game call, not bringing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> his partners, too often ignoring the score and his tendency to stammer.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with another}} state side the MCC were again in trouble, this time under Colin Cowdrey's captaincy. John Snow was rested after {{damaging}} his toes in Melbourne and a stiff and sore Alan Ward strained a calf muscle during the game. In a rain affected match the New South Wales captain and wicket-keeper Brian Taber won the toss {{and decided to}} bat. They were 82/3 when Doug Walters came in and made 201 not out, adding 132 with Geoff Davies (57) and 145 with Kerry O'Keeffe (55 not out) before Taber declared at 410/5. Geoff Boycott (36) and Brian Luckhurst (42) added 54 for the first wicket and the MCC passed 100 with one wicket down. The leg-spinner O'Keeffe showed his all-round skills by taking 6/69 and they collapsed to 204 all out and were forced to follow on 206 runs behind. This kind of situation that brought <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> Geoff Boycott (129 not out) and he added 228 for the first wicket with Brian Luckhurst (135) and 97 for the second with Keith Fletcher (51 not out) to ensure a draw.|$|E

The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to John's efforts to save humanity from the machines.
