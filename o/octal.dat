40|$|In this work, a new {{approach}} is tested by applying neural networks treatment to meteorological time-series data sets, recorded during 1991 - 2000 at certain Greek locations, {{in order to create}} fully appropriate solar data information. Neural networks, in this case, are used for creating missing mean, maximum and minimum global and diffuse solar irradiance hourly data, when educated with other known meteorological time-series hourly values. For this purpose, hourly data of air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine duration, clouds' <b>octals,</b> as well as local latitude are used with regard to these sites. Neural networks' education process outputs are checked against known hourly values of solar irradiance, based upon the mentioned meteorological hourly raw data necessary for this action recorded at the National Observatory of Athens, the actinometric station at the Technological Education Institute (TEI) of Piraeus, and six other locations. Selection of these sites is representative of the climatic conditions in Greece, from north to south and east to west. Following the same scheme, the produced hourly global and diffuse mean hourly solar irradiance values are in a very good agreement (P< 0. 01) with actual measurements. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

RCA's strong patent position meant that the company effectively set the selling prices for vacuum tubes in the U.S., which {{were significantly higher than}} in Europe, where Lee de Forest had allowed a key patent issued to him to lapse. RCA was responsible for creating a series of innovative products, ranging from <b>octal</b> base metal tubes co-developed with General Electric before World War II, to miniaturized Nuvistor tubes used in the tuners of the New Vista series of TV sets. The Nuvistor tubes were a last major vacuum tube innovation, and were meant to compete with the newly introduced transistor. By 1975, RCA had completely switched from tubes to solid-state devices in their television sets, except for the cathode ray tube (CRT) picture tube.|$|E
500|$|This formula, unlike {{others before}} it, can produce any {{individual}} hexadecimal digit of [...] without calculating all the preceding digits.

An important application of digit extraction algorithms is to validate new claims of record [...] computations: After a new record is claimed, the decimal result is converted to hexadecimal, and then a digit extraction algorithm {{is used to calculate}} several random hexadecimal digits near the end; if they match, this provides a measure of confidence that the entire computation is correct.|$|E

2500|$|The number twelve, a {{superior}} highly composite number, {{is the smallest}} number with four non-trivial factors (2, 3, 4, 6), and the smallest to include as factors all four numbers (1 to 4) within the subitizing range. As {{a result of this}} increased factorability of the radix and its divisibility by a wide range of the most elemental numbers (whereas ten has only two non-trivial factors: 2 and 5, and not 3, 4, or 6), duodecimal representations fit more easily than decimal ones into many common patterns, as evidenced by the higher regularity observable in the duodecimal multiplication table. As a result, duodecimal has been described as the optimal number system. Of its factors, 2 and 3 are prime, which means the reciprocals of all 3-smooth numbers (such as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9...) have a terminating representation in duodecimal. In particular, the five most elementary fractions ( [...] , , , [...] and [...] ) all have a short terminating representation in duodecimal (0.6, 0.4, 0.8, 0.3 and 0.9, respectively), and twelve is the smallest radix with this feature (because it is the least common multiple of 3 and 4). This all makes it a more convenient number system for computing fractions than most other number systems in common use, such as the decimal, vigesimal, binary, <b>octal</b> and hexadecimal systems. Although the trigesimal and sexagesimal systems (where the reciprocals of all 5-smooth numbers terminate) do even better in this respect, this is at the cost of unwieldy multiplication tables and a much larger number of symbols to memorize.|$|E
