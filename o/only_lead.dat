5|$|After Ole Miss took {{an early}} 7–0 lead, the Crimson Tide scored 52 {{unanswered}} points in their 52–7 {{victory over the}} Rebels at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium. The Rebels scored their only points of the game on their first possession. Jeff Scott scored on a one-yard touchdown run to cap a 5-play, 72-yard drive to give Ole Miss their <b>only</b> <b>lead</b> of the game at 7–0. Alabama responded on the following drive with {{the first of four}} Trent Richardson touchdowns of the evening on an eight-yard run to tie the game at 7–7.

5|$|In 2004, Saran {{acted in}} two Telugu and two Hindi films, {{including}} Nenunnanu, where {{she played a}} student in classical singing. She had ten 2005 releases, nine of which were Telugu films, the most notable for her being Chatrapathi. There she appeared opposite Prabhas and earned her first nomination for the Filmfare Best Telugu Actress Award. A reviewer for Moviebuzz said that as an action film, Saran's character of the lead's love interest was not well developed {{and that she was}} there primarily for the songs. Meanwhile, she tried to make her comeback in Tamil with Mazhai, a remake of the Telugu film Varsham. Neither the movie nor her performance were received well. Also in 2005, she appeared as one of only three characters in the film Mogudu Pellam O Dongodu, which was about a married couple's first night together, and made a guest appearance in a children's film called Bommalata, which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu. Saran's <b>only</b> <b>lead</b> role in 2006, excluding three special appearances, was in the Tamil film Thiruvilayadal Arambam.|$|E

5|$|Kyle Brotzman handled all the kicking duties for Boise State, punting {{the ball}} four times for 169yards. His longest punt was 52yards, and one kick was downed inside the Pirates' 20yard line. His only field goal was a 31–yard kick {{that came with}} three minutes and 11seconds {{left in the third}} quarter. Brotzman kicked off seven times for 384yards, {{averaging}} 54.9yards per kick with no touchbacks. Marty Tadman had BSU's only punt return for −1yard. The Broncos' special teams had more luck on kickoff returns. Three players had kickoff returns. Austin Smith returned four kickoffs for 173yards. His 89–yard return for a touchdown in the first quarter was the team's longest of the game and gave Boise State its <b>only</b> <b>lead</b> of the game. Jeremy Avery returned two kicks for 41yards, and Titus Young returned one kick for 52yards.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} a story of pit strategy, as the only passing on the circuit was of lapped traffic. Albers was the only car to run a three pit stop race, as all other drivers chose to stop only twice. The <b>only</b> <b>lead</b> changes came on lap 26, as Schumacher's 32-second stop gave Barrichello the lead, and on lap 51, as Schumacher turned in the quickest pit stop at 23.615 seconds, giving him enough time to exit pit lane {{at the same time}} as Barrichello, with the result of forcing Barrichello into the grass of Turn One. After this incident, which was not {{investigated}} by race officials, both Ferrari drivers were reminded over their radios not to crash out of the race, and they both settled into a slower pace, comfortably ahead of the rest of the field. All four of the drivers for Jordan and Minardi scored their first points in Formula One at this race. Karthikeyan's points were the first for an Indian driver in Formula One. This was also the final race at which the Minardi team tallied points.|$|E
5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing second down on Stanford's 49-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Taylor completed a 10-yard throw to wide receiver Marcus Davis for a first down. Tech's drive continued down the field, with running back Darren Evans receiving {{the ball on the}} majority of the plays. A 5-yard false start penalty against Virginia Tech was offset by a pass interference penalty two plays later by Stanford. Tech penetrated to the Stanford 10-yard line, but was stopped for no gain, then a loss, on two consecutive running plays. On third down, Taylor was pressured by the Stanford defense, scrambled out of the pocket, and threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to running back David Wilson an instant before Taylor stepped out of bounds. The score and subsequent extra point gave Tech its <b>only</b> <b>lead</b> of the game, 9–7, with 10:22 remaining before halftime.|$|E

5|$|Tijori {{produced}} and played his <b>only</b> <b>lead</b> role in Gowariker-directed murder mystery Pehla Nasha (1993), alongside Pooja Bhatt and Raveena Tandon. Upon release, the film received poor reviews and failed {{at the box}} office. In the same year, he appeared as the antagonist in D Rama Naidu-directed Santaan. Tijori starred alongside Shah Rukh Khan in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa and Anjaam (both 1994). The latter one {{is considered one of}} the most violent films in Bollywood. In 1995, he starred in another Mahesh Bhatt-directed film Naajayaz. Tijori played a supporting role in action drama Mrityudata (1997) which did not receive favourable reviews from critics. He portrayed supporting characters in Aamir Khan-starrer Ghulam (1998) and the Abbas-Mustan-directed comedy thriller Baadshah. In the latter, he featured as the titular undercover CBI agent.|$|E
5|$|As they {{approach}} the planet, Jameson begins audio communication with Karnas to learn more of the situation, but soon discovers that it is Karnas himself that has taken the Federation staff. Karnas reminds Jameson that his treachery during their last encounter on Mordan IV resulted in years of war. Against the advice of Picard, Jameson devises plans to rescue the hostages by transporting the away team, now including the captain, to the tunnels beneath Karnas' mansion, where Jameson believes the hostages are being held. Picard privately confronts Jameson about Karnas' motives. Jameson reveals that in the past, Karnas had captured a Federation starliner in revenge {{for the death of}} his father by another local tribe. Jameson had negotiated for the passengers' release by giving Karnas what he demanded, a supply of Federation weapons. However, Jameson, in his interpretation of the Prime Directive, also supplied the warring tribes with an equal number of weapons. Jameson had thought this would <b>only</b> <b>lead</b> to a short-lived skirmish, and had not expected a war that would last over forty years. Jameson is now insistent on correcting his past mistake and thus took the reverse aging drug in order to be at his best.|$|E

In order to find out who, McGarrett and Danny turn to Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim), one of John's proteges. He left the Honolulu Police Department disgraced after {{he was accused of}} corruption. After Chin Ho asserts his innocence, McGarrett offers him to join his task force.

In order to apprehend Sang Min, Chin Ho decides to appoint his cousin, Kono Kalakaua (Grace Park) as a plant. Kono was a former professional surfer turned police academy graduate. She goes undercover as a Chinese immigrant to meet with Sang Min. The conversation is monitored {{by the rest of the}} team through up-to-date laser audio surveillance, eliminating the need for a wire. However, it has emerged that Sang Min has a mole in HPD, who identifies Kono as a cop. The team storm the warehouse, and McGarrett apprehends Sang Min.|$|E

Former Xavier player Brian Grant had his jersey retired at halftime, and the team wore throwback uniforms in his honor. Grant gave the Musketeers a pep talk prior to the game, and Xavier opened an early 16–8 lead. Scootie Randall scored Temple Owls' first 10 points, hitting five out of his first six shots. The Owls took their <b>only</b> <b>lead</b> of the half 29–28 off of a three by Randall. In the second half, the teams traded baskets before Xavier went on a 10–0 run. Randall led Temple Owls on an 11–1 run {{to tie the game}} at 66, knocking down two fastbreak layups and a three-point shot, and finished with a career-high 28 points. The Owls took their final lead 69–68 off a Khalif Wyatt three-pointer with 5:30 to go. Afterwards Tu Holloway hit a scoop shot and Mark Lyons had a layup and a steal to give Xavier a 75–69 advantage that they maintained. Holloway scored 21 points and Lyons 19 to score the most points against Temple Owls in the season.|$|E
