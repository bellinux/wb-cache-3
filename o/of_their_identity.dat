5|$|Early Māori {{adapted the}} tropically based east Polynesian culture {{in line with}} the {{challenges}} associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, particularly with the introduction of Christianity. However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>identity,</b> and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples. More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.|$|E
5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>identity,</b> which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E

Specifically, the study examines how middle school students come to value or reject mathematics homework. Case study analyses revealed two ways of characterizing students’ experiences with homework. Students who buy into homework develop aspects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> related to school, math and homework that support them in valuing homework. Students who check out develop aspects <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>identities</b> that support them in rejecting homework. The concepts of buying in and checking out have implications for theory development around motivation and identity and for school practices around homework...|$|R

25|$|Urdu {{continued}} {{its role in}} developing a Muslim identity as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was established {{with the intent to}} construct a homeland for Islamic believers. Several languages and dialects spoken throughout the regions of Pakistan produced an imminent need for a uniting language. Because Urdu was the symbol of Islamic identity in Northern India, it was selected as the national language for Pakistan. While Urdu and Islam together played important roles in developing the national identity of Pakistan, disputes in the 1950s challenged the necessity for Urdu as a national symbol and its practicality as the lingua franca. The significance of Urdu as a national symbol was downplayed by these disputes when English and Bengali were also accepted as official languages. In addition to the disagreements over the value of Urdu as a national language in Pakistan, recent Muslims in Asia question the necessity for the Urdu script to be distinctly different from the Hindi script. While early nineteenth century Muslims saw the Arabic script as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>identity,</b> certain modern Muslims choose to use a modified Hindi script in writing Urdu. Although Urdu was a distinct identity marker for Muslims in colonialist ruled India and a national symbol for Pakistan, its necessity has been put into question by modern Muslims in both India and Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|For flights {{within the}} Schengen Area (either between Schengen member states or {{within the same}} Schengen member state), law {{enforcement}} agencies, airport authorities and air carriers are only permitted to carry out security checks on passengers and may not carry out border checks. Such security checks can be conducted through the verification of the passenger's passport or national identity card: Such a practice must only be used to verify the passenger's identity (for commercial or transport security reasons) and not his or her immigration status. For this reason, law enforcement agencies, airport authorities and air carriers cannot require air passengers flying within the Schengen Area who are third-country nationals to prove the legality of their stay by showing a valid visa or residence permit. In addition, according to European Commission guidelines, identity checks on air passengers flying within the Schengen Area should take place only either at check-in, or upon entry to the secured zone of the airport, or at the boarding gate: passengers should {{not be required to}} undergo a verification <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>identity</b> {{on more than one occasion}} before their flight within the Schengen Area. Nevertheless, the identity checks function as practical border controls anyway, and are a problem for illegal immigrants who arrive in Greece (which has no land border to another Schengen country) and want to go to some other Schengen country. The requirements as to which identity document to possess varies by country and airline. Normally a passport or EU national identity card is needed. Greece, Iceland and Malta do not share land borders with other Schengen member states.|$|E

25|$|The {{use of the}} St. Brigid's Cross {{was chosen}} by Edith Cusack the Head of Women's Programming at the newly founded channel in early 1960s. St. Brigid is the female patron saint of Ireland. The first logo lasted until the {{formation}} of Ireland's national radio and television services Raidió Teilifís Éireann in 1966. Part of the redesign was to prevent strobing on screen. The 1966 to 1969 logo was a much simpler form of the cross and was designed by Jim Jones. The letters R, T and E {{were added to the}} logo after the formation of RTÉ as a statutory body. Before this the logo was simply the cross in black on a white background or white on a black background. Don Farrell and Jon Cogan designed the 3rd incarnation of the Brigid's Cross. This logo remain on air until 1986 when RTÉ decided that both channels in a multi-channel landscape need to be identified as clearly RTÉ. The 1986 logo coincided with the 25th anniversary of Irish Television. The Cross on RTÉ One was animated turning into a number 1, while over on RTÉ Two it turned into a number 2. On screen this logo lasted until 1988 when RTÉ Two re-branded as Network 2 moving it further away from the sister channel RTÉ One. 10 years later the logo dropped the Brigid's Cross, {{and for the first time}} placed an accent (Fadá) on the letter E. RTÉ also formal branded Network Two on screen as part of RTÉ until 1997 when the channel was once more re-branded on screen as N2. The three letters are a modern take on Celtic scripting. The Brigid's Cross was seen on many RTÉ One television idents until 2003 and remains on the headed paper of RTÉ, while a variation of the 1966 cross is used by RTÉ's Graphic Design Department. Since 2004 all RTÉ service use the 1996 logo as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>Identity.</b>|$|E
