5|$|One of Innis's primary {{contributions}} to communications studies was {{to apply the}} dimensions <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> space to various media. He divided media into time-binding and space-binding types. Time-binding media are durable. They include clay or stone tablets. Space-binding media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Relationships {{change as}} {{partners}} {{take on new}} roles, {{such as that of}} caregiver, which may conflict with the role of partner and require substantial sacrifice <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> self-care.

5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is on the nature <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> salvation. Eliot emphasises the need {{of the individual to}} focus on the present moment and to {{know that there is a}} universal order. By understanding the nature <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept and}} origin of Burnt Norton is {{connected}} to Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral. The poem discusses the idea <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> the concept that only the present moment really matters because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown.|$|E

40|$|This study {{draws on}} a feminist {{perspective}} on <b>time</b> <b>and</b> space, or a feminist <b>time</b> <b>and</b> space literacy, {{in order to}} better understand the <b>times</b> <b>and</b> spaces in distance learning. I seek to respond to some of the key gaps in the literature by considering the multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> spaces in distance learning, and the underpinning power relations, within respondents' stories of being a distance learner. This research makes a substantial contribution to the research on <b>time,</b> space <b>and</b> distance learning. This is {{not only in terms of}} bringing a feminist <b>time</b> <b>and</b> space literacy to the area of distance learning but, by doing so in conjunction with data collected over <b>time</b> <b>and</b> space, it also adds many new layers to the stories about the multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> spaces in distance learners' lives, and the ways in which gendered and other power relations shape these. Moreover, this study has contributed to the wider body of feminist knowledge in seeking to explore a multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> spaces in women and men's lives- as opposed to a binary <b>of</b> women's <b>time</b> <b>and</b> space <b>and</b> men's <b>time</b> <b>and</b> space - and in seeking to focus on <b>time</b> <b>and</b> space simultaneously.

5|$|After {{a period}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive {{stage of the}} life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, {{and will continue to}} produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E
5|$|After being {{aided by}} rain {{while in a}} disadvantageous {{position}} during the Third Test, the Australians had only one tour match—a victory over Middlesex—to prepare for the next Test at Headingley.

Instead of opting to use reserve opener Brown to replace Barnes, Australia played Hassett out of position to partner Morris, while Harvey took a middle-order slot.|$|E

5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it for a period <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E
