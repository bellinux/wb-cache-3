40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} new double {{exposure}} Moire method for an <b>optical</b> <b>registration</b> metrology system in photolithography. Our method enables us to achieve at least a factor of 10 improvements in precise displace-ment metrology using a conventional optical sensor. We utilize a new registration mark printed to the photoresist on a bare silicon wafer using a double exposure of the gratings. The mark consists of two types of Moire with opposite phases. The two types of Moire are oriented in alternate directions. Displacement is measured from {{the distance between the}} positions of the two types of Moire in analogy with the conventional registration method. This concept is called alternating direction Moire. Performance is experimentally confirmed using an i-line wafer exposure apparatus. Precision is improved by up to 32 times as compared with the conventional method and can be applied to other Moire metrologies. Â© The Authors.

Very rich hydrogen + air flames were studied {{in a constant}} volume bomb equipped with a pressure sensor and a Schlieren system for <b>optical</b> <b>registration</b> of the flame front movement. The mixtures contained 70 % and 75 % of hydrogen, the rest being air. The measurements were conducted at pressures from 1 to 4 atm for 70 % H- 2 + air mixture and from 0. 7 to 1. 4 atm for 75 % H- 2 + air mixture. Two methods for determination of the laminar burning velocity were used: from the temporal evolution of the flame front movement and from the pressure records at nearly constant pressure. These methods were compared and {{discussed in terms of}} accuracy and implicit assumptions behind them. Markstein lengths were also extracted and compared with the literature by using different extrapolation models. An important role of the critical radius for extraction of the burning velocity and Markstein length is demonstrated.

40|$|In <b>optical</b> image <b>registration,</b> the {{reference}} control points (RCPs) used as explanatory {{variables in the}} polynomial regression model are generally assumed to be error free. However, this most frequently used assumption is often invalid in practice because RCPs always contain errors. In this situation, the extensively applied estimator, the ordinary least squares (LS) estimator, is biased and incapable of handling the errors in RCPs. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop new feasible methods to address such a problem. This paper discusses the scaled total least squares (STLS) estimator, which is a generalization of the LS estimator in optical remote sensing image registration. The basic principle and the computational method of the STLS estimator and the relationship among the LS, total least squares (TLS) and STLS estimators are presented. Simulation experiments and real remotely sensed image experiments are carried out to compare LS and STLS approaches and systematically analyze the effect of the number and accuracy of RCPs on the performances in registration. The results show that the STLS estimator is more effective in estimating the model parameters than the LS estimator. Using this estimator based on the error-in-variables model, more accurate registration results can be obtained. Furthermore, the STLS estimator has superior overall performance in the estimation and correction of measurement errors in RCPs, which is beneficial to the study of error propagation in remote sensing data. The larger the RCP number and error, the more obvious are these advantages of the presented estimator...|$|R

Conventional optical rangefinders have been limited to a relative resolution of 10 (exp - 6) even for short distances.

In this paper the opportunity of application of cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy for N 2 O detection is presented. This method is a modification of cavity ring down spectroscopy. The laser radiation tuned to absorption line of N 2 O is injected into an optical cavity under a very small angle in respect to its axis. In the case of lack of the absorption, the result is determined by the mirrors reflectivity coefficient, diffraction losses and length of the cavity. When the absorber is present in the cavity, the result additionally depends on absorption and scattering of light in cavity. The method provides the determination of a very weak absorption coefficient as well as the concentration of the absorbing gas. Our N 2 O sensor consisted of a pulsed radiation source, optical cavity, detection module and a digital oscilloscope. As the light source anoptical parametric generator was applied.

However, PET images collected at discrete bins can be significantly affected by noise as there are lower activity counts in each gated bin unless the total PET acquisition time is prolonged, so that gating methods should be combined with imaging-based motion correction and registration methods. ^ The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and validate a fast and practical solution to the problem of respiratory motion for the detection and accurate quantitation of lung tumors in PET images. This included: (1) developing a computer-assisted algorithm for PET/CT images that automatically segments lung regions in CT images, identifies and localizes lung tumors of PET images; (2) developing and comparing different registration algorithms which processes all the information within the entire respiratory cycle and integrate all the tumor in different gated bins into a single reference bin. Four registration/integration algorithms: Centroid Based, Intensity Based, Rigid Body and <b>Optical</b> Flow <b>registration</b> were compared as well as two registration schemes: Direct Scheme and Successive Scheme. Validation was demonstrated by conducting experiments with the computerized 4 D NCAT phantom and with a dynamic lung-chest phantom imaged using a GE PET/CT System. Iterations were conducted on different size simulated tumors and different noise levels. Static tumors without respiratory motion were used as gold standard; quantitative results were compared with respect to tumor activity concentration, cross-correlation coefficient, relative noise level and computation time. Comparing the results of the tumors before and after correction, the tumor activity values and tumor volumes were closer to the static tumors (gold standard). Higher correlation values and lower noise were also achieved after applying the correction algorithms. With this method the compromise between short PET scan time and reduced image noise can be achieved, while quantification and clinical analysis become fast and precise. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Analysis of in vitro cell {{motility}} {{is a useful}} tool for assessing cellular response to a range of factors. However, the majority of cell-tracking systems available are designed primarily for use with fluorescently labelled images. In this paper, five commonly used tracking systems are examined for their performance compared {{with the use of a}} novel in-house celltracking system based on the principles of image <b>registration</b> and <b>optical</b> flow. Image <b>registration</b> is a tool commonly used in medical imaging to correct for the effects of patient motion during imaging procedures and works well on low-contrast images, such as those found in bright-field and phase-contrast microscopy. The five cell-tracking systems examined were Retrac, a manual tracking system used as the gold standard; CellTrack, a recently released freely downloadable software system that uses a combination of tracking methods; ImageJ, which is a freely available piece of software with a plug-in for automated tracking (MTrack 2) and Imaris and Volocity, both commercially available automated tracking systems. All systemswere used to track migration of human epithelial cells over ten frames of a phase-contrast time-lapse microscopy sequence. This showed that the in-house image-registration system was the most effective of those tested when tracking non-dividing epithelial cells in low-contrast images, with a successful tracking rate of 95...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for object {{tracking}} so that precise object shape can be obtained. Unlike previous tracking methods that build on image segmentation (by separating foreground and background statistics), which are limited to uncluttered background and simple appearance of the object, and tracking by detection approaches that have complex appearance models but simplistic models of shape, we track by identifying stationary statistics of both appearance and shape over time, and therefore obtain accurate shape in complex changing backgrounds. Our method is an adaptive template matching scheme that applies to objects with large deformations and articulation {{as well as a}} camera that moves and changes viewpoint relative to the object. The significant aspect that must be addressed in such a template matching scheme is that the shape of the projected object into the imaging plane is quickly changing from the complex image induced transformation due to 3 D articulation and deformation, viewpoint change, occlusions and disocclusions of the object due to viewpoint change, and self-occlusions and self-disocclusions due to articulation. We provide the fundamentals to understand occlusions and disocclusions of the object, a model of the shape and appearance of the projected object in time taking into account occlusion phenomena, and a computational algorithm to obtain the precise shape of the object. We illustrate the ideas on challenging video sequences and obtain state-of-the-art results.
