5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of an}} array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a {{cellular automaton}} is an assignment of a state to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E
5|$|A typhoon {{differs from}} a cyclone or {{hurricane}} <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of location.

5|$|Additionally, {{critics have}} noted the {{similarity}} between Qwak! and the 1984 Nintendo light gun game for the Nintendo Entertainment System titled Duck Hunt. Nintendo used that similarity in a 1986 court case attempting to invalidate a patent held by Sanders Associates; the patent, filed by Ralph Baer, was for the light gun peripheral used in the Magnavox Odyssey light gun game and held to be infringed on by Duck Hunt. Nintendo unsuccessfully claimed that Baer had based his patent not <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Odyssey work but also on Qwak! as seen by him at the 1974 MOA show.|$|E
5|$|An Atlantic {{hurricane}} or {{tropical storm}} is a tropical cyclone that {{forms in the}} Atlantic Ocean, usually in the summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of location. A hurricane is a storm that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Any second-order {{automaton}} may {{be transformed}} into a conventional cellular automaton, in which the transition function depends <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> single previous time step, by combining pairs of states from consecutive time steps of the second-order automaton into single states of a conventional cellular automaton.|$|E

5|$|Before his succession, George {{was granted}} the royal arms differenced by a label of five points Azure, the centre point bearing a fleur-de-lis Or on 27 July 1749.

5|$|Consider a {{particle}} moving under an arbitrary central force F1(r) whose magnitude depends <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> distance r between the particle and a fixed center. Since {{the motion of}} {{a particle}} under a central force always lies in a plane, {{the position of the}} particle can be described by polar coordinates (r,θ1), the radius and angle of the particle relative to the center of force (Figure1). Both of these coordinates, r(t) and θ1(t), change with time t as the particle moves.|$|E

5|$|Director Rob Bowman {{initially}} {{thought that}} the episode could be filmed in five days, two fewer than usual. However, it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sickbay set. He later said that he simply shot the framework for the clips to be added in later, and never saw a final cut of the episode. Production assistant Eric A. Stillwell was responsible for selecting the clips {{that went into the}} episode, with 21 different clips included. The prop used on Riker to fight the infection was created from drawings by designer Rick Sternbach.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E
