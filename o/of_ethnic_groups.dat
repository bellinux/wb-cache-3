While self-identification is now widely accepted as the appropriate mode of assignment, the impracticalities {{of a free}} response in the collection <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> data mean that categorisation into a limited set of choices must take place.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> identity is a causal factor <b>of</b> deadly violence. <b>Ethnic</b> <b>group</b> identity {{is not a}} sufficient cause <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> war, however; rather, it is a remote and necessary one. In order for violence to ignite, other more proximate events must occur that directly precipitates ethnic conflict. In addition, this scholar seeks to understand how <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> identity influences group behavior during conflict, e. g., when mass protests might turn violent and when they might not. This dissertation asserts that in contentious political arenas, the strength <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> identity has a positive relationship with the intensity <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> conflict. The following propositions are tested: stronger <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> identities are likely to correlate with violent ethnic conflict; conversely, weaker <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> identities are likely to correlate with political rather than violent ethnic conflict. ^ The hypothesis of this project, then, is that as strength <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> identity increases, the intensity <b>of</b> an existing <b>ethnic</b> conflict also increases. To test this hypothesis, I have created an index that scales the strength <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> identity. The <b>Ethnic</b> <b>Group</b> Identity Index (EGII) determines if a group 2 ̆ 7 s strength of identity is weak, moderate, or strong. This scholar argues that the more cultural and <b>ethnic</b> indicators a <b>group</b> has that differentiates it from all other groups, the higher that group 2 ̆ 7 s strength <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> identity will be. ^ One may then expect that groups with a stronger ethnic identity will experience more intense ethnic conflict. Further, this scholar also created the Intensity of Violence Index (IVI). The IVI allows scholars to score, and therefore compare and contrast, any ethnic conflict based upon the most intense violence found in a relationship between two or more <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups.</b> This dissertation expects that the stronger an <b>ethnic</b> <b>group</b> measures on the EGII, the higher that group 2 ̆ 7 s score {{will be on the}} IVI. ...|$|R
