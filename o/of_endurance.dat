5|$|I needed {{somebody}} who could perform, and {{who also had}} a lot <b>of</b> <b>endurance,</b> because we were shooting in Atlanta {{at the end of}} July. Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{a statue}} of Shackleton by Mark Richards was erected in Athy, {{sponsored}} by Kildare County Council. In 2017, the musical play Ernest Shackleton Loves Me by Val Vigoda and Joe DiPietro made its debut in New York City at the Tony Kiser Theater, an Off-Broadway venue. Blended with a parallel story of a struggling composer, the play retells the adventure <b>of</b> <b>Endurance</b> in detail, incorporating photos and videos of the journey.|$|E

5|$|Macklin {{believed}} that Shackleton {{may have been}} influenced in his decision by Worsley who shared a mutual enmity with McNish, and had accompanied Shackleton back from Antarctica. Members of the Scott Polar Research Institute, New Zealand Antarctic Society and Caroline Alexander, the author <b>of</b> <b>Endurance,</b> have criticised Shackleton's denial of the award to McNish, {{and there is an}} ongoing campaign to have him awarded the medal posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the {{organizing}} body considered rescheduling <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its impact}} and scale, the Battle of Triangle Hill {{is one of}} the least known episodes of the Korean War within the Western media. For the Chinese, this costly victory {{presented}} an opportunity to promote the value <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> and sacrifice. The courage demonstrated by the Chinese soldiers at Triangle Hill was repeatedly glorified in various forms of media, including several major motion pictures. Qin Jiwei was also celebrated as the hero of Shangganling and eventually rose to become the Minister of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress. The 15th Corps {{became one of the most}} prestigious units within the PLA, and the PLAAF selected the 15th Corps to become China's first airborne corps in 1961. It remains the most elite corps-size unit in China today.|$|E

5|$|Once {{assembled}} at Nadzab, the 25th Infantry Brigade commenced its {{advance on}} Lae. On 11 September, it engaged the Japanese soldiers at Jensen's Plantation. After defeating them, it engaged and defeated a larger Japanese force at Heath's Plantation. During this skirmish, Private Richard Kelliher won the Victoria Cross, Australia's highest award for gallantry. The Japanese Army elected {{not to fight}} for Lae, preferring instead to withdraw over the Saruwaged Range. This {{proved to be a}} gruelling test <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> for the Japanese soldiers who had to struggle over the rugged mountains; in the end, the Japanese Army managed to withdraw its forces from Salamaua and Lae, though with extensive losses from exposure and starving during the retreat. Troops of the 25th Infantry Brigade reached Lae shortly before those of the 9th Division that had been advancing on Lae from the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the stages, {{the player}} may enter doors to access seven {{different}} types of chambers. Stores and black markets offer items in exchange for hearts, which are left behind by defeated monsters. Treasure chambers contain items, enemy nests give the player an opportunity to earn extra hearts, and hot springs restore Pit's health. In the god's chamber, the strength of Pit's bow and arrow may be increased depending on several factors, such {{as the number of}} enemies defeated and the amount of damage taken in battle. In the training chamber, Pit will be awarded with one of the three power items if he passes a test <b>of</b> <b>endurance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anthropomorphised ants {{have often}} been used in fables and children's stories to {{represent}} industriousness and cooperative effort. They also are mentioned in religious texts. In the Book of Proverbs in the Bible, ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation. Aesop did the same in his fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. In the Quran, Sulayman {{is said to have}} heard and understood an ant warning other ants to return home to avoid being accidentally crushed by Sulayman and his marching army. In parts of Africa, ants are considered to be the messengers of the deities. Some Native American mythology, such as the Hopi mythology, considers ants as the very first animals. Ant bites are often said to have curative properties. The sting of some species of Pseudomyrmex is claimed to give fever relief. Ant bites are used in the initiation ceremonies of some Amazon Indian cultures as a test <b>of</b> <b>endurance.</b>|$|E

5|$|For most of {{the last}} century {{military}} service {{has been one of the}} single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the national identity has been built on an idealised conception of the Australian experience of war and of soldiering, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions <b>of</b> <b>endurance,</b> courage, ingenuity, humour, larrikinism, egalitarianism and mateship; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity.|$|E
5|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of their history, Andalusians have been used for both riding and driving. Among the first horses used for classical dressage, they are still making a mark in international competition in dressage today. At the 2002 World Equestrian Games, two Andalusians were on the bronze-medal winning Spanish dressage team, a team that went on to take the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Today, the breed is increasingly being selectively bred for increased aptitude in classical dressage. Historically, however, they were also used as stock horses, especially suited to working with Iberian bulls, known for their aggressive temperaments. They were, and still are, known for their use in mounted bull fighting. Mares were traditionally used for la trilla, the Spanish process of threshing grain practiced until the 1960s. Mares, some pregnant or with foals at their side, spent full days trotting over the grain. As well as being a traditional farming practice, it also served as a test <b>of</b> <b>endurance,</b> hardiness and willingness for the maternal Andalusian lines.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, McGovern {{joined the}} 741st Squadron of the 455th Bombardment Group of the Fifteenth Air Force, {{stationed}} at San Giovanni Airfield near Cerignola in the Apulia region of Italy. There {{he and his}} crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything they had seen back home during the Depression. Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger. Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the Dakota Queen after his wife Eleanor. His targets were in Austria; Czechoslovakia; Nazi Germany; Hungary; Poland; and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either oil refinery complexes or rail marshalling yards, all {{as part of the}} U.S.strategic bombing campaign in Europe. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests <b>of</b> <b>endurance</b> for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared to earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire that filled the sky with flak bursts.|$|E
