5|$|The word Ahimsa—sometimes spelled as Ahinsa—is {{derived from}} the Sanskrit root hiṃs – to strike; hiṃsā is injury or harm, a-hiṃsā is the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> this, i.e. non harming or nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|As Kepler-8b orbits its star, it {{demonstrates}} the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, {{in which the}} host star's spectrum becomes red- and, later, blueshifted, as a body transits it. The identification of this effect established Kepler-8b as orbiting in a prograde motion (as opposed to retrograde motion, in which a planet orbits in a direction <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> its star's rotation).|$|E

5|$|Background {{selection}} is the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation {{tends to be}} weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background {{selection is}} a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E
5|$|Based on Japanese mythology, Orochimaru {{was created}} {{as one of}} the series' main antagonists, and {{intended}} to represent the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> the protagonists' morals and values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended {{to make it easier for}} the reader to recognize that he is a villain. In Japanese, Orochimaru has been voiced by Kujira whereas in the English dub he is voiced by Steve Blum.|$|E

5000|$|As Aristotle noted, {{however, the}} virtues can have several opposites. Virtues can be {{considered}} the mean between two extremes, as the Latin maxim dictates in medio stat virtus - in the centre lies virtue. For instance, both cowardice and rashness are <b>opposites</b> <b>of</b> courage; contrary to prudence are both over-caution and insufficient caution; the <b>opposites</b> <b>of</b> pride (a virtue) are undue humility and excessive vanity. A more [...] "modern" [...] virtue, tolerance, {{can be considered}} the mean between the two extremes of narrow-mindedness {{on the one hand}} and over-acceptance on the other. Vices can therefore be identified as the <b>opposites</b> <b>of</b> virtues - but with the caveat that each virtue could have many different opposites, all distinct from each other.|$|R
5|$|In neuroscience, {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons. The <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.|$|E
5|$|Melanism is {{the direct}} <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> albinism. An unusually {{high level of}} melanin {{pigmentation}} (and sometimes absence {{of other types of}} pigment in species that have more than one) results in an appearance darker than non-melanistic specimens from the same genepool.|$|E
5|$|On June 12, 2003, NOAA {{published}} a forecast for the East Pacific hurricane season, {{the first time}} it had done so. The scientists predicted a 50% chance of below normal activity this season, due to the expectation that La Niña conditions would develop. La Niña conditions generally restrict tropical cyclone development in the northeast Pacific, which is the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> its effect in the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Other critics emphasise {{that the}} letter's object, Lord Molesworth, was {{targeted}} to bind the higher and lower classes together. Using Molesworth, a religious dissenter, a nobleman, and the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> Swift, the Drapier unites {{all of the}} various people of Ireland in a common nationalist cause. Instead of defending charges against himself, the Drapier is calling up more support for the Irish cause; he seeks attention so that the greater liberty of Ireland will be respected.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E
5|$|The <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> {{convergence}} is divergent evolution, where {{related species}} evolve different traits. Convergent evolution {{is similar to}} but different from parallel evolution. Parallel evolution occurs when two independent but similar species evolve {{in the same direction}} and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, gliding frogs have evolved in parallel from multiple types of tree frog.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form as {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. Cyclolysis is the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> his heroines: his male characters {{are not particularly}} handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|After this transfer, {{the roadway}} carried the CR492 designation. In 1964, several {{abandoned}} underground mine shafts collapsed underneath M-35 in Negaunee, and M-35 was rerouted {{out of the}} city along its current roadway through Negaunee Township, connecting with CR492. The eastern end of CR492 was moved by 2001. Before this realignment, CR492 followed Brookton Road, parallel to US41/M-28 before turning to the previous terminus just west of the border between Marquette Township and the City of Marquette. After the change, CR492 turned north to intersect the highway <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> Wright Street. The CR492 designation was extended along Wright Street at the same time. In 2006, the city of Marquette extended Wright Street to end at Lakeshore Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E
