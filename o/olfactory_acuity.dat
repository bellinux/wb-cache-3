5000|$|Hyperosmia is an {{increased}} <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> (heightened sense of smell), usually {{caused by a}} lower threshold for odor.

30|$|Nest {{site-specific}} landscape variables most influenced DSR of nests in this sagebrush-obligate species, {{the greater}} sage-grouse. However, managing for microsite landscape characteristics is difficult. Large-scale management practices are readily implemented across the landscape; thus, predictive mapping {{of the landscape}} factors responsible for nest survival (longer temporal scale than DSR) may be more appropriate for applying management actions (Dzialak et al. 2011 a). This management action does not {{take away from the}} fact that microsite characteristics are important to DSR of nests. Nest sites are located in a broader landscape context, which supports earlier studies which found that predators selected landscape characteristics (including human-altered areas) at larger spatial extents (Chalfoun et al. 2002; Stephens et al. 2005). This may lead to reduced DSR of nests when nest sites are located within the larger landscape selected by predators or in landscapes where human activity subsidizes predators. Therefore, predators appear to be the proximate cause of reduced DSR of nests whereby predator senses, such as visual and <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuities,</b> are heightened in certain landscapes and under variable weather conditions. However, the ultimate cause of nest failure may stem from alterations to the landscape that typically occur across large spatial extents leading to subsidized predator communities or decoupled selection decisions used during nest site selection. Although weather patterns cannot be managed per se, managers can use predictive mapping of spatial attributes of the landscape and model seasonal nest survival by including weather patterns experienced over the nesting period to predict annual trends of breeding dynamics.|$|R

Higher cognitive brain mechanisms and more olfactory brain regions enable humans to discriminate odors better than other mammals despite fewer olfactory receptor genes.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} factors which {{influences}} a dog’s ability to track:Physiological {{features of the}} dog are a factor, including age and sex. As a dog ages, their <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> decreases and decreases their ability to track. Furthermore, male dogs {{have been found to}} be better at tracking than females, possibly due to sex differences in olfaction. Sniffing behaviour also influences olfaction, and therefore a dog’s ability to track. For example, a dog’s ability to sniff is higher when it is not panting due to fatigue - it is physically impossible for a dog to both pant and sniff at the same time and the mouth must be open or closed respectively. However, dogs trained to track during physically demanding activities may have adapted their behaviour by increasing sniffing frequency to maximize olfaction, and tracking. Also, different dog breeds have varying suitability to different tasks of tracking. For example, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives use Labrador Retrievers for their tracking purposes.|$|E

A phylogenetically corrected regression of olfactory ratio to body mass reveals that, relative to predicted values, the olfactory bulbs of (i) tyrannosaurids and dromaeosaurids are significantly larger, (ii) ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorids are significantly smaller, and (iii) ceratosaurians, allosauroids, basal tyrannosauroids, troodontids and basal birds are within the 95 % CI. Relative to other theropods, <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> was high in tyrannosaurids and dromaeosaurids and therefore olfaction would have {{played an important role in}} their ecology, possibly for activities in low-light conditions, locating food, or for navigation within large home ranges. <b>Olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> was the lowest in ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorids, suggesting a reduced reliance on olfaction and perhaps an omnivorous diet in these theropods. Phylogenetic trends in olfaction among theropods reveal that <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> did not decrease in the ancestry of birds, as troodontids, dromaeosaurids and primitive birds possessed typical or high <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity.</b> Thus, the sense of smell must have remained important in primitive birds and its presumed decrease associated with the increased importance of sight did not occur until later among more derived birds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Human {{perception}} of the odour environment is highly variable. People vary both in their general <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> {{as well as in}} if and how they perceive specific odours. In recent years, {{it has been shown that}} genetic differences contribute to variability in both general <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> and the {{perception of}} specific odours. Odour perception also depends on other factors such as age and gender. Here we investigate the influence of these factors on both general <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> and on the perception of 66 structurally and perceptually different odours in a diverse subject population. Results We carried out a large human olfactory psychophysics study of 391 adult subjects in metropolitan New York City, an ethnically and culturally diverse North American metropolis. 210 of the subjects were women and the median age was 34. 6 years (range 19 – 75). We recorded ~ 2, 300 data points per subject to obtain a comprehensive perceptual phenotype, comprising multiple perceptual measures of 66 diverse odours. We show that general <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> correlates with gender, age, race, smoking habits, and body type. Young, female, non-smoking subjects had the highest average <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity.</b> Deviations from normal body type in either direction were associated with decreased <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity.</b> Beyond these factors we also show that, surprisingly, there are many odour-specific influences of race, age, and gender on olfactory perception. We show over 100 instances in which the intensity or pleasantness perception of an odour is significantly different between two demographic groups. Conclusions These data provide a comprehensive snapshot of the olfactory sense of a diverse population. <b>Olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> in the population is most strongly influenced by age, followed by gender. We also show a large number of diverse correlations between demographic factors and the perception of individual odours that may reflect genetic differences as well as different prior experiences with these odours between demographic groups. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: This study aims {{to measure}} <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> in chronic {{migraine}} subjects, at baseline and on migraine days, and compare to age- and sex-matched controls. Olfactory impairment {{is common in}} neurological disorders. While smell hypersensitivity has been established with chronic migraine, <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> has not been well studied. METHODS: We recruited 50 subjects with chronic migraine from the Jefferson Headache Center and 50 age- and sex-matched controls. Using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a validated test of olfaction, <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> was measured at baseline and during a migraine for subjects, and compared to controls at baseline and at home 2 weeks later. All subjects were additionally screened for odor sensitivity and allodynia. RESULTS: The mean UPSIT score for migraine subjects was 34. 5 on non-migraine days and 34. 7 on migraine days (mean difference[*]=[*]- 0. 4, 95 % confidence interval [CI; - 1. 3, 0. 6] P[*]=[*]. 45). Controls had a mean of 35. 9 and 36. 1 for each test day (mean difference[*]=[*]- 0. 1, 95 % CI [- 0. 9, 0. 7] P[*]=[*]. 87). On average, migraineurs performed worse than their matched control counterparts in both test sittings (test 1 : P[*]=[*]. 047; test 2 : P[*]=[*]. 01). The great majority of subjects were allodynic (42 / 50) compared with only 9 of 50 controls, {{and the majority of}} subjects (41 / 50) found more than one listed odor to be bothersome, compared with only 10 / 50 controls. On non-migraine days, 18 / 48 chronic migraine subjects had abnormal olfaction and on migraine days 14 / 42 had abnormal olfaction, compared with only 9 / 50 controls who had abnormal olfaction on their first UPSIT. CONCLUSIONS: While chronic migraine patients do not appear to have a significant change in <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> between migrainous and non-migrainous periods, they do appear to be more likely to have abnormal <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> at baseline compared to age- and sex-matched controls...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of assessors' varying <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> on the perceived intensity of androstenone and skatole odour and flavour in boar loins. To discriminate sensitive (SENS) and highly sensitive (SENS HIGH) panellists, two levels of androstenone were used on smell strips. Sensitivity {{was defined as the}} correct identification of the androstenone strip in three replicate triangle tests. Judges then assessed loins from boars, castrated pigs and gilts. SENS HIGH assessors scored low-fat boar loins with 1. 5 to 2. 0 mikrog of androstenone per gram of melted back fat which is significantly different from castrate and gilt loins for androstenone odour and flavour whereas SENS assessors were less discriminating. Panellists' <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> should thus be considered for selection and training.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{recovery of}} olfactory function in five consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection of midline skull base tumors using an anterior craniofacial approach {{in which the}} cribriform plate was mobilized with the dura. Olfactory function was evaluated before and after surgery using an intravenous olfactory test with prosultiamine and also a standard <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> test. Before surgery, one patient showed anosmia attributable to obstruction of the nasal cavity and olfactory cleft, and four patients showed normal olfactory function. After surgery, one patient was irreversibly anosmic, probably because of intradural dissection of the olfactory tracts. The other four patients, including the patient showing anosmia preoperatively, reported subjective recovery of olfaction 3 to 8 weeks after surgery. Intravenous and standard <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> tests indicated recovery of olfaction to the normal range in three patients and decreased olfactory function in one.

40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} adaptive significance of the sphyrnid cephalo-foil, including potential advantages of spacing the olfac-tory organs at the distal tips of the broad surface. We employed comparative morphology to test whether the sphyrnid cephalofoil provides better stereo-olfaction, in-creases <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity,</b> and samples a greater volume of the medium compared {{to the situation in}} carcharhiniform sharks. The broadly spaced nares provide sphyrnid spe-cies with a significantly greater separation between the olfactory rosettes, which could lead to an enhanced ability to resolve odor gradients. In addition, most sphyrnid spe-cies possess prenarial grooves that greatly increase the volume of water sampled by the nares and thus increase the probability of odorant encounter. However, despite a much greater head width, and a significantly greater number of olfactory lamellae, scalloped hammerhead sharks do not possess a greater amount of olfactory epi-thelial surface area than the carcharhiniform sandbar sharks. Therefore, sphyrnid sharks might not possess any greater <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> than carcharhinids. Despite this, there are clear olfactory advantages to the cephalofoil head morphology that could have led to its evolution, persistence, and diversification. J. Morphol. 264 : 253 – 263...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpecific anosmia is a {{term that}} {{describes}} an inability to perceive a particular odorant {{in the context of}} an otherwise normal <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity.</b> The most common example, for the odor of androstenone, has been ascribed a prevalence ranging from 2 to 45 %. In two experiments we sought to determine whether this wide range could be explained by the difference in steroid concentrations used, and by the degree to which the trigeminal system contributes to perception of androstenone. Experiment 1 demonstrated that high concentrations of androstenone stimulated the trigeminal system, as indicated by electrophysiological recordings. Experiment 2 demonstrated that conscious detection of androstenone is possible based solely on the trigeminal system. Interestingly, detection seems to interact with <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> in that subjects with a low olfactory sensitivity to androstenone were better able to detect its trigeminal component. The agreement between conscious experience and behavioral discrimination was not well calibrated, in that subjects demonstrated a clear overconfidence in their abilities. Altogether, the current study suggests that androstenone is an odorant that produces a concentration-dependent degree of trigeminal stimulation. This trigeminal component explains the diversity of the reported prevalence of specific anosmia for androstenone and might have implications on future use of specific anosmia as a tool to understand odor processin...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNumerous {{clinical}} reports {{underscore the}} frequency of olfactory impairments in patients suffering from major depressive disorders (MDDs), yet the underlying physiopathological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that one key link between olfactory deficits and MDD lies in hypercortisolemia, a cardinal symptom of MDD. Corticosterone (CORT) is known to negatively correlate with hippocampal neurogenesis, yet its effects on olfactory neurogenesis and olfaction remain unknown. Here we used a rodent model of anxiety/depression-like states, {{which is based on}} chronic CORT administration and studied the effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) on behavior, olfaction, and adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG), olfactory bulb (OB), and the olfactory epithelium (OE). Chronic CORT had no effect on cell proliferation in the OE or on olfactory sensory neurons projecting to the OB, but induced pronounced deficits in <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity,</b> fine discrimination of odorants and olfactory memory. These alterations were accompanied by a significant {{decrease in the number of}} adult-born neurons in both the DG and OB. Remarkably, FLX not only reversed depression-like states as expected, but also improved <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity,</b> memory, and restored impaired adult neurogenesis. However, fine olfactory discrimination was not restored. Morphological analysis of adult-born neurons in both the DG and the OB showed that dendritic complexity was not significantly affected by CORT, but was increased by FLX. These findings demonstrate an essential role for glucocorticoids in triggering olfactory impairments in MDD and highlight a novel therapeutic effect of FLX. Increasing clinical reports show that major depression is characterized by pronounced olfactory deficits, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this work, we used an endocrine model of depression to study whether hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis perturbation could be sufficient to provoke olfactory impairments. We found that chronic corticosterone not only induces marked deficits in <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity,</b> fine discrimination and olfactory memory, but also significantly decreases bulbar and hippocampal neurogenesis. Importantly, the antidepressant fluoxetine restores both adult neurogenesis and depressive states, and improves most olfactory functions. Our data reveal that impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during depression can lead to olfactory deficits and that the neurogenic effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants can successfully restore certain olfactory functions...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: People with {{migraine}} often report being osmophobic, both {{during and}} between acute migraine attacks. It is not clear, however, whether such reports {{are associated with}} changes in olfaction such as hyperosmia, as measured by psychophysical testing. In this case-control study we quantitatively assessed olfactory identification ability, which correlates with threshold tests of <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity,</b> in patients with migraine at baseline (no headache), during migraine episodes, and after a treated attack and compared the test scores to those of matched control subjects. METHODS: Fifty episodic migraine subjects and 50 and sex- and age-matched controls without headache were tested. All completed the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a standardized and well-validated olfactory test. RESULTS: At baseline, the UPSIT scores {{did not differ significantly}} between the migraine and control study groups (median paired score difference: - 1, p[*]=[*] 0. 18). During migraine attacks, a minority of migraine subjects (eight of 42) developed microsmia (i. e. lower test scores by at least four points), suggesting that, as compared to their matched controls, <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> was somewhat impaired during migraine attacks (p[*]=[*] 0. 02). This difference was less pronounced and not statistically significant after a successfully treated attack (p[*]=[*] 0. 15). DISCUSSION: People with episodic migraine were found to have similar olfactory function as age- and sex-matched controls, but a minority exhibit microsmia or hyposmia during acute attacks. The cause of this dysfunction is unknown, but could relate to autonomic symptoms, limbic system activation, or disorders of higher order sensory processing...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Mutations {{reducing}} {{the function of}} Nav 1. 7 sodium channels entail diminished pain perception and <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity,</b> suggesting a link between nociception and olfaction at ion channel level. We hypothesized that if such link exists, it should work in both directions and gain-of-function Nav 1. 7 mutations known {{to be associated with}} increased pain perception should also increase <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity.</b> Methods: SCN 9 A variants were assessed known to enhance pain perception and found more frequently in the average population. Specifically, carriers of SCN 9 A variants rs 41268673 C&# 62;A (P 610 T; n = 14) or rs 6746030 C&# 62;T (R 1150 W; n = 21) were compared with non-carriers (n = 40). Olfactory function was quantified by assessing odor threshold, odor discrimination and odor identification using an established olfactory test. Nociception was assessed by measuring pain thresholds to experimental nociceptive stimuli (punctate and blunt mechanical pressure, heat and electrical stimuli). Results: The number of carried alleles of the non-mutated SCN 9 A haplotype rs 41268673 C/rs 6746030 C was significantly associated with the comparatively highest olfactory threshold (0 alleles: threshold at phenylethylethanol dilution step 12 of 16 (n = 1), 1 allele: 10. 6 ± 2. 6 (n = 34), 2 alleles: 9. 5 ± 2. 1 (n = 40)). The same SCN 9 A haplotype determined the pain threshold to blunt pressure stimuli (0 alleles: 21. 1 N/m 2, 1 allele: 29. 8 ± 10. 4 N/m 2, 2 alleles: 33. 5 ± 10. 2 N/m 2). Conclusions: The findings established a working link between nociception and olfaction via Nav 1. 7 in the gain-of-function direction. Hence, together with the known reduced olfaction and pain in loss-of-function mutations, a bidirectional genetic functional association between nociception and olfaction exists at Nav 1. 7 level...|$|E

We report a significant improvement over age in young children&# 39;s overall olfactory discriminability. Critically, such improvement is modulated by the degree of structural similarity between odorants independent of odor familiarity.

Furthermore, we posed the question whether olfactory detection amelioration upon sexual maturation might provoke a change in food preferences, for instance a reduction in fish consumption.

40|$|How is {{behaviour}} organised across sensory modalities? Specifically, we ask {{concerning the}} fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster how visual context affects olfactory learning and recall and whether information about visual context is getting integrated into olfactory memory. We find that changing visual context between {{training and test}} does not deteriorate olfactory memory scores, suggesting that these olfactory memories can drive behaviour despite a mismatch of visual context between training and test. Rather, both the establishment and the recall of olfactory memory are generally facilitated by light. In a follow-up experiment, we find no evidence for learning about combinations of odours and visual context as predictors for reinforcement even after explicit training in a so-called biconditional discrimination task. Thus, a ‘true’ interaction between visual and olfactory modalities is not evident; instead, light seems to influence olfactory learning and recall unspecifically, for example by altering motor activity, alertness or <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity...</b>|$|E

Expression of multiple {{members of the}} larger subfamilies was detected, suggesting that most if not all of the cross-hybridizing bands in genomic Southern blots represented actively transcribed olfactory receptor genes. Analysis of large DNA fragments using Southern blots of pulsed-field gels indicated that subfamily members were clustered together, and that two of the subfamilies were closely linked in the dog genome. Analysis of the four olfactory receptor gene subfamilies in 26 breeds of dog provided evidence that the number of genes per subfamily was stable in spite of differential selection on the basis of <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> in scent hounds, sight hounds, and toy breeds...|$|E
40|$|Sensory loss induces cross-modal plasticity, often {{resulting}} in altered performance in remaining sensory modalities. Whereas much {{is known about}} the macroscopic mecha-nisms underlying cross-modal plasticity, only scant information exists about its cellular and molecular underpinnings. We found that Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes deprived of a sense of body touch exhibit various changes in behavior, associated with other unimpaired senses. We focused on one such behavioral alteration, enhanced odor sensation, and sought to reveal the neuronal and molecular mechanisms that translate mechanosensory loss into improved <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity.</b> To this end, we analyzed in mechanosensory mutants food-dependent locomotion patterns that are associated with olfactory responses and found changes that are consistent with enhanced olfaction. The altered locomotion could be reversed in adults by optogenetic stimulation of the touch receptor (mechanosensory) neu-rons. Furthermore, we revealed that the enhanced odor response is related to a strengthen-ing of inhibitory AWC!AIY synaptic transmission in the olfactory circuit. Consistently, inserting in this circuit an engineered electrical synapse that diminishes AWC inhibition o...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} nasal {{function}} after laryngectomy {{have suggested that}} patients must accept complete and irreversible anosmia as an inevitable consequence of the operation, {{and that this is}} due to interruption of a poorly defined neuronal interaction between larynx and nose. In this study nasal function was investigated in 23 laryngectomees and 10 patients about to undergo laryngectomy. Scanning electron microscopy showed a more densely ciliated nasal epithelium in the laryngectomees compared with the preoperative controls, and nasal mucociliary transport, measured by saccharine clearance, was significantly faster (P less than 0. 01) in laryngectomees. <b>Olfactory</b> <b>acuity,</b> as determined by the threshold for detection of insufflated pyridine vapour, was normal in laryngectomees. Some laryngectomees did have a relatively normal sense of smell; these were shown to be those who had discovered a technique of sniffing using buccopharyngeal rather than respiratory musculature. These findings have obvious implications for the rehabilitation of laryngectomees, many of whom may otherwise have to contend with distressing anosmia {{as well as the other}} physical and psychological consequences of the operation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Dynamic Triangle Olfactometer, an {{instrument}} which measures odor thresholds {{by a system}} functionally based {{on the principles of}} steady state dynamic flow, dilution and forced choice triangle design, was evaluated and found to be most acceptable for its utility in appraising the efficacy of breath freshening formulations in relieving or controlling extrinsic (onion) oral malodor. Initially, the <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> of a panel of novice judges was ascertained by the development of thresholds for hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan, both compounds related to oral malodor, especially extrinsic as induced by an aqueous suspension of onion oil used in this study. The thres-hold for onion oil was also established. Several breath freshening formulations were demonstrated to be effective in controlling extrinsic oral malodor under the conditions of this study. The operational parameters of the DTO system were uncomplicated and the data so obtained was reproducible. The panel of judges approximated the distribution of olfactory sensitivity of a normal population; therefore, the performance of the formulations as measured in this system should be, and is, reasonably predictive to a consumer population...|$|E
40|$|Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are {{versatile}} {{resources for}} humans {{due to a}} number of their physical and behavioural characteristics. Because of dogs 2 ̆ 7 <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> they have been used to detect cryptic or concealed items such as narcotics, explosives and wildlife. However, there is a wide variation in performance. This variation is often not correlated with their breed and has not been rigorously tested. Little research has compared dog breeds for their suitability as detection dogs, and even fewer studies have concluded which characteristics should be selected. This is important considering the number of dogs produced for detection work. This paper has collated the scientific literature to present important behavioural and physical traits, and traits which should be avoided, in detection dogs. The important traits include: highly play motivated; high level of cooperativeness with their handler; boldness; obedience yet independence when off-leash; and high athleticism. Although wildlife detection dogs are this paper 2 ̆ 7 s focus, these proposed traits are relevant in any detection field...|$|E
40|$|Disruptions of a Drosophila gene {{encoding}} {{a regulatory}} subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase homologous to mammalian RIbeta (dPKA-RI) were targeted {{to the first}} (noncoding) exon of dPKA-RI via site-selected P element mutagenesis. Flies homozygous for either of two mutant alleles showed specific defects in olfactory learning but not in subsequent memory decay. In contrast, <b>olfactory</b> <b>acuity</b> and shock reactivity, component behaviors required for normal odor avoidance learning, were normal in these mutants. Northern and Western blot analyses of mRNA and protein extracted from adult heads have revealed a complex lesion of the PKA-RI locus, including expression of a novel product and over- or underexpression of wild-type products in mutants. Western blot analysis revealed reductions in RI protein in mutants. PKA activity {{in the absence of}} exogenous cAMP also was significantly higher than normal in homogenates from mutant adult heads. These two mutant alleles failed to complement each other for each of these phenotypic defects, eliminating second-site mutations as a possible explanation. These results establish a role for an RI regulatory subunit of PKA in Pavlovian olfactory conditioning...|$|E
