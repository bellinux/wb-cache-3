40|$|Florida is one {{of fifteen}} jurisdictions in the United States that have enacted a <b>direct</b> <b>file</b> statute that grants {{prosecutors}} the ability to transfer juveniles from {{the juvenile justice system}} to adult court. Critiques of the <b>direct</b> <b>file</b> statute have focused on its effectiveness on deterrence and recidivism, its arbitrariness in application, and the tension with the role of juvenile justice in reforming rather than punishing youth. This Note explores the harmful consequences of the <b>direct</b> <b>file</b> statute <b>on</b> non-citizen youth in immigration proceedings and the probability of obtaining immigration relief. An adult conviction as opposed to a juvenile delinquency adjudication is grounds for immigration proceedings and also bars to relief such as Special Immigration Juveniles Status. Additionally, the greater cooperation between local law enforcement in adult jail systems and Immigration Customs Enforcement increases the likelihood that juveniles with adult convictions will face immigration proceedings {{as a result of their}} immigration status...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} youths are being tried in {{criminal}} court because of statutory measures that have decreased {{the use of}} judicial review as the primary mechanism for transfer. The relative immaturity of adolescents suggests that transferred youths might have impaired competence-related abilities compared to adults. To test this hypothesis, we compared the competence-related abilities and developmental characteristics of a sample of direct-filed 16 - 17 -year-olds charged in criminal court {{in the state of}} Florida (<b>Direct</b> <b>File</b> sample) to a sample of 18 - 24 -year-old adults charged in criminal courts (Adult Offender sample) and to a separate sample of 16 - 17 -year-olds charged in juvenile court (Juvenile Court sample). Results indicated that there were few differences between the <b>Direct</b> <b>File</b> youths and Adult Offenders. The differences that were observed suggested that the Direct Filed youths performed slightly better than the Adult Offender group and the Juvenile Court youths charged in juvenile court. These findings suggest that as a group, 16 - 17 -year-old <b>Direct</b> <b>File</b> adolescents do not have significant deficits in competence-related abilities due to age or immaturity...|$|R

40|$|The {{amount of}} multidistrict {{litigation}} (MDL) {{in the federal}} courts is skyrocketing, particularly {{in the areas of}} mass torts and products liability. One significant reason for the explosion of MDL has been the difficulty of maintaining nationwide or multistate class actions in these areas, {{due in large part to}} the choice-of-law problems created by operation of many different states 2 ̆ 7 laws to plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 claims. One comparative benefit of MDL is that individual cases within the consolidated pretrial proceedings retain their 2 ̆ 2 choice-of-law identity 2 ̆ 2 [...] that is, that transfer of a case into a pending MDL does not change the choice-of-law rules that would otherwise apply to a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s case had it proceeded in its original home forum. In other words, the case carries the choice-of-law rules of the original forum state with it into the MDL. Because MDL is purportedly a consolidation only for pretrial proceedings, unlike a class action, the application of different choice-of-law rules to different plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 claims does not render the MDL proceeding itself infeasible. This framework, however, is in disarray due to the advent and increasing popularity of a practice called 2 ̆ 2 <b>direct</b> <b>filing.</b> 2 ̆ 2 In <b>direct</b> <b>filing,</b> plaintiffs bypass the transfer process and file their cases directly into an MDL court. Amid the growing popularity of this practice, the question of what choice-of-law rules ought to apply to direct-filed cases has been left unaddressed. This paper seeks to expose and resolve the problem by permitting <b>direct</b> <b>filing,</b> but requiring plaintiffs to declare a proper home district whose choice-of-law rules would apply to their claims. Such an approach would both preserve the efficiency benefits of <b>direct</b> <b>filing,</b> and be consistent with the values of federalism and litigant autonomy underlying the choice-of-law framework in diversity cases...|$|R

40|$|The judge's {{ability to}} {{transfer}} a juvenile to adult court through judicial waiver {{has been in}} existence {{since the inception of}} the juvenile court in 1899. In response to increases in violent juvenile crime, state legislatures created and expanded juvenile transfer policies in the mid to late 1990 's. Although many of these policies have been in effect for almost 15 years, there is little empirical work examining how type of transfer can affect sentencing outcomes in adult court. This study examines three of the most common juvenile transfer mechanisms (judicial waiver, statutory exclusion, and <b>direct</b> <b>file)</b> and their sentencing outcomes using a large, multi-jurisdictional sample. Results from this study indicate that juveniles transferred through <b>direct</b> <b>file</b> have the highest likelihood of incarceration while youths transferred through statutory exclusion face the harshest incarcerative sanctions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 It is {{necessary}} to evaluate and compare the characteristics of various methods of accessing data-files in order to utilize economically both the hardware and the software (Space and Time) supported by the digital on-line system. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe and evaluate the structure and use of four conventional methods of file organization: Sequential File, Indexed Sequential File, Partitioned <b>File,</b> and <b>Direct</b> <b>File.</b> Special attention is given to the <b>Direct</b> <b>File,</b> which possesses the fastest accessing time. Five selected Hash Coding Techniques, each associated with three methods of handling redundant keys, are simulated and examined with the use of a selected data model of 1024 random United States names, and the resulting "average number of search per record retrieval" are compared with their corresponding theoretical values. As Hash 1 has offered the best results, it has been used to evaluate the organization of the <b>Direct</b> <b>File,</b> and to compare this organization with that of the other files. The CDC- 3300 system hardware parameter, control cycle time, the internal core storage, and the auxiliary storage parameters are introduced. From these values and the average number of searches per record retrieval, an expression of logical record file size, or loading factor is developed. The file size, or loading factor varies for different methods of file structure and accessing, (based upon the selected testing program). The system characteristics consisting of the average throughput per record retrieval, achievable-throughput-rate capability and user operating cost per call (unit cost) are evaluated and compared. The file system uses the full name of the record and a fixed length numerical key. Two common internal searches, Linear search and Binary search, are evaluated and compared as the preliminary work of this investigation, as shown in Appendix B...|$|R
