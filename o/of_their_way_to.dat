Johnson reported to William Henry Harrison, Territorial Governor of Indiana, then {{in command of the}} entire Northwest frontier. He was ordered to relieve Fort Wayne in the northeast of the Territory, which was already being attacked by the Indians. On September 18, 1812, Johnson's men reached Fort Wayne in time to save it, and turned back an Indian ambush.

5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series {{have said that the}} magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the Harry Potter novels go out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E

25|$|The Shiba is a {{relatively}} fastidious breed and feels {{the need to maintain}} itself in a clean state. They can often be seen licking their paws and legs, much like a cat.

Because of their fastidious and proud nature, Shiba puppies are easy to housebreak and in many cases will housebreak themselves.

25|$|New York State Route32A (NY32A) is a {{state highway}} in the Hudson Valley region of New York in the United States. It serves as a {{connector}} between NY32 {{in the town of}} Saugerties and NY23A in the town of Catskill. The road allows traffic from the Saugerties area, particularly from the New York State Thruway, to directly reach the interior of the Greene County portion of Catskill Park. The majority of traffic is tourism-oriented, from hikers in summer to skiers bound for Hunter Mountain in winter.

25|$|Additional {{research}} has shown that fusion could also be a strong predictor of group-directed helping behaviors. In some studies, individuals donated money to the group. In others, they provided social and emotional support to fellow group members. Other {{research has}} also suggested that strongly fused individuals are especially willing to go out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> protect the group and maintain its integrity. For instance, strongly fused employees {{were more likely to report}} having “blown the whistle” sometime during their employment. Presumably, such whistle-blowing activity was motivated by a conviction that their actions would ultimately benefit the group. Another study found that students who were strongly fused with their university were willing to whistle-blow against a cheating fellow student despite the cost of time, energy, and the possibility of retaliation from the cheater.|$|E
25|$|Returning home, {{he found}} western Pennsylvanians (mostly Scotch Irish) {{angry at the}} liquor tax imposed in 1791 by Congress at the demand of Alexander Hamilton {{to raise money to}} pay the {{national}} debt. Farmers could only export whiskey because transportation costs were too high for grain. Although Gallatin had opposed the tax before it was passed and attended numerous protest meetings, he counseled moderation. Nevertheless, the role he played in the Whiskey Rebellion in the early 1790s proved a lasting political liability, as President George Washington denounced the tax protesters, called out the militia, and marched {{at the head of the}} army for a portion <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> put down the rebellion.

25|$|When two of Liza's female {{teachers}} (who live together) go {{on vacation}} during spring break, she volunteers {{for the job of}} taking care of their home and feeding their cats. The two girls stay at the house together, but in an unexpected turn of events a Foster Academy administrator discovers Liza and Annie together. Liza is forced to tell her family about her relationship with Annie, and the headmistress of her school organizes a meeting of the school's board of trustees in order to expel Liza. The board rules in favor of Liza staying at Foster, and she is allowed to keep her position as student president. However, the two teachers, who in the process are discovered to be gay, are fired. After their initial shock at discovering the girls together, the teachers are very supportive and go out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reassure Liza not to worry about their dismissal, but a few ignorantly insensitive responses end up pushing Liza to leave Annie.|$|E

According to Phil Sandhop, the director of Mothers localization, {{in an interview with}} LostLevels.org, [...] "the Mother project and localizing it really opened up a few eyes at Nintendo.

Santer commented: [...] "One of the unique things about EastEnders is its ability to play stories over months and years.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the war, No.82 Squadron was {{selected}} to join the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. It re-equipped with North American P-51D Mustang fighters between 12September and 11January 1946, losing two aircraft to accidents in the process. The squadron deployed to Bofu, a former kamikaze base, during 13–18March 1946, once again as part of No.81 Wing with Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons; Nos.381 and 481 Squadrons provided logistics and maintenance support, respectively. No.82 Squadron lost three of its twenty-eight Mustangs, along with an escorting deHavilland Mosquito, in bad weather en route to Bofu, killing all crew members. From April 1946, the squadron conducted surveillance patrols over Japan as well as participating in routine exercises and flypasts.

500|$|While Carle Place was {{complaining}} about the inability to access their section of town, a January 1990 article in The New York Times mentioned that the Court's decision put Westbury alone against the state, then-Governor Mario Cuomo and regional planners, who were worried {{about the safety of}} the roughly 140,000 drivers who used the interchange daily. Local business leaders claimed that Westbury was being selfish in opposing inconvenient construction. Even after the ruling, Strada continued to claim that they wanted to be informed on the impacts of a nearby widening project on the Northern State. NYSDOT officials worried that this would add more bureaucratic levels to getting approval for local road projects and that it could set the project back three years. Officials also went out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> call this a simple [...] "not in my backyard" [...] case. NYSDOT continued to claim that the projects were separate, and filed three years apart, despite the court's ruling that they were similar projects. Cuomo, worried about the safety of drivers, invited Strada to come to Albany to meet with NYSDOT Commissioner Franklin White and State Senator Norman J. Levy to make an agreement. Strada, however, felt that in order to compromise, they would have to continue the original [...] "violation" [...] of not giving a report.|$|E
