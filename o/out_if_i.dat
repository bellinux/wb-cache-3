500|$|Bill Szymczyk's has {{frequently}} been noted as {{the sort of}} producer who pushes bands to expand their musical horizons; he has been brought in with the specific intent of changing a band's sound. He himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge, stating: [...] "I'm a professional listener. I listen and I react. I never was a musician, so I don't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table; I don't favour the guitar over the keyboard, and so forth. I just listen {{and try to figure}} <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have anything I can bring to a song." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Daniel Lanois became disoriented {{with the}} {{direction}} U2 took [...] "Acrobat" [...] during its recording. Bono noted [...] "Daniel had {{such a hard time}} on that... {{he was trying to get}} us to play to our strengths and I didn't want to. I wanted to play to our weaknesses. I wanted to experiment." [...] Bono noted that the end product [...] "doesn't quite get off the ground the way I'd hoped it would." [...] An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby. The mix, titled [...] "'Baby' Acrobat", contained lyrics that were later modified to a different perspective ("You know I'd hit <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> only knew who to hit" [...] instead of the final [...] "I know you'd hit out if you only knew who to hit") or scrapped entirely ("If the sky turns to purple and the moon turns to blood / Will you dig me out when I'm face down in the mud").|$|E
500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... and I thought he was a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> run into him again, we can have a good laugh about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E

500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Reznor {{successfully}} completed rehab, and eventually moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles. In a 2005 interview with Kerrang, he reflected on his self-destructive past: [...] "There was a persona that had run its course. I {{needed to get}} my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I {{took a couple of}} years off, just to figure out who I was and working <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened." [...] In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is [...] "pretty happy". Nine Inch Nails' next full-length album, With Teeth (2005), reached number one on the Billboard 200.|$|E
2500|$|One {{specific}} {{scene in}} the film perceived {{as an example of}} anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states [...] "His blood [...] on us and on our children!", a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack. When asked about this scene, Gibson said: [...] "I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after me at my house. They'd come to kill me." [...] In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, [...] "It's one little passage, and I believe it, but I don't and never have believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit {{that one of the reasons}} I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{the rebels}} {{had yet to}} {{completely}} surround Duchang, so Taishi Ci managed to sneak past the enemy at night and enter the fortress to meet Kong Rong. He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very difficult for you to break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I know what I am doing, and that I can help you. Now, everyone says it is impossible to break <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E

6000|$|... "To undo it, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can," [...] {{he replied}} quickly,--"a part of it, at any rate. I {{fell into a}} trap--Selingman and I. I've a way <b>out,</b> <b>if</b> there's time. <b>I</b> want your uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{could pick}} <b>out</b> tunes, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had any instrument, {{which could be}} made as handy to me as my lace-pillow. But I dare say I deceive myself. At all events, I shall never know." ...|$|R
6000|$|I had risen. [...] "I take it {{you have}} {{pressing}} business to speak of, since amid your latest political occupations you have been at pains to seek me <b>out.</b> <b>If</b> so, <b>I</b> will ask you to be brief." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That," [...] {{answered}} the man, [...] "I do not know. I've never dared to find <b>out.</b> For <b>if</b> <b>I</b> broke my frosting {{to see what}} I'm stuffed with, every one else would see too, and I would be disgraced and ruined." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should find}} <b>out</b> indirectly, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were you, {{how he is}} feeling," [...] the Marquis advised.
