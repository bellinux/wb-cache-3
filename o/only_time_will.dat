25|$|When Sandoz {{returns to}} Earth, {{his friends are}} dead, and his faith, once {{considered}} worthy of actual canonization by his superiors, is merely an extension of his bitter anger with the God who sent him to Rakhat. Due to relativistic space-time effects, decades had passed while he has been gone, during which popular outrage at the UN's initial and highly out-of-context report on the mission, and especially Sandoz's role in the tragedy, had left the Society of Jesus shattered and nearly extinct. As Sandoz painfully explains what really happened, his personal healing begins, but <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>will</b> prove whether {{the same is true}} of the Society of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the North African Sephardic dialect was, {{until the early}} 20th century, also highly conservative; its {{abundant}} Colloquial Arabic loan words retained most of the Arabic phonemes as functional components of a new, enriched Hispano-Semitic phonological system. During the Spanish colonial occupation of Northern Morocco (1912–1956), Ḥakitía was subjected to pervasive, massive influence from Modern Standard Spanish and most Moroccan Jews now speak a colloquial, Andalusian form of Spanish, with only an occasional use of the old language {{as a sign of}} in-group solidarity, somewhat as American Jews may now use an occasional Yiddishism in colloquial speech. Except for certain younger individuals, who continue to practice Ḥakitía as a matter of cultural pride, this splendid dialect, probably the most Arabized of the Romance languages apart from Mozarabic, has essentially ceased to exist. By contrast, Eastern Judeo-Spanish has fared somewhat better, especially in Israel, where newspapers, radio broadcasts, and elementary school and university programs strive to keep the language alive. But the old regional variations (i.e. Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey for instance) are already either extinct or doomed to extinction. <b>Only</b> <b>time</b> <b>will</b> tell whether Judeo-Spanish koiné, now evolving in Israel—similar to that which developed among Sephardic immigrants to the United States early in the 20th century will prevail and survive into the next generation.|$|E

500|$|Detecting {{a signal}} from Delta, which has taken the {{equivalent}} of 15 Earth years to reach them, the travellers are able to plot their position and lay in a course home. However, disaster strikes when Altares is caught in the gravity {{of a black hole}} that has formed from a collapsed star. The photon drive is unable to provide the faster-than-light speeds necessary to break free; nevertheless, Anna urges the crew not to give up hope, for she suspects that the object may be a gateway to another universe. Her theory is proven correct when, sustaining the various space-time distortions at the event horizon, Altares safely emerges from the black hole – intact, albeit with no way of returning to Earth. As the vessel and its intrepid crew approach a planet, the narrator concludes, [...] "One thing is sure – this is not the final word. Not the end, but the beginning. A new universe, a new hope? <b>Only</b> <b>time</b> <b>will</b> tell." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You're Mine (Eternal)" [...] {{garnered}} {{a generally}} positive response amongst music critics. Christina Garibaldi of MTV News was complimentary of the song, praising Carey's [...] "impressive" [...] vocal range and specifically {{drawing attention to}} the high note that she ends the song with. Garibaldi stated that [...] "You're Mine (Eternal)" [...] serves as a reminder as to why Carey is [...] "still the fiercest diva in the game". Writing for Billboard, Jason Lipshutz noted that the slow structure {{for the majority of}} the song could have made it a [...] "sleepy" [...] R song, but noted that the [...] "inevitable" [...] high note saves it from becoming so. Jamieson Cox of Time echoed Garibaldi's sentiments, writing [...] "It's a gaseous, fluffy ballad that feels like a direct descendant of the song that rang in her mid-career renaissance, 2005's mega-hit 'We Belong Together': plinking piano melodies, a typically fluttering Carey vocal take, and a very similar beat. <b>Only</b> <b>time</b> <b>will</b> tell if 'You're Mine (Eternal)' can duplicate that song's record-breaking success".|$|E

There are so many questions that we have about this show, and that is a good thing.

2500|$|In 2006 a {{post-mortem}} inquest {{into the}} death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0–2 micrograms per gram. Her death {{was caused by a}} form of early-onset beta amyloid angiopathy, a cerebro-vascular disease usually associated with Alzheimer's, which could be connected to the abnormally high level of aluminium in her brain.

50|$|Many legends {{surround}} Japanese swords, {{the most}} frequent being that the blades are folded an immense number of times, gaining magical properties in the meantime. While blades folded hundreds, thousands, or even millions of times are encountered in fiction, {{there is no record}} of real blades being folded more than around 20 times. With each fold made by the maker, every internal layer is also folded, and so the total number of layers in a sword blade is doubled at each fold; since the thickness of a katana blade is less than 230 iron atoms, going beyond 20 folds no longer adds meaningfully to the number of layers in the blade. Folding a blade <b>only</b> ten <b>times</b> <b>will</b> therefore create 1024 layers; 20 <b>times</b> <b>will</b> create 1,048,576 layers.|$|R
