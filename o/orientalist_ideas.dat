In the writings that exist, the hammam is often portrayed {{to be a place}} of sexual looseness, inhibition and mystery. These <b>Orientalist</b> <b>ideas</b> paint the Arab [...] "other" [...] as mystical and sensuous, lacking morality in comparison to their Western counterparts. [...] "Orientals" [...] were seen as backward and opposite to western rationality.|$|E

According to them, the campaign of My Stealthy Freedom is fuelling <b>Orientalist</b> <b>ideas,</b> comes to be perpetuated, decontextualized and manipulated by Western media propaganda of Iranophobia and Islamophobia. Researchers state that although movement focuses primarily on state gendered violence, its message has been disturbed by challenges arising from the embedded normativity of conceptualizations of gender and sexualities in relation to Middle Eastern women in general and Iranian women in particular.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the {{reactions to the}} ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) recent lift of the ban against the Islamic headscarf in the Turkish Parliament. The reactions by the oppositional party, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), were analysed through Norman Fairclough’s understanding of critical discourse analysis, which aims to illuminate unequal power relations created or recreated by the production of discursive practises, which is believed to ultimately affect social practises. The method of critical discourse analysis was accompanied by the feminist critique of orientalism, intended to assess how headscarved women are stereotyped and homogenised through <b>orientalist</b> <b>ideas.</b> The analysis resulted in {{an understanding of the}} complex power relations between the ruling party and the main oppositional party, as well as the effect of using <b>orientalist</b> <b>ideas</b> in discourse, possibility contributing to an increasingly extensive polarisation and, thus, the risk of increased conflicts between the secular groups and the more religiously observant groups in the Turkish society...|$|E

Why do the {{statements}} about Tibet made by American, Chinese, and foreign organizations often {{appear to be}} quite different from and sometimes in contradiction to each other? This research focuses on how Tibet has been framed by different parties in their discourse. It examines how these parties discuss and portray Old Tibet (prior to the Chinese invasion) and Contemporary Tibet. With regard to Old Tibet I consider how <b>Orientalist</b> <b>ideas</b> have influenced and shaped the discourse on Tibet; with regard to Contemporary Tibet, two processes which influence the discourse on Tibet are discussed, namely, the commodification and the politicization of Tibet...|$|E

Since the 1970 s Egypt has been the center of Islamic social activism, which has created a more religious society among the Egyptian people but has created a “seculareligious” state. This new form of political interaction with religious life in Egypt {{is the result of the}} country’s history with Colonialism and how <b>orientalist</b> <b>ideas</b> toward Islam and its relationship to democracy, have defined the county’s current political system. This culminates with the revolution in January 2011 with the elimination of the old democracy in attempt to form an Islamic democracy...|$|E
40|$|V. S. Naipaul, the Nobel laureate’s two Islamic travelogues have {{continued}} to create controversies even {{after more than a}} decade of the publication of the second one Beyond Belief in late nineties. They have been considered prophetic of the events of 9 / 11 by a certain section of the academia. This has obfuscated the serious lack of sophistication, an understanding of cultural nuances and differences as well as a certain kind of empathy for the subjects of any “study”, provided one believes that millions of people can be understood just by travelling through their countries. Naipaul, in his Among the Believers and Beyond Belief seems to lack these things. But his superb narrative skills as a novelist as well as an atmosphere vitiated by the events of and consequent upon 9 / 11 have given these two travelogues canonical status as anthropologically nuanced observations. Our contention to the contrary is that these two books are plagued by limitation of vision, <b>orientalist</b> <b>ideas,</b> Islamophobia, prejudice and misconceptions...|$|E
40|$|Following the September 11, 2001 {{attacks on}} the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, there was a {{noticeable}} proliferation of rhetoric advocating for the invasion of Afghanistan, with much of this rhetoric focused on saving Afghan women from the Taliban. My critique of this rhetoric {{is based on a}} theoretical background that interrogates the use of racist, colonialist, and <b>Orientalist</b> <b>ideas</b> about Afghanistan, and calls into question the notion of the helpless Afghan woman in need of rescue by U. S. and Western military force. The narrative of the need for U. S. intervention in Afghanistan to save Afghan women from the Taliban was often evident in the news broadcasts of Fox News and CNN, both in terms of language used and in the televisual presentation of information. This narrative was also evident among many Western feminists, especially hegemonic liberal feminist organizations in the U. S. At the same time, there was significant resistance among many other feminists {{to the use of the}} idea of the helpless Afghan woman to justify the war on Afghanistan...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} and {{describe}} the images of China in the Western tourist material. There is much literature talking about images of China; however, among the existing scholarship so far few have investigated from the angle as we do. We use social constructivism and representation as main theories and combined with central concepts of the tourist gaze, stereotypes and the other, and post-colonialism and orientalism. Moreover, we conduct a case study by applying qualitative discourse analysis {{in order to find}} out the stereotypes and <b>orientalist</b> <b>ideas</b> of China depicted in the tourist material. The findings show that in the perspective of western tourist material, China is representative of the Orient. The analysis also concludes that China is seen as a country with 5, 000 -year civilization whose people have lots of virtues; a developing economic power; a not so democratic socialist country; a potential threat and a global actor with increasing influences. Our thesis contributes to the existing literature on China research and tourism research—marketing and political implications for its national image improvement and tourism development...|$|E
40|$|Western {{thoughts}} have discredited Islamic teaching. Orientalism never {{gives up}} in spreading issues in relation with their objectives in distancing Muslim from Islam. The idea of orientalism becomes {{a point of}} discussion that appears as opposition of Islam in many ways. Unfortunately, {{this kind of situation}} has not been realized by most Muslim in Indonesia that is contemporarily bothered by their debated teaching of Islam which comes from <b>orientalist</b> <b>ideas</b> in order to disintegrate Islam. For instance, is the orientalism in Indonesia. The history of orientalism in Indonesia becomes unforgettable part of Indonesia colonialism. It was known that the orientalist activities have supplied many objectives for the colonialism, especially in Aceh Darussalam. Hurgronje analyzed and observed that the struggle from the Acehness will be suppressed by the politics of split within the local leader between Ulama (religious leader) and Uleebalang (formal leader). This paper aims to explore the activities of Christian Snouck Hurgronje in relation with his effort in helping colonial to disintegrate Indonesia people. His mission is to crack the principal sources of Islam: Qur’an and Hadith by pretending to be a Muslim and went to Mecca for learning Islam. But his affiliation to Islam is only a mask to cover his actual purposes as a missionary...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedSince the early 20 th century, persons across the Muslim world {{have attempted to}} move their society toward a more religious Islamic path. They have attempted to form political parties and participate in elections, only to be marginalized and repressed. Some have reacted violently, carrying out attacks against government officials and other targets. Typically a cycle of violence, repression and political exclusion transpires. Democratic reform is not uncomplicated. Both practical considerations and moral ones demand changes in the policies of both the United States and Egypt. The Egyptian government's electoral engineering and interference does not go unnoticed by the world and undermines {{the legitimacy of the}} government to its own citizens and the world community alike. Co-opting moderate Islamists may seem threatening to President Mubarak as well as to Western countries, whose public continues to embrace <b>Orientalist</b> <b>ideas.</b> This study maintains that when moderate Islamists are allowed to participate in politics, they will restrain their stances regarding strict interpretations of Islam, as have the New Islamists in Egypt. The alternative is the status quo, which aside from being immoral in terms of personal liberty is also not workable for those desiring stability in the Middle East.

40|$|This article {{studies the}} Orientalist and Feminist discourses that {{underlay}} Ellen M. Rogers’s A Winter in Algeria: 1863 - 4 (1865). Her conception of Algeria reproduces the Victorian imperialist {{attitude toward the}} Algerian as inferior to the European in order to celebrate British imperial power. Underneath this colonial discourse, the writer proclaims her feminist {{point of view about}} empire and juxtaposes feminist attitudes in Victorian Britain with the degraded condition of the Oriental woman. To contribute to Victorian feminist struggle for gender equality, she identifies with the suffering of Muslim Algerian women under male domination and compares their confinement to the harem and their veiling to Victorian “separate spheres” ideology. From this perspective, Rogers presents the profiles of the Orientalist as defined by Edward Said (1978) and the feminist as defined by Antoinette Burton (1994). Said limits his discussion of Orientalism to male writers and travelers who construct imperialist views about the colonial world and its people. However, Burton argues that many Victorian travel writers were women who not only circulated <b>Orientalist</b> <b>ideas</b> but also constructed a feminist discourse. Women writers found in the colonial world ways to cross the boundaries of gender and power in order to criticize male writers who insisted on women’s inferior status. In sum, the major claim made in this article is that Ellen M. Rogers projects a feminist-Orientalist view in her travel account about French Algeria...|$|E
40|$|With {{the release}} of her debut solo album, 2004 's Love. Angel. Music. Baby., No-Doubt front-woman Gwen Stefani turned to the street fashions of Tokyo's Harajuku {{district}} for her inspiration. The platinum-blonde Stefani promoted herself by being constantly surrounded with an entourage of four voiceless Asian women, dubbed her "Harajuku Girls". They were on her CD cover, she dedicated a track to them, they performed in her videos, and they danced on her Harajuku Lovers live tour. Stefani even re-named them, "Love", "Angel", "Music", and "Baby" after her new record and clothing line, L. A. M. B. The Harajuku Girls function as Stefani's human accessories [...] silent, sexed-up, submissive, school-girl muses sent to save her from her dull whiteness. I introduce Stefani as an intertextual celebrity who appropriates, absorbs and crossreferences cultural texts and ethnicities in order to market and brand herself as a distinct entity in the worlds of music and fashion [...] all while resisting any static signification or "authentic" identity. This thesis questions: (1) how Stefani has appropriated Harajuku culture in ways that reinforce <b>Orientalist</b> <b>ideas</b> of Asian women; (2) how Stefani has used Harajuku culture in order to reinforce her whiteness and distinguish herself as a distinct celebrity brand; (3) if Stefani's representations reveal the performative nature of ethnicity and destabilize essentialist ideas of authenticity; (4) how we may compare the transcultural differences between Harajuku appropriation of American culture and Stefani's appropriation of it; and (5) what the political and cultural implications of Stefani's ethnic signifiers may be...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 14 January 2014 Examining Board: Professor Sebastian Conrad, EUI; Professor Antonella Romano, EUI; Doctor David Washbrook, Cambridge University; Doctor Pratik Chakrabarti, Kent University. The Asiatic Society of Bengal {{was founded}} by Sir William Jones in Calcutta (nowadays Kolkata) in 1784. It is a learned society which was to carry {{investigation}} which bounds would be the geographical limits of Asia and within these limits (…) whatever is performed by Man and produced by Nature. It was thus instituted in order to inquiring into the history and antiquities, the arts, sciences, and literature of Asia. Initially a rather selective circle of British scholars, the Society elected Indians to membership from 1829 onwards and elected an Indian as its president, Rajendralal Mitra, in 1885. Two hundred years later, the Government of (independent) India granted the Society the status of National Institution. This thesis focuses on Indian presence at, and contribution to, the Asiatic Society of Bengal between 1829 and 1885 to discuss and address the main positions in the debates {{on the relationship between}} knowledge and power in colonial contexts since the publication of the book Orientalism by Edward W. Said. Doing so, it argues that, if Indians collaborated to craft orientalist notions and discourses about India's history and culture, they did so with an agenda of their own. Thus, they appropriated and transformed <b>orientalist</b> <b>ideas,</b> knowledge and applications and which gradually infused it into an ideological framework articulating discourses on Indian national identity, socio-ritual hierarchies and the nation's place in the 'modern world'. Finally, this dissertation seeks to explore the limits of this framework, and its incapacities to integrate the diversity and variety of communities that contributed to form India...|$|E
40|$|The {{second half}} of the nineteenth century saw the blossoming of a new Jewish {{literature}} in France: quasi-ethnographic material written by Paris Jews of Alsatian origin about their former region. Students of Alsatian Jews have so far tended to treat those texts as primary sources on Alsatian-Jewish folklore, ignoring the viewpoints that went into that representation and turned it into a self-representation. The purpose of this dissertation is to fill this need for a critical, thorough analysis of these Alsatian-Jewish texts, thus casting a new light on Jewish life in France during that period. My primary sources are Daniel Stauben's (pseudonym for Auguste Widal) book Scenes de la vie juive en Alsace (1860), a slightly different version of which was originally published in periodical form in Archives Israelites, and Leon Cahun's La vie juive, illustrated by Alphonse Levy (1886). My authors' status as natives who have become strangers is at the heart of their representation of Alsatian Jews. It is also at the crux of the tension I examine in the dissertation. The authors' sense of loss and nostalgia that is at the very basis of their representation of Alsatian-Jewish life conflicts with their feeling of superiority to their former neighbors. This feeling, in turn, is caused by the new identity they have acquired through their transformation from Alsatian Jews into Parisian Israelites. In these works, the authors become a counter-image to Alsatian Jews, while being suffused with expressions of nostalgia. Using an approach that combines literary, anthropological and historical perspectives, I examine Stauben and Cahun as representatives of that new literature. It is my contention that the use of contemporary <b>Orientalist</b> <b>ideas</b> and literary references, by Stauben, and the adoption of French standards, by Cahun, in their representation of Alsatian Jews demonstrates a distancing from Alsatian-Jewish life that cannot be dissociated from the feeling of loss experienced by Jews who were at the threshold of the modern world. I argue that the texts examined have a much larger scope than has hitherto been thought. As a representation not just of Alsatian Jews, but of their authors as well, they offer a fresh look at the predicament of the Jew entering modernity. By focusing on the relation between these authors and Alsatian Jews, this dissertation casts a new light on the position of the recently-emancipated Jewish minority in French society and therefore on the process of creation of the modern French nation that took place in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Finally, they demonstrate the necessary reciprocity between "ethnographer" and "object of study. "Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Columbia University, 1996. School code: 0054...|$|E
