5|$|In 324, Constantine I chose Byzantium {{to be the}} {{new capital}} of the Roman Empire, {{renaming}} it New Rome. Following the death of Theodosius I in 395 and the permanent division of the Roman Empire between his two sons, the city, which would popularly {{come to be known as}} Constantinople, became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. This empire, which would later be branded by historians as the Byzantine Empire, ruled most of the territory of present-day Turkey until the Late Middle Ages; although the eastern regions remained in firm Sasanian hands up to the first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> century. The frequent Byzantine-Sassanid Wars, as part of the centuries long-lasting Roman-Persian Wars, fought between the neighbouring rivalling Byzantines and Sasanians, took place in various parts of present-day Turkey and decided much of the latter's history from the fourth century up to the first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> century.|$|E
