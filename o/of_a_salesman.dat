5|$|In {{the spring}} of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance, {{starring}} as Willy Loman in a Broadway revival of Death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman.</b> Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre's history. Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, was too young {{for the role of}} 62-year-old Loman, and Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune felt that the character had been interpreted poorly. Hoffman admitted that he found the role difficult, but he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{appeared}} in 55 films and one miniseries during his screen career spanning 22 years.

He also received five Golden Globe Award nominations (winning one), five BAFTA Award nominations (winning one), four Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning one), {{and won the}} Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival.

5|$|In 1963, Wilder {{was cast}} in {{a leading role in}} Mother Courage and Her Children, a {{production}} starring Anne Bancroft, who introduced Wilder to her boyfriend (and later husband) Mel Brooks. A few months later, Brooks mentioned that he was working on a screenplay called Springtime for Hitler, for which he thought Wilder would be perfect in the role of Leo Bloom. Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments. Months went by, and Wilder toured the country with different theatre productions, participated in a televised CBS presentation of Death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman,</b> and was cast for his first role in a film—a minor role in Arthur Penn's 1967 Bonnie and Clyde. After three years of not hearing from Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1968's The Producers.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Asher Miller (October 17, 1915– February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist, {{and figure}} in twentieth-century American theater. Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), Death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman</b> (1949), The Crucible (1953) and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956). He also wrote several screenplays and was most noted {{for his work}} on The Misfits (1961). The drama Death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman</b> has been {{numbered}} on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside Long Day's Journey into Night and A Streetcar Named Desire.|$|E
25|$|In Death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman</b> – {{originally}} entitled “The Inside of His Head” – Miller brilliantly {{solves the}} problem of revealing his main character's inner discord, rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself. Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play, which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. Death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman</b> seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{works have}} {{indicated}} {{the relationships between}} polynomially solvable combinatorial optimization problems and the core non-emptiness of cooperative games associated with them, and between intractable combinatorial optimization problems and the hardness of the problem to decide the core non-emptiness of the associated games. In this paper, we study the core <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traveling <b>salesman</b> game, which {{is associated with the}} traveling salesman problem. First, we show that in general the problem to test the core non-emptiness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given traveling <b>salesman</b> game is NP-hard. This corresponds to the NP-hardness of the traveling salesman problem. Second, we show that the core <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traveling <b>salesman</b> game is non-empty if the distance matrix is a symmetric Monge matrix, and also that <b>a</b> traveling <b>salesman</b> game is submodular (or concave) if the distance matrix is a Kalmanson matrix. These correspond {{to the fact that the}} Monge property and the Kalmanson property are polynomially solvable special cases of the traveling salesman problem...|$|R

25|$|In 1948, Miller built a small {{studio in}} Roxbury, Connecticut.

Death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Salesman</b> premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949, at the Morosco Theatre, directed by Elia Kazan, and starring Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman, Mildred Dunnock as Linda, Arthur Kennedy as Biff, and Cameron Mitchell as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a Tony Award for Best Author, the New York Drama Circle Critics' Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.
