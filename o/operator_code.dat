40|$|Codeword {{stabilized}} quantum codes {{provide a}} unified approach to constructing quantum error-correcting codes, including both additive and non-additive quantum codes. Standard codeword stabilized quantum codes encode quantum information into subspaces. The more general notion of encoding quantum information into a subsystem {{is known as}} an operator (or subsystem) quantum error correcting <b>code.</b> Most <b>operator</b> <b>codes</b> studied to date are based in the usual stabilizer formalism. We introduce <b>operator</b> quantum <b>codes</b> based on the codeword stabilized quantum code framework. Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for operator quantum error correction, we derive a error correction condition for operator codeword stabilized quantum codes. Based on this condition, the word operators of a operator codeword stabilized quantum code are constructed from a set of classical binary errors induced by generators of the gauge group. We use this scheme to construct examples of both additive and non-additive codes that encode quantum information into a subsystem. Comment: 6 pages, submitted to PR...|$|R

For instance, the New York City information operator was 212-131. If the customer knew the number, and the point was direct-dialable, the operator would dial the call.

Other major networks are DNA Finland (using then 041, 044 and other numbers in the 045 range) and Saunalahti (using numbers in the 045 range).

40|$|Mobile devices running {{context-aware}} {{applications are}} in need of data sources delivering context information. We envision that context information data sources will be offered by third-party providers, and will likely be distributed across the Internet. Context information providers will prefer to use small and simple databases that do not require complex data modeling, configuration, and administration. Context-aware applications require that database systems be able to run applicationspecific queries, often involving tailored operators. Unfortunately, it is impractical to manually deploy the tailored operators of each application on the necessary remote data sources. A solution to this problem is to have applications dynamically move query <b>operator</b> <b>code</b> to the remote database sites, as described in [1]. In this paper we briefly describe an architecture for delivering context information to wireless mobile devices from data sources on the Internet. The architecture is based on code mobility and the conceptually simple tuple space technology.

40|$|Wired array {{studies are}} being {{conducted}} at the SNL Z accelerator to maximize the x-ray generation for inertial confinement fusion targets and high energy density physics experiments. An integral component of these studies is the characterization of the time-resolved spectral content of the x-rays. Due to potential spatial anisotropy in the emitted radiation, it is also critical to diagnose the time-evolved spectral content in a space-resolved manner. To accomplish these two measurement goals, we developed an x-ray spectrometer using a set of high-speed detectors (silicon PIN diodes) with a collimated field-of-view that converged on a 1 -cm-diameter spot at the pinch axis. Spectral discrimination is achieved by placing high Z absorbers in front of these detectors. We built two spectrometers to permit simultaneous different angular views of the emitted radiation. Spectral data have been acquired from recent Z shots for the radial and polar views. UNSPEC 1 has been adapted to analyze and unfold the measured data to reconstruct the x-ray spectrum. The unfold <b>operator</b> <b>code,</b> UFO 2, is being adapted for a more comprehensive spectral unfolding treatment...|$|E
40|$|Spectral {{unfolding}} is {{an inverse}} mathematical operation which attempts to obtain spectral source {{information from a}} set of tabulated response functions and data measurements. Several unfold algorithms have appeared over the past 30 years; {{among them is the}} UFO (UnFold <b>Operator)</b> <b>code.</b> In addition to an unfolded spectrum, UFO also estimates the unfold uncertainty (error) induced by running the code in a Monte Carlo fashion with prescribed data distributions (Gaussian deviates). In the problem studied, data were simulated from an arbitrarily chosen blackbody spectrum (10 keV) and a set of overlapping response functions. The data were assumed to have an imprecision of 5 % (standard deviation). 100 random data sets were generated. The built-in estimate of unfold uncertainty agreed with the Monte Carlo estimate to within the statistical resolution of this relatively small sample size (95 % confidence level). A possible 10 % bias between the two methods was unresolved. The Monte Carlo technique is also useful in underdetemined problems, for which the error matrix method does not apply. UFO has been applied to the diagnosis of low energy x rays emitted by Z-Pinch and ion-beam driven hohlraums...|$|E
