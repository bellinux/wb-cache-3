METHODS: we examined 52 percutaneous liver biopsies of 50 HIV-infected {{patients who had}} {{at least two of}} the following conditions: fever of unknown origin, unexplained severe emaciation, hepatomegaly or abnormal liver chemistry. The specimens were cultured for mycobacteria and fungi and stained by standard procedures. RESULTS: reactive patterns, granulomatous hepatitis and chronic active hepatitis were verified in 28 (54 %), 11 (21 %) and 8 (15 %) of the patients respectively. Opportunistic infections were diagnosed in 18 (36 %) patients: mycobacteria in 12 (24 %), Cryptococcus neoformans in 5 (10 %) patients and mycobacteria and yeast was isolated from the same liver fragment in one patient.

40|$|My project tests viral {{quantities}} in M. S. {{patients at}} different times of remission and relapse using quantitative Real-time PCR. There is current debate among scientists on the role of Human Herpes Virus 6 in association with Multiple Sclerosis. Some researchers believe that the virus plays a role in co-triggering the disease, while others believe that the virus is solely an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>agent.</b> Still other scientists believe that there is no connection at all. Therefore, by testing viral quantities at different stages of the disease, I am able to investigate these current theories. My hypothesis is that if the virus plays a role in the etiology of the disease, there will be an increase of virus before relapse. However, if the virus is an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>agent,</b> there will be a viral increase after relapse. Or it might show no correlation between the two. To test this possible association between Human Herpes Virus 6 and Multiple Sclerosis, I drew blood samples from M. S. patients over the course of two months.
