40|$|MasterIn recent years, {{automated}} inspection {{systems have}} become widely {{used to create}} high-quality products and achieve high productivity in various industries. The detection of defects on steel surfaces {{is an important component}} of the steel making process to control the quality of steel products. However, detection of defects in steel slab is still carried out by human inspection. This thesis proposed an algorithm to detect defects such as edge defects and oscillation marks in slab through the use of image processing. The surface of a slab is partially covered with scales composed of <b>oxidized</b> <b>substance.</b> Because these scales can be visually similar to defects, and because the surface features of slab images vary under different lighting conditions, defect detection can be difficult. To minimize the influence of scales and to improve the accuracy of detection, a new detection method is proposed. The edge defects are extracted by vertical projection profile and canny edge detection. Also, the reconstructed images by discrete wavelet transform are used for defect detection of oscillation mark. Finally, the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm...|$|E

We have proposed to use a neutral and less harmful electrolyte, NaNO 3 aqueous solution to fabricate tungsten-carbide (WC) alloy micro-pins with ECM. The workpiece rotation and ultrasonic flushing were adopted during processing {{in order to obtain}} a higher machining accuracy and removal rate. However, it was found that oxidized substances adhered to the pin surface, which decreased the removal rate and machining accuracy. In order to reduce the <b>oxidized</b> <b>substance</b> adhesion to the WC alloy surface under the NaNO 3 aqueous solution condition, bipolar pulses was then used, since {{it has been reported that}} a negative current has the effect to generate NaOH which can dissolve the oxide. Experiments were carried out by changing the pulse condition to investigate the influence of the positive and negative pulse width on the machining characteristics. The results show that a micro-pin with the diameter about 20 μm was obtained in a very short time of 2. 5 min. It is also found that using the bipolar pulse power supply is an effective way to reduce the adhesion of oxidized substances to the pin surface, and there exists an optimized pulse period for the micro-pin fabrication...|$|E

30|$|Straight {{fertilizers}} {{are very}} {{convenient to use}} when a farm is equipped with proper facilities. However, the preparation and use of these facilities {{requires a lot of}} money. In addition, nutrient fertilizers, which are compounds of inorganic ions, form sediments by ionic reaction when dissolved in water, and these sediments cause damage to plant growth and yield. Therefore, we developed a better fertilizer, which is no different in mineral composition than conventional fertilizer, by simply mixing conventional fertilizer with vitamin C. Vitamin C is the richest water-soluble <b>oxidized</b> <b>substance</b> in plant cells, and has ability to chelate and bond with minerals due to the –OH group it contains. The vitamin C-substrate straight fertilizer developed here, AGH-Ringer, has chelated minerals that easily move from root to leaves and had no sedimentation even when stored a long time after it was dissolved (Tables  1, 2, Fig.  1). Therefore, when lettuce was cultivated with this fertilizer, plant growth was enhanced by the minerals chelated with vitamin C (Table  3). It was also demonstrated that its mineral bioavailability and absorption are superior to conventional fertilizers (Tables  4, 6). For these reasons, there was an increase in crop yield (Table  5). Based on these results, AGH-Ringer is expected to increase famers’ profits by increasing the yield of high-quality crops and convenience of use.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent Legionella contamination, several methods have been {{developed}} with which the bacteria can be killed in (tap) water. The most common method is thermal disinfection, with which the bacteria are killed through heating. Other methods use different techniques to kill Legionella, {{such as the use}} of UV-light, copper-silver ionisation or <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substances.</b> In this literature study, the specific biological mechanisms behind several methods of Legionella control were studied. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages in effectiveness. Of course, all methods also have advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, utility, safety and so on, but these are only marginally referred to in this research. UV-light only has an effect on the DNA of the micro-organism: the DNA is damaged and becomes dysfunctional, due to which the Legionella bacteria die. When using UV-light, it is of importance that the dosage and duration of the radiation is sufficient. With a short exposure, a high intensity is needed to provide enough energy. The dosage emitted by the UV-lamp can moreover damage only a limited amount of DNA. If the Legionella are located in protozoa that have a large amount of DNA (in the nucleus as well as the mitochondria), possibly less damage is done to the DNA of the Legionella bacteria. Copper-silver ionisation is a cheap method and an effective way of killing Legionella. However, as with UV-light, the Legionella bacteria can be protected by the protozoa and/or a biofilm. Another disadvantage is that the use of heavy metals in waterworks brings with it risks for public health. Besides above mentioned methods, there are <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substances</b> that can kill off Legionella. Of these, chlorine is especially suitable in preventing the spread of Legionella, as a supplement to other methods. Disinfection with ozone is more effective, but has the disadvantage that ozone is quickly deactivated in water. Peroxides are also used extensively in waterworks disinfection. Similar to UV-light and copper-silver ionisation, the <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substances</b> must penetrate the protozoa that harbour the Legionella for a proper disinfection. Whether these methods of disinfection have a sufficiently lethal effect on Legionella is not yet known. With thermal disinfection, Legionella bacteria that have infected the protozoa are also reached, as well as the Legionella bacteria located in a biofilm. The temperature increases without as well as within the protozoa, and leads to damage to the Legionella bacteria present. A second point that supports thermal disinfection methods is that, through heating, multiple parts of the cell are destroyed. The chance that Legionella survives this combination of factors is in this way reduced to a minimum...|$|R

40|$|Dedicated to Prof Dr. Dr. Ernst Schütte on the {{occasion}} of his 70 th birthday Summary: The oxalate content of urine is determined by means of oxalate oxidase and simple pH measurement. The enzyme specifically decarboxylates oxalate, producing two moles CO 2 per mole oxalate. The CO 2 diffuses into an alkaline buffer solution (Hallson, P. C. & Rose, G. A. (1974), Clin. Chim. Acta 55, 29 - 39) in the closed reaction vessel, and reduces the pH value, which is measured with an electrode. Only 125 native urine is required to measure oxalate concentrations in the range of 80 / to 1. 6 mmol/ 1 (corresponding to 7 to 144 mg anhydrous oxalic acid per liter). The limit of detection is 10 nmol oxalate, and the accuracy is 101 % with a coefficient of variation of 6 %. The method described is insensitive to various interfering factors, such as reducing and <b>oxidizing</b> <b>substances,</b> cloudy or colored samples.

These studies do not support a {{considerable}} decrease in the incidence of the common cold with supplemental vitamin C. However, vitamin C has consistently decreased the duration of cold episodes and the severity of symptoms.

The biochemical explanation for the benefits may be based on the antioxidant property of vitamin C. In an infection, phagocytic leucocytes become activated and they produce oxidizing compounds which are released from the cell. By reacting with these oxidants, vitamin C may decrease the inflammatory effects caused by them.
