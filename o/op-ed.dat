40|$|SummaryObjectiveAn age-related {{decline in}} {{chondrocyte}} production of osteogenic protein- 1 (<b>OP-</b> 1) (Bone Morphogenetic Protein- 7) {{may contribute to}} cartilage loss in osteoarthritis. This {{study was designed to}} determine if increased methylation of the <b>OP-</b> 1 promoter might serve as a mechanism for the age-related decline in <b>OP-</b> 1 expression. MethodsHuman articular chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage obtained after death from tissue donors (ages 19 – 86 years) without a known history of arthritis. DNA was obtained from isolated chondrocytes in primary culture and analyzed for <b>OP-</b> 1 promoter methylation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after bisulfite treatment. Cultured cells were treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5 -azacytidine and <b>OP-</b> 1 production was measured in the media by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RNA was isolated to measure expression of insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), the IGF- 1 receptor (IGF- 1 R), aggrecan, and <b>OP-</b> 1 by real-time PCR. ResultsMethylation of the <b>OP-</b> 1 promoter was detected in chondrocytes isolated from tissue obtained from older adults and there was a positive correlation between age and <b>OP-</b> 1 methylation status (n= 22, R 2 = 0. 277, P= 0. 014). Inhibition of methylation in cultured cells with 5 -azacytidine increased chondrocyte production of <b>OP-</b> 1 protein and increased the expression of the IGF- 1, the IGF- 1 R, aggrecan, and <b>OP-</b> 1 genes but not GAPDH. ConclusionAge-related methylation of the <b>OP-</b> 1 promoter may contribute to a decrease in <b>OP-</b> 1 production in cartilage and a decrease in expression of <b>OP-</b> 1 responsive genes such as IGF- 1, the IGF- 1 R, and aggrecan...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Postero-lateral lumbar fusion in {{a rabbit}} model was {{performed}} to compare the bone induction potential of autograft, insoluble bone gelatin (ISBG), osteogenic protein- 1 (<b>OP-</b> 1), and the combination of ISBG and <b>OP-</b> 1. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of ISBG as a carrier/enhancer for <b>OP-</b> 1 in a rabbit spinal fusion model. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: <b>OP-</b> 1 or recombinant human BMP- 7 {{has been shown to}} be effective in inducing new bone formation in surgical applications such as spinal arthrodesis. However, the lack of an ideal carrier contributes to its associated comorbidities (e. g., uncontrolled bone growth, local inflammatory over-response, nonfusion) and limits its use clinically. METHODS: Adult New Zealand white rabbits (n = 32) underwent bilateral lumbar intertransverse process fusion procedures at L 5 to L 6 and were randomized to receive: (1) autograft; (2) ISBG; (3) <b>OP-</b> 1; or (4) ISBG in combination with <b>OP-</b> 1 (ISBG + <b>OP-</b> 1). Spinal fusion masses were evaluated by manual palpation, biomechanical testing, radiographic assessment, microcomputer tomography scanning and histologic examination at 6 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: Treatment of ISBG + <b>OP-</b> 1 resulted in higher spinal fusion rates (7 of 7, 100 %) than that of autograft (3 of 7, 43 %), ISBG (2 of 8, 25 %), and <b>OP-</b> 1 (2 of 7, 29 %) based on manual palpation (P > 0. 01). Greater fusion rates in the ISBG + <b>OP-</b> 1 group were also evidenced by radiographic examination (P > 0. 01), microcomputer tomography bone volume analysis (P > 0. 01), and biomechanical testing (P > 0. 05). Histologic assessment demonstrated that treatment of ISBG + <b>OP-</b> 1 induces new contiguous bone formation in the interval between the transverse processes which was absent in the other groups. CONCLUSION: In this study, ISBG + <b>OP-</b> 1 resulted in more effective lumbar intertransverse process fusion than autograft, <b>OP-</b> 1 putty or ISBG alone. ISBG is capable of enhancing <b>OP-</b> 1 -induced bone formation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractArticular {{cartilage}} has a poor reparative capacity. This {{feature is}} exacerbated with aging and during degenerative joint conditions, contributing to loss of motion and impairment {{of quality of}} life. This study focused on osteogenic protein- 1 (<b>OP-</b> 1) {{and its ability to}} serve as a repair-stimulating factor in articular cartilage. The purpose of this work was to develop a quantitative method for the assessment of the content of <b>OP-</b> 1 protein in extracts from human articular cartilage and to investigate the changes in <b>OP-</b> 1 mRNA expression and protein levels with aging of normal adult cartilage. Full thickness cartilage was dissected from femoral condyles of donors with no history of joint disease within 24 h of death. Levels of <b>OP-</b> 1 mRNA expression were measured by a semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method; concentration of <b>OP-</b> 1 protein was detected by new sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); qualitative changes in <b>OP-</b> 1 forms were evaluated by Western blots with various anti-OP- 1 antibodies. The sensitivity of the ELISA method allowed the detection of picogram quantities of <b>OP-</b> 1 in cartilage extracts. We found that (1) concentration of <b>OP-</b> 1 in normal cartilage is within the range of biological activity of <b>OP-</b> 1 in vitro; and (2) during aging of human adult, articular cartilage, levels of <b>OP-</b> 1 protein and message are dramatically reduced (more than 4 -fold; p< 0. 02). The major qualitative changes affected primarily mature <b>OP-</b> 1. The results of the current study suggest the possibility that <b>OP-</b> 1 may be critical for chondrocytes to maintain their normal homeostasis and could also serve as a repair factor during joint disease or aging...|$|R

40|$|Characterization of receptors for osteogenic protein- 1 /bone {{morphogenetic}} protein- 7 (<b>OP-</b> 1 /BMP- 7) in rat kidneys. BackgroundOsteogenic protein- 1 /bone morphogenetic protein- 7 (<b>OP-</b> 1 /BMP- 7), {{a member}} of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, has been shown to prevent kidney damage from ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. The molecular events involved in <b>OP-</b> 1 action on kidney are not yet understood. MethodsIn this study, we evaluated the biodistribution of 125 I-labeled <b>OP-</b> 1 in rat kidneys. Adult rats received a single intravenous injection of 250 μg 125 I-labeled <b>OP-</b> 1 per kg body wt, a dose that was effective in protecting kidneys from ischemic injury. Tissue localization, in situ hybridization, and immunostaining with a specific receptor antibody were performed to identify <b>OP-</b> 1 cellular targets. Also, isolated plasma membranes from kidney cortex and medulla regions were analyzed to identify and characterize receptor structural components that recognize <b>OP-</b> 1. ResultsAt 10 and 180 minutes following injection, the relative uptake of 125 I-labeled <b>OP-</b> 1 was consistently higher in kidney cortex than in medulla region. Upon autoradiography, kidney tissue sections revealed that <b>OP-</b> 1 bound to the convoluted tubule epithelium, glomeruli, and collecting ducts. Moreover, in situ hybridization and immunostaining methods have shown localization of mRNA transcripts and the protein for BMP receptor type II in the cortex and medulla in similar areas as 125 I-labeled <b>OP-</b> 1. Bulk membranes (enriched with plasma membranes) isolated from the cortex and medulla regions of kidney each bound specifically to 125 I-OP- 1, and the binding of 125 I-labeled <b>OP-</b> 1 was inhibited by unlabeled <b>OP-</b> 1 in a dose-dependent manner. However, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, insulin-like growth factor, fibroblast growth factors, and other members of BMP family such as BMP- 2 and cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein- 1 /growth and differentiation factor- 5 (CDMP- 1 /GDF- 5) failed to inhibit the binding of 125 I-labeled <b>OP-</b> 1 to receptors, suggesting a high degree of specificity with which <b>OP-</b> 1 bound to kidney receptors. Scatchard analysis of quantitative binding data indicated that the <b>OP-</b> 1 receptors of kidney contained a single class of high-affinity binding sites for <b>OP-</b> 1 with an association constant (Ka) of 2. 26 × 109 mol/L- 1 and a binding capacity of 1. 01 pmol of <b>OP-</b> 1 per mg membrane protein. When analyzed by a ligand blot technique, plasma membranes isolated from kidney cortex and medulla each showed the presence of a prominent specific band with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 100 kD. Further analysis by Western blotting indicated that an antibody raised against BMP type II receptor effectively recognized the 100 kD <b>OP-</b> 1 binding component of kidney plasma membranes. ConclusionsWe demonstrated, to our knowledge for the first time, the presence of membrane-bound, specific, high-affinity <b>OP-</b> 1 receptors in rat kidney tissues, which are likely to mediate <b>OP-</b> 1 actions in the kidney. The major <b>OP-</b> 1 –binding component of the kidney appears to be a long form of BMP type II receptor with a Mr of 100 kD. In vivo and in vitro evidence suggests that the cellular targets for <b>OP-</b> 1 are convoluted tubule epithelium, glomeruli, and collecting ducts. <b>OP-</b> 1 does not share receptor binding properties with other growth factors, including BMP- 2 and CDMP- 1, suggesting that its mode of action in kidney appears to be specific...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of body fluid levels of biochemical markers in joint tissues {{has begun to}} provide clinically useful information. Synovial fluid (SF) {{plays an important role}} in articular joint lubrication, nutrition, and metabolism of cartilage and other connective tissues within the joint. The purpose of our study was to identify and characterize osteogenic protein 1 (<b>OP-</b> 1) in SF from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or with osteoarthritis (OA) and to correlate levels of <b>OP-</b> 1 with those of hyaluronan (HA) and antigenic keratan sulfate (AgKS). SF was aspirated from the knees of patients with either RA or OA and from the knees of asymptomatic organ donors with no documented history of joint disease. The presence of detectable <b>OP-</b> 1 in SF was demonstrated by western blots with specific anti-pro-OP- 1 and anti-mature <b>OP-</b> 1 antibodies. Measurement of levels of <b>OP-</b> 1, HA and AgKS was performed using ELISAs. <b>OP-</b> 1 was identified in human SF in two forms, pro-OP- 1 and active (mature) <b>OP-</b> 1 – mature <b>OP-</b> 1 being detected only in SF from OA patients and RA patients. Levels of <b>OP-</b> 1 and HA were higher in RA patients than in OA patients and asymptomatic donors, while the level of AgKS was highest in SF from asymptomatic donors. Statistically significant differences were found between SF levels of <b>OP-</b> 1 in RA and OA patients and between SF levels of AgKS among the three groups tested. The SF content of <b>OP-</b> 1 tended to correlate positively with HA levels, but negatively with AgKS concentrations. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that {{measurement of}} <b>OP-</b> 1 in joint fluid may have value in the clinical evaluation of joint disease processes...|$|R

40|$|Osteogenic protein- 1 (<b>OP-</b> 1) or bone {{morphogenetic}} protein- 7 (BMP- 7) stimulates cartilage {{formation in}} mouse bone rudiments in vitro but arrests terminal differentiation of prehypertrophic chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes. In {{this study we}} report that these effects of <b>OP-</b> 1 depend on the developmental stage of the bone rudiment, early stages (E 14 and E 15 metatarsals) being most responsive. E 17 metatarsals that already contained a hypertrophic area that had initiated mineralization were no longer affected by <b>OP-</b> 1. We then investigated whether {{the sensitivity of the}} early long bone rudiments to <b>OP-</b> 1 correlated with high expression of the <b>OP-</b> 1 binding type I serine/threonine kinase receptors (activin receptor-like kinase: ALK- 2 /ActR-I, ALK- 3 /BMPR-IA or ALK- 6 /BMPR-IB) at this early stage. We did not find any significant difference in overall mRNA levels of these ALKs between stages E 14 through E 17 as assessed by RNase protection assays. However, by immunohistochemistry we found that ALK- 6 staining was strong in E 14 early cartilage primordium and its future perichondrium but dropped sharply to low levels in these cell types until onset of chondrocyte (pre) hypertrophy at E 16. By contrast, ALK- 2 and ALK- 3 immunostainings in E 14 were barely detectable. We also examined by immunohistochemistry the local synthesis of <b>OP-</b> 1. <b>OP-</b> 1 was present in E 14 early chondrocytes and forming perichondrium but in low amounts; however, production of <b>OP-</b> 1 increased in these cell types with age. All three receptor types as well as <b>OP-</b> 1 were present in significant amounts in prehypertrophic chondrocytes and late hypertrophic chondrocytes including those undergoing mineralization. The temporary high immunostaining for ALK- 6 in the early proliferating chondrocytes and future perichondrium of E 14 bone rudiments, and its absence in older bones correlated with the sensitivity of chondrocytes and perichondrium to (exogenous) <b>OP-</b> 1. We therefore propose that the effects of <b>OP-</b> 1 on these cells in vitro are mediated by ALK- 6 /BMPR-IB. We furthermore conclude that locally produced <b>OP-</b> 1 is a potential autocrine/paracrine growth factor. Increased local production of <b>OP-</b> 1 may be partially responsible for the age-related decrease in responsiveness to exogenous <b>OP-</b> 1 with respect to hypertrophy and mineralization of cartilage. status: publishe...|$|R

The present {{experiments were}} designed to compare anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperalgesic eects of orally administered <b>OP-</b> 1206 {CD with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), loxoprofen Na, in the rat. In addition, the eect of <b>OP-</b> 1206 {CD on loxoprofen Na-induced gastrointestinal ulceration was investigated. Oral administration of loxoprofen Na (1 - 10 mg/kg) elicited anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive eects on carrageenin-induced edema and yeast-induced mechano-hypersensitivity, respectively. In contrast, oral administration of <b>OP-</b> 1206 {CD (150 g/kg) per se did not show any thera-peutic eect in the models used. Treatment with <b>OP-</b> 1206 {CD did not aect the eects produced by loxoprofen Na. However, <b>OP-</b> 1206 {CD (150 g/kg) administered serially six times {{over a period of}} 4 days reduced thermal hyper-algesia resulting from a chronic sciatic nerve constriction injury (CCI) model, whereas loxoprofen Na (3 and 10 mg/kg) had no signicant benecial eect. Gastrointestinal ulceration was induced by orally administered loxoprofen N...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{a simple}} aqueous {{two-phase}} system (ATPS) was employed for concurrent purification of oyster polysaccharides. The chemical structure and anti-tumor activities of purified oyster polysaccharides (<b>OP-</b> 1) were also investigated. Under optimal ATPS conditions, oyster polysaccharides can be partitioned {{in the bottom}} phase with 67. 02 % extraction efficiency. The molecular weight of <b>OP-</b> 1 was determined as 3480 Da. <b>OP-</b> 1 is a (1 → 4) -α-d-glucosyl backbone and branching points located at O- 3 of glucose with a terminal-d-Glcp. The anti-tumor activity assay showed that <b>OP-</b> 1 exhibited good activities, including promotion of splenocyte proliferation, IL- 2 release, and inhibition of HepG 2 cell proliferation. Additionally, <b>OP-</b> 1 had no in vivo toxicity. This finding suggests that ATPS is a much simpler and greener system, and it opens up new possibilities in the large-scale separation of active polysaccharides from oysters. <b>OP-</b> 1 {{could be used by}} the health food and pharmaceutical therapies as potential anti-cancer adjuvants...|$|R
40|$|A {{major concern}} in using growth factors in {{impaction}} grafting {{is the potential}} stimulation of the osteoclastic lineage. A solution would be using an osteoconductive material resistant to resorption and providing initial stability after reconstruction. Growth factors may promote bone formation in combination with such graft materials. We determined whether <b>OP-</b> 1 would promote the incorporation of impacted morselized allografts and tricalcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite (TCP/HA) into host bone, whether bone formation would be preceded by an initial process of accelerated resorption, and whether the response to <b>OP-</b> 1 remodeling/incorporation would be dose-related. We performed two bone chamber studies in goats to ascertain the early effects of <b>OP-</b> 1 dose on resorption and incorporation of impacted morselized allografts and TCP/HA. After 4 weeks, the incorporation process of impacted morselized allografts and TCP/HA was not promoted by <b>OP-</b> 1. We observed no signs of accelerated resorption preceding bone formation. An increase in <b>OP-</b> 1 dose resulted in an inhibition of fibrous tissue formation but <b>OP-</b> 1 did not promote bone formation. Early failures in impaction grafting, using mixes with <b>OP-</b> 1, might {{be explained by the}} lack of fibrous tissue ingrowth and not by increased resorption and remodeling...|$|R
