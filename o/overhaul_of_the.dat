5|$|The VF Commodore, a major <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VE, {{was officially}} {{revealed}} on 10 February 2013 in Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|A general <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{gun laws}} took place through act No. 288/1995 Coll. Under the new act, gun license became shall issue. Also {{possession}} and concealed carry of pistols and revolvers became shall issue. The law further introduced mandatory firearms registration.|$|E
5|$|From 2012, this {{category}} was discontinued {{as part of}} a major <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grammy Award categories. Recordings in {{this category}} were shifted to the Best R Album category.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village killed 146 garment workers. The {{disaster}} {{eventually led}} to <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's fire department, building codes, and workplace regulations.|$|R
50|$|Collaroy {{differs from}} its class mates in having been {{equipped}} with underwater stabilisers and enhanced radar for use ocean cruises. The stabilisers were removed during the vessels last major overhaul {{and the control}} systems upgraded to match that being fitted during <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other Freshwater class. Collaroy can no longer do ocean cruising.|$|R
50|$|Between 1943 and March 1983 the {{airfield}} {{was used by}} a number of aircraft manufacturers including Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft (AWA), Whitworth Gloster, Hawker Siddeley and British Aerospace for final assembly, flight testing and <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> companies aircraft.|$|R
5|$|On May 18, 2013, Perl 5.18 was released. Notable new {{features}} include the new dtrace hooks, lexical subs, more CORE:: subs, <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hash for security reasons, support for Unicode 6.2.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{during the}} 15th {{anniversary of the}} game's release, Square Enix (who had {{acquired}} Eidos earlier) endorsed a free fan-created mod, Deus Ex: Revision which was released through Steam. The mod, created by Caustic Creative, is a graphical <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original game, adding in support for newer versions of DirectX, improving the textures and the soundtrack from the original game, and adding in more world-building aesthetics.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{proposals}} during the 21st century {{to extend the}} Clearview south to feed into the JFK Expressway via an underground tunnel. The JFK Expressway had been built {{as part of a}} costly <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> JFK Airport that began in the late 1980s. The JFK Expressway south of the Nassau Expressway and 150th Street was completed around 1986, and it was fully completed by 1991.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> their {{successor}} tender locomotives {{beginning in}} 1890, {{it was possible}} to introduce a through steam-hauled service from the coast to O'okiep from 15 May 1893. The condensing locomotives were then relegated to lesser duties, mainly ballast, sand clearing and other work trains. They also served as standby power to cover breakdowns and <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new mainline locomotives.|$|R
25|$|There is a mid-life upgrade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{light rail}} {{vehicles}} currently in progress. On September 9, 2013, {{a contract for}} mid-life <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light rail vehicles was awarded to Alstom. Five vehicles at a time will be sent for rebuilding, involving testing, removal of all interior and exterior components and replacement with new propulsion systems. The overhaul is scheduled for completion in March 2018. The overhauled cars are expected to begin testing in early 2016.|$|R
50|$|He {{continued}} in that post until 1997, {{when he was}} named American University's provost. During his tenure as provost, Kerwin oversaw {{a number of major}} changes including <b>the</b> tightening <b>of</b> graduate and doctoral programs, <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University College Program, and comprehensive reviews and <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> General Education Program, University Honors Program and academic advising. Kerwin put his understanding of policy implementation to use in executing segments of then-University President Benjamin Ladner's 15-Point Plan, including <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> a new faculty senate.|$|R
5|$|As {{construction}} {{of schools and}} hiring of teachers continued in Ravalomanana's second term, additional measures were adopted to improve education quality, including a shift to Malagasy as the language of instruction in grades one to five, expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for greater access to lower secondary schooling and an <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national curriculum, which had been modified piecemeal since independence from France in 1960. In the Constitution of 2007, English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language, in reflection of Ravalomanana's goal to increase Madagascar's participation in the global market.|$|E
5|$|He spent £58,000 on {{his royal}} castles, {{carrying}} out major {{works at the}} Tower of London, Lincoln and Dover. Both the military defences and the internal accommodation of these castles were significantly improved. At Windsor, a huge <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle produced a lavish palace complex, whose style and detail inspired many subsequent designs in England and Wales. The Tower of London was extended to form a concentric fortress with extensive living quarters, although Henry primarily used the castle as a secure retreat {{in the event of}} war or civil strife. Henry also kept a menagerie at the Tower, a tradition begun by his father, and his exotic specimens included an elephant, a leopard and a camel.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012, Smooth {{confirmed}} it would air a documentary celebrating {{the life of}} Dusty Springfield over the Christmas period to mark the upcoming 50th anniversary of her debut as a solo artist. In January 2013, a Saturday programme dedicated to films and a regular documentary slot for Sunday afternoons were announced {{as part of an}} <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station's schedule. Mark Goodier returned to the network in June 2013 to present Rolling Home: The Summer of the Stonesa one-hour documentary about The Rolling Stones.|$|E
50|$|A part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “Digital Bangladesh” {{project was}} also massive <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government’s websites. This, however, {{included}} <b>the</b> publication <b>of</b> thousands of sensitive data points. <b>The</b> breakout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2012 ICT Skype controversy revealed that residential phone numbers <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foreign ministry were available online. Government institutions had published their employees’ “Personal Data Sheets” online - {{a record that}} includes sensitive contact information (including postal addresses, e-mail and mobile numbers), their National ID numbers, details on their education and details on their parents.|$|R
50|$|Following {{mechanical}} {{problems with}} the Isuzu Elf, Oscar Mayer decided to adopt a larger chassis {{in order to accommodate}} an increase in size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signature wiener running through the middle. While the Wienermobile was not as long as the 1995 version, it was considerably wider and taller. Craftsmen Industries went through numerous <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truck including a flipped axle and a leveling kit. This version held a record for numerous suspension problems, most leading to the chassis not being able to hold <b>the</b> large weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oscar Mayer Wiener.|$|R
40|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>overhauling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} {{energy efficiency}} regulations (following European directive 2002 / 91 /CE), the Wallonia and Brussels-Capital Region commissioned the LUCID {{to develop an}} optional 3 D graphic encoding module to be integrated with the core energy efficiency computation engine developed by Altran Europe. Our contribution consisted mostly in analyzing the target users’ needs and representations (ergonomics, UI, interactions) and implementing a bespoke 3 D CAD modeler dedicated to thermal models of buildings {{taking into account the}} various geometrical and relational constraints specific to thermal modeling.

5|$|Melbournes {{first major}} refit started in December 1967 and {{continued}} until February 1969, {{during which she}} was upgraded to operate S-2 Tracker and A-4 Skyhawk aircraft. The modifications cost A$8.5million, and included an <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull and machinery, strengthening of the flight deck, improvements to the catapult and arrestor cables, modification of the aviation fuel systems and flight control arrangements, and upgrades of the navigational aids and radar. Air conditioning systems and a liquid oxygen generation plant were also installed. Melbourne re-entered service {{at the conclusion of}} the refits on 14 February, and performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May. This was the largest project undertaken by Garden Island Dockyard to that date.|$|E
5|$|Strom also {{resisted}} calling {{an early}} election {{to give his}} government a fresh mandate, despite Hamilton's impassioned advocacy for this course of action. He was no more positive towards Anderson's proposals for a radical <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party, including the computerization of political data (such as voting trends, demographic shifts, and polling results) and the purchase of an office building to make the party a profit and free it from the need for fundraising. The ideas that Strom did not reject outright were referred to committees and study groups where they were watered down or shelved.|$|E
5|$|The studies {{recommended}} a comprehensive <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system, {{with the development}} of an in-state mental health program for Alaska. This proposal was widely supported by the public and politicians. At the start of 1956, in the second session of the 84th Congress, Representative Edith Green (D-Oregon) introduced the Alaska Mental Health Bill (H.R. 6376) in the House of Representatives. The bill had been written by Bob Bartlett, the Congressional Delegate from the Alaska Territory who later became a U.S. Senator. Senator Richard L. Neuberger (D-Oregon) sponsored an equivalent bill, S. 2518, in the Senate.|$|E
50|$|For example, the Motorola 68010 (and {{the obscure}} 68012) was a 68000 with {{improvements}} to the loop instruction {{and the ability to}} suspend then continue an instruction in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> a page fault, enabling <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> virtual memory with the appropriate MMU hardware. There were, however, no major <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core architecture. Similarly, the Motorola 68030 was a process improvement on the 68020 with the MMU and a small data cache (256 bytes) moved on-chip. The 68030 was available in speed ratings up to 50 MHz.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} {{dynamic programming}} based model as a planning tool for <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> electric power systems. Every distribution component has an exponential age depending reliability function {{to model the}} fault risk. In <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> time when <b>the</b> fault costs exceed <b>the</b> investment costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new component <b>the</b> reinvestment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> component should be made. However, in some cases <b>the</b> <b>overhauling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old component may be more economical than the reinvestment. The comparison between overhauling and reinvestment is made by optimisation process. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optimisation process {{is to find the}} cost minimising maintenance program for electric power distribution system. Keywords—Dynamic programming, Electric distribution system, Maintenance. ...|$|R
25|$|TAP began 1974 with 32 {{state-of-the-art}} aircraft operating to {{more than}} 40 destinations on four continents, it began offering computerised reservations, load control and check-in (known as Tapmatic), {{and became the first}} European airline to carry out major comprehensive <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boeing 747 engines. By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> 1974, TAP had carried more than 1.5 million passengers, flown 68,210 hours over a network of almost 103,000 kilometres and had a staff of over 9,000. Following the 25 April 1974 revolution, Portugal was caught up in <b>the</b> wave <b>of</b> nationalisations during <b>the</b> following year and TAP was no exception, thus becoming a state-owned corporation in 1975.|$|R
5|$|Two-time {{recipients}} include India.Arie, Cee Lo Green (once {{as part of}} the duo Gnarls Barkley), and Jill Scott. Erykah Badu, Big Boi (a {{member of}} OutKast) and will.i.am (a member of The Black Eyed Peas) share the record for the most nominations, with three each. Sérgio Mendes is the only performer to be nominated twice in one year. The category was dominated by Americans, yet individuals from Jamaica and Côte d'Ivoire also won the award. The award will be discontinued from 2012 in a major <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grammys where the category will be shifted to the Best R Performance category.|$|E
5|$|After the tender, 80 {{employees}} {{were transferred to}} the subsidiary, including the director, chartered engineer Arne Fosen. To the press {{he said that the}} increased efficiency in the organization was related to a small administration, and being able to use uniform trains. Previously both locomotive-hauled trains, as well as Class 70 and Class 69 trains had been used. Following the PSO, NSB Anbud would operate nine Class 69g trains, which are somewhat smaller than the locomotive-hauled and Class 70 trains. These would be owned by NSB, but rented by the subsidiary. The ministry would pay for a NOK 40 million <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock. Representatives from the labor union said they feared for the flexibility of NSB, since 80 {{employees were}} now bound up in serving only a single line. Margareth Nordby replaced Fosen as director in August.|$|E
5|$|Following his injury, Johnson {{never really}} rediscovered his old form, scoring just 11 goals in 47 {{appearances}} from March 2004 to March 2005, when, after a falling-out with manager Gary Megson, {{he was sent}} on loan to Sheffield United, ironically the club against whom he had broken his leg in the first place. Following Nottingham Forest's relegation to League One {{at the end of}} the season, Megson placed Johnson on the transfer list as part of a dramatic <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's playing staff. However, the summer of 2005 saw Johnson recalled to the Nottingham Forest first team, and by the start of the 2005–06 season, he had admitted his desire to remain with the club and fight for a place in the team.|$|E
30|$|The Chinese Government and Chinese {{enterprises}} {{have demonstrated}} commitment to these special trade zones {{and the benefits}} will be immense to both parties and ultimately lead to transfer of technology and massive foreign direct investment (Renard, 2011; Shen, 2013). Africa remains a strategic business partner for China and Chinese government’s involvement in building infrastructural facilities across Nigeria is expected to provide a well-coordinated supply chain network and logistics network to boost economic activity (Bräutigam & Xiaoyang, 2011; Ozawa, 2015). For instance, several Chinese firms are engaged in on-going reconstruction and <b>overhauling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway network, building of roads in strategic locations all over Nigeria.|$|R
25|$|Along {{over three}} decades <b>of</b> {{operation}} <b>the</b> activities and services of Gestair group expanded to include charter airline services — through Audeli Air—, air taxi, flight training (in 2013 bought by G Air Group), handling, consulting, as well as maintenance and <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> aircraft. <b>The</b> maintenance and overhaul unit, initially named Corjet Maintenance, was later renamed Gestair Maintenance.|$|R
25|$|Major {{administrative}} reforms {{took place}} in 1564–1566 in preparation for <b>the</b> second Statute <b>of</b> Lithuania and <b>the</b> <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> judicial system. <b>The</b> entire territory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchy, with exception of Samogitia, was divided into 12 voivodeships.|$|R
5|$|Henry's {{break with}} Rome {{incurred}} {{the threat of}} a large-scale French or Spanish invasion. To guard against this, in 1538, he began to build a chain of expensive, state-of-the-art defences, along Britain's southern and eastern coasts from Kent to Cornwall, largely built of material gained from the demolition of the monasteries. These were known as Henry VIII's Device Forts. He also strengthened existing coastal defence fortresses such as Dover Castle and, at Dover, Moat Bulwark and Archcliffe Fort, which he personally visited for a few months to supervise. Wolsey had many years before conducted the censuses required for an <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system of militia, but no reform resulted. In 1538–39, Cromwell overhauled the shire musters, but his work mainly served to demonstrate how inadequate they were in organisation. The building works, including that at Berwick, along with the reform of the militias and musters, were eventually finished under Queen Mary.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2009, the G {{was once}} again {{extended}} south at all times to Church Avenue. This was required for <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Culver Viaduct, which caused the express tracks at Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue/Ninth Street—used to switch G trains between tracks after they terminated at Smith–Ninth Streets—to be temporarily taken out of service. This had several benefits. First, five stations previously served by only the F train had more frequent service. Additionally, riders from northern Brooklyn and Long Island City had a direct route to Kensington. Finally, since the Church Avenue terminal had four tracks to store terminating G trains, as opposed to only one storage track at Smith–9th Streets, this reduced delays on both services because terminating G trains could switch to the storage tracks without having {{to wait in the}} station for another train to leave, as had occurred at Smith–Ninth Street. On July 19, 2012, MTA officials made this extension permanent because it provided more direct connections between Kensington and north Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach's premiership {{was heavily}} focused on {{management}} of the province's oil reserves, especially those of the Athabasca Oil Sands. He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing an <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and {{the conclusion of a}} major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach had to cope with a deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E
500|$|John Brownlee became Premier of Alberta in 1925 as <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{parliamentary}} caucus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Farmers <b>of</b> Alberta (UFA). [...] Early in his premiership, {{he achieved}} {{a number of}} successes, including winning control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province's natural resources from the federal government, but by 1933 the Great Depression was taking its toll on his government's popularity. [...] Political forces were advocating radical <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial system. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UFA's grassroots favored socialism and government ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> means <b>of</b> production, while <b>the</b> Alberta Liberal Party, many within the UFA, and William Aberhart's new provincial movement favored social credit, although in differing forms and with differing levels of enthusiasm.|$|R
50|$|During {{his term}} as governor, Sewell issued twenty-four orders, {{most of them}} {{concerned}} with taxes. He conducted major <b>overhauls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> taxation, criminal code, and prison system. He also repealed a number <b>of</b> laws limiting <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> native Guamanian culture, including once again allowing United States military personnel to live among the Chamorro people and allowing the Caroline Islands to wear native clothing and participate in cockfights. At first, he raised the property taxes, which had only been one percent under Spanish rule, which caused many natives to default and lose their land. After a series of crop failures caused economic hardship on the island, he reduced property taxes by fifty percent.|$|R
25|$|The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, {{also called}} the Medicare Modernization Act or MMA, is a federal law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States, enacted in 2003. It {{produced}} <b>the</b> largest <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> Medicare in <b>the</b> public health program's 38-year history.|$|R
