This is the first time there have been two Elders in the history of Seio Girls' Academy.|$|E

5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip <b>over</b> <b>her</b> clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yare! yare!" [...] screamed Goodwin Hawtayne, flinging himself {{upon the}} long pole {{which served as}} a tiller. [...] "Cut the halliard! Haul <b>her</b> <b>over!</b> Lay <b>her</b> two courses to the wind!" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{last she}} came to a little rustic gate, leading into a shadowy wood-lane. The gate was bound with willow withes, and, as Sara fumbled vainly at them with her chilled hands, a man's firm step came up behind her, and Lige Baxter's hand closed <b>over</b> <b>her's.</b>|$|R
60|$|What he {{said was}} not very cogent, {{and not in the}} least literary, but it was reassuring and lover-like, and when he turned <b>her</b> <b>over</b> to <b>her</b> mother she was composed, though unwontedly grave.|$|R
5|$|Endhita as Rika, a young divorcée, {{mother of}} one, and Catholic convert. Because of her divorce and conversion, she is often {{looked down upon}} by her neighbours.

5|$|Even {{before her}} marriage, Anne Boleyn {{was able to}} grant petitions, receive diplomats and give patronage, and had {{enormous}} influence <b>over</b> <b>her</b> future husband to plead the cause of foreign diplomats.

5|$|Girls had equal {{inheritance}} {{rights with}} boys if their father died without leaving a will.

5|$|Gopalam and {{his wife}} Ammi, jovial by nature, treat the couple like their own children. Although Mary finds the Hindu customs strange, she says nothing to Gopalam and Ammi because she needs her job to repay David. She vents her {{frustration}} to Rao and Devaiah, who bear it patiently.

5|$|Maggie is the {{youngest}} child of Homer and Marge, and sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking on her red pacifier and, when she walks, she trips <b>over</b> <b>her</b> clothing and falls on her face (this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she cannot talk. She is a counterpart to Lisa Simpson. However, she did appear to talk in the first Tracey Ullman Show short.|$|E
60|$|Now Miriam was angry. There {{was nothing}} to be ashamed of, that she could see, and it was {{certainly}} very rude in Miss Bannister to drop her bottle, and nearly push <b>her</b> <b>over</b> in <b>her</b> haste to get away from her and her poor calf.|$|R

5|$|Marguerite Louise's caprices lead to sour {{relations}} with the family. She argued with the Grand Duchess Vittoria over precedence, and with Grand Duke Ferdinando <b>over</b> <b>her</b> spending.
