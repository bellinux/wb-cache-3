5|$|There {{are several}} classifications of beads {{common to the}} Swahili coastal {{settlements}} {{that have been found}} at Gedi. In his examination of beads found at Gedi and the Limpopo Valley (Mapungubwe), Schofield placed beads into three categories: red, blue, green, and yellow cylinders made from cane glass; smaller black, red, green, yellow, and blue biconical and lenticular beads made from wound glass; and spheres of red, black, and yellow pressed glass. Kirkman similarly created eight classifications of beads. All but 25 of the 558 beads categorized as class 1–3 were made from <b>opaque</b> <b>glass.</b> During his excavations at Gedi, Kirkman recovered 631 beads in six stratigraphic layers. Monochrome yellow, green, and black wound and pressed glass beads formed in melon, biconical, globular, barrel, and cylindrical shapes were the most common styles represented in strata from the fourteenth century and sporadically appeared in later levels. Small drawn cane glass beads are also commonly represented in fourteenth and fifteenth century levels with the colors green, opaque red, yellow, and black occurring more frequently than blue, brown, and red. It is believed that Islamic traders brought the majority of glass beads to East Africa, which were traded across the continent, since there is no evidence for local production or trade south or west of Egypt and Nubia {{with the exception of a}} site in Igbo Olokun Grove at Ile-Ife in southern Nigeria.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, glassmakers {{discovered}} that uranium glass with certain mineral additions could be tempered at high temperatures, inducing varying degrees of micro-crystallization. This produced a range of increasingly <b>opaque</b> <b>glasses</b> from the traditional transparent yellow or yellow-green to an opaque white. During the Depression years, more iron oxide was added to the mixture to match popular preferences for a greener glass. This material, technically a glass-ceramic, acquired the name [...] "vaseline glass" [...] because of its supposedly similar appearance to petroleum jelly. Today, a few manufacturers continue the vaseline glass tradition: Fenton Glass, Mosser Glass, Gibson Glass and Jack Loranger.|$|R

25|$|To date {{only two}} {{extensive}} chemical analysis studies of Anglo-Saxon bead assemblages {{have been carried}} out, from the cemeteries of Sewerby in Yorkshire and Apple Down in Sussex. These studies showed that, like glass vessels, the beads had a modified soda-lime-silica composition with high manganese and iron oxide contents. Variations in the composition {{directly related to the}} glass colour. Lead rich <b>opaque</b> <b>glass</b> was also prominent in Anglo-Saxon Britain, most likely due to its lower softening temperature and longer working period, which would not melt or distort the bead body. The bead body could be constructed {{in a number of different}} ways; winding, drawing, piercing, folding or even a combination of these. Decoration was applied by adding twisting rods of colour, coloured mosaic patterns, enclosing metal between layers of clear glass or simply adding a different colour in either drops or trails.|$|E

2500|$|Light {{polarization}} is {{an added}} feature {{that can be}} applied to sunglass lenses. Polarization filters are positioned to remove horizontally polarized rays of light, which eliminates glare from horizontal surfaces (allowing wearers to see into water when reflected light would otherwise overwhelm the scene). Polarized sunglasses may present some difficulties for pilots since reflections from water and other structures often used to gauge altitude may be removed. [...] Liquid crystal displays often emit polarized light making them sometimes difficult to view with polarized sunglasses. Sunglasses may be worn just for aesthetic purposes, or simply to hide the eyes. Examples of sunglasses that were popular for these reasons include teashades and mirrorshades. Many blind people wear nearly <b>opaque</b> <b>glasses</b> to hide their eyes for cosmetic reasons.|$|R

40|$|<b>Opaque</b> red <b>glass</b> tantalizes modern {{scientists}} {{as much as}} it fascinated ancient people. Its gem-like appearance, its symbolic value, and {{the challenge}} of its production are at the basis of this interest. Despite the apparent chromatichomogeneity, <b>opaque</b> red <b>glasses</b> so far analysed show a wide range of chemical and textural features, indicating a large variety of production technologies. It is generally accepted that copper-based phases are responsible for the red colour and its variants (mainly orange and brown), and that rigorous reducing conditions must have been established and maintained throughout the glassmelting, but there is no clear consensus on the mechanism of colour generation and the parameters influencing it. In this context the present work, focusing on opaque red tesserae dated from Roman to Early- Byzantine time (2 nd- 6 th century AD), aims to investigate and compare the different production technologies employed. In particular, 16 Roman tesserae, ranging from orange to brown in colour, excavated in the sites Domus delle Bestie Ferite (Aquileia, dated to the mid- 4 th century), Domus of Torre di Pordenone (Pordenone, dated between the 1 st and 5 th century) and Santa Maria Maggiore Cathedral (Trento, dated between the 2 nd and 4 th century) are here considered. Strict comparisons are made with 26 Byzantine <b>opaque</b> red <b>glass</b> tesserae from Padova and Vicenza, dated to the 6 th century AD and previously analysed with comparable methodological approach. The study was carried out using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energydispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS) for textural and qualitative chemical analyses, electron microprobe (EMPA) to determine quantitative chemical compositions of the glassy matrix, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy to define the crystalline phases of pigments, providing valuable insights into the complexity of <b>opaque</b> red <b>glass</b> technology from Roman to Early-Byzantine period in northeastern Italy...|$|R

25|$|Colourants/Opacifiers: These can be {{naturally}} {{present in}} the glass due to impurities in the raw materials, e.g. {{in the case of}} green/blue-green glass which results from the presence of iron in the sand. Other colourants are likely to be deliberate additions to the glass melt of small quantities of mineral-rich material or in some cases slags from metalworking processes. The elements in ancient glass that affect its appearance are mainly iron, manganese, cobalt, copper, tin and antimony. The presence or absence of lead is also important, while it doesn’t produce a colour itself (except in the form lead-tin oxide or lead-antimony oxide) it can change the hue of other colourants. In addition when added to <b>opaque</b> <b>glasses</b> it ensures that the colourants form in a controlled way and are uniformly distributed. Opacity in glass can be due to a number of factors; intensity of colour, bubbles in the glass or the inclusion of opacifying agents, such as tin (SnO2 & PbSnO3) and antimony (Ca2Sb2O7 & CaSb2O6 & Pb2Sb2O7).|$|R

Upward of twenty years ago, I believe, this gentleman took a fancy to the crumbling shell of a mediæval fortress on a breezy hill-top overlooking the Val d' Arno and forthwith bought it and began to [...] "restore" [...] it. I know nothing of what the original ruin may have cost; but in the dusky courts and chambers of the present elaborate structure this impassioned archæologist must have buried a fortune. He has, however, the compensation of feeling that he has erected a monument which, if it is never to stand a feudal siege, may encounter at least some critical over-hauling. It is a disinterested work of art and really a triumph of æsthetic culture. The author has reproduced with minute accuracy a sturdy home-fortress of the fourteenth century, and has kept throughout such rigid terms with his model that the result is literally uninhabitable to degenerate moderns. It is simply a massive facsimile, an elegant museum of archaic images, mainly but most amusingly counterfeit, perched on a spur of the Apennines. The place is most politely shown.

60|$|Pitiful is {{the case}} of the blind, who cannot read the face; pitiful that of the deaf, who cannot follow the changes of the voice.

They are poorer than the gipsy, for their heart can speak no language under heaven. Such people we must learn slowly by the tenor of their acts, or through yea and nay communications; or we take them on trust on the strength of a general air, and now and again, when we see the spirit breaking through in a flash, correct or change our estimate. But these will be uphill intimacies, without charm or freedom, to the end; and freedom is the chief ingredient in confidence. Some minds, romantically dull, despise physical endowments. That is a doctrine for a misanthrope; to those who like their fellow creatures it must always be meaningless; and, for my part, I can see few things more desirable, after the possession of such radical qualities as honour and humour and pathos, than to have a lively and not a stolid countenance; to have looks to correspond with every feeling; to be elegant and delightful in person, so that we shall please even in the intervals of active pleasing, and may never discredit speech with uncouth manners or become unconsciously our own burlesques. But of all unfortunates there is one creature (for I will not call him man) conspicuous in misfortune. This is he who has forfeited his birthright of expression, who has cultivated artful intonations, who has taught his face tricks, like a pet monkey, and on every side perverted or cut off his means of communication with his fellow-men.
