5000|$|Soluble {{fragments}} of graphene {{can be prepared}} in the laboratory through chemical modification of graphite. First, microcrystalline graphite is treated with an acidic mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. A series of oxidation and exfoliation steps produce small graphene plates with carboxyl groups at their edges. These are converted to acid chloride groups by treatment with thionyl chloride; next, they are converted to the corresponding graphene amide via treatment with <b>octadecylamine.</b> The resulting material (circular graphene layers of 5.3 angstrom thickness) is soluble in tetrahydrofuran, tetrachloromethane and dichloroethane.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical fouling inhibitors {{can reduce}} fouling in many systems, mainly by {{interfering with the}} crystallization, attachment, or {{consolidation}} steps of the fouling process. Examples for water systems are: chelating agents (for example, EDTA), long-chain aliphatic amines or polyamines (for example, <b>octadecylamine,</b> helamin, and other [...] "film-forming" [...] amines), organic phosphonic acids (for example, etidronic acid), or polyelectrolytes (for example, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, usually with a molecular weight lower than 10000). For fired boilers, aluminum or magnesium additives can lower the melting point of ash and promote creation of deposits which are easier to remove. See also process chemicals.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} of olaflur starts from cattle's tallow. The contained fatty acids, mainly stearic acid (C17H35COOH), are obtained by hydrolysis, and then converted to the corresponding amides, {{which in turn}} are reduced catalytically to the primary amines (largely <b>octadecylamine).</b> Addition of acrylonitrile, followed by another reduction, yields N-alkyl-1,3-propanediamines. The two nitrogen atoms react with ethylene oxide to form tertiary amines. Finally, hydrofluoric acid is added to give the end product. Because olaflur is produced from a mixture of fatty acids, some molecules have side chains that are longer or shorter than 18 carbon atoms. Other byproducts of the reaction include hydroxyethyl ethers resulting from addition of ethylene oxide to the free hydroxyl groups. The presence of these side products is clinically irrelevant.|$|E

40|$|The {{structures}} of <b>octadecylamine</b> montmorillonite and stearamide-octadecylamine com-plex montmorillonite were studied by X-ray diffraction and infrared absorption spectrum. The {{relation between the}} amount of added organic compounds and the separation of the lattice layer of montmorillonite crystal was measured by X-ray diffraction. The basal spacing of <b>octadecylamine</b> montmorillonite was expanded stepwise, in increments of 4 A with the quantity of organic compound, while stearamide montmorillonite was expanded to about 22 A with the smallest amount of organic compound.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of polar compounds and salinity on the interfacial tension and wettability characteristics of rock/oil/brine systems. Crude oil and core samples from Safaniya formation iIt<Saudi Arabia were used in the study. The concentration of polar compounds in the crude oil was varied by adding different amounts of oleic acid and <b>octadecylamine</b> to the crude oil. Results showed that, the interfacial tension between crude oil and brine was lowered to a minimum value when oleic acid concentration of (J.

40|$|A {{single step}} {{process for the}} {{synthesis}} of size-controlled silver nanoparticles has been developed using a bifunctional molecule, <b>octadecylamine</b> (ODA). <b>Octadecylamine</b> complexes to Ag+ ions electrostatically, reduce them, and subsequently stabilizes the nanoparticles thus formed.

The particle size, and the nucleation and growth kinetics of silver nanoparticles could be tuned by varying the molar ratio of ODA to AgNO 3. The UV-vis spectra of nanoparticles prepared with different concentrations of ODA displayed the well-defined plasmon band with maximum absorption around 425 nm. The formation of silver metallic nanoparticles was confirmed by their XRD pattern. The binding of ODA molecule on the surface of silver has been studied by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy.

40|$|Structural {{analysis}} of Na-montmorillonite co-intercalated with <b>octadecylamine</b> and stearic acid {{was carried out}} using combination of experiment: X-ray powder diffraction and IR spectroscopy with molecular modeling (force field calculations) in Cerius 2 modeling environment. Results of structure analysis revealed the chemical reaction of guest compounds leading {{to the formation of}} octadecylammonium stearate. This reaction may occur even before the intercalation out of the interlayer space of montmorillonite. The presence of octadecylammonium stearate in the samples was clearly confirmed by IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Present results also showed that: (1) Stearic acid itself does not intercalate into Na-montmorillonite; (2) cointercalation with <b>octadecylamine</b> {{led to the formation of}} octadecylammonium stearate, which was successfully intercalated into the interlayer space of montmorillonite, and (3) Na-montmorillonite intercalated with octadecylammonium stearate does not create a stable structure. Intercalated samples in ambient conditions undergo gradual decomposition, accompanied by the release of octadecylammonium stearate from the interlayer space and rearrangement of the interlayer structure.

The long alkyl chains (such as <b>octadecylamine)</b> [18] were always used as the surface-modified agents and the alkyl-chain-modified graphene sheets that could be dispersed in organic solvents after sonication [19].

A slight decrease of crystallinity degree was detected. Reduction of elastic modulus and elongation at break were noticed. The lamellar spacing was increased (3. 3 times higher). The storage modulus decreased and low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LFNMR) revealed an increasing of molecular mobility.

The results of these experiments revealed that at pH 7 BmoLL, compared to other studied by us lectins, required higher bulk protein concentrations to lower its surface tension to a given g value. The results showed also that at high solution concentrations unusually high surface pressures (p=g 0 -g) were observed with a maximum appearing below pH 4. These data corroborated those from z p tential measurements. BmoLL appeared to be negatively charged at all studied pH’s ranging from 2 to 7. 5 and exhibited the highest negative charge within the 4. 0 - 7. 5 pH ranges. The penetrant ability of BmoLL into two different in chemical nature monolayers (dioleylphosphatidylcholine, <b>octadecylamine)</b> has been assessed measuring Dp increments at constant area. It was observed that whereas the monolayers of either pure dioleylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) or pure <b>octadecylamine</b> (ODA) favored BmoLL adsorption, the lectin adsorption within their mixtures strongly depended on both the ratio of the positively charged <b>octadecylamine</b> in the mixture and on the mixture compressibility.

Abdel-Wali studied the impact of simple polar components on crude oil (including both simple acid and base materials such as naphthenic acids (R-COOH) and basic nitrogen-containing components such as <b>octadecylamine</b> (R-NH 2)) by adding various concentrations of oleic acid and <b>octadecylamine</b> (ODA) to crude oil, and also they investigated the effect of salinity of the brine, through altering the concentration of NaCl in the brine in the range of 0 – 200, 000  ppm. They encountered a reverse trend for IFT by adding salts and oleic acids and reported specific salinity and concentration of oleic acid and <b>octadecylamine</b> at which the minimum interfacial tension is achieved. They believed that the increase in IFT by increasing salinity above the optimum point is related to the attachment of Na+ ions to the hydrophilic part of the oil sample, which reduces the solubility of oleic acids in the water phase, but they didn’t mention the reasons behind the IFT reduction in the salinity below the optimum salinity point (Abdel-Wali 1996). Polar components are the simple acid and base materials which exist in crude oil and act as surface active materials. The polar components stem from the heteroatoms present in the heavier fractions (Seifert and Howells 1969; Speight 2014). Compounds that contain oxygen are most commonly alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, ketones, esters and ethers. These are often acidic in nature, and the collective term naphthenic acid (NA) is often used in reference to them. Common basic nitrogen-containing compounds are pyridine and quinolone, and non-basic compounds are typically pyrrole, indole and carbazole and their derivatives. Sulfur compounds commonly found in crude oils are thioalkanes and heterocyclic compounds derived from thiophene (Schobert 2013).|$|E
