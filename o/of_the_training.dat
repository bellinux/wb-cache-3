40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track geometry on <b>the</b> dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> is <b>of</b> {{great concern}} for the railway companies, {{because they have to}} guarantee <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> passengers in ensuring <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> In this paper, <b>the</b> long-term evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> on a stretch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway track is studied with respect to <b>the</b> long-term evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track geometry. <b>The</b> characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-term evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> response allows <b>the</b> railway companies to start off maintenance operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track at the best moment.

At the same time, Taylor was detached from the Scouting Fleet and transferred to Destroyer Division 47, Squadron 16 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Training</b> Squadron. She was assigned to the 6th and 7th Naval Districts to train reservists and to carry Reserve Officer Training Corps midshipmen on summer cruises.

5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained {{without the possibility of}} air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E

5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate.

Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
