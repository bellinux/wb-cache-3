5|$|In its secret negotiations, the Committee of Public Safety was {{initially}} unable {{to form a}} consensus concerning the jailed deputies, but as some Girondins fled to the provinces and attempted to incite an insurrection, its opinion hardened. By early July, Saint-Just was able to address the Convention with a lengthy report {{in the name of}} the Committee, and his damning attack left no room for any further conciliation. The Girondins' trials must proceed, he said, and any verdicts must be severe. The proceedings dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>months,</b> but Brissot and twenty of his allies were eventually condemned and sent to the guillotine on 31 October 1793. Saint-Just used their situation to gain approval for intimidating new laws, culminating in the Law of Suspects (17 September 1793) which gave the Committee vast new powers of arrest and punishment.|$|E
5|$|The siege at the Peñol de Cerquín dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>months,</b> with {{constant}} fighting. The Spanish there numbered about a hundred, plus auxiliaries, but {{were unable to}} maintain supply lines through the surrounding hostile territory, and were often short of food. The seasonal rains that arrived in spring 1538 only added to their hardship. The supplies from El Salvador finally arrived, and Cáceres slowly gained territory around the Peñol. After six months, Cáceres invited Lempira to a parley. Lempira arrived, dressed in full regalia, cotton armour, and plumed headdress, accompanied by a retinue of nobles. Cáceres sent a mounted soldier to request his surrender, and when Lempira refused, a carefully hidden arquebusier shot him through the head. This was a signal for an all-out surprise attack by the Spanish. The Indians responded with complete panic at {{the death of their}} leader, and the Spanish onslaught swiftly took the fortress without any Spanish loss of life, although some were wounded. A portion of the indigenous garrison retreated to nearby mountains, but most of the Indians surrendered without further resistance, including a great many women, children and elderly. Cáceres followed Montejo's instructions in dealing with the defeated natives with moderation. He followed native custom and sent gifts of textiles and fowls to the native leaders, as a symbol of peace, accompanied by a spear as a promise of war should they refuse to submit. After a council, the Indian leaders accepted peace, and the region passed immediately under Spanish control. Cáceres released all his prisoners to return to their villages, a move that surprised the natives, who had expected harsh punitive measures. The fall of Lempira's stronghold was followed by the speedy capitulation of a wide area of Honduras, and came at a critical juncture for the Spanish, when they had been at the point of losing the province.|$|E

25|$|The Privy Council reiterated its position, and Ridley {{responded in}} person, agreeing that vestments are {{indifferent}} but making a compelling {{argument that the}} monarch may require indifferent things without exception. The council became divided in opinion, and the issue dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>months</b> without resolution. Hooper now insisted that vestments were not indifferent, since they obscured the priesthood of Christ by encouraging hypocrisy and superstition. Warwick disagreed, emphasising that the king must be obeyed in things indifferent, and he pointed to St Paul's concessions to Jewish traditions in the early church. Finally, an acrimonious debate with Ridley went against Hooper. Ridley's position centred on maintaining order and authority; not the vestments themselves, Hooper's primary concern.|$|E
25|$|In 1223, the Mongol general Muqali {{had struck}} into Shaanxi Province, attacking Chang'an when Genghis Khan was attacking Khwarezmia.

The siege dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>months</b> and the Mongols were harassed by local militia, while Jin reinforcements were about to arrive. Muqali then died of illness, and the Mongols retreated. This was the siege in which the Western Xia troops supporting the Mongols gave up and went home, incurring the wrath of Genghis Khan. In the wars against the Mongols, therefore, the Jin relied heavily on subjects or allies like the Uighurs, Tanguts and Khitans to supply cavalry.|$|E

A {{series of}} engagements were fought, and some of Yuan Shao's top generals had been killed, but Yuan still possessed a huge army, which applied much {{pressure}} to Cao Cao. The war had been dragging <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>months,</b> and Cao Cao's supplies nearly depleted. When Cao Cao considered retreating, he received a piece of intelligence concerning the whereabouts of his enemy's food storage, which was guarded by Yuan Shao's general Chunyu Qiong. Determined to bet on the information, he picked Yue Jin as his vanguard in this desperate mission, and sneaked their way to Wuchao (烏巢; in present-day Yanjin, Henan) with 5,000 troops composed of mainly cavalry. Under the cover of night, they were unopposed until they arrived the enemy encampment, where they set fire to Yuan Shao's supplies. Chunyu Qiong attempted to fight back with his larger force, but was slain by Yue Jin in the chaos. The success of this raid in Wuchao enabled Cao Cao to score a decisive victory over Yuan Shao's at Guandu.|$|E

Constitutional negotiations between the government and ZAPU began in Salisbury ten days later. The ZAPU delegation proposed an immediate switch to black majority rule, a government elected on a [...] "strictly non-racial" [...] basis, and reluctantly offered some sweeteners for the Rhodesian white population, [...] "which we detested", Nkomo says, including some reserved seats for whites in parliament. The talks dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>months</b> afterwards, with little progress being made, though Smith notes the [...] "congenial atmosphere, with both sides ready to crack a joke".

The game actually started off as a mission-based, anime-inspired, paramilitary action thriller intended as a spiritual sequel to Shogo and ended up as a 60s spy adventure in the tradition of Our Man Flint and countless other 60s spy movies and shows." [...] This final theme for the game was settled on through discussions with Fox Interactive, the final publisher of NOLF. (Parts of the initial [...] "paramilitary action thriller" [...] concept evolved into F.E.A.R., another Monolith game, released after the NOLF series, in 2005.)

500|$|Bonds met Susann ("Sun") Margreth Branco, {{the mother}} of his first two {{children}} (Nikolai and Shikari), in Montreal, Quebec in August 1987. They eloped to Las Vegas February 5, 1988. The couple separated in June 1994, divorced in December 1994, and had their marriage annulled in 1997 by the Catholic Church. The divorce was a media affair because Bonds had his Swedish spouse sign a prenuptial agreement in which she [...] "waived her right to a share of his present and future earnings" [...] and which was upheld. Bonds had been providing his wife $20,000/month in child support and $10,000 in spousal support {{at the time of the}} ruling.

The trial dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>months,</b> but Bonds was awarded both houses and reduced support.
