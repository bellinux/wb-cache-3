25|$|TV3 {{routinely}} {{disagrees with}} RTÉ Television's policy of purchasing US, Canadian and Australian imports which RTÉ subsequently broadcasts after midnight with low audience figures. TV3 {{argue that if}} made available, it could air such shows in prime-time slots. In the past such shows as Rookie Blue, Rescue Me, Big Love, United States of Tara, Tangle and The Secret Life <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> purchased by RTÉ and aired between 00:00 and 06:00 on RTÉ Two. RTÉ has argued that TV3 has rarely gone after {{the same types of}} imported programming and that such shows perform better than when broadcast in prime time on TV3.|$|E
25|$|The {{crisis in}} health and welfare {{services}} in our nation today highlights for NASW what many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> stressing for a long time: inherent in the responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for professional action. They are not disparate aspects of social work but merely two faces {{of the same coin}} to be spent on more and better services for the people who need our help. It is out of our belief in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.|$|E
500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyoncé {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in three different places... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the themes}} of This Addiction were heavily {{influenced}} by the band members' personal lives. Skiba remarked that [...] "The whole record is really personal, all three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> through quite a bit since our last album and it is all expressed through this, all the songs are about the relationships we've been in and so the record has a constant theme." [...] He cited this as another {{way in which the}} album recalls the band's earlier material: ...|$|E
2500|$|Biblical {{references}} {{appear in}} several forms. Chapter VI cites the Book of Job, ii. 13); {{there is an}} allusion to the elder brother in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, and Margaret paraphrases the definition of charity ("that spirit which suffereth long and is kind and seeketh not her own") (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 15) from the First Epistle to the Corinthians. However, Gaskell cautions against misuse; Bessy Higgins reads the Apocalypse to cope with her condition and interprets the parable of Dives and Lazarus so simplistically that Margaret counters vigorously: [...] "It won't be division enough, in that awful day, that some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> beggars here, and some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rich—we shall not be judged by that poor accident, but by our faithful following of Christ" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 19). Margaret and John follow a path of conversion which leads to reconciliation, acknowledging their [...] "unworthiness" [...] (Pollard, 1967). Margaret, who has the longest way to go, is crushed by guilt from her lie and by shame from being debased in Thornton's eyes (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 39). Francis de Sales encourages her to seek [...] "the way of humility" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 41), despite Mr. Bell's attempts to minimise and rationalise her lie as told in a panic. Thornton, {{on the brink of}} ruin like Job, tries not to be outraged while his mother rebels against the injustice of his situation ("Not for you, John! God has seen fit to be very hard on you, very") and gives fervent thanks for the [...] "great blessing" [...] his existence gives her (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 50).|$|E
2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position." ...|$|E

The GameCube version {{was also the}} runner-up in the November 2003 [...] "GameCube Game of the Month" [...] award, losing to [...] Boulding wrote [...] "the greatest strength of this Luxoflux game is the integration of story and layers of game design into one cohesive package." [...] He praised the gameplay, especially the Good Cop/Bad Cop system and the upgrades system. He also praised the absence of loading screens. However, he wrote of the graphics, [...] "there are far too many clipping issues that come up far too often to be ignored. Similarly, the camera ties into the clipping problems so {{that there will be}} times when the camera will float through and behind a wall or tree during a fight so that you can't see the action at all." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime is an enjoyable game if you can clear your mind of Grand Theft Auto expectations [...] It's a lot of fun despite the burden of the camera system and other technical glitches. It doesn't, nor should it, replace Grand Theft Auto by any means. True Crime has enough good to counter the bad and stand on its own." [...] Boulding and Tom McNamara scored the PC version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the multiplayer that many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> salivating for is almost disorientingly low-budget." [...] They were also critical of the controls and graphics, concluding [...] "the rich fighting component and the shooting and driving mechanics aren't translated well to the PC, with awkward controls, poor texture quality, and odd visual bugs. Plus, multiplayer, the hot magnet exclusive to the PC version, is decidedly half-baked." ...|$|E
