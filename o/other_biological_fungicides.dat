40|$|Effect of some Chemical and Biological Fungicides on Mycelial Growth and Disease Severity of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici. Fusarium {{is among}} the most {{aggressive}} telluric fungi causing wilt and root rots in several vegetable crops. A new disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici was recorded in southern Tunisia in the "Cinquième Saison" farm, situated in Hammet Gabès during 2000 - 2001 crop season. It caused death of up to 90 % of tomato plants in some greenhouses. In the present research, the effect of 3 chemical and 4 biological fungicides was tested in vitro on mycelial growth and in vivo on disease severity of F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici. Hymexazol, benomyl and manebe were used as chemical fungicides whereas four biological products, i. e. two based on Trichoderma harzianum, one on Bacillus subtilis and another one on Bacillus thuringiensis were also tested. Among the chemical fungicides which were used, hymexazol and benomyl were the most effective in vitro and inhibited mycelial growth up to 80 %. However, in vivo assays showed that only hymexazol was effective with a reduction in disease incidence of about 76 %. In vitro, the product based on B. thuringiensis entailed a mycelial growth inhibition of less than 20 %. This value is more than 75 % higher than what was obtained through the <b>other</b> <b>biological</b> <b>fungicides</b> based on either T. harzianum or in B. subtilis. The efficacy of the latter 2 biological fungicides was more important in vivo assays using inoculated tomato plants. Indeed, by the use of the product based on B. subtilis, the reduction of disease incidence exceeded 95 %. These results show that some biological fungicides can be used in controlling Fusarium crown and root rot of tomato...|$|E

After 12 months storage, protein content decreased accompanied by declined of lipid content, increased free fatty acids and activated lipoxygenase enzyme. In the case of <b>biological</b> <b>fungicide</b> coated seeds, the antioxidative scavenging enzymes were ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase and a high antioxidant activity protected them. Moreover, the sugar content was positive correlated with seed germination and vigor. The biological coated seeds were found to maintain high sugar contents inside the seeds, which resulted high seed storability significantly. In contrast, under fungicide stress (CA), those compounds were lost that directly affected seed vigor during storage...|$|R

40|$|White mold (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) is a {{major problem}} of the common bean in Brazil. Thus, the {{objective}} {{of this study was to}} verify the effectiveness of chemical <b>fungicides</b> and <b>biological</b> products (Trichoderma spp) for the control of white mold in a bean field with different plant population densities located in the Silvânia, Goiás State, Brazil, in the 2007 / 08 rain season. The experimental design was the randomized blocks, with four replicates and seven treatments. The treatments are consisting of two levels of plant population densities (240 and 120 thousand plants/ha - 1), chemical fungicides (carboxin-thiram and procymidone) and <b>biological</b> <b>fungicides</b> (Trichoderma spp), as well as untreated control. The results indicated that there was no significant interaction between bean population densities and chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>fungicides</b> applied to control S. sclerotiorum. The biological agent Trichoderma spp. is not effective in controlling S. sclerotiorum in common bean crop grown in the Brazilian “cerrado” region. Application of carboxin-thiram + procymidone was the most efficient treatment for the control of white mold on the common bean. Lower planting density is recommended for areas contaminated with S. sclerotiorum, as it can be easily associated with other control strategies. </p...|$|R

Recently, sengon productivity decreases due to pests and diseases, attack {{is caused by the}} fungus Uromycladium tepperianum (SACE.) McAlp. The control of gall rust disease at seedling level is important, because the stadia nursery are the most vulnerable. The aim of this research was to determine the effectiveness of the type of control in supressing the fungus of U. tepperianum and the growth of sengon in a nursery. The research design used a completely randomized design (CRD) with five treatments of gall rust disease control types i. e. control; biological fertilizer of Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) (5 g -L of water), biofungicide (5 g-L of water); chemical fungicide (2 g-L of water); and boron (300 ppm). Each treatment consisted of 20 seedlings repeated 4 times. The observed response were the number of fungal spores, diameter and height of seedlings. In addition, calculation of the effectiveness of the type of controller was counted. The results showed that after two weeks of fungal infections, the highest seedling growth was the seedling treated with fungicide (0. 53 cm), while the lowest was the seedling treated with <b>biological</b> <b>fungicide</b> (0. 32 cm).

50|$|Erysiphe cruciferarum is a fungal {{pathogen}} {{that belongs}} to the phylum Ascomycota. The pathogen overwinters in survival structures known as ascospores. The powdery mildew initially appears as white, powdery spots formed on leaf surfaces, shoots, and sometimes flowers or fruits. Over time, the spots spread over a larger area of leaves and stems. Eventually, leaves infected with powdery mildew may turn yellow in color and proceed to die or fall off. In some cases, fungal growth causes leaves to twist or distort in shape. Specifically, powdery mildew functions by decreasing the fruit production of plants. The ascospores survive on leaf material and cause it to fall onto the ground. Certain <b>biological</b> <b>fungicides,</b> such as Serenade or sulfur products, {{can be used on}} plants to inhibit powdery mildew infection.|$|R
40|$|Bacillus sp. 9912 mutant, 9912 D, was {{approved}} {{as a new}} <b>biological</b> <b>fungicide</b> agent by the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China in 2016 owing to its excellent inhibitory effect on various plant pathogens and being environment-friendly. Here, we present the genome of 9912 D with a circular chromosome having 4436 coding DNA sequences (CDSs), and a circular plasmid encoding 59 CDSs. This strain was finally designated as Bacillus velezensis based on phylogenomic analyses. Genome analysis revealed a total of 19 candidate gene clusters involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, including potential new type II antibiotics. The absence of fengycin biosynthetic gene cluster is noteworthy. Our data offer insights into the genetic, biological and physiological characteristics of this strain and aid in deeper understanding of its biocontrol mechanism. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.
