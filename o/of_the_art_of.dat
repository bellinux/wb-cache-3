5|$|Political Economy, {{the first}} edition {{published}} in 1883, {{was one of the}} most widely used textbooks of the 19th century as a component of the American Science Series. Robert Solow criticized the third edition (1888) for being devoid of facts, figures, and mostly full of off-the-cuff judgments on the practices and capacities of Native Americans and immigrants, but generally embodying the state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> economics at the time.|$|E
5|$|There {{also are}} various altars and sculptures used as {{decoration}} in the facades of buildings; most Quiriguá monuments have a grand formal monumentality that is rather stiff {{compared to the}} naturalistic grace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> some other Maya sites. Traces of red pigment have been found {{on some of the}} monuments and most of the monuments were likely to have been painted red, the colour of birth, sacrifice, and renewal.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} the state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing {{a path of}} technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock {{in the center and}} a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E

5|$|Custine's son, Renaud-Louis-Philippe-Francois, (b. in Paris in 1768 {{and died}} 3 January 1794), also called Armand, was a captain {{in one of}} the regiments in the Army of the Rhine. As a young man, he had {{traveled}} widely, and made a long study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> war in Berlin. Comte de Mirabeau, ever the politician, predicted that the young Custine would become a well-respected diplomat. By 1792, Armand was Nicholas Luckner's aide-de-camp; following Luckner's dismissal, he entered a brief embassy duty in Berlin in 1792 as chargé de affaires and eventually, as diplomatic relations between France and the rest of Europe became strained, he was a hostage for the safe return of Prussian and Austrian diplomats in Paris. His deceased mother had left him capital of 700,000 livres, making him a wealthy young man; it was assumed that his father would also settle a suitable amount on him upon his marriage as well as the family estates in Niderviller, which included six farms.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} statues of Amenhotep have been found, {{but they are}} mostly from the Ramesside period and relate to his {{continuing}} funerary cult, made for his posthumous funerary cult. This makes study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> his reign difficult. Based upon his few authentic statues, it appears that Amenhotep continued the practice of copying Middle Kingdom styles. Art in the early 18th dynasty was particularly {{similar to that of}} the early Middle Kingdom, and the statues produced by Amenhotep I clearly copied those of Mentuhotep II and Senusret I. The two types are so similar that modern Egyptologists have had trouble telling the two apart.|$|E
5|$|Sun Tzu's historicity is uncertain. Sima Qian {{and other}} {{traditional}} historians placed {{him as a}} minister to King Helü of Wu and dated his lifetime to 544–496 BC. Modern scholars accepting his historicity nonetheless place the existing text <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> War in the later Warring States period based upon its style of composition and its descriptions of warfare. Traditional accounts state that the general's descendant Sun Bin also wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled The Art of War. Since both Sun Wu and Sun Bin were referred to as Sun Tzu in classical Chinese texts, some historians believed them identical prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin's treatise in 1972.|$|E

5|$|The Silver Age {{coincided with}} the rise of pop art, an artistic {{movement}} that used popular cultural artifacts, such as advertising and packaging, as source material for fine, or gallery-exhibited, art. Roy Lichtenstein, one of the best-known pop art painters, specifically chose individual panels from comic books and repainted the images, modifying them to some extent in the process but including in the painting word and thought balloons and captions as well as enlarged-to-scale color dots imitating the coloring process then used in newsprint comic books. An exhibition of comic strip art was held at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs of the Palais de Louvre in 1967, and books were soon published that contained serious discussions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> comics {{and the nature of the}} medium.|$|E
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of The Rescuers signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first chances to prove themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), the animation for which was directed by Don Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|At that time, Antoine had {{a student}} named Martin Jeanfils, an {{employee}} at the Corbeau coal. A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> healing. Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply {{put his hand on the}} forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment. Adjourned, The judgment was adjourned and was finally, on 21 June 1907, President Hamoir acquitted the two men, who were absent in court then. Following an appeal by the prosecutor, Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907. The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment, analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal art of healing, claiming that it was not what Antoine did. On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E
