BS Zelda was the first Satellaview game to feature a [...] "SoundLink" [...] soundtrack—a streaming audio track through which, every few minutes, players were cautioned to listen carefully as a voice actor narrator, broadcasting live from the St.GIGA studio, would give them plot and gameplay clues. In addition to the SoundLink elements, BS Zelda also featured updated 16-bit graphics, a smaller overworld, and different dungeons. Link was replaced by one of the two Satellaview avatars: a boy wearing a backward baseball cap <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> with red hair.|$|E
500|$|By {{the latter}} part of the 19th century Kilham {{consisted}} of a large farm with farmhouse and two rows of cottages for the farm's workforce. [...] There was, in addition, a smithy and a post office. [...] To the south, Thompson's Walls was by 1800 an estate with a farm complex laid out around a square courtyard. [...] Hemp and flax were grown, and a small mill is shown on maps from the 1860s onwards. The adoption of new agricultural techniques and improvements to the area's transport infrastructure resulted in greater prosperity for Kilham's farming community in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Enclosure of common land was intended to increase efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production, and Howtel Common was enclosed in 1779. Female bondagers, or outworkers, were employed to work in the fields up to the end of the 19th century. [...] The system was recorded in the Scottish Borders as early as 1656, and subsequently spread into Glendale. [...] Agricultural labourers, known as hinds, were required to provide a female, often a relative <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> living with the hind's family, who would be on call as a day labourer whenever required. [...] The bondager's work was regarded as paying the rent of the hind's cottage.|$|E

2500|$|Scharnhorst {{writes that}} Alger [...] "exercised a certain {{discretion}} in discussing his probable homosexuality" [...] and {{was known to}} have mentioned his sexuality only once after the Brewster incident. In 1870 the elder Henry James wrote that Alger [...] "talks freely about his own late insanity—which he in fact appears to enjoy as a subject of conversation". Although Alger was willing to speak to James, his sexuality was a closely guarded secret. According to Scharnhorst, Alger made veiled references to homosexuality in his boys' books, and these references, Scharnhorst speculates, indicate Alger was [...] "insecure with his sexual orientation". Alger wrote, for example, {{that it was difficult}} to distinguish whether Tattered Tom was a boy <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> and in other instances he introduces foppish, effeminate, lisping [...] "stereotypical homosexuals" [...] who are treated with scorn and pity by others. In Silas Snobden's Office Boy, a kidnapped boy disguised as a girl is threatened with being sent to the [...] "insane asylum" [...] if he should reveal his actual sex. Scharnhorst believes Alger's desire to atone for his [...] "secret sin" [...] may have [...] "spurred him to identify his own charitable acts of writing didactic books for boys with the acts of the charitable patrons in his books who wish to atone for a secret sin in their past by aiding the hero". Scharnhorst points out that the patron in Try and Trust, for example, conceals a [...] "sad secret" [...] from which he is redeemed only after saving the hero's life.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disparity}} in the gender ratio at birth increases dramatically {{after the first}} birth, for which the ratios remained steadily within the natural baseline over the 20 year interval between 1980 and 1999. Thus, {{a large majority of}} couples appear to accept the outcome of the first pregnancy, whether it is a boy <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> If the first child is a girl, and they are able to have a second child, then a couple may take extraordinary steps to assure that the second child is a boy. If a couple already has two or more boys, the sex ratio of higher parity births swings decidedly in a feminine direction. This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly value having male offspring, a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often comes into play. [...] reported a study based on the 1990 census in which they found sex ratios of just 65 or 70 boys per 100 girls for births in families that already had two or more boys. [...] A study by [...] found a similar pattern among both Han and non-Han nationalities in Xinjiang Province: a strong preference for girls in high parity births in families that had already borne two or more boys. [...] This tendency to favour girls in high parity births to couples who had already borne sons was later also noted by Coale and Banister, who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males, it was also much {{more likely to engage in}} [...] "stopping behavior", i.e., to stop having more children.|$|E
2500|$|Virtually all {{societies}} {{have had a}} concept {{of the crime of}} rape. Although what constituted this crime has varied by historical period and culture, until quite recently, the definitions tended to focus around an act of forced vaginal intercourse perpetrated through physical violence or imminent threat of death or severe bodily injury, by a man, on a woman <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl,</b> not his wife. These definitions differ significantly from the modern definitions of rape in Western countries today. For example, the actus reus of the crime, was, in most societies, the insertion of the penis into the vagina, and, until the 19th century, many jurisdictions required ejaculation for the act to constitute the offense of rape. Acts other than vaginal intercourse did not constitute rape in common law countries and in many other societies. In many cultures, such acts were illegal, even if they were consensual and performed between married couples (see sodomy laws). In England, for example, the Buggery Act 1533, which remained in force until 1828, provided for the death penalty for [...] "buggery". Many countries criminalized [...] "non-traditional" [...] forms of sexual activity well into the modern era: notably, in the U.S. state of Idaho, sodomy between consensual partners was punishable by a term of five years to life in prison as late as 2003, and this law was only ruled to be inapplicable to married couples in 1995. Today, in many countries, the definition of the actus reus has been extended to all forms of penetration of the vagina and anus (e.g. penetration with objects, fingers or other body parts) as well as insertion of the penis in the mouth.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward to explain the enduring appeal of the target girl. These range from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the hero's ordeal, in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril. [...] Jim Steinmeyer, a noted illusion designer who has written well-regarded books {{on the history of}} magic, has identified a fashion for female peril as entertainment in the post-First World War period. Steinmeyer has written that P. T. Selbit's stage debut of the Sawing Through A Woman illusion in 1921 marked the beginning of a trend for women as the victims of choice for acts simulating danger or torture. While Steinmeyer focuses on stage magic and attributes some of the trend to practical factors, he also points to a broader pattern in entertainment generally, which he links to social trends. He concludes that: [...] "...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment". A further view on historical trends is provided by performer and blogger Ula the Painproof Rubbergirl, who has acted as a target girl for New York-based knife thrower The Great Throwdini. In an extensive article on her experiences and philosophical approach to the art she notes: [...] "Knife throwing is an old act. So is high wire. And rodeo. And stone throwing, witch burning, beheading, Roman gladiators, jousting, dog fights,you name it - we, humans, love it. And we love a vulnerable woman. Isn't there something oddly attractive about the woman in danger?
