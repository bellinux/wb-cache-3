5|$|Operation Barbarossa, the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, began on 22June 1941. On the same day, the Ustaše began arresting communists and their known sympathisers in the towns of Bosanska Krajina, including Prijedor. The communists had predicted this, {{and most of them}} avoided capture by escaping to the villages or hiding in the towns. Stojanović {{was one of the few}} communists arrested in Prijedor. He was imprisoned with the Serb hostages on the second floor of a school in the town. They were subjected to forced labour, being led each morning through the town to repair the road to Kozarac. The column <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> was usually headed by Stojanović carrying a shovel on his shoulder. The Croatian Home Guards guarding the prison treated him well. While detained, Stojanović lectured a group <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> about Marxism.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a treaty}} between John Hunyadi and Đorđe Branković, Despot of Serbia, Matthias and the Despot's grand{{daughter}} Elizabeth of Celje were engaged on 7 August 1451. Elizabeth {{was the daughter}} of Ulrich II, Count of Celje, who was related to King Ladislaus V of Hungary and an opponent of Matthias's father. Because of new conflicts between Hunyadi and Ulrich of Celje, the marriage of their children only took place in 1455. Elizabeth settled in the Hunyadis' estates but Matthias was soon sent to the royal court, implying that their marriage was a hidden exchange <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> between their families. Elizabeth died before the end of 1455.|$|E
5|$|The Kragujevac {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} murder of between 2,778 and 2,794mostly Serb {{men and boys}} in Kragujevac by German soldiers on 21October 1941. It occurred in the German-occupied territory of Serbia during World War II, and came in reprisal for insurgent attacks in the Gornji Milanovac district {{that resulted in the}} deaths of 10German soldiers and the wounding of 26others. The number <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> to be shot was calculated as a ratio of 100hostages executed for every German soldier killed and 50hostages executed for every German soldier wounded, a formula devised by Adolf Hitler with the intent of suppressing anti-Nazi resistance in Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|The Kraljevo {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} murder of approximately 2,000 {{residents of the}} central Serbian city of Kraljevo by the Wehrmacht between 15 and 20 October 1941, during World War II. The massacre came in reprisal for a joint Partisan–Chetnik attack on a German garrison in which 10 German soldiers were killed and 14 wounded. The number <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> to be shot was calculated based on a ratio of 100hostages executed for every German soldier killed and 50hostages executed for every German soldier wounded, a formula devised by Adolf Hitler {{with the intent of}} suppressing anti-Nazi resistance in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of an}} American unified special {{operations}} command had its origins {{in the aftermath of}} Operation Eagle Claw, the disastrous attempted rescue <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> at the American embassy in Iran in 1980. The ensuing investigation, chaired by Admiral James L. Holloway III, the retired Chief of Naval Operations, cited lack of command and control and inter-service coordination as significant factors in the failure of the mission. Since its activation on 16 April 1987, U.S. Special Operations Command has participated in many operations, from the 1989 invasion of Panama to the ongoing Global War on Terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Coleman Reese, an {{accountant}} at Wayne Enterprises, deduces that Bruce is Batman {{and tries to}} go public with the information. After observing the unpredictability of the Joker, Maroni informs Commissioner Gordon of the Joker's location. The Joker sets fire to the mob's money, burning Lau alive in the process, and kills the Chechen. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The Joker finds Dent in Gotham General and manipulates him into seeking revenge for Rachel's death on Gotham's corrupt systems. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload <b>of</b> <b>hostages.</b> Dent goes on a killing spree based on a coin flip and targets people he holds responsible for Rachel's death, killing Wuertz and Maroni while sparing Ramirez.|$|E

It explores the role of Personality, Decision-Making Style, Coping Style, Cognitive Coping Style and Emotion Regulation and Emotional Intelligence within high stress environments and occupations. The findings suggest that certain individual traits and characteristics {{may play a role in}} negotiator success, via the mediation of specific styles, which are conducive to effective crisis negotiation skills. It is proposed that these findings have application within the field of hostage/crisis negotiation in the format of guidance regarding the recruitment and selection <b>of</b> <b>hostage</b> negotiators and the identification of potential training needs within individual negotiators in order to maximise their efficacy within the field. In line with this, it is argued that a psychometric tool that assesses these constructs is developed in order to aid the process <b>of</b> <b>hostage</b> negotiation selection...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} major {{operations}} in which the ships were involved was Operation Eagle Claw launched by USS Nimitz in 1980 after she had deployed to the Indian Ocean {{in response to the}} taking <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> in the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Although initially part of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Eisenhower relieved Nimitz in this operation after her service in the Mediterranean Sea. Nimitz conducted a Freedom of Navigation exercise alongside the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra, near Libya. During this exercise, two of the ship's F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan aircraft in {{what became known as the}} Gulf of Sidra incident. In 1987, Vinson participated in the first U.S. carrier deployment in the Bering Sea, and Nimitz provided security during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} collaborationist {{military}} and paramilitary units, the SDS was {{used against the}} Partisans operating within the occupied territory. In late 1941, prior {{to the formation of}} the SDS, the Serbian gendarmerie had participated in the German-led Operation Uzice, which drove the Partisans and Chetniks from the Užice area. The SDS routinely executed captured Partisans, and frequently took and murdered hostages in towns and villages. The SDS also included former members of the gendarmerie that had assisted German troops to round up hostages to be shot at both Kraljevo and Kragujevac in October 1941. In July 1941, the Banjica concentration camp had been established in the suburbs of Belgrade. It was initially guarded by both the Gestapo and the SDS, but sole responsibility was eventually transferred to the SDS, who behaved sadistically and violently towards the inmates. Survivors of the camp stated that executions at the camp were carried out by both the Belgrade Special Police and the SDS, and that those executed included children. A total of 3,849 people were killed at the camp before it was closed on 3 October 1944. The SDS became increasingly unpopular with the population as time went on. Despite their limited independence, the SDS actively engaged in dehumanising Jews, Roma and communist Serbs, and in killing people from those groups or delivering them to the Germans for execution. They engaged in the execution <b>of</b> <b>hostages</b> both under Gestapo or Wehrmacht control and at their own initiative. The SDS clashed with other collaborationist formations at times, specifically Dimitrije Ljotić's Serbian Volunteer Corps (Srpski dobrovoljački korpus or SDK), and the Pećanac Chetniks loyal to vojvoda Kosta Pećanac.|$|E
5|$|At 3:50 pm {{the prisoners}} left H7, {{and the driver}} and a prison orderly were taken back to the lorry, and the driver's foot tied to the clutch. 37 prisoners climbed {{into the back of}} the lorry, while Kelly lay on the floor of the cab with a gun pointed at the driver, who was also told the cab had been booby trapped with a hand grenade. At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners {{intended}} to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage. At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number <b>of</b> <b>hostages.</b> Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, and before he could raise the alarm he collapsed.|$|E
