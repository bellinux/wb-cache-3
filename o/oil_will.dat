5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E

25|$|In the Kyrgyz Republic, {{the gate}} price of heating oil is $50 per ton at the {{refinery}} {{in the south}} of the country. Bringing it to the north by rail, however, may cost as much as $27–30 because it must pass through Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan. That means <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> sell for about $90 in the north. For coal, the share of transport costs in the final price is even higher.|$|E
25|$|Petronas is {{also the}} {{custodian}} {{of oil and gas}} reserves for Malaysia. Hence, all oil and gas activities are regulated by Petronas. Malaysia encourages foreign oil company participation through production sharing contracts, in which significant amount of <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> be given away to the foreign oil company until it reaches a production milestone. Currently, many major oil companies such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Nippon Oil, and Murphy Oil are involved in such contracts. As a result, 40% of oil fields in Malaysia are developed.|$|E
25|$|During a 6-year period, this {{agreement}} envisages broad autonomy {{for the south}} of Sudan which will have its own government and an autonomous army. At {{the end of this}} period, a self-determination referendum will be organized. The income resulting from <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> be shared in equal share between the south and north. In addition, the government will have 70% of the positions in the central administration against 30% for the southern rebels. Lastly, the Sharia (Islamic law) will be into force only in the north of the country, with Muslim majority. It will not be applied in the south, having a Christian and animist majority.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} various {{molecules}} in an oil sample {{can be determined}} by laboratory analysis. The molecules are typically extracted in a solvent, then separated in a gas chromatograph, and finally determined with a suitable detector, such as a flame ionization detector or a mass spectrometer. Due to {{the large number of}} co-eluted hydrocarbons within oil, many cannot be resolved by traditional gas chromatography and typically appear as a hump in the chromatogram. This unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil. Some of the component of <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> mix with water: the water associated fraction of the oil.|$|E
25|$|Solidifying: Solidifiers are {{composed}} of tiny, floating, dry ice pellets, and hydrophobic polymers that both adsorb and absorb. They clean up oil spills by changing the physical state of spilled oil from liquid to a solid, semi-solid or a rubber-like material that floats on water. Solidifiers are insoluble in water, therefore {{the removal of the}} solidified oil is easy and the <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> not leach out. Solidifiers have been proven to be relatively non-toxic to aquatic and wild life and have been proven to suppress harmful vapors commonly associated with hydrocarbons such as Benzene, Xylene, Methyl Ethyl, Acetone and Naphtha. The reaction time for solidification of oil is controlled by the surface area or size of the polymer or dry pellets as well as the viscosity and thickness of the oil layer. Some solidifier product manufactures claim the solidified oil can be thawed and used if frozen with dry ice or disposed of in landfills, recycled as an additive in asphalt or rubber products, or burned as a low ash fuel. A solidifier called C.I.Agent (manufactured by C.I.Agent Solutions of Louisville, Kentucky) is being used by BP in granular form, as well as in Marine and Sheen Booms at Dauphin Island and Fort Morgan, Alabama, to aid in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill cleanup.|$|E
500|$|However, if {{the food}} is cooked in the oil for too long, much of the water will be lost and the <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> begin to {{penetrate}} the food. The correct frying temperature depends on the thickness and type of food, {{but in most cases}} it lies between [...] An informal test for a temperature close to this range involves adding a tiny amount of flour into the oil and watching to see if it sizzles without immediately burning. A second test involves adding one piece of food to deep fry and watching it sink somewhat and rise back up. Sinking without resurfacing indicates that the oil is too cold; not sinking at all indicates that the oil is too hot.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, {{the period}} of {{economic}} prosperity for Venezuela was relatively short-lived. [...] As Venezuelan oil minister and OPEC co-founder Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo had presciently warned in 1976: [...] "Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> bring us ruin... It is the devil's excrement." [...] This was the case during the [...] "1980s oil glut". OPEC member countries were not adhering strictly to their assigned quotas, and once again oil prices plummeted.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2001, oil {{remained}} on or under {{more than half}} the sound's beaches, according to a 2001 federal survey. The government-created Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council concluded that the oil disappears at less than 4 percent per year, adding that the <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> [...] "take decades and possibly centuries to disappear entirely". Of the 27 species monitored by the Council, 17 have not recovered. While the salmon population has rebounded, and the orca whales are recovering, the herring population and fishing industry have not.|$|E

A similar deal was struck with Ecuador where Venezuela agreed to refine [...] of crude oil from Ecuador at discount prices. Cuba agreed to let thousands of Venezuelans be received for medical treatment and health programs, and in turn, Venezuela agreed to sell several thousands of barrels to Cuba at a 40% discount under Petrocaribe program.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transition}} {{can start}} with biodiesel, vegetable oil refining, and vegetable oil blends, since these technologies do not require the capital outlay of converting an engine to run on vegetable oils. [...] Because it costs to convert vegetable oil into biodiesel {{it is expected that}} vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> always be cheaper than biodiesel. [...] After there are production cars that can use straight vegetable oil and a standard type available at gas stations, consumers will probably choose straight vegetable oil to save money. [...] So the transition to vegetable oil can happen gradually.|$|E
2500|$|The rate {{of loss of}} {{moisture}} can be controlled by coating the planks with any substance that is relatively impermeable to moisture; ordinary mineral oil is usually quite effective. Coating the ends of logs with oil or thick paint improves their quality upon drying. Wrapping planks or logs in materials which will allow some movement {{of moisture}}, generally works very well provided the wood is first treated against fungal infection by coating in petrol/gasoline or oil. Mineral <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> generally not soak in more than 1–2mm below the surface and is easily removed by planing when the timber is suitably dry.|$|E

30|$|From {{the point}} of view of IEA, obviously, the {{fundamental}} factor is still a big driver influencing the fluctuations of international Brent crude oil prices. Two scenarios can be set up to analyze the development of oil prices: low development scenario and high development scenario. The high reservoir development scenario means that if new oil projects are to be launched, worries about low reserve <b>oil</b> production capacity <b>will</b> be eased, and the crude <b>oil</b> futures curve <b>will</b> be more resilient. Thus, the international Brent crude <b>oil</b> prices <b>will</b> slowly rise along the forecast results of VEC. The low reservoir development scenario means that if new oil projects continue to be blocked, the reserve crude <b>oil</b> production capacity <b>will</b> further reduce. Thus, the increased fluctuations of <b>oil</b> prices <b>will</b> accelerate along the forecast results of VAR. Overall, from the forecast trends of international Brent crude oil prices from September 2017 to December 2022, both VAR and VEC models have good forecast effects, which are coincide with the possible future developments in the international oil market and the international oil prices.|$|R
2500|$|Kudryavtsev's Rule {{has been}} {{explained}} {{for oil and}} gas (not coal)—gas deposits which are below oil deposits can be created from that oil or its source rocks. [...] Because natural gas is less dense than oil, as kerogen and hydrocarbons are generating gas the gas fills the top of the available space. [...] Oil is forced down, and can reach the spill point where oil leaks around the edge(s) of the formation and flows upward. [...] If the original formation becomes completely filled with gas then all the <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> have leaked above the original location.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{before its}} completion, the {{pipeline}} {{was having an}} effect on the world's petroleum politics. The South Caucasus, previously seen as Russia's backyard, is now a region of great strategic significance. The U.S. and other Western nations have become much more involved in the affairs of the three nations through which <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> flow. [...] The countries have been trying to use the involvement as a counterbalance to Russian and Iranian economic and military dominance in the region. [...] Russian specialists claim that the pipeline will weaken the Russian influence in the Caucasus. The Russian Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee chairman [...] stated that the United States and other Western countries are planning to station soldiers in the Caucasus on the pretext of instability in regions through which the pipeline passes.|$|E
2500|$|The CPEC will connect Pakistan with China and the Central Asian {{countries}} with highway connecting Kashgar to Khunjerab and Gwadar. Gwadar port in southern Pakistan {{will serve as}} the trade nerve center for China, as most of its trade especially that of <b>oil</b> <b>will</b> be done through the port, which is operated by the China Overseas Port Holding Company, a state-owned Chinese company. Currently, sixty percent of China’s oil must be transported by ship from the Persian Gulf to the only commercial port in China, Shanghai, a distance of more than 16,000 kilometres. The journey takes two to three months, during which time the ships are vulnerable to pirates, bad weather, political rivals and other risks. Using Gwadar port instead would reduce the distance and possibly the cost.|$|E
