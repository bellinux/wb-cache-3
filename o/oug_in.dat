40|$|Abstract This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{constructing}} a minimum-weight spanning tree (MST) in a dis-tributed network. This {{is one of the}} most important problems in the area of distributed computing. There is a long line of gradually improving protocols for this problem, and the state of the art today isa protocol with running time O(Λ (G) + pn * log * n) due to Kutten and Peleg [22], where Λ (G) denotesthe diameter of the graph G. Peleg and Rubinovich [29] have shown that Ω (pn) time is required forconstructing an MST even on graphs of small diameter, and claimed that their result &quot;establishes the asymptotic near-optimality &quot; of the protocol of [22]. In this paper we refine this claim, and devise a protocol that constructs the MST <b>in</b> <b>O(u(G,!)</b> +pn) rounds, where u(G,!) is the MST-radius of the graph. The ratio between the diameter and the MST-radius may be as large as Θ (n), and, consequently, on some inputs our protocol is faster than theprotocol of [22] by a factor of Ω (p n). Also, on every input, the running time of our protocol is nevergreater than twice the running time of the protocol of [22]...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Two {{clinical}} trials {{to assess the}} efficacy of two topical beta-blocker preparations involved the recruitment of 60 and 40 patients respectively. The greatest obstacle encountered in carrying out the trials was recruiting patients. This difficulty is reported in detail and comparisons are made {{with the experience of}} others who have met similar problems. All who have carried out clinical research will be aware that the recruitment of patients often pose: major difficulties. It is only too easy to overestimate the number of patients who will both agree to take part in any study and will satisfy the inclusion criteria However, in spite of this difficulty being common place, there is little information in the ophthalmic literature on the likely scale of the problem. Wc therefore took the opportunity of documenting the erosion of the number of patients originally identi fied as possibly being suitable for inclusion in tw(studies of the efficacy of two beta-blocker drugs. <b>OuG</b> aim <b>in</b> quantifying the problems encountered is tc give guidance to others undertaking similar studies. The trials involved recruiting a statistically deter mined number of patients to allow comparison {{of the effects of the}} two preparations in the treatment o patients with either chronic open-angle glaucoma o 0 ocular hypertension. The first study was a single masked randomised crossover trial. The 60 patient were required to attend hospital on five occasions al three weekly intervals over a 12 -week period. Or three of these visits patients were required to arrive al the hospital at 9 am and stay until 5 pm. On the tw(remaining visits patients needed to spend no longer than half an hour in the hospital. The second study was a randomised evaluation or both preparations in which the patients received onlI one of the drugs over a period of 12 months. The 4 (patients were required to attend hospital for between 30 minutes and 2 hours on six occasions...|$|R
40|$|Data on job {{satisfaction}} in Waves 1 - 7 of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) {{were reduced to}} scores for 33, 249 observations by means of non-linear principal components analysis. Overall {{job satisfaction}} gradients are defined for Major Groups and Minor Groups of occupations in the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). Taking account of the theoretical difference between material aspects and quality of work-life aspects of job satisfaction, detailed profiles based {{on the degree of}} congruence of these modes, as well their level, in occupational unit groups (OUGs) are provided. Stark contrasts are drawn between fortunate OUGs where levels of both modes of satisfaction are high and disfavoured OUGs where both are low. Cases where there is non-congruence, occasionally extreme, between the modes are listed. While consistent with earlier accounts of alienation in industrial settings, the findings require more comprehensive forms of explanation making use of established findings about the correlates of job satisfaction. Regression analysis shows that, in many cases, levels of satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>OUGs</b> can be accounted for largely in terms of individual or organisational variables. However, significant occupational effects remain for a large minority of OUGs. Industry is discounted as a major influence on job satisfaction. The importance for allocation in SOC of skill levels and skills specialisation allows further examination of the influence of skill discrepancy on employee attitudes, producing results closely in line with previous findings. In concluding, the scope for more general explanations of job satisfaction in terms of relative deprivation are suggested, methods for predicting trends in job satisfaction are outlined, and occupational groups [...] ...|$|R
