40|$|Inspired by {{the motion}} <b>of</b> {{biological}} <b>snakes,</b> {{this paper presents}} an overview of recent results in modelling and control <b>of</b> <b>snake</b> robots. The objective of the research underlying {{this paper is to}} contribute to the mathematical foundation of the control theory <b>of</b> <b>snake</b> robots. To this end, the paper presents two mathematical models <b>of</b> planar <b>snake</b> robot dynamics, which are employed to investigate stabilisability and controllability properties <b>of</b> <b>snake</b> robots. Furthermore, averaging theory is used to derive properties of the velocity dynamics <b>of</b> <b>snake</b> robots. Moreover, a straight line path following controller is proposed and cascaded systems theory is employed to prove that the controller K-exponentially stabilizes a snake robot to any desired straight path...|$|R
2500|$|The {{first wave}} in 2005 {{contained}} a Snake Eyes figure. A [...] "Ninja Showdown" [...] battle pack also contained alternate versions <b>of</b> <b>Snake</b> Eyes and Storm Shadow. In 2006, {{all of the}} 2005 figures were re-released with new molds and accessories, including four different versions <b>of</b> <b>Snake</b> Eyes. A new version <b>of</b> <b>Snake</b> Eyes was also released in 2007.|$|R
5|$|Black mambas are {{generally}} solitary, but not strictly so; {{as a rule}} they interact very little except in male rivalry during the mating season. However, black mambas are well known to share retreats occasionally, either with other mambas, or sometimes with other species <b>of</b> <b>snakes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hox genes {{determine}} where repeating parts, {{such as the}} many vertebrae <b>of</b> <b>snakes,</b> will grow in a developing embryo or larva. Pax-6, already mentioned, is a classic toolkit gene. Homeobox genes are also found in plants, implying they are common to all eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Leptotyphlopidae is {{a family}} <b>of</b> <b>snakes</b> found in North and South America, Africa, and Asia. All are fossorial and adapted to burrowing, feeding on ants and termites. One species has been {{recorded}} in Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
50|$|Roger Conant is {{credited}} with describing numerous new species <b>of</b> <b>snake,</b> including several species <b>of</b> water <b>snake</b> (<b>of</b> the genus Nerodia) {{as well as several}} species <b>of</b> garter <b>snake</b> (<b>of</b> the genus Thamnophis). He collaborated with Howard K. Gloyd, and finished Gloyd's monograph on Agkistrodon snakes after Gloyd's death in 1978.|$|R

5|$|Swifts {{spend most}} of their time in flight. Few birds have the {{necessary}} speed and agility to catch them, hobbies being the main exception. The nest sites are also usually sufficiently inaccessible to be beyond the reach <b>of</b> <b>snakes</b> or mammalian predators.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Bad News Brown and Jake Roberts {{began when}} Roberts sent Brown a {{birthday}} present on the April 22 episode of Wrestling Challenge. Upon opening the package, Brown found a rubber snake; {{it was revealed that}} Brown was afraid <b>of</b> <b>snakes.</b> On the May 5 episode of WWF Superstars, the two men agreed to a match; Brown later claimed that his fear <b>of</b> <b>snakes</b> was cured, although he was quickly proven wrong. On the July 28 episode of WWF Superstars, it was announced that Brown and Roberts face each other at SummerSlam with the Big Boss Man as a special referee. Brown also announced that he would bring 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats to counteract Roberts's boa constrictor, Damien.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Bungarus species, who are {{primarily}} snake-eaters, the many-banded krait usually feeds on fish, {{but it is}} also preys on other species <b>of</b> <b>snakes,</b> including members of its own species. This species also feeds on rodents, eels, frogs, and occasionally lizards.|$|E

5|$|Elephants, lions, buffalo, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, giraffes, antelopes, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, {{and many}} species <b>of</b> <b>snakes</b> are found here, {{although}} most large carnivore populations have been drastically reduced {{since the early}} 20th century. Elephant poaching, particularly {{in the south of}} the country in areas such as Zakouma National Park, is a severe problem. The small group of surviving West African crocodiles in the Ennedi Plateau represents one of the last colonies known in the Sahara today.|$|E
5|$|In {{certain areas}} in North America, where the {{diversity}} <b>of</b> <b>snakes</b> {{is not too}} large, easy keys based on simple identification of scales have been devised for the lay public to distinguish venomous snakes from non-venomous snakes. In other places with large biodiversity, such as Myanmar, publications caution that venomous and non-venomous snakes cannot be easily distinguished apart without careful examination.|$|E
5|$|Manasā, also Mansā Devi, is a Hindu folk goddess <b>of</b> <b>snakes,</b> worshipped {{mainly in}} Bengal {{and other parts}} of North and northeastern India, chiefly for the {{prevention}} and cure of snakebite and also for fertility and prosperity. Manasa is the sister of Vasuki, king of Nāgas (snakes) and wife of sage Jagatkāru (Jaratkāru). She is also known as Vishahara (the destroyer of poison), Nityā (eternal) and Padmavati.|$|E

5|$|Michigan, one of {{the fifty}} United States, is home to two types of lizards, {{nineteen}} types <b>of</b> <b>snakes</b> and eleven types of turtles, {{all members of the}} class Reptilia. Reptiles are found throughout Michigan, although the only venomous species, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, is seen only in the Lower Peninsula. Reptiles are cold-blooded, and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in frost-free areas, such as underground burrows (for snakes and land-dwelling turtles) or the bottoms of lakes and streams (for water-dwelling turtles). Most reptiles in Michigan are protected by state law, but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case <b>of</b> <b>snakes,</b> indiscriminate killing by fearful humans. In 1995, the painted turtle was named as Michigan's state reptile.|$|E
5|$|Moulting {{serves a}} number of {{functions}} – firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. Renewal of the skin by moulting is supposed to allow growth in some animals such as insects, however this view has been disputed in the case <b>of</b> <b>snakes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{have been}} {{part and parcel of}} culture and religion. Vivid scale {{patterns}} have been thought to have influenced early art. The use of snake-skin in manufacture of purses, apparel and other articles led to large-scale killing <b>of</b> <b>snakes,</b> giving rise to advocacy for use of artificial snake-skin. Snake scales are also to be found as motifs in fiction, art and films.|$|E

5|$|Snakes on a Plane is a 2006 American action thriller film {{directed}} by David R. Ellis and starring Samuel L. Jackson. It {{was released by}} New Line Cinema on August 18, 2006, in North America. The film was written by David Dalessandro, John Heffernan, and Sheldon Turner and follows the events of hundreds <b>of</b> <b>snakes</b> being released on a passenger plane {{in an attempt to}} kill a trial witness.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch; Barry White, who had expressed a wish {{to appear in the}} show, guest stars as himself. It was pitched by George Meyer, who wanted to create an episode against the mistreatment <b>of</b> <b>snakes</b> (the episode ended up winning a Genesis Award). The episode includes the first appearance of Superintendent Chalmers, and it features an Itchy & Scratchy parody of Oliver Stone's film JFK.|$|E
5|$|The {{human brain}} is {{provided}} with information about light, sound, the chemical composition of the atmosphere, temperature, head orientation, limb position, the chemical composition of the bloodstream, and more.
