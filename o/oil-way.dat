40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{measurement}} of the high pressure side flow in hydraulic system {{is still one of}} the important and difficult problems in hydraulic test technique. In order to solve the dynamic coupling mechanism between main and bypass <b>oil-way</b> fluid flow signals in the bypass flow measurement method, hydraulic system software was used to analysis the problem in this paper, the dynamic coupling relationship between main and bypass <b>oil-way</b> fluid flow signals were obtained. Finally verify the feasibility of the bypass flow measurement method. Analysis method and process Element initial parameters: components initial parameters in the simulation model are shown in table 1.
