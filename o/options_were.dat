5|$|After the ten-day campaign, the Israelis were {{military}} {{superior to}} their enemies and the Cabinet subsequently considered {{where and when}} to attack next. Three <b>options</b> <b>were</b> offered: attacking the Arabic enclave in Galilee held by the Arab Liberation Army; moving eastward {{as far as possible}} in Samarian and Judean areas, taken by the Iraqis and Jordanians; or attacking southern Negev taken by the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Orioles signed {{free agent}} shortstop Mike Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to third base permanently. General manager Pat Gillick {{said that the}} move was made not because of {{problems}} by Ripken but because more defensive <b>options</b> <b>were</b> available at shortstop than at third base. Had Ripken not wanted {{to move back to}} third base, the Orioles likely would have signed Tim Naehring instead.|$|E
5|$|Leaks were noticed {{immediately}} after {{the installation of the}} topping. Harry S. Peterson Co. attempted many times to fix the leaks. In 1991, the owners contracted Trow to investigate the chronic leaking and find a solution. Two <b>options</b> <b>were</b> provided, but upon consulting with Coreslab, it was determined that neither plan could go forward due to the HCS not being able to support additional loads.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} spreads in which unequal number of <b>options</b> <b>are</b> {{simultaneously}} purchased and written. When more <b>options</b> <b>are</b> written than purchased, it is a ratio spread. When more <b>options</b> <b>are</b> purchased than written, it is a backspread.|$|R
50|$|A stock <b>option</b> <b>is</b> a {{class of}} option. Specifically, a call <b>option</b> <b>is</b> the right (not obligation) to buy stock in the future at a fixed price and a put <b>option</b> <b>is</b> the right (not obligation) to sell stock in the future at a fixed price. Thus, {{the value of a}} stock option changes in {{reaction}} to the underlying stock of which it is a derivative. The most popular method of valuing stock <b>options</b> <b>is</b> the Black Scholes model. Apart from call options granted to employees, most stock <b>options</b> <b>are</b> transferable.|$|R
50|$|An <b>option</b> <b>is</b> {{the right}} to convey a piece of property. The person {{granting}} the <b>option</b> <b>is</b> called the optionor (or more usually, the grantor) {{and the person who}} has the benefit of the <b>option</b> <b>is</b> called the optionee (or more usually, the beneficiary).|$|R
5|$|Several <b>options</b> <b>were</b> {{implemented}} {{to increase the}} bridge's lifespan. These included a dehumidification programme that slowed the rate of corrosion in the main cables by keeping air in the voids between the main cables' strands below 40% humidity. Engineering consultants Faber Maunsell began work on the project in 2006, which took {{two and a half}} years to complete at a cost of £7.8million. As part of the works, some of the corroded cable strands were spliced.|$|E
5|$|Under the aspices of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks, the {{renovation}} included brick, window and steel frame replacement. The {{focal point of}} the renovated building is the publicly accessible Commons Club on the second floor, with a contemporary-style bar, a full kitchen, a lounge area, curated books and local memorabilia. At the time of opening, four additional dining <b>options</b> <b>were</b> expected within three months. The area was carved out of a former second-floor banking hall.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the United States Numbered Highways, the U.S. relied on an informal network of roads, organized by various competing interests, collectively called the auto trail system. The surveyors of most trails chose either South Pass in Wyoming or a southern route through New Mexico to traverse the Rocky Mountains. Both <b>options</b> <b>were</b> less formidable than the higher mountain passes in Colorado, but left the state without a transcontinental artery. When the planners of the Lincoln Highway also decided to cross the Rockies in Wyoming, officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main route in Nebraska, enter Colorado, and return to the main route in Wyoming. While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way, the loop proved impractical and was soon removed.|$|E

5|$|Boston College ended Maryland's six-game {{winning streak}} against ranked opponents. With a 7–5record, the Terrapins' postseason bowl game <b>options</b> <b>were</b> also limited. The Eagles secured the ACC Atlantic Division title and, with it, {{a trip to}} Tampa for the ACC Championship Game to face Virginia Tech for the second-straight season. Boston College held the Maryland run to 6 yards, forcing {{reliance}} on Chris Turner's passing ability. It was the second {{game of the season}} the Terrapins were held to negative rushing yards (this had also occurred against Virginia Tech). Turner, however, was able to throw for 360yards, bettering Boston College's total offensive yardage of 318yards.|$|E
5|$|Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. Turboprop <b>options</b> <b>were</b> also considered, but they were so new that Bristol could not guarantee the performance specifications.|$|E
5|$|Charles Edward Greene {{was born}} September 24, 1946, in Temple, Texas. He played high school {{football}} at Dunbar High School in Temple. Despite Greene's talents, the Dunbar Panthers had a mediocre record, {{and he was not}} heavily recruited by colleges. His <b>options</b> <b>were</b> limited further due to segregation of the Southwest Conference. He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now University of North Texas), where he played on the varsity team from 1966 to 1968. He led the team to a 23–5–1 record during his three seasons. In his 29 games at defensive tackle, North Texas State held the opposition to 2,507 yards gained on 1,276 rushes, a per-carry average of less than two yards. Greene was a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection.|$|E

40|$|The {{trouble with}} <b>options</b> <b>is</b> {{that too many}} <b>options</b> <b>are</b> granted to too many people. Most <b>options</b> <b>are</b> granted below the top-executive level, and <b>options</b> <b>are</b> often an inefficient way to attract, retain and motivate {{executives}} and (especially) lower-level employees. Why, then, <b>are</b> <b>options</b> so prevalent? We discuss several explanations including changes in corporate governance, reporting requirements, taxes, the bull market and managerial rent-seeking. We also offer an alternative hypothesis that we believe explains the over-use of options and several apparent puzzles: boards and managers falsely perceive stock <b>options</b> to <b>be</b> inexpensive because of accounting and cash-flow considerations. ...|$|R

5|$|During 2005–06, a Bakerloo {{extension}} {{was proposed}} with three route options. The <b>options</b> <b>were</b> extensions to Hayes via Peckham Rye, Beckenham Junction via Camberwell, or Hayes via New Cross. In July 2011, Network Rail recommended {{an extension of}} the Bakerloo line from Elephant & Castle to Lewisham, where it would take over the line to Hayes. In September 2014, Transport for London ran a consultation on the Bakerloo extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction with options via Lewisham and Camberwell or Old Kent Road, taking over Network Rail's Hayes line. The cost of the extension is estimated at around £2–3 billion with construction expected to take place between the mid-2020s and early 2030s. A February 2017 consultation indicates that the line could extend to Lewisham via Old Kent Road with future extension options later on.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, DoD {{officials}} {{met with}} the White House Military Office to discuss the program's future; the Pentagon had apparently wanted to terminate the VH-71 due to setbacks, budget issues, and design problems. The White House overruled a decision to cancel; the program was effectively placed on hold while <b>options</b> <b>were</b> considered. In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010. The {{second phase of the}} development, VH-71B (Increment 2) was expected to start entering service in 2017.|$|E
5|$|In the US and Canada, nine {{variations}} of the third-generation iPad were offered, compared to six {{in the rest of}} the world, although some countries had only the Wi-Fi only model. Each variation was available with black or white front glass panels, with options for 16, 32, or 64GB of storage. In North America, connectivity <b>options</b> <b>were</b> Wi-Fi only, Wi-Fi + 4G (LTE) on Verizon, AT, Telus, Rogers, or Bell. For the rest of the world outside North America, connectivity options are Wi-Fi only (on the Wi-Fi model) or Wi-Fi + 3G (on the Wi-Fi + Cellular model), with the latter unavailable in some countries, as 4G (LTE) connectivity for the device is not available outside North America. The Wi-Fi + Cellular model includes GPS capability.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Azerbaijan's {{victory at}} the 2011 edition, {{officials}} announced that a new 23,000 seat concert venue was to be built near National Flag Square in Baku, as a potential venue for the event. Three days later, other venue <b>options</b> <b>were</b> revealed by organisers, such as the 37,000-seat Tofiq Bahramov Stadium and the Heydar Aliyev Sports and Exhibition Complex. On 2 August 2011, Alpine Bau Deutschland AG was awarded the contract to construct the Baku Crystal Hall. Preparations for construction began in the area shortly after the announcement. Even though {{the full cost of}} the contract was not named, the government allocated 6 million AZN for the construction of the venue.|$|E
5|$|The Mitchell Freeway {{is planned}} to {{continue}} {{north to the}} Metropolitan Region Scheme's boundary, beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks. The state government announced in March 2012 {{the formation of the}} Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group. The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for relieving congestion, with a focus on the next freeway extension. Several <b>options</b> <b>were</b> considered, before the group released a strategic business case in November 2012. The report recommends a staged approach, starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015. This would be followed by a freeway extension to Hester Avenue, by 2017 and then an expressway standard extension to Romeo Road, Alkimos by 2021. Half-diamond interchanges are suggested for Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{impacts of}} the various <b>options</b> <b>were</b> {{estimated}} as the differences between a carbon tax and a reference ‘business as usual’ scenario assuming New Zealand had not signed the Kyoto Protocol. The variables changed in the model runs were the NZ carbon price ($0, $10, $25 or $100), the world carbon price, the duration (short term to 2012, long term to 2025), the level of free allocation and whether the Government assumed all Kyoto liabilities. The results of each model run was reported as the percent difference from the 'no-Kyoto' ‘business as usual’ scenario in 2012 or 2025.|$|E

5|$|The {{urban growth}} of Southampton, {{as in many}} English walled towns and cities, put {{considerable}} pressure on the older fortifications. In 1898 to 1899, for example, parts of the wall west of Biddles Gate, including a square tower, were demolished to create the Western Esplanade road. By {{the second half of}} the century, the Bargate and the surrounding walls were creating serious traffic congestion; various <b>options</b> <b>were</b> considered to relieve this including demolition, but it was not until the 1930s that the decision was made to retain the gatehouse, but to destroy the walls on either side.|$|E
5|$|While Criterion {{had their}} own audio team to create {{original}} music, working with EA gave {{them the opportunity to}} include licensed music in Burnout 3.

Burnout 3s soundtrack featured over forty songs, delivered in a radio station format presented by DJ Stryker from alternative rock station KROQ-FM. <b>Options</b> <b>were</b> added to modify which songs during a race or on the menu screen and the Xbox version supports custom soundtracks.|$|E
5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at {{the body of a}} batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg side would catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The batsman's <b>options</b> <b>were</b> to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to be caught by the fielders on the leg side; pull and hook shots could be caught {{on the edge of the}} field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E
