Osteitis fibrosis cystica, abbreviated OFC, also known as <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa,</b> osteodystrophia fibrosa, and von Recklinghausen's disease of bone (not to be confused with von Recklinghausen's disease, neurofibromatosis type I), is caused by hyperparathyroidism, which is a surplus of parathyroid hormone from over-active parathyroid glands. This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclastic bone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma, hereditary factors, parathyroid carcinoma, or renal osteodystrophy. Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, including calcium, from the bone into the bloodstream, causing both elevated blood calcium levels, and the structural changes which weaken the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and include bone fractures, kidney stones, nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.|$|E

5000|$|Renal {{osteodystrophy}} {{is currently}} {{defined as an}} alteration of bone morphology in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). [...] It is one measure of the skeletal component of the systemic disorder of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). The term [...] "renal osteodystrophy" [...] was coined in 1943, 60 years after an association was identified between bone disease and renal failure. The traditional types of renal osteodystrophy have been defined {{on the basis of}} turnover and mineralization as follows: mild, slight increase in turnover and normal mineralization; <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa,</b> increased turnover and normal mineralization; osteomalacia, decreased turnover and abnormal mineralization; adynamic, decreased turnover and acellularity; mixed, increased turnover with abnormal mineralization. A Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes report has suggested that bone biopsies in patients with CKD should be characterized by determining bone turnover, mineralization, and volume (TMV system). On the other hand, CKD-MBD is defined as a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism due to CKD manifested by either one or a combination of the following: 1) abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, or vitamin D metabolism; 2) abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength (renal osteodystrophy); and 3) vascular or other soft-tissue calcification.|$|E

NPS R- 568 is a phenylalkylamine derivative that acts as an agonist at the cell-surface Ca 2 + receptor (“calcimimetic”) and inhibits parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. In the present study, we tested whether NPS R- 568 could ameliorate <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> in partially nephrectomized (Nx) rats with 2 °HPT. Six months after surgery, Nx rats had developed mild but progressive 2 °HPT and <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa.</b> Two groups of Nx rats received NPS R- 568 (3 and 30 mg/kg body wt · day) by daily gavage for 30 days, {{which led to a}} dose-related decrease in serum PTH levels and to a marked reduction in peritrabecular fibrosis (0. 96 ± 0. 49 % to < 0. 1 %). Furthermore, 2 °HPT was associated with decreases in volumetric cortical bone mineral density (vCtBMD) and in cortical bone stiffness at the femoral midshaft.

40|$|Value of the 99 mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scan in renal osteodystrophy. The {{value of}} {{radionuclide}} bone scanning {{in the diagnosis}} of renal osteodystrophy is still debated. In order to re-examine this issue, 25 uremic patients treated by intermittent hemodialysis underwent 99 m-Technetium Methylene Diphosphonate (99 mTc-MDP) bone scan. They were subdivided into three groups according to quantitative bone histology. Group 1 (N = 8) had pure dialysis osteomalacia, group 2 (N = 7) mixed lesions, and group 3 (N = 10) pure <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa.</b> The scintigraphic studies were interpreted {{by means of a}} five point semiquantitative scale. Using this quantification, all but one group 1 patients had decreased bone tracer uptake, and all patients of group 3 had an increased uptake (chi square test of Yates, P < 0. 001). Among patients of group 2, bone uptake was decreased in the three patients with clearly reduced mineralization front and moderate <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa,</b> but it was increased in all patients with severe <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> and subnormal mineralization front. A quantitative analysis of regional tracer uptake into bone was performed in two patients: one of group 2 and one of group 3. The results obtained clearly corroborated the semi-quantitative findings. Thus, in hemodialysis patients with symptomatic bone disease, the 99 mTc-MDP bone scan provides useful information for the differential diagnosis between dialysis–related osteomalacia and secondary hyperparathyroidism. In patients with mixed lesions, the importance of bone tracer uptake appears to depend on the extent of the mineralization front and on the intensity of <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa...</b>|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Renal {{osteodystrophy}} {{includes the}} complete range of mineral metabolism disorders {{that affect the}} skeleton in patients with chronic renal failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 200 patients with end-stage renal disease and on dialysis were investigated regarding the clinical, biochemical and histological findings of bone disease. RESULTS: The spectrum of renal osteodystrophy consisted mainly of high turnover bone lesions (74. 5 %), including <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> in 57. 5 %. Patients with mild bone disease were on dialysis for shorter periods of time and were mostly asymptomatic. Patients with aluminum-related bone disease (16. 5 %) had the greatest aluminum exposure, either orally or parenterally, and together with patients with high turnover mixed disease, were the most symptomatic. Although on a non-regular basis, {{the vast majority of}} the patients (82. 5 %) had been receiving vitamin D. The incidence of adynamic bone disease was high (n= 8) among parathyroidectomized patients (n= 12). Significantly higher serum levels of alkaline phosphatase were observed in <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The use of calcitriol and phosphate-binding agents on a non-regular basis seems to be the reason for the apparent reduced response to the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Alkaline phosphatase has been shown to be a fair marker for bone turnover in patients with <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa.</b> The severity of the clinical manifestations of bone disease correlates with the histological features of bone lesion and to the time spent on dialysis...|$|E

40|$|Polyostotic fibrous {{dysplasia}} is {{a disease}} that deserves to be better known for it is more frequent than is generally appreciated. Von Recklinghausen's (1891) description of {{what appear to be}} two examples of this disease together with one of hyperparathyroidism seems to have set a precedent for many fruitless parathyroid explora-tions. This has occurred despite Hunter and Turnbull's (1931) differentiation of ' <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> in multiple foci ' from ' <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa</b> cystica generalisata '. Interest in the condition and a recognition of the frequent association with other features was aroused by Albright, Butler, Hampton and Smith (1937) in a paper describing a syndrome of dis-seminated <b>osteitis</b> <b>fibrosa,</b> skin pigmentation, and, in females, sexual precocity. Despite earlier descriptions by McCune and Bruch (1937) and Weil (1922) this syndrome has often been called Albright's syndrome. Lichtenstein (1938) in a review and pathological report suggested the term polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. In his view the bony lesion is the one essential feature of the disease. Three patients with this disease have been seen in The Hospital for Sick Children, since 1938. One was reported by Warrick (1949) and is referred to by Jolly (1951). This was a boy who showed skin pigmentation, involvement of the skull and probably two ribs, and sexual and skeletal precocity. His parents and his four siblings showed no skin pigmentation.

40|$|Secondary {{hyperparathyroidism}} is {{a frequent}} complication of patients with chronic kidney disease and is characterized by excessive serum parathyroid hormone levels and an imbalance in calcium and phosphorus metabolism.
