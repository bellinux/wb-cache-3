25|$|Polypropylene {{is a major}} polymer used in nonwovens, {{with over}} 50% used for diapers or {{sanitary}} products where it is treated to absorb water (hydrophilic) rather than naturally repelling water (hydrophobic). Other interesting non-woven uses include filters for air, gas, and liquids in which the fibers can be formed into sheets or webs that can be pleated to form cartridges or layers that filter in various efficiencies in the 0.5 to 30 micrometre range. Such applications occur in houses as water filters or in air-conditioning-type filters.

25|$|Bioremediation Accelerator: <b>Oleophilic,</b> {{hydrophobic}} chemical, containing no bacteria, which chemically {{and physically}} bonds to both soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons. The bioremediation accelerator {{acts as a}} herding agent in water and on the surface, floating molecules {{to the surface of}} the water, including solubles such as phenols and BTEX, forming gel-like agglomerations. Undetectable levels of hydrocarbons can be obtained in produced water and manageable water columns. By overspraying sheen with bioremediation accelerator, sheen is eliminated within minutes. Whether applied on land or on water, the nutrient-rich emulsion creates a bloom of local, indigenous, pre-existing, hydrocarbon-consuming bacteria. Those specific bacteria break down the hydrocarbons into water and carbon dioxide, with EPA tests showing 98% of alkanes biodegraded in 28 days; and aromatics being biodegraded 200 times faster than in nature they also sometimes use the hydrofireboom to clean the oil up by taking it away from most of the oil and burning it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oleophilic</b> skimmers {{function}} {{by using}} an element such as a drum, disc, rope or mop to which the oil adheres. The oil is wiped from the <b>oleophilic</b> surface and collected in a tank. As the oil is adhering to a collection surface {{the amount of water}} collected when oil is not present will be limited.|$|E
50|$|Non-oleophilic skimmers are {{distinguished}} by the component {{used to collect}} the oil. A metal disc, belt or drum is used in applications where an <b>oleophilic</b> material is inappropriate, such as in a hot alkaline aqueous parts washer. The skimmer is generally turned off whenever there is no oil to skim thus minimizing {{the amount of water}} collected. Metal skimming elements are nearly as efficient as <b>oleophilic</b> skimmers when oil is present.|$|E
50|$|An ideal <b>oleophilic</b> surface {{would have}} a contact angle of 0° with oil, {{therefore}} allowing the ink to transfer to the paper and be absorbed. The hydrocarbon plasma coating provides an <b>oleophilic</b> surface to the paper by lowering the contact angle of the paper with the oil in the ink. The hydrocarbon plasma coating increases the non-polar interactions while decreasing polar interactions which allow paper to absorb ink while preventing dampening water absorption.|$|E

5000|$|Effectiveness with {{different}} oils: <b>Oleophilic</b> and Non-Oleophilic skimmers are not equally effective with all oil types {{due to the}} changing nature of the attraction forces {{with different}} oils and materials.|$|E
5000|$|Oil removal flow rate: Alternative Skimmer designs have {{different}} oil removal flow rates. Volume removal rates for <b>Oleophilic</b> skimmer types (drum, brush, disc, belt) are comparatively low. Weir type skimmers {{are capable of}} very high oil and water removal rates. ASTM F2709 standard establishes the test procedure for determining oil recovery rate (ORR).|$|E
5000|$|Oil removal concentration: It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that oil skimmers remove concentrated or pure 'oil'; {{when in fact they}} remove a mixture of oil and water. In most situations the 'oil' mixture removed is an emulsion of oil and water more like a 'mousse'. <b>Oleophilic</b> and Non-Oleophilic skimmers can provide a more concentrated oil in the removal stream, however still collect entrained water.|$|E

5000|$|This method uses an oil {{absorbing}} continuous belt {{to transport}} heavy oil {{as an alternative}} to pumping. A single sided “O” shape belt driven by a Moebius surface unit cycles continuously to the underground unit, below the static level, capturing the oil and transporting up to the surface unit for collection. The <b>oleophilic</b> properties of the belt ensure that sand, paraffin, and most of the water are not captured.|$|E
50|$|Earlier, a {{magnetic}} boron-doped MWNT nanosponge that could absorb oil from water. The sponge was grown as a forest on a substrate via chemical vapor disposition. Boron puts kinks and elbows into the tubes {{as they grow}} and promotes the formation of covalent bonds. The nanosponges retain their elastic property after 10,000 compressions in the lab. The sponges are both superhydrophobic, forcing them to remain at the water's surface and <b>oleophilic,</b> drawing oil to them.|$|E
50|$|However, some biostimulative agents {{may be used}} in chaotic {{surfaces}} such as {{open water}} and sand so long as they are <b>oleophilic,</b> meaning that they bond exclusively to hydrocarbons, and basically sink in the water column, bonding to oil, where they then float to the water's surface, exposing the hydrocarbon to more abundant sunlight and oxygen where greater micro-organic aerobic activity can be encouraged. Some consumer-targeted biostimulants bond possess this quality, others do not.|$|E

50|$|The anatase {{phase is}} {{generally}} considered to be the most photocatalytic among its polymorphic structures, possibly {{as the result of a}} typically higher specific surface area. Moreover, ultraviolet irradiation creates surface oxygen vacancies at bridging sites, resulting in the conversion of relevant Ti4+ sites to Ti3+ sites which are favourable for dissociative water adsorption. These defects presumably influence the affinity to chemisorbed water of their surrounding sites, forming hydrophilic domains, whereas the rest of the surface remains <b>oleophilic.</b> Hydrophilic domains are areas where dissociative water is adsorbed, associated with oxygen vacancies that are preferentially photogenerated along the 001 direction of the (110) plane; the same direction in which oxygen bridging sites align.|$|E

40|$|Titania {{film with}} 20 - 30 nm {{particle}} sizes was prepared by improved sol-gel processing and dip-coating technique. Its water contact angle decreased from 40 degrees {{to less than}} 5 degrees within 10 min, consequently showing an antifogging effect. This highly hydrophilic surface feature is ascribed to photogenerated oxygen vacancies that are favorable for dissociative water adsorption. The authors of this investigation believe that carefully controlling the composite rnicrostructure between hydrophilic domains and <b>oleophilic</b> areas may result in four kinds of surface wet abilities: hydrophilic, <b>oleophilic,</b> amphiphilic, and amphiphobic.

40|$|The surface {{free energy}} and {{geometrical}} structure are two important factors to govern the surface wettability. However, the design and simple synthesis of materials with specific {{surface free energy}} and geometrical structure, and their elaborate regulations are still a key challenge. Herein, through one-step thermal evaporation method, we successfully synthesized aligned arrays of highly crystallized ZnO with modulated nail structures on the stainless steel meshes for the first time. Owing to the decoration of [0001] oriented nail structures, the wire surface of meshes were indeed enclosed by the ZnO (0002) facets, which had the lowest surface energy in wurtzite structure. Under no any further modifications, just by regulating the nail structure and density {{as well as the}} mesh pore sizes, we not only obtained ZnO nail-coated mesh with hydrophobic, <b>oleophilic</b> (oil penetration), and underwater <b>oleophilic</b> properties, but also fabricated one with hydrophilic (water penetration), <b>oleophilic</b> (oil penetration), and underwater superoleophobic properties. Furthermore, interestingly, the separation of oil and water mixture was realized by utilizing two ZnO-nail coated meshes with different wettability. The underlying mechanism was investigated and discussed in the work. Therefore, our study provides interesting insight into the design of novel functional films with desired surface wettability for the separation of oil-water mixture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The percent {{recovery}} of fine coal or graphite particles suspended in water by agglomeration with heptane was {{highly dependent on}} the measured induction time, i. e., the gas bubble to particle attachment time of the material. The induction time was found to correlate closely with the heat of immersion of the solids in water, another indicator of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of the material. For a series of coals and graphite, the agglomeration recovery decreased exponentially with increasing induction time. For the more <b>oleophilic</b> coal or graphite particles, an increase in salt (NaC 1) concentration of the suspending medium caused an increase in agglomeration recovery {{and a decrease in}} induction time. For the less <b>oleophilic</b> coal or pyrite particles, an increase in salt concentration caused a decrease in agglomeration recovery apd an increase in induction time. Due to the opposing effects of salt concentration on the recoveries of a highly hydrophobic coal and pyrite, it was possible to improve the separation of these materials by an increase in salt concentration. On the other hand, because the recoveries of pyrite and a weakly <b>oleophilic</b> coal were affected similarly by an increase in salt concentration, {{it was not possible to}} improve the separation of these materials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} <b>oleophilic</b> and {{hydrophobic}} properties of polyurethane (PU) for oil spill cleanup, graft copolymerization of <b>oleophilic</b> monomer was performed using divinylbenzene (DVB) as the cross-linker, benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as the initiator, toluene as the solvent.

The effects of the monomer ratio, cross-linker, initiator, polymerization time, and different grafting monomers were studied. The optimum monomer, polymerization time, initiator, cross-linker and monomer weight ratios were found to be Lauryl methacrylate (LMA), 6 h, 5 % and 1. 5 % of PU, and the ratio of LMA to PU at 1. 5, respectively. The maximum sorption obtained was 46. 98 g diesel and 41. 42 g kerosene per gram of modified PU. The water sorption of the modified PU decreased 50 %, compared with the blank PU...|$|E
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{challenges}} of global oil spills and oil-water contamination, the development of a low-cost and reusable sorbents with good hydrophobicity and <b>oleophilic</b> nature is crucial. In this study, functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were wrapped in polystyrene (PS) polymer (PS-CNTs) and electrospun to create an effective and rigid sorbent for oil. Covalent modification and fluorination of CNTs improved their dispersibility and interfacial interaction with the polymer, resulting in a well-aligned CNTs configuration inside the porous fiber structure. Interestingly, the oil sorption process using PS-CNTs was observed to have two phases. First, the oil swiftly entered the membrane pores formed by interconnected nanofibers due to <b>oleophilic</b> properties of the micro-sized void. In the second phase, the oil not only moved to nano interior spaces of the fibers by capillary forces but also adsorbed on the surface of fibers where the latter was retained due to Van der Waals force. The sorption process fits well with the intra particle diffusion model. Maximum oil sorption capacity of the PS-CNTs sorbent for sunflower oil, peanut oil, and motor oils were 116, 123, and 112 g/g, respectively, which was 65 % higher than that of the PS sorbent without CNTs. Overall, {{a significant increase in the}} porosity, surface area, water contact angle, and <b>oleophilic</b> nature was observed for the PS-CNTs composite sorbents. Not only did the PS-CNTs sorbents exhibited a promising oil sorption capacity but also showed potential for reusability, which is an important factor to be considered in determining the overall performance of the sorbent and its environmental impacts...|$|E

40|$|Polystyrene-divinylbenzene resins bearing linear acyl {{groups with}} up to eight carbon atoms in the chain have been {{prepared}} and sulfonated to obtain <b>oleophilic,</b> strongly acidic ion-exchange catalysts. They were tested in the esterification of stearic acid with methanol at 85  °C using edible oil as the reaction medium to mimic raw materials {{for the production of}} biodiesel with a high content of free fatty acids. The acylation of the catalysts made them more <b>oleophilic</b> hence less active than a conventional strongly acidic ion-exchange catalyst when the reaction mixture was saturated with methanol (20  %, w/w), because of their lowered swelling ability. However at relatively low methanol concentration (5  %, w/w) not only the acylated catalysts were generally more active than the conventional catalyst, but their activity showed an excellent correlation with the degree of acylation and the number of carbon atoms of the acyl groups. The results clearly show that this does not depend on their swelling behaviour under duty rules, but rather to enhanced adsorption of stearic acid into the catalyst facilitated by the intermixing of the acylic and sulfonic groups at the molecular level...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{control of}} surface wetting {{properties}} to produce robust and strong hydrophobic and oleophobic effects on intrinsically <b>oleophilic</b> surfaces {{is at the}} heart of many technological applications. In this paper, we explore the conditions to observe such effects when the roughness of the substrate is of fractal nature and consists of nanofeatures obtained by the ion track etching technique. The wetting properties were investigated using eight different liquids with surface tensions γ varying from 18 to 72 mN m- 1. While it is observed that all the tested oils readily wet the flat substrates, it is found that the contact angles are systematically exalted on the rough surfaces even for the liquids with very low surface tension. For liquids with γ ≥ 25 mN m- 1 an oleophobic behavior is clearly induced by the nanostructuration. For liquids with γ < 25 mN m- 1, although the contact angle is enhanced on the nanorough surfaces, it conserves its <b>oleophilic</b> character (θ* lower than 90 °). Moreover, our experiments show that even in the case of hexane, liquid having the lowest surface tension, the homogeneous wetting (Wenzel state) is never reached. This high resistance to liquid impregnation is discussed within the framework of recent approaches explaining the wetting properties of superoleophobic surfaces...|$|E

40|$|As {{the demand}} for liquid {{petroleum}} increases, the need for reliable and efficient oil spill clean-up techniques is inevitable. Bioremediation {{is considered one of}} the most sustainable clean-up techniques but the potential has not been fully exploited in the field because it is too slow to meet the immediate demands of the environment. This study reviews the challenges to managing oil spills in terrestrial and marine environments to identify areas that require further research. Current challenges associated with bioremediation of spilled petroleum include resistance of asphalthenes to biodegradation; delay of heavy or high molar mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) biodegradation, eutrophication caused by biostimulation, unsustainability of bio-augmentation in the field, poor bioavailability of spilled petroleum, inefficiency of biodegradation in anoxic environments and failure of successful bioremediation laboratory studies in the field. Recommendations offered include encouraging asphalthene biodegradation by combining heat application (80 °C), biosurfactant (thermophilic emulsifier) and bioagumentation (using a consortium containing Bacillus lentus and Pleurotus tuberregium as members) but as a temporary measure, adopting the use of ‘booms and skimmers ’ and ‘organic sorbents ’ for water and land clean-up, respectively. Heavy PAHs may be rapidly degraded by applying nutrients (biostimulation) and biosurfactants to sites that are <b>oleophilic</b> microbe-rich. <b>Oleophilic</b> nutrients may be the most effective strategy to reduce eutrophication in marine environments whilst on land, slow-releas...|$|E
40|$|Exposure of {{pristine}} microbial environments to hydrocarbon contamination stimulates {{growth of}} the initially small fraction of indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. Custom-made <b>oleophilic</b> fertilizers have been demonstrated to promote oil bioremediation by boosting this proliferation. In the present study, the temporal dynamics of the bacterial community structure and the individual influences of hydrocarbons and an <b>oleophilic</b> fertilizer in shaping the community structure was explored during a 78 days bioremediation experiment in a high-Arctic intertidal beach environment. A combination of cultivation independent 16 S rRNA gene length-heterogeneity polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR) profiling and identification of hydrocarbon-degrading isolates based on partial 16 S rRNA gene sequences was employed. LH-PCR community profiles in the fertilizer alone and fertilized kerosene plots were largely indistinguishable throughout the experimental period, while kerosene alone plots showed a markedly different composition of dominant groups. This pointed to the fertilizer as the more decisive factor in shaping the community structure. Most prominent LH-PCR fragments which emerged after kerosene or fertilizer addition could be provisionally assigned to bacterial taxa through coinciding LH-PCR fragment lengths with hydrocarbon degrading isolates obtained from {{the same type of}} experimental units. However, a few quantitatively significant LH-PCR groups had no counterparts among the cultivated bacteria.

40|$|Much of the {{inspiration}} for the creation of superhydrophobic surfaces has come from nature, from plant such as the Sacred Lotus (Nulembo nucifera), where the micro-scale papillae epidermal cells on the surfaces of the leaves are covered with nano-scale epicuticular wax crystalloids. The combination of the surface roughness and the hydrophobic wax coating produces a superhydrophobic wetting state on the leaves allowing them to self-clean and easily shed water. Here a simple scale-up carbon nanoparticle spray coating is presented that mimics the surface of the Sacred Lotus leaves and can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} materials, complex structures, and flexible substrates, rendering them superhydrophobic, with contact angles above 160 °. The sprayable mixture is produced by combining toluene, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and inherently hydrophobic rapeseed soot. The ability to spray the superhydrophobic coating allows for the hydrophobisation of complex structures such a metallic meshes, which allows for the production of flexible porous superhydrophobic materials that when formed into U-shape channels, can be used to direct flows. The porous meshes, whilst being superhydrophobic, are also <b>oleophilic.</b> Being both superhydrophobic and <b>oleophilic</b> allows oil to pass through the mesh, whilst water remains on the surface.
