5|$|Unfortunately, {{there is}} also a cost in {{structurally}} keeping inflation lower than in the United States, UK, and China.

5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reasons</b> behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters.

5|$|For {{much of its}} {{existence}} the Court was formally led by the Lord Chancellor, assisted by the judges of the common law courts. The staff of the court included {{a large number of}} clerks, led by the Master of the Rolls, who regularly heard cases on his own. In 1813 a Vice-Chancellor was appointed to deal with the Chancery's increasing backlogs, and two more were appointed in 1841. Offices of the Chancery were sold by the Lord Chancellor for much of its history, raising large amounts of money. Many of the clerks and other officials were sinecures who, in lieu of wages, charged increasingly exorbitant fees to process cases, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reasons</b> why the cost of bringing a case to the Chancery was so high. The 19th century saw the abolition of many sinecure offices and the institution of a wage and pension for the Lord Chancellor to curb the sale of offices, and later the right to appoint officials was transferred from the Chancellor to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|The design {{report for}} the Bay Freeway project was {{published}} on February 10, 1970, and was subsequently distributed to the project. The report featured a new design for the freeway, including ramps to a parking garage serving the domed stadium and aesthetic standards meant to complement the existing Seattle Center. Five additional public hearings were held by the Seattle City Council in 1970, as support for the R.H. Thomson Expressway and other proposed freeways were the subject of highway revolts {{similar to those in}} other American cities. During the April hearing, former State Department of Highways director Charles Prahl spoke out against the Bay Freeway and predicted that it would cause traffic to back up onto I-5 during rush hour. Voters rejected a Forward Thrust initiative that would have built the proposed domed stadium at the Seattle Center on May 19, removing <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reasons</b> to build the freeway and forcing the city council to consider scaling down the proposal. The June hearing resulted in the removal of the R.H. Thomson Freeway from the comprehensive plan as well as the widening of the Bay Freeway to six lanes to support an expected 2,610 drivers during rush hour.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, the Japanese {{called a}} halt to their attack on the Australian right, and subsequently troops from the 2/28th Infantry Battalion were then sent to the east to secure the position's flanks. On 29 November, the 2/32nd was relieved by the 2/43rd. In doing so, it {{was struck by a}} heavy Japanese artillery bombardment which killed or wounded25. Over the 10days that the 2/32nd had held Pabu, Mollard's force had endured repeated mortar and artillery fire, and repeated attacks, but with the assistance of strong artillery support, it had held its ground and in doing so had helped blunt the force of the Japanese counterattack at a time when Australian forces were making heavy progress towards the Japanese fortress at Sattelberg. Later, the Japanese commanding general, Adachi, pinpointed the Australian capture of Pabu as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reasons</b> for the defeat of his force during the Huon Peninsula campaign. Losses during the fighting around Pabu were 195Japanese and 25Australians killed, and 51 Australians wounded.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{occupation}} of Pabu, and the general movement of Australian forces towards Wareo–Bonga, the Japanese infantry were threatened with being trapped. In response, the Japanese commander, Katagiri, diverted some of the effort away from the recapture of Finschhafen, and resolved to recapture the North Hill–Pabu area. A strong force of Japanese subsequently advanced south along the coastal track from Bonga, attempting to retake North Hill and the ground north of the Song River. Commencing on 22 November, the Japanese made heavy assaults around North Hill, on positions which were defended by Australians from the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion and the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion. The 2/32nd, with two companies isolated to the north around Pabu, was also {{in the thick of the}} fighting, and over the space of 10 days it was subjected to repeated attacks. Despite being short of food and receiving repeated mortar fire, the 2/32nd held its ground with the assistance of strong artillery support, and in doing so inflicted heavy casualties upon the Japanese. Later at least 195 bodies were found around the 2/32nd's position; their own losses amounted to 25 killed and 51 wounded. The Japanese commanding general, Hatazo Adachi, later pinpointed the Australian capture of Pabu Hill as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reasons</b> for the defeat of his force during the Huon Peninsula campaign.|$|E
5|$|GCHS {{underwent}} a major remodeling project during the 2005–2006 school year. An open courtyard had previously {{existed in the}} central section of the school which had gone largely unused. School officials met and decided to enclose the courtyard and transform the space into a multi-purpose atrium tetrastylum. After nearly a year, construction was completed. The new multi-purpose area was used for additional seating during lunchtime, as well as conferences, banquets, and additional uses. The atrium featured a projection screen, a flat-screen HDTV, additional storage closets, a small elevated stage area, several unique design features, and additional entrances/exits to classrooms. The renovation was, however, largely regarded by students and residents of Garden City as a waste of resources, owing {{to the construction of}} the current high school. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>reasons</b> for the enclosure of the courtyard was to provide adequate room for most of its students in a lunchroom of some sort. However, at the time, the high school espoused an open lunch policy, and consequently a majority of its close to 2,000 students left campus for lunch. Administrators responded to this in the 2007–2008 school year by closing lunch to freshmen, and the following year by closing lunch to sophomores who do not have special identification cards.|$|E

Like all Final Mix releases, it combines English audio with Japanese game text and subtitles, and includes all additional features implemented in the Western versions as well as brand new content, such as a new playable secret episode for Aqua, which also has new cutscenes with dialogue provided by her voice actress Megumi Toyoguchi. Alongside The 3rd Birthday, Final Mix includes a code that allows players to obtain downloadable content for Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, with Final Mix featuring the character Cloud Strife costume from the original Kingdom Hearts. Final Mix topped the video game charts following its release with 77,317 units sold in the first week, and reaching 106,276 in February 2011.
