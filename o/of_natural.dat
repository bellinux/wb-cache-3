5|$|A {{far-reaching}} {{generalization of}} addition <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> numbers is {{the addition of}} ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers in set theory. These give two different generalizations of addition <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> numbers to the transfinite. Unlike most addition operations, addition of ordinal numbers is not commutative. Addition of cardinal numbers, however, is a commutative operation {{closely related to the}} disjoint union operation.|$|E
