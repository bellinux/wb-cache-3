In November 2011, Bandai announced the release of the series in four Blu-ray compilations between March and December 2012. The HD version was first streamed on the Bandai Channel website in December 2011 and aired in Japan between January and November 2012.|$|E
5|$|By mid-2011, Arafiles {{had moved}} his {{practice}} to East Texas and was affiliated with Cozby Germany Hospital in Grand Saline. A hospital administrator there {{said that she}} had looked into some of the allegations against Arafiles that she found on the Internet but that no one had formally complained to her about the doctor. In November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on two counts of misuse of <b>official</b> <b>information.</b> Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell and Galle were {{terminated}} from WCMH in June 2009. A {{few days}} later, both nurses were arrested. They {{were charged with}} misuse of <b>official</b> <b>information,</b> a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta {{rather than as a}} good faith reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E

5|$|Roberts {{was convicted}} on {{two counts of}} misuse of <b>official</b> <b>information,</b> two counts of {{retaliation}} and two counts of official oppression. In June 2011, {{he was sentenced to}} 100 days in jail, four years of felony probation and a $6,000 fine. After the sentence, Roberts was removed as sheriff and forced to surrender his license as a peace officer. Convicted on similar charges, Tidwell was removed from office and sentenced to 120 days in jail, ten years of probation and a $6,000 fine. Tidwell's trial publicly uncovered a 2004 guilty plea he entered after being charged with soliciting a prostitute. DSHS assessed a $15,850 fine against the hospital for inadequate supervision of Arafiles and illegal termination of Galle and Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|When {{he learned}} of the complaint, Arafiles spoke with the sheriff of Winkler County, who was his friend {{and one of his}} patients. Arafiles alleged that the nurses' reports to the medical board {{constituted}} harassment. The sheriff investigated and obtained the TMB complaint, which provided enough information about Mitchell and Galle to make them identifiable. Galle and Mitchell were terminated from the hospital and faced criminal charges of misuse of <b>official</b> <b>information.</b> Galle's charges were dropped before trial and Mitchell was acquitted by a jury. In the aftermath of Mitchell's trial, Arafiles, several county officials and a hospital administrator all faced jail time for their roles in the retaliation against the nurses.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{was kept}} secluded {{by his wife}} and {{personal}} physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge <b>official</b> <b>information</b> on his condition. Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to personally determine his condition, {{he was unable to}} do so, and relied on vague updates he received through a few bulletins published by Wilson's physician. Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. The senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty, however, believed that as president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock. In order to prevent the treaty's ratification, the anti-League senators blocked the joint resolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{threat model}} for OFFICIAL data {{is similar to}} typical large private-sector organisations; it anticipates that {{individual}} hackers, pressure groups, criminals, and investigative journalists might attempt to get information. The threat model does not guarantee protection against very persistent and skilled attacks, for instance by organised crime groups or by foreign governments; these are possible, but normal controls would make them more difficult, and much stronger controls would be disproportionate. People with routine access to <b>OFFICIAL</b> <b>information</b> {{should be subject to}} BPSS screening.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} was initially kept secret.

However, rumors of the attacks kept most of the local population home at night. Eventually, investigators selectively distributed sketches and lists of stolen property to local pawn shops. Stolen property {{began to appear in}} the pawn shops of the city's Leninskiy district. The combination of the sketches and located stolen property quickly led to the suspects.|$|E
