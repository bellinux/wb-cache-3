5|$|Taking {{advantage}} {{of the existence of}} 30 years of newsreels archives were filmmakers who made early sound era documentaries. World War I was a popular topic <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> and spawned the following documentaries; The Big Drive (1933), World in Revolt (1933), This is America (1933), and Hell's Holiday (1933). The most prescient pre-Code World War I documentary was aptly called The First World War (1934) and was the most critically and commercially successful documentary of the era.|$|E
5|$|At last, in May 1877, {{the day of}} {{recognition}} came, {{with the opening of}} the first exhibition of the Grosvenor Gallery, when the Days of Creation, The Beguiling of Merlin, and the Mirror of Venus were all shown. Burne-Jones followed up the signal success <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> with Laus Veneris, the Chant d'Amour, Pan and Psyche, and other works, exhibited in 1878. Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> are painted in brilliant colours. A change is noticeable the next year, 1879, in the Annunciation and in the four pictures making up the second series of Pygmalion and the Image; the former of these, one of the simplest and most perfect of the artist's works, is subdued and sober; in the latter a scheme of soft and delicate tints was attempted, not with entire success. A similar temperance of colours marks The Golden Stairs, first exhibited in 1880. The almost sombre Wheel of Fortune was shown in 1883, followed in 1884 by King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid, in which Burne-Jones once more indulged his love of gorgeous colour, refined by the period of self-restraint. He next turned to two important sets of pictures, The Briar Rose and The Story of Perseus, though these were not completed for some years.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Haynes and Leary {{published}} the magazine Strange V.D., which featured photos of abnormal medical ailments, coupled with fictitious, humorous {{explanations for the}} diseases. After being caught with one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> at work, Haynes left the accounting firm and moved to Southern California. Leary, at the time one semester shy of his degree, {{dropped out of college}} and followed Haynes. After a brief period spent selling homemade clothes and linens emblazoned with Lee Harvey Oswald's image, the pair returned to San Antonio, and launched the band that would eventually become Butthole Surfers.|$|E

5|$|During 1929, most of {{the major}} European filmmaking {{countries}} began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound. Many of the trend-setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages. One of Europe's first two feature-length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking: The Crimson Circle was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik's Efzet-Film company and British Sound Film Productions (BSFP). In 1928, the film had been released as the silent Der Rote Kreis in Germany, where it was shot; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP's corporate parent. It was given a British trade screening in March 1929, as was a part-talking film made entirely in the UK: The Clue of the New Pin, a British Lion production using the sound-on-disc British Photophone system. In May, Black Waters, a British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all-talker, received its initial trade screening; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound-on-film system. None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> made much impact.|$|E

25|$|At {{the peak}} of his {{creative}} powers, Kelly made what in retrospect some see as a mistake. In December 1951, he signed a contract with MGM that sent him to Europe for nineteen months to use MGM funds frozen in Europe to make three pictures while personally benefiting from tax exemptions. Only one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> was a musical, Invitation to the Dance, a pet project of Kelly's to bring modern ballet to mainstream film audiences. It was beset with delays and technical problems, and flopped when finally released in 1956.|$|E
25|$|Promiscuous, flirtatious, {{and openly}} flaunting her body, Mata Hari captivated her audiences {{and was an}} {{overnight}} success from the debut of her act at the Musée Guimet on 13 March 1905. She became the long-time mistress of the millionaire Lyon industrialist Émile Étienne Guimet, who had founded the Musée. She posed as a Javanese princess of priestly Hindu birth, {{pretending to have been}} immersed in the art of sacred Indian dance since childhood. She was photographed numerous times during this period, nude or nearly so.

25|$|According to guitarist Paul Leary, he {{acquired}} the eventual cover image by chance while purchasing marijuana from an acquaintance in San Antonio, Texas. The image's photographer {{was at the}} acquaintance's residence for the same reason, and happened to have his portfolio with him. After a session of beer drinking and impromptu guitar playing, Leary accidentally caused some of the photographer's photos to fall on the floor. One <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> was a group shot depicting the young girl seen on Cream Corns cover, but surrounded by six older models. Leary commented that he liked it, the photographer gave him the photo and its reproduction rights, and the girl's picture was cropped, blown up, and used on the EP's U.S. cover.|$|E
25|$|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood was {{developed}} by Ubisoft Montreal. Montreal also worked on both of the other main Assassin's Creed games in the series and was thus chosen to lead production for the third installment. A new Assassin's Creed episode featuring multiplayer was announced during Ubisoft's 2009 fiscal third quarter results while not revealing its name. In early May 2010, a GameStop employee published on the internet some images of a pre-order box featuring the Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood title while Ubisoft was teasing the game on Facebook and Twitter. Ubisoft then confirmed the authenticity <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures.</b> Brotherhood has not been numbered unlike Assassin's Creed II because players, and even developers themselves would have expected a new setting and a new ancestor while {{this is only the}} continuation of Ezio's story.|$|E
25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings {{there is something}} that is very seldom found in the art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I talked with a man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E

25|$|The {{return to}} Italy allowed Lawrence to renew old friendships; {{during these years}} he was {{particularly}} close to Aldous Huxley, who was to edit the first collection of Lawrence's letters after his death, along with a memoir. With artist Earl Brewster, Lawrence visited a number of local archaeological sites in April 1927. The resulting essays describing these visits to old tombs were written up and collected together as Sketches of Etruscan Places, a book that contrasts the lively past with Benito Mussolini's fascism. Lawrence continued to produce fiction, including short stories and The Escaped Cock (also published as The Man Who Died), an unorthodox reworking {{of the story of}} Jesus Christ's Resurrection. During these final years Lawrence renewed a serious interest in oil painting. Official harassment persisted and an exhibition of some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> at the Warren Gallery in London was raided by the police in mid 1929 and a number of works were confiscated.|$|E

Rix Nicholas's works remained didactic and insistent in their idealism about rural Australia, but following World War II, the country – and its art critics – had moved on. In 1945, The Sydney Morning Herald critic, lambasting Rix Nicholas's works as [...] "crude in colour and poster-ish in presentation", concluded: [...] "There is insufficient spiritual material to fill the canvases of Hilda Rix Nicholas... The bravura, the boldness <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> is hardly {{in keeping with the}} actual knowledge displayed.

Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>pictures</b> were shown on the projection as slides, including one of him dreaming. He explained how he was inspired by the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969.
