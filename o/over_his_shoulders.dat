5|$|As {{soldiers}} {{approached the}} sacristy, {{one of the}} young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders.</b> In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, who attempted to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match, Randy Orton faced Kurt Angle. In {{the early stages}} both superstars took the advantage over one another. Angle controlled most of the match, as Orton tried to avoid Angle's assaults. Angle tried to perform a suplex on Orton off the ring apron, but did not perform the move. This was followed by Angle performing a belly to back suplex on Orton on the outside ring floor. Mid-way in the match, Orton attempted to perform an RKO by jumping and grabbing Angle's head to drive it <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> but he countered by pushing Orton to the turnbuckle. Orton took the padding off the turnbuckle, leaving it exposed. Following this, Angle began performing a series of German suplexes on Orton. Angle then applied the ankle lock hold. Orton, however, flipped over and sent Angle face-first into the exposed turnbuckle. As he turned around, Orton performed the RKO, and covered Angle to gain the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match on}} the card was a $15,000 Body Slam Challenge between André the Giant and Big John Studd, who was {{accompanied}} by Bobby Heenan. The stipulation of the match was that André the Giant had to body slam Studd to win $15,000, and if he failed, he {{would be forced to}} retire. After beginning the match in the defensive position, André countered with chops and a headbutt. From then on André controlled the match and after weakening Studd's knees with multiple kicks, André was able to lift Studd <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and execute a body slam to win the match. After André collected his prize money, he started throwing the money out to the audience. Heenan, however, grabbed the bag holding the remainder of the winnings and ran from ringside. As a result of the match, André was able to continue his career and his WWF undefeated streak was unscathed.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a singles match in which WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin defended against the Undertaker. Originally, Shane and Vince McMahon were {{supposed}} to be the guest referees, but due to storyline purposes, Pat Patterson, an accomplice of Vince McMahon, replaced Vince, who had had his ankle broken earlier in the event, in order to prevent Shane from helping The Undertaker. Patterson, however, was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker executed a chokeslam on him. The Undertaker and Austin wrestled inconclusively until Austin hit The Undertaker on the head with a folding chair. As Austin went to cover the Undertaker, Gerald Brisco, another accomplice of Vince, came down to the ring to replace Patterson and officiated the unsuccessful pinfall attempt by Austin. Like his partner Patterson, Brisco was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker attacked him. Vince then came down to the ring as another referee replacement, but when Austin forcefully pulled the Undertaker's head <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> to perform a stunner, Shane prevented him from performing a three count. As Vince and Shane argued, Austin got up and confronted Vince, at which point Shane shoved Vince into Austin, who fell into a roll-up by The Undertaker, and then performed a fast count to give him the victory and the WWF Title.|$|E

500|$|Pickett made a {{colorful}} general. He rode a sleek black charger named [...] "Old Black," [...] {{and wore a}} small blue kepi-style cap, with buffed gloves over the sleeves of an immaculately tailored uniform that had a double row of gold buttons on the coat, and shiny gold spurs on his highly polished boots. He held an elegant riding crop whether mounted or walking. His moustache drooped gracefully beyond {{the corners of his}} mouth and then turned upward at the ends. His hair was the talk of the Army: [...] "long ringlets flowed loosely <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> trimmed and highly perfumed, his beard likewise was curling and giving up the scent of Araby." ...|$|E
500|$|Childe's other hobbies {{included}} {{walking in}} the British hillsides, attending classical music concerts, and playing the card game contract bridge. Fond of poetry, his favourite poet was John Keats, although his favourite poems were William Wordsworth's [...] "Ode to Duty" [...] and Robert Browning's [...] "A Grammarian's Funeral". He was not particularly interested in reading novels but his favourite was D. H. Lawrence's Kangaroo (1923), a book echoing many of Childe's own feelings about Australia. He was a fan of good quality food and drink, and frequented a number of restaurants. Known for his battered, tatty attire, Childe always wore his wide-brimmed black hat, which he had purchased from a hatter in Jermyn Street, central London, {{as well as a}} tie, which was usually red, a colour chosen to symbolise his socialist beliefs. He regularly wore a black Mackintosh raincoat, often carrying it over his arm or draped <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> like a cape. In summer he frequently wore shorts with socks, sock suspenders, and large boots.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} in the media that Davis put his wife's overcoat <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> while fleeing. This led to the persistent rumor that he attempted to flee in women's clothes, inspiring caricatures that portrayed him as such. Over 40 years later, an article in the Washington Herald claimed that Mrs. Davis's heavy shawl had been placed on him to protect him from the [...] "chilly atmosphere of the early hour of the morning" [...] by the slave James Henry Jones, Davis's valet who served Davis and his family during and after the Civil War. Meanwhile, Davis's belongings continued on the train bound for Cedar Key, Florida. They were first hidden at Senator David Levy Yulee's plantation in Florida, then placed in the care of a railroad agent in Waldo. On June 15, 1865, Union soldiers seized Davis's personal baggage from the agent, together with some of the Confederate government's records. A historical marker was erected at this site. In 1939, Jefferson Davis Memorial Historic Site was opened to mark the place where Confederate President Jefferson Davis was captured.|$|E

500|$|Muslims {{regard the}} Prophet Muhammad {{as the best}} example to live by, and try to emulate him {{whenever}} possible. The Islamic Prophet Muhammad reportedly in Sahih Muslim had hair that [...] "hung <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and earlobes". Sahih Bukhari, regarded the most authentic of hadith, also supports this using {{a prime example of}} the prophet Isa (Jesus). The Prophet Muhammad has also described Jesus as [...] "having long hair reaching his ear lobes." [...] Malik's Muwatta 51.2.6 reported, Yahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said that Abu Qatada al-Ansari said to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, [...] "I have a lot of hair which comes down to my shoulders, shall I comb it? The Messenger of Allah. may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, [...] "Yes, and honour it." [...] Sometimes Abu Qatada oiled it twice in one day because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to him. [...] "Honour it." ...|$|E
500|$|The feud between The Undertaker and Randy Orton and [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton {{began at}} SummerSlam. At the event, Randy faced off against Undertaker. During the match, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob (disguised as a fan) {{came into the}} ring and {{interrupted}} the match. Following this, Randy pinned Undertaker after he jumped and pulled Undertaker's head down <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> a move dubbed the RKO, to win. After the match, Randy peeled off the latex mask of the fan and revealed him to be his father, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob. On the September 16 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker defeated Randy. During the match, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob drove a U-Haul truck down to the ring and unloaded a casket. As Undertaker went to put Randy inside the casket, he opened it and found a mannequin of himself inside. Despite this distraction, Undertaker pinned Randy after he drove Randy's head into the mat in an upside down position, a move called the Tombstone Piledriver. The following week, druids wheeled out a casket. Undertaker appeared on the TitonTron and urged The Ortons to look inside. The Ortons opened the casket and found mannequins of themselves inside. Undertaker then proclaimed {{that this would be}} their fate at No Mercy.|$|E
500|$|Bostock's {{deposition}} describes Teach as a [...] "tall spare {{man with}} a very black beard which he wore very long". [...] It is the first recorded account of Teach's appearance and {{is the source of}} his cognomen, Blackbeard. [...] Later descriptions mention that his thick black beard was braided into pigtails, sometimes tied in with small coloured ribbons. [...] Johnson (1724) described him as [...] "such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful." [...] Whether Johnson's description was entirely truthful or embellished is unclear, but it seems likely that Teach understood the value of appearances; better to strike fear into the heart of one's enemies, than rely on bluster alone. [...] Teach was tall, with broad shoulders. [...] He wore knee-length boots and dark clothing, topped with a wide hat and sometimes a long coat of brightly coloured silk or velvet. [...] Johnson also described Teach in times of battle as wearing [...] "a sling <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders,</b> with three brace of pistols, hanging in holsters like bandoliers; and stuck lighted matches (Slow match) under his hat", the latter apparently to emphasise the fearsome appearance he wished to present to his enemies. [...] Despite his ferocious reputation though, there are no verified accounts of his ever having murdered or harmed those he held captive. [...] Teach may have used other aliases; on 30November, the Monserrat Merchant encountered two ships and a sloop, commanded by a Captain Kentish and Captain Edwards (the latter a known alias of Stede Bonnet).|$|E

500|$|Steiger portrayed a mastermind {{criminal}} {{seeking to}} obtain a $500,000 ransom, opposite James Mason and Inger Stevens, in Andrew L. Stone's Cry Terror! (1958) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Paul Beckley of the Herald Tribune had thought Steiger [...] "superbly laconic", but Dennis Schwartz dismissed the film as [...] "an ill-conceived attempt" [...] with [...] "too many coincidences and contrived plot points to sustain interest". The following year, Steiger appeared with Claire Bloom (whom he later married) in a Fay and Michael Kanin stage production of Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film, Rashomon, where he enacted {{the role of the}} bandit originally played by Toshiro Mifune. A major success, it was lauded by critics and nominated for three Tony awards. Robert Coleman of the Daily Mirror described Steiger's performance as [...] "magnificently animalish", while Kenneth Tynan of The New Yorker thought the acting helped set new standards for Broadway. The same year, Steiger portrayed iconic mobster Al Capone in the film of the same name. Steiger was particularly keen on demonstrating the showiness of Capone, speaking thunderously, slinging a camel-hair coat <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and wearing his hat at a jaunty angle. The film, noted for its deglamorized portrayal of the subject, earned Steiger a Laurel Award for Best Male Dramatic Performance nomination. Though Hutchinson, author of Rod Steiger: Memoirs of a friendship, perceived Steiger's portrayal of Capone {{to be more of a}} caricature, George Anastasia and Glen Macnow, authors of the book The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies, described it as one of the best screen portrayals of Capone.|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{match was}} the Extreme Rules {{lumberjack}} match between Sabu and John Cena. Before the match began, the ECW and Raw superstars {{made their way}} to ringside to take their place as lumberjacks. The match quickly began with Cena throwing Sabu out of the ring onto the Raw lumberjacks, in which they assaulted Sabu and threw him back in the ring. Sabu would later get the upper hand and throw Cena out onto the ECW lumberjacks, at ringside. Throughout the match, Sabu took the advantage over Cena as he performed a somersault leg drop, driving a steel chair onto Cena's face. Cena got the upper hand when he was able to counter a flying crossbody attempt by Sabu. Mid-way in the match, the ECW and Raw lumberjacks started brawling at ringside. At ringside, the ECW lumberjacks began their assault on Cena, after [...] he was hit with a steel chair by Sabu. They laid his head on a table, in which Sabu attempted to perform a high-flying maneuver. The Raw superstars, however, gave Cena the upper hand to hit Sabu with a kendo stick in mid-air. Back in the ring, Cena hit Sabu with a steel chair then lifted him <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> and threw him down on a table that was at ringside to execute the FU. Following this, Sabu was thrown back into the ring where Cena applied the STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent, in which Sabu submitted to and giving Cena the win.|$|E
