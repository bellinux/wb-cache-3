5|$|Although it was {{originally}} believed that neurons could not regenerate in the adult brain, neurogenesis {{has been shown to}} occur in mammalian brains, including those <b>of</b> <b>primates.</b> However, neurogenesis is limited to the hippocampus and SVZ, and the RMS is one mechanism neurons use to relocate from these areas.|$|E
5|$|Gaze following, or shared gaze, can {{be found}} in a number <b>of</b> <b>primates.</b> Domesticated animals such as dogs and horses also {{demonstrate}} shared gaze. This type of joint attention is important for animals because gaze shifts serve as indicators alerting the animal to the location of predators, mates, or food.|$|E

40|$|KEY WORDS {{community}} ecology; primate evolution; biogeography; community conservation ABSTRACT An {{understanding of}} the fundamental causes of the structure <b>of</b> <b>primate</b> communities is impor-tant for studies <b>of</b> <b>primate</b> evolutionary history, primate behavioral ecology, and development of conservation strategies. Research into these structuring factors has benefited from new perspectives such as consideration <b>of</b> <b>primate</b> phylogenetic history, metacommunities, and in-teractions with predators and nonprimate competitors. This review presents the underlying factors <b>of</b> <b>primate</b> community structure within the biogeographic regions of Madagascar, the Neotropics, Africa, and Asia. One of the major differences among these locations likely resulted from the initial primate taxa that colonized each region (...|$|R
50|$|The {{titles of}} the two archbishops have been {{distinguished}} since the 14th century with the Archbishop of Canterbury known as <b>Primate</b> <b>of</b> All England and the Archbishop <b>of</b> York as <b>Primate</b> <b>of</b> England. A similar distinction in Ireland makes the Archbishop <b>of</b> Armagh <b>Primate</b> <b>of</b> All Ireland and that <b>of</b> Dublin <b>Primate</b> <b>of</b> Ireland.|$|R
5|$|Similarly, the forelimbs of ancestral {{vertebrates}} {{have evolved}} into the front flippers of whales, the wings of birds, the running forelegs of dogs, deer, and horses, the short forelegs of frogs and lizards, and the grasping hands <b>of</b> <b>primates</b> including humans. The same major forearm bones (humerus, radius, and ulna) are found in fossils of lobe-finned fish such as Eusthenopteron.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} {{hypoglossal}} nerve, {{as measured}} {{by the size of the}} hypoglossal canal, has been hypothesised to be associated with the progress of evolution <b>of</b> <b>primates,</b> with reasoning that larger nerves would be associated with improvements in speech associated with evolutionary changes. This hypothesis has been refuted.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb, {{a special}} {{morphological}} arrangement of {{teeth in the}} anterior lower jaw, is best known in extant strepsirrhine primates, which include lemurs and lorisoid primates (collectively known as lemuriforms).

5|$|Most of the {{enlargement}} of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal cortex and {{the parts of the}} cortex involved in vision. The visual processing network <b>of</b> <b>primates</b> includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy {{more than half of the}} total surface of the primate neocortex. The prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} humans and other {{primates}} contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals, but are generally larger in proportion to body size. The encephalization quotient (EQ) is used to compare brain sizes across species. It {{takes into account the}} nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values higher than those <b>of</b> <b>primates</b> other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower.|$|E
5|$|The sublingua in lemuriform {{primates}} and tarsiers {{may have}} {{evolved from the}} specialized folds of tissue below that tongue, as seen in some marsupials, such as sugar gliders, {{as well as some}} embryonic eutherian mammals, such as whales and dogs. It is also found in some adult eutherian mammals, such as treeshrews, colugos, and rodents. The sublingua of treeshrews, close relatives <b>of</b> <b>primates,</b> is less developed than in lemuriforms and tarsiers, but suggests a phylogenetic relationship.|$|E

5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that <b>of</b> <b>primates</b> and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|In biology, {{homology}} is {{the existence}} of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different taxa. A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of vertebrates, where the wings of bats, the arms <b>of</b> <b>primates,</b> the front flippers of whales and the forelegs of dogs and horses are all derived from the same ancestral tetrapod structure. Evolutionary biology explains homologous structures adapted to different purposes {{as the result of}} descent with modification from a common ancestor. Homology was explained by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this, from Aristotle onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by Pierre Belon in 1555. The term was applied to biology by the anatomist Richard Owen in 1843.|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, animal {{sources are}} governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which {{requires}} lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported {{and is not a}} wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement. In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established. The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer <b>of</b> <b>primates</b> into the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs are {{a diverse}} group <b>of</b> <b>primates</b> in terms of {{morphology}} and physiology. Some lemurs, such as the sportive lemurs and indriids, have longer hind limbs than forelimbs, making them excellent leapers. Indriids also have a specialized digestive system for folivory, exhibiting enlarged salivary glands, a spacious stomach, and an elongated caecum (lower gut) that facilitates fermentation. The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) reportedly has a very long tongue, allowing it to feed on nectar. Likewise, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) has a feathery brush-shaped tongue, also uniquely adapted to feed on nectar and pollen. The aye-aye has evolved some traits that are unique among primates, making it stand out among the lemurs. Such traits include continuously growing, rodent-like front teeth for gnawing through wood and hard seeds; a highly mobile, filiform (filament-shaped) middle finger for extracting food from tiny holes; large, bat-like ears for detecting hollow spaces within trees; and use of self-generated acoustical cues to forage.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains <b>of</b> <b>primates.</b> Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
