5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone.</b> The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of the {{wildebeest}} are known to hybridise. Male black wildebeest {{have been reported to}} mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa. The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species, however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase {{in the size of the}} hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals, the tympanic part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone</b> is highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E

25|$|The major ligament, the {{temporomandibular}} ligament, {{is actually}} the thickened lateral portion of the capsule, and it has two parts: an outer oblique portion (OOP) and an inner horizontal portion (IHP). The base of this triangular ligament {{is attached to the}} zygomatic process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone</b> and the articular tubercle; its apex is fixed to the lateral side of the neck of the mandible.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report the}} {{audiometric}} and radiologic {{findings in the}} first otosclerosis family linked to OTSC 5. STUDY DESIGN: A clinical investigation of a family linked to OTSC 5, including analyses of audiometric data and of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> from genetically affected family members. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Family members from a four-generation pedigree with otosclerosis segregating as an autosomal dominant trait. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Pre-surgery pure tone audiometric data. Classification of otosclerotic foci on high-resolution spiral CT images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> genetically affected individuals. RESULTS: Audiometric data showed a considerable degree of phenotypic variability. Cross-sectional regression analysis did not disclose any clear age dependence of threshold-related data. Systematic differences between mean parameter values relating to the thresholds in the best or the worst ear were found. High-resolution CT images revealed a fenestral otosclerotic focus in seven of nine (78 %) clinically affected individuals and cochlear foci {{in one of these}} seven patients. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> phenotype <b>of</b> OTSC 5 seems to be variable. Additional long-term audiometric data are needed to construct age-related typical audiograms, which may also facilitate the comparison between phenotypes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different otosclerosis loci. <b>The</b> detection rate <b>of</b> otospongiotic foci in our study group is similar or lower compared with previous reports on CT data in consecutive otosclerosis patients who had stapes replacing surgery...|$|R
25|$|One of his {{earliest}} contributions {{while at the}} Royal Infirmary, in 1877, was in orthopaedics, {{by means of the}} development of the first bone grafts, but also in knee surgery using a special instrument (Macewen's osteotome) both techniques becoming key treatments for the highly prevalent disease of rickets (caused by a lack of Vitamin D). Macewen was interested in the biology of bone and carried out a classical series of experiments on animals in order to determine how bones grow and may be repaired. He developed surgical treatments for mastoid disease and pyogenic cysts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone</b> and has identified an anatomical structure in this bone, the foveola suprameatica, which was named MacEwen's triangle in his honour.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of dehiscence {{can be detected}} by a high definition (0.6mm or less) coronal CT scan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone,</b> currently the most reliable way to distinguish between superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) and other conditions of the inner ear involving similar symptoms such as Ménière's disease and perilymphatic fistula. Other diagnostic tools include the vestibular evoked myogenic potential or VEMP test, videonystagmography (VNG), electrocochleography (ECOG) and the rotational chair test. An accurate diagnosis is of great significance as unnecessary exploratory middle ear surgery may thus be avoided. Several of the symptoms typical to SCDS (e.g. vertigo and Tullio) may also be present singly {{or as part of}} Ménière's disease, sometimes causing the one illness {{to be confused with the}} other. There are reported cases of patients being affected by both Ménière's disease and SCDS concurrently.|$|E
25|$|The two parotid glands {{are major}} salivary glands {{wrapped around the}} mandibular ramus in humans. The largest of the salivary glands, they secrete saliva to {{facilitate}} mastication and swallowing, and amylase to begin the digestion of starches. It is the serous type of gland which secretes the ptyalin. It enters the oral cavity via the parotid duct or Stensen duct. The glands are located posterior to the mandibular ramus and anterior to the mastoid process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone.</b> They are clinically relevant in dissections of facial nerve branches while exposing the different lobes of it since any iatrogenic lesion will result in either loss of action or strength of muscles involved in facial expression. They produce 20% of the total salivary content in the oral cavity. Mumps, a virus infection, is caused due to infection in parotid salivary gland.|$|E

25|$|The {{articular}} disc is a fibrous {{extension of}} the capsule in between the two bones of the joint. The disc functions as articular surfaces against both the temporal bone and the condyles and divides the joint into two sections, as already described. It is biconcave in structure and attaches to the condyle medially and laterally. The anterior portion of the disc splits in the vertical dimension, coincident with the insertion of the superior head of the lateral pterygoid. The posterior portion also splits in the vertical dimension, and the area between the split continues posteriorly and {{is referred to as}} the retrodiscal tissue. Unlike the disc itself, this piece of connective tissue is vascular and innervated, and in some cases of anterior disc displacement, the pain felt during movement of the mandible is due to the condyle compressing this area against the articular surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the {{internal}} carotid artery enters the canal in the petrous portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>temporal</b> <b>bone,</b> it first ascends a short distance, then curves anteriorly and medially. The artery lies at first {{in front of the}} cochlea and tympanic cavity; from the latter cavity it is separated by a thin, bony lamella, which is cribriform in the young subject, and often partly absorbed in old age. Farther forward it is separated from the trigeminal ganglion by a thin plate of bone, which forms the floor of the fossa for the ganglion and the roof of the horizontal portion of the canal. Frequently this bony plate is more or less deficient, and then the ganglion is separated from the artery by fibrous membrane. The artery is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a prolongation of dura mater, and is surrounded by a number of small veins and by filaments of the carotid plexus, derived from the ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
