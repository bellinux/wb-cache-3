5|$|Although Bomis began {{a search}} for experts to vet Nupedia articles, this proved tedious. In August 2000 Nupedia had more than 60 {{academics}} contributing to the peer-review process on the site, most with doctor of philosophy or doctor of medicine degrees. Scholars wishing to contribute to Nupedia were required to submit their credentials via fax for verification. At that time, Bomis was attempting to obtain advertising revenue for Nupedia and the company was <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> it could fund the project with ad space on Nupedia.com.|$|E

It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between managerial optimism and debt conservatism (i. e. the low-leverage puzzle). Our analysis demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>optimistic</b> tone, our time-varying optimism measure, significantly decreases leverage. This evidence supports the proposition <b>that</b> <b>optimistic</b> managers who consider external financing as unduly costly use debt conservatively. This reduced reliance on external financing can be explained by our further evidence <b>that</b> <b>optimistic</b> tone significantly increases cash holdings and decreases dividend payment. The negative tone-leverage relation is stronger in the presence of high insider purchase of own stocks which confirms <b>that</b> <b>optimistic</b> tone reflects managerial optimism. This study suggests that managerial optimism can help explain the low-leverage puzzle...|$|R

5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> it could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E

Martin had remained <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> a negotiated settlement could be reached whereby the US {{would not have to}} pull out of South Vietnam and, in an effort to avert defeatism and panic he instructed Major James Kean, Commanding Officer of the Marine Security Guard Battalion and Ground Support Force Commander United States Embassy Compound, that he could begin to remove the tamarind tree and other trees and shrubbery which prevented the use of the Embassy parking lot as a helicopter landing zone.|$|E

He was an anti-war believer who held psychology should aim to assist humanity's quest to avert future wars. He was <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> people and ethnicities, making up nations, could be taught to live in peace, though the races were not equal in inborn mental capacity, a belief he held as scientific. In the later part of his career he wrote books looking at international relations, war, and the differences between races on emotions. He was also a scholar of the classics and translated Greek philosophers.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies {{played the}} Orange Bowl without {{starting}} linebacker Lyndell Gibson, who fractured his shoulder {{in the second}} quarter of the ACC Championship Game. Gibson was fourth on the team in tackles with 66. Replacing Gibson was redshirt freshman Tariq Edwards, who played only a few times before the Orange Bowl. The Hokies also returned a player from injury for the Orange Bowl. Linebacker Barquell Rivers, who had been predicted to be Tech's starting middle linebacker, suffered a torn quadriceps tendon in offseason workouts, causing him to miss every game. Heading into the Orange Bowl, coaches were <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> he had healed enough to be able to play.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} <b>optimistic</b> <b>that</b> the fourth {{installment}} might {{be released in}} the last quarter of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} chief {{executive}} officer (CEO) optimism effect on managerial motives for cash holdings and find <b>that</b> <b>optimistic</b> and non-optimistic managers have significantly dissimilar purposes for holding more cash. This is consistent with both theory and evidence <b>that</b> <b>optimistic</b> managers are reluctant to use external funds. Optimistic managers hoard cash for growth opportunities, use relatively more cash for capital expenditure and acquisitions, and save more cash in adverse conditions. By contrast, they hold fewer inventories and receivables and their precautionary demand for cash holdings is less than that of non-optimistic managers. In addition, we consider debt conservatism in our model and find no evidence <b>that</b> <b>optimistic</b> managers? cash hoarding is related to their preference to use debt conservatively. We also document <b>that</b> <b>optimistic</b> managers hold more cash in bad times than non-optimistic managers do. Our work highlights the crucial role that CEO characteristics play in shaping corporate cash holding policy...|$|R
