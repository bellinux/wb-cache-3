40|$|Manipulation {{validity}} may {{be influenced}} by many factors, including specific aspects of experimental procedure. Meta-analysis is an ideal tool for assessing factors that influence manipulations because it is capable of equating, combining, and gauging the impact of different experimental procedures on a given manipulation. This use of meta-analysis is demonstrated by meta-analyzing experiments employing the Velten mood manipulation. This manipulation has been criticized for creating experimental demand. Procedures relevant to experimental demand include whether an honest or deceptive <b>cover</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> used and whether a self-report or non-self-report manipulation check measure is used. Effect sizes are smaller when a deceptive (vs. honest) <b>cover</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> used and when a non-self-report (vs. self-report) manipulation check measure is used. Discussion concerns how the Velten manipulation may be compromised and how meta-analysis may be employed to evaluate factors influencing manipulation validity...|$|R
