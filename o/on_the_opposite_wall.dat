5|$|The {{church is}} entered through the porch {{to the west}} end of the south wall of the nave, which leads to an arched doorway. There are two 18th-century slate plaques on the walls by the south door commemorating those who made {{donations}} to the poor of the parish; one has names from 1761, the other from 1766. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> a 17th-century slate plaque commemorates Hugh ap Richard Lewis and his wife Jane (died 1660 and 1661 respectively). The internal timbers of the roof, some of which are old, are exposed, but there is a decorated panelled barrel-vaulted ceiling above the sanctuary at the east end of the church. The transept roof is largely 17th-century.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to move city and county {{government}} functions {{out of the state}} capitol, the city purchased a plot of land to build on in 1832. They chose a spot on the edge of De Witt's public square, along Eagle Street at the eastern terminus of Lion Street (later renamed Washington Avenue); the land was bought from St. Peter's Church for $10,295.95 ($ in modern dollars). The design of the new city hall was done by Albany architect Philip Hooker. The cornerstone was laid by Mayor John Townsend amid a Masonic ceremony, however the date of this event is in dispute. The building was completed in 1832 {{at a cost of about}} $92,000 ($ in modern dollars). The new city hall was a Greek Revival structure, built of white marble with an entrance porch supported by four Doric columns. On the roof was a gilded dome. The interior was simple, with little ornamentation, though a full-length statue of Alexander Hamilton stood in the center of the upper hall, between the Court room and the Common Council Chamber. Upon one side of this hall was a bas-relief of DeWitt Clinton, with a view of a primitive canal-boat in the distance, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall</b> was a similar figure of Sir Walter Scott. The building was destroyed by fire on February 10, 1880. Plans for a replacement city hall quickly developed.|$|E
25|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall</b> {{there is}} a door flanked by soupe, with a {{rectangular}} pulpit on a stone corbel, surrounded by a wooden balustrade. At {{the front of the}} nave, there are two retables with gilded carvings, protected by iron railings, that shelter the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (pulpit side) and Our Lady of Fátima (epistle-side), both flanked by pews.|$|E
50|$|The two saints' {{stories are}} to be read from the top to the bottom, and mirror each other <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>walls.</b> <b>The</b> two lunette depict scenes {{of the birth of}} the two saints, while in the central scenes is their abandon of the secular life to take the vows; finally, the lower scenes show their martyrdom (central wall) and their death or funeral (side walls).|$|R
50|$|The main courtrooms are {{the most}} {{significant}} spaces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third floor. The most impressive is the two-story en banc courtroom that is designed {{for all of the}} appellate judges to meet to hear a case. Walls are covered with elaborately carved, stained oak paneling decorated with garlands, scrolled brackets, and molding. Large, round-arch windows are balanced with recessed arched bays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>walls.</b> Bronze grilles are located throughout. The maple floor is laid in a herringbone pattern and an elaborate, plaster, coffered ceiling with rosettes tops the room. Another appellate courtroom, although slightly smaller in scale, is equally impressive. Similar finishes are used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls and floor, and a gallery of oak benches provides seating for observers.|$|R

25|$|Beyond the Great Hall is {{the dining}} room for the courtiers in {{attendance}} (the Courtiers-in-Attendance Dining Room). The room was designed by Rastrelli in the mid-18th century. The small room is lit by four windows which look out into the formal courtyard. The architect placed false windows with mirrors and mirrored glass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> making the hall more spacious and bright. Decorated in the typical baroque interior style, the hall is filled with gilded wall-carvings, complex gilded pieces on the doors, and ornamental patterns of stylized flowers. The ceiling mural was painted by a well-known student of the Russian School from the mid-18th century. It {{is based on the}} Greek myth of the sun god Helios and the goddess of the dawn, Eos.|$|E
25|$|Quarto do Rei D. Luís (King Luís's Room), {{covered in}} wood paneled wainscoting, painted white and gold remains {{as one of}} the few rooms in the Palace painted in its {{original}} un-restored wall colors. The painted ceiling, depicting an allegorical representation of Paz by Cyrillo Volkmar Machado that includes figures, mythical figures and flowers in each corner, while the main ceiling is designed as a fanciful open-air Cupola. The walls are painted simply in white with gold trim, divided in square panels, while the floor is paved in parquet. An ornate bed, table and white-velvet chairs decorate the room, with a writer’s desk along one wall, while statues stand in the window niches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall</b> from the bed. Paintings of many of the Portuguese monarchs are located on one of the walls, while over the desk the full-size painting of King Carlos of Portugal is hung.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the Tent Room is drawn from the original use of striped fabric draped {{on the walls and}} hung in swaths from the ceiling in order to temporarily transform what was normally the tennis court into a dining hall. The room today has a wall covering of vertically sriped red and gold fabric with a padded backing, which rises to meet the same fabric hung in a swag fashion outwards from a single coffer in the centre of the ceiling and trimmed {{around the perimeter of the}} room with a scallop edged valence of simple passementerie and tassels. This gives the space an overall resemblance to the interior of a large tent. The west wall of the room is broken by series of windows, each paired with a double door into the Long Gallery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> and between them a continuous frame and panel wainscotting. All this woodwork, including the door frames and other trim, is painted in a gloss white to contrast with the textured and patterned wall fabric.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} ion motion in an {{electrolyte}} solution flowing {{in a thin}} rectangular duct with velocity V_E {{in the presence of}} a transverse magnetic field B_ 0 is studied by means of classical mechanics and electrodynamics. Because of Lorentz force <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ions in the electrolyte solution, a so called Faraday voltage appears at the electrodes orthogonal to both the field B 0 and the velocity V_E. The dynamics of positive and negative ions (cations and anions, respectively) in this classical system is studied by taking into account the viscosity of the fluid and the process of charge accumulation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> duct. Hydrogen production is seen to take place at one of the electrodes when salt water is taken as the flowing electrolyte...|$|R

50|$|The murals occupy an {{extensive}} amount of space, covering {{three of the}} four walls of the Council Room. The only wall that does not have a mural is the southern wall, as this wall contains the only window of the room. The door from which the council would enter is found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> northern <b>wall.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> eastern wall Lorenzetti depicted the scenes of the Effects of Good Government, while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western <b>wall,</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>the</b> fresco displaying The Effects of Good Government lays the depiction of The Effects of Bad Government.

25|$|Directly west {{of these}} rooms is the Edwardian Mappin Wing, which {{contains}} the entrance hall. Its walls are partly panelled, partly clad in marble; the lower floor covered in mosaic tile {{and the upper}} with wood. The two levels are connected by a wide, white marble, central stair; to each side, at the upper landing, are marble guards with ornate, Neoclassical balustrades. Across {{from the top of}} the stair is a door (to the reception room) flanked with wood panels documenting the names and escutcheons of each of the governors general for New France, British North America, and Canada. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> to the left of the entrance, is the Royal Window—a stained glass piece commemorating the 40th anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth II to the throne, displaying, between the Queen's Canadian royal standard above and the Great Seal of Canada below, the monarch's coat of arms for Canada surrounded by the shields of each of the provincial coats of arms. Additionally, in the top two corners are images of Elizabeth's royal cypher, balancing out representations of the Sovereign's badges for both the Order of Canada and the Order of Military Merit in the bottom two corners. Another stained glass window is found to the right of the entrance, marking the first appointment of a Canadian-born governor general; the viceregal position is symbolised by a crowned lion holding a maple leaf and surrounded by the shields of the arms of the first seven persons to hold the post. In 2012, bronze and glass handrails, funded by a private donation from Rouge Herald Extraordinary Roger Alexander Lindsay, were added to each side of the stair in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
500|$|All {{that remains}} {{of the church is}} the chancel, which is 18feet 6inches by 14feet 6inches (5.6 by 4.4m), and the north chapel which is 15feet 6inches by 13feet (4.7 by 4.0m); the nave, south chapel and the roof have been {{demolished}} or removed. The walls are built from rubble masonry dressed with sandstone. [...] The church is now entered through a doorway at the west end of the chancel; the doorway reuses a 15th-century pointed arch. The south wall still shows where there was formerly a chapel on that side. [...] <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> there is a window from the late 16th century with three lights (sections of window separated by stonework); the entrance to the north chapel has been reduced in width. The three-light east window also dates from the late 16th century. An inscribed stone above the window records the date 1598.|$|E
500|$|Men from CCC Camp S-88-Pa, {{based at}} nearby Lyman Run in Potter County, were also {{active in the}} park. In 1939, they built a {{structure}} at Cherry Springs which is [...] "the largest and most unique of the CCC-built picnic pavilions" [...] in the state, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The pavilion overlooks PA Route 44and is shaped like an H, with two partially enclosed structures (the vertical lines of the H) connected by a breezeway (the horizontal bar). The breezeway is a roof supported by eight log columns with log railings. The ends of the pavilion are built from log walls with white chinking, like log cabins. Each end has a large opening to the breezeway in one wall, while the other three sides are fully enclosed with a large window in the wall facing the highway, a stone fireplace and chimney <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> and a door flanked by windows on the wall opposite the breezeway.|$|E

500|$|The {{ceiling of}} the chancel {{consists}} of a stone lierne vault with almost 70carved bosses dating from the 14thcentury. [...] The eastern bosses depict the life of Mary and the western ones Christ's Passion and Resurrection. [...] Over each choirstall is a carved wooden triple-arched canopy. [...] The canopies are described as having [...] "a complexity unsurpassed in English medieval woodcarving". [...] Clifton-Taylor considered {{that they are the}} finest in the country, although he complained that they have been stained nearly black. [...] At the lower ends of the canopies are Victorian carvings of angels, grotesques and foliage and below these are carvings on corbels of subjects such as mermaids, centaurs, wyverns and musical angels. [...] At the back of the choirstalls are 20misericords which date from the early–mid 15thcentury. [...] Under of each of these is a different carving; the subjects include Saint George and the Dragon, the Virgin and a unicorn, and a pelican with her brood. [...] At the ends of the choirstalls are carvings of poppyheads, wyverns and a green man. [...] The altar table is Elizabethan and is dated 1638. [...] In the north wall of the sanctuary is an aumbry and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall</b> are a canopied piscina and a triple sedilia, also with canopies. [...] These canopies are described as being [...] "among the showpieces of the 14thcentury masons". [...] The reredos was dedicated in 1919 and contains carvings of Christ on the Cross, Mary and John, and the four national saints, Saints George, Andrew, Patrick and David. [...] The canopies above them echo those of the choirstalls.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a numerical study of ventilation performance of balconies using computational fluid dynamics. The pressure coefficients distributed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>walls</b> of a five-storey building model, both {{with and without}} balconies, were studied under variation of the wind direction, balcony dimensions and building height. The effect of balconies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> capacity for wind-induced natural ventilation is discussed. The numerical results show good agreement with the experiments of Chand et al. They also indicate that a balcony enhances the cross-ventilation of intermediate floors but weakens that of the ground and top floors, by significantly changing <b>the</b> pressure distribution <b>on</b> <b>the</b> windward wall. Finally, the ventilation performance of a balcony is not greatly affected by variations in its size but is slightly weakened as {{the height of the}} building increases.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of an electrochemical detector with two working electrodes located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>walls</b> of a thin-layer cell and its use as a detector for High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) {{in the analysis of}} catecholamines in human cerebrospinal fluid are described. The location of the electrodes in this manner permits an electrochemically reversible or quasireversible couple to be electrolized more than once as it passes through the detector. If one electrode is held at a potential where oxidation takes place and the second electrode at a potential where reduction of this oxidized form back to the starting material occurs, then the current produced increases proportionately to the number of conversions that take place. A comparison of this cell in the dual-working-electrode and single-working-electrode mode shows an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of six. This HPLC system with electrochemical detection has been used {{for the first time to}} detect norephinephrine (141 pg/mL) and dopamine (262 pg/mL) in human cerebrospinal fluid...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{ground-state}} structures of identical classical point charges with Coulomb interactions, confined between two symmetric parallel charged walls. For the well understood homogeneous dielectric case with no electrostatic images, the charges evenly condense <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>walls,</b> thereby forming a bilayer Wigner crystal; five structures compete upon changing the inter-wall separation. Here, we consider a dielectric jump between {{the walls and}} a solvent in which charges are immersed, implying repulsive images. Using recently developed series representations of lattice sums for Coulomb law, we derive the complete phase diagram. In contrast to the homogeneous dielectric case, the particles remain in a hexagonal Wigner monolayer {{up to a certain}} distance between the walls. Beyond this distance, a bifurcation occurs to a sequence of Wigner bilayers, each layer having a nonzero spacing from the nearest wall. Another new phenomenon is that the ground-state energy {{as a function of the}} wall separation exhibits a global minimum...|$|R

50|$|Meiringen is {{the only}} {{airfield}} with fully operational cavernes. The caverne at Meiringen was extended and refurbished for about 120 million Swiss Francs to comply {{to the needs of}} the current Swiss airforce F/A-18 fighters. Because of the weight of these aircraft hanging them in overhead cranes would be enormously expensive so that was not considered a viable option. Instead an extra tunnel had to be built. The tunnels are connected by some linking tunnels and extra dispersals were added <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>walls</b> of each tunnel making it possible to operate 22 F/A-18s. The aircraft are able to roll in and out at the same time without the need of moving parked aircraft. A linking tunnel constructed directly before the main blast doors makes it possible to refuel and rearm an aircraft immediately after its mission without opening the main blast doors.
