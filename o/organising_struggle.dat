50|$|The Guerrilla {{war in the}} Baltic {{states or}} the Forest Brothers {{resistance}} movement was the armed struggle against Soviet rule that spanned from 1944 to the mid-1950s. After the occupation of the Baltic territories by the Soviets in 1944, an insurgency started. According to some estimates, 10,000 partisans in Estonia, 10,000 partisans in Latvia and 30,000 partisans in Lithuania and many more supporters were involved. This war continued as an <b>organised</b> <b>struggle</b> until 1956 when {{the superiority of the}} Soviet military caused the native population to adopt other forms of resistance. While estimates related to the extent of partisan movement vary, but {{there seems to be a}} consensus among researchers that by international standards, the Baltic guerrilla movements were extensive. Proportionally, the partisan movement in the post-war Baltic states was of a similar size as the Viet Cong movement in South Vietnam.|$|R

The company had initially dug test trenches on land without obtaining permission and the farmers, who were mostly tenants, objected in fear of losing their lands. The dam was eventually constructed and thus the protest ultimately failed. Compensation for lands submersed by the dam's construction was eventually arranged but was given to the landlords rather than to the tenants. Although satyagrahas are intended to be non-violent, Bapat was jailed for vandalism of the construction project: rather than be captured for this, he turned himself in. His third jail sentence was for speaking at a public gathering held by Subhas Chandra Bose.|$|R

25|$|Trotskyists {{differ on}} the extent to which this is true today, but even the most {{orthodox}} tend to recognise in the late twentieth century a new development in the revolts of the rural poor, the self-organising struggles of the landless, and many other struggles which in some ways reflect the militant united <b>organised</b> <b>struggles</b> of the working class, and which to various degrees do not bear the marks of class divisions typical of the heroic peasant struggles of previous epochs. However, orthodox Trotskyists today still argue that the town and city based working class struggle is central to the task of a successful socialist revolution, linked to these struggles of the rural poor. They argue that the working class learns of necessity to conduct a collective struggle, for instance in trade unions, arising from its social conditions in the factories and workplaces, and that the collective consciousness it achieves as a result is an essential ingredient of the socialist reconstruction of society.|$|R

40|$|How do {{precarious}} workers {{employed in}} call-centres, universities, {{the fashion industry}} and many other labour markets <b>organise,</b> <b>struggle</b> and communicate to become recognised, influential political subjects? "Media Practices and Protest Politics: How Precarious Workers Organise" reveals {{the process by which}} individuals at the margins of the labour market and excluded from the welfare state communicate and struggle outside the realm of institutional politics to gain recognition in the political sphere. In this important and thought provoking work, Alice Mattoni suggests an all-encompassing approach to understanding grassroots political communication in contemporary societies. Using original examples from precarious workers mobilizations in Italy, she explores a range of activist media practices and compares different categories of media technologies, organizations and outlets from the printed press to web application and from mainstream to alternative media. Explaining how activists perceive and understand the media environment in which they are embedded, the book discusses how they must interact with a diverse range of media professionals and technologies and considers how mainstream, radical left-wing and alternative media represent protests. "Media Practices and Protest Politics" offers important insights for understanding mechanisms and patterns of visibility in struggles for recognition and redistribution in post-democratic societies and provides a valuable contribution to the field of political communication and social movement studies.

40|$|In {{strictly}} political terms, the Gramscian {{concept of}} subalternity applies to those groups in society who are lacking autonomous political power. In Gramsci’s time these groups were easily identified, {{and much of}} the work around the concept of subalternity has centred on groups like peasants and the proletariat. But Gramsci also argued that subalternity existed on a broader scale than this, including people from different religions or cultures, or those existing at the margins of society. This aspect of Gramsci’s work is often overlooked, because many writers are interested in Gramsci’s political theory, which they use to analyse the way in which capitalism, as a structural system, has become hegemonic over time. The focus here is on the history of organised groups and their <b>organised</b> <b>struggle.</b> Hence, the emphasis is largely on white, male-oriented institutions of power. But Gramsci argued that hegemony did not exist merely at this level. Rather, he argued that hegemony comes from below, originating in the thoughts, beliefs and actions of everyday people {{who may or may not}} see themselves as part of organised groups. Hence, Gramsci was intensely aware of the way hegemony operated at a personal level. Capitalist hegemony was not, is not, possible, without a complete identification at the level of the self. This paper seeks to expand on some of Gramsci’s thinking in this area, in an attempt to understand the connections between the self and society in a theory of hegemony, where hegemony is considered a process based on leadership, rather than a state built on domination. It is through an analysis of what hegemonic processes exclude (or make subaltern), that we can expand our understanding of how hegemony works, and of how it may be resisted...|$|R
40|$|The {{worldwide}} “movement of movements”, {{which has}} brought together individual movements fighting neo-liberal capitalism and the “New World Order” {{since the late}} 1990 s, is a strange kind of animal. Some might say it {{is less of a}} single species and more of a symbiotic relationship between several species, or even a mini-ecosystem making its way through the cracks of the world the powerful created. Metaphors aside, the “movement of movements” consists of several very different kinds of things. It includes a multitude of local campaigns, sometimes organised into large-scale movements around specific issues (opposition to “war on terror”, fighting resource extraction companies, workplace <b>organising,</b> <b>struggles</b> over women’s rights over their own bodies, movements of peasants and small farmers, intellectual property campaigns, opposition to racism… {{the list goes on and}} on). It includes the high-profile summit protests where the ritual meetings of our rulers are disrupted by direct action, delegitimated by mass demonstrations, critiqued in counter-summits and forced to hide in remote rural areas, dictatorships where protests are banned, behind massive walls or shielded by armies and surface-to-air missiles. And it includes the long, slow process of creating continuity between summit protests, networking between different movements and campaigns, building trust or at least cooperation between different political (and anti-political) traditions: learning to have confidence in ourselves across a whole society or a whole world. The Grassroots Gatherings, which have been running in Ireland for the last five years, fit in here: a space to meet each other and learn to work together; a place to dance, learn juggling, fall in love and practice for street fighting; a place to work on the issues that divide us and identify what we have in common; a very temporary autonomous zone where the phrase “another world is under construction” is more than just a neat slogan...|$|R

It was not uncommon even, for workers to blackmail reluctant party organisations into supporting the killing of their enemies. Secondly, the social democrats were not driven by irrational urges but followed a rationally motivated and selective terrorist strategy. They attempted to limit or prevent workers' terrorism from below, the ‘anarchist’ potential of which they considered a threat to the <b>organised</b> mass <b>struggle.</b> They set their hopes on a division of labour, with a militant but mostly peaceful workers' movement and terrorism as the prerogative of the party...|$|R

50|$|The Prajamandal {{included}} both communists and non-communists.

This spurred the non-communist leaders of Prajamandal to try to expel the communists. However, the ban was enforced before the expulsion had taken place. Leaders of Prajamandal were arrested, and many cadres went into hiding. By not differentiating between communists and non-communists in repressing Prajamandal, the royal government indirectly contributed to increasing the support for the communist within the organisation. On Independence Day Prajamandal took out a militant manifestation in Agartala. Simultaneously, the movement started activating itself in the struggle for tribal land rights.

50|$|Austro-Hungarian {{authorities}} {{signed a}} {{treaty with the}} Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople by which the Emperor gained control over the Serbian Orthodox Church in Bosnia and Herzegovina in exchange for annual reimbursement. Serbs largely disapproved of Austro-Hungarian control over their religious institutions, and <b>organised</b> a <b>struggle</b> to gain their religious autonomy. The struggle was ended in their favour in 1905. After gaining religious autonomy, the Serbs gathered around four political groups, out of which three become notable. The notable groups became known by {{the names of their}} official newspapers, the Srpska riječ (Serbian Word), the Petar Kočić's Narod i Otadžbina (the People and Fatherland) and the Lazar Dimitrijević's Dan (the Day). Later they demanded unity under one party, which was approved to them, so they founded the Serbian People's Organisation. As a relative majority, the Serbs were a dominant political factor, and as such they demanded Bosnia and Herzegovina's autonomy from the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. Serbian politics in Bosnia and Herzegovina was dominated by the three factions gathered around the three newspapers. The main problem of Serbian civic politics was the agrarian reaction. Serb peasants demanded to be liberated from feudal relations, while on the other hand they wanted to maintain cooperation with the Muslim People's Organisation in achieving national aspirations. The group gathered around Kočić's Narod i Otadžbina newspaper completely stood for Serbian peasantry against the Muslims in order to change the agrarian position of the peasantry. Kočić's group also banned any cooperation with the Austrian-Hungarian authorities. The group gathered around Dimitrijević also advocated a radical change of the agrarian relations and criticised the Serbian civic leadership for neglecting the peasantry, but they advocated cooperation with the Austro-Hungarian authorities in changing agrarian relations. The main goal of Serbian politics in Bosnia and Herzegovina was the removal of Austro-Hungarian authority in Bosnia and Herzegovina and annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Kingdom of Serbia. Their goals, however, were no obstacle to economic cooperation with the Austrian-Hungarian authorities.|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 251 - 273. This thesis {{examines}} how urban apartheid affected Mamelodi residents, {{and how they}} responded to it, in the period 1953 to 1990. The thesis challenges the idea that township residents were victims of urban apartheid, and did nothing to improve their lives. It also challenges {{the idea that the}} African response to urban apartheid was limited to political struggles. It argues that forms of struggles went beyond social, economic and political ones, to challenge all the facets of urban apartheid. From 1953, Mamelodi residents realised the effects of apartheid laws on their lives. The thesis takes into account the inﬂuence of race, class and age {{in the evolution of the}} struggles against urban apartheid, which was implemented by bureaucratic administrative structures created by the National Party government. The notion of African Nationalism inﬂuenced Mamelodi residents in their political struggles. They saw themselves as Africans who had a birthright to rule themselves in South Africa. The thesis shows how the existence of different classes as social categories in the township contributed to various forms of struggle. These included daily struggles such as illicit beer brewing, hawking and taxi pirating. They were complemented by more <b>organised</b> political <b>struggles</b> initiated by the black middle class in the earlier years. The thesis argues that African responses in Mamelodi township made it difﬁcult for the government to control the lives of urban blacks. It began to concentrate on curbing resistance rather than insisting on the implementation of its urban policies. This deﬁance on the part of the residents led to government policy losing direction. The government became defensive as it concentrated its energies and resources on curbing resistance. In the mid 1980 s, the thesis argues, the government lost control of the township due to co-ordinated campaigns, which it failed to curb. When the government unbanned political organisations and released political prisoners in 1990, it was acceding to demands that township residents had made for many years...|$|R

These external conditions create various limitations, making requests for adaptative health information systems. Especially, when developing new solutions, defining the balance between protection of personal privacy and availability of information, is a great challenge. Several projects are working on possible {{solutions to the problem}} of sharing health information in a distributed way. Based on two different pilot projects in each of the countries Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and seen from an information security perspective, this thesis does a comparison of external conditions and various approaches to these conditions. Main focus is on the Scandinavian health legislation, but organisation of health services will also be considered briefly. The objective is to acquire new knowledge about and to contribute to the debate concerning exchange and sharing of health information. The results of this project are founded on an inductive multiple case study, and empirical data have been collected through semi-structured interviews. Through this thesis, it has become evident that health care in the Scandinavian countries is upon the whole equally <b>organised</b> and <b>struggles</b> with many of the same technological challenges. All three countries' health legislation promotes personal integrity, with Sweden as the most expressive. Nevertheless, there is a tendency towards enhancement of the patient's autonomy and a request for more united health care processes, leading to needs for new types of technological tools to ensure information security. In order to meet these requests, common national technological standards, concepts and infrastructure have become more important. In addition, the systems made have to be in accordance with Acts and regulations. Parts of the prevailing legislation are to a hindrance for exchange and sharing of information across organisational borders. The technological solutions chosen within the scope of the limiting external conditions are generally well-defined, high quality systems which have information security in focus. Still, there has become evident that some weak points exist, and there is room for improvements. In order to make health care of higher quality and ensure information security to an even larger degree, legal amendments and a more extensive national co-operation will arrange for the possibility of developing better information security solutions. </p...|$|R

The Wind Done Gone {{is one of}} the slavery novels which appeared in early 21 st century in America as a respond to the most parennial and hegemonic novel Gone with the wind(1938) authored by Margaret Mitchell. In many proslavery discourse,African-Americans found on popular culture artifacts or documents frequently employ the visual metaphor of others-as-beast. Tomap the discursive features ofthis form of racist ideology, attention is paid to the iconographic and linguistic strategies employed to depict African-Americans as physically, intellectually, and temperamentally distinct and inferior. Slavery was initially justified {{on the basis of the}} need for cheap labor, a racist ideology developed to support the subjugation of people of African descent. Included in this process was a denigration of African physical features and attributes. To respond this fact, Alice Randall tried to redefine the African- Americans‘physical appearances in her slavery novel as a resistence to colonial stereotype on African-American beauty. As the novel appeared in 21 st century, Randall conviced thatAfrican-Americando no need to bleach his Negro soul in a flood of white American ideal of beauty, but the most important thing is that the change of perception on African-Americanidentity(blackness).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a dialectical {{analysis}} of democratisation in Nigeria focusing {{especially on the}} dynamics of social forces operating within the terrains of state and civil society. It revisits the structural link between state and civil society and explores the processes of interaction in these sites between agents contesting the project of democratisation. The study critiques the dominant liberal democracy epistemology and proceeds {{on the assumption that}} democracy is a continuing project whose development depends on the outcome of struggles between contesting social forces in the political field. Grounding the mutual penetration between state and civil society in a dialectical perspective, the study links the interactions of political agents with the divergent norms and practices which they struggle to embed in society. More concretely, the work empirically explores the trajectories of struggles to achieve conditions of democratic citizenship in Nigeria and the setbacks to these efforts. In particular, examination of this struggle focuses on political engagements in the contexts of the press, <b>organised</b> labour <b>struggles</b> and <b>organised</b> engagements by political activist groups that pursue dichotomous aims around democratisation. The work tries to find out how these dialectical struggles generate progresses and reverses to democracy in Nigeria’s colonial and post-colonial history. Using qualitative analysis the thesis proceeds from a theoretical plane and pulls together some theories of dialectical relations to construct a neo-Gramscian conceptual tool, which is applied to study Nigeria as a concrete historical instance. Applying the analytical concept of ‘relations of forces’ as a specific use of the dialectical approach, the work explores authoritarian domination in the Nigerian state {{as a function of the}} alliance of dominant forces in the integral state (government and civil society) and the relations of these dominant forces with contending social forces within the same terrains. It investigates the strategy of the ruling forces towards the political, civil and social rights that define democratic citizenship and how counterforces engage the state in various contexts for the emergence of a fully democratised civil society. The study also examines the challenges of democratisation connected with its confinement to the attainment of the minimalists’ empirical referents of democracy. Falling back on historical materials, the study focuses on the struggles for democracy in Nigeria’s colonial and post-colonial epochs in relation to the experiences of journalistic actors, organised labour and other organised activists in the political field vis a vis the alliance of forces that controls the Nigerian state. The analysis draws materials mostly from both primary documents and secondary interpretive ones to illustrate the dialectics of democratic struggles in Nigeria. The study reveals that the continuing suspension of democracy in Nigeria draws from the tendency of the ruling forces to subdue democratic forces with coercion. Also, forces controlling the state penetrate the space of civil society with the use of sponsored agents to undermine genuine democratic movements. In addition, in the mediation of crises, the state apparatuses are sometimes applied in a partisan manner to create repressive institutions that undermine democratic progress. In that connection, the encounter of political forces in the executive state and civil society has yet to result in a net movement towards democratisation. Thus democratic forces located in state and civil society are not able to embed and extend democratic institutions, norms and outcomes because the coalition of the ruling forces in Nigeria undermine these outcomes and continues to maintain a superior margin of power over the democratic forces...|$|R
