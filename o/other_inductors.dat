40|$|Abstract: Large {{inductance}} requirements (for accuracy) in {{switching power}} supplies for portable applications impede system-on-chip (SoC) integration and therefore form-factor reduction because on-chip inductances are invariably low and off-chip inductors intolerably obtrusive. Cancelling the current ripple of innately small onchip inductors, however, keeps the effective output current ripple and its resulting output voltage variation (i. e. accuracy) within acceptable window limits (e. g. 50 – 200 mA and 20 – 50 mV), effectively multiplying the on-chip inductance and circumventing {{the need for}} bulky off-chip inductors. To this end, while gyrators and <b>other</b> voltage-mode <b>inductor</b> multiplier circuitry simulate relatively high inductances, they cannot supply the 250 – 750 mW loads typically attached to battery-powered switching regulators, which the predictive currentmode multipliers discussed in this paper can. The basic objective is to cancel the ac inductor current ripple with an inverting ac replica and allow the on-chip inductor to source the full dc load. Ac mismatches {{in the form of}} amplitude, delay and non-linearity, however, limit {{the extent to which the}} original ac ripple is cancelled, constraining the inductor multiplication factor to finite values. The foregoing paper describes, illustrates and derives the effects of these mismatches on the multiplication factor and shows how realistic non-idealities (e. g. up to 10 % gain error and less than 10 ns of delay) can yield inductance multiplication factors of 125 H/H at 100 kHz and 11. 5 H/H at 10 MHz in a practical switching dc–dc power-supply integrate...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{density of}} electronics within {{portable electronic devices}} provides the motivation to develop more compact power electronics, such as DC-DC converters. Typically, integrated circuits and each passive component, such as inductors, are discreetly packaged and mounted on printed circuit board (PCB), to implement the converter. Hence for further size reduction there has been growing interest for integration schemes such as Power supply in package (PwrSiP). However, {{the ultimate goal is}} the monolithic integration of the power supply solution, in an integration scheme known as Power Supply on Chip (PwrSoC). The economic effectiveness of the converter will be determined by the device footprint and number of processing steps required to fabricate the inductor. Hence, the motivation behind this thesis is the need for microinductors with large inductance density (inductance per device footprint) while maintaining low losses, which can be integrated with silicon IC. Furthermore, the need for thick layers will result in issues with yield and reliability of the fabricated device. Hence {{there is a need to}} identify, characterise and integrate materials with low residual stress into the microinductor fabrication process. A typical choice of inter-coil dielectric is the photo-definable epoxy SU- 8. However, SU- 8 suffers from intrinsic issues with high residual stress and adhesion. One possible replacement for SU- 8 as a structural and dielectric layer is Parylene-C. The first objective of this thesis proposes a test-bed inductor process, which incorporates Parylene as a structural and dielectric layer and has a short turnaround time of one week. This fabrication process involves the filling of high aspect ratio gaps between copper structures with Parylene and subsequent chemical mechanical planarisation, and a test chip has been designed to characterise these processes. Additionally, Scotch-tape testing has been used to confirm suitable Parylene adhesion to patterned and unpatterned films used in this process. Subsequently, complete microinductors, with magnetic cores, have been fabricated, characterised and benchmarked against <b>other</b> <b>inductor</b> technologies and architectures reported in the literature. Parylene is expected to produce films with low residual stress due to its room temperature deposition process. However, the test-bed inductor process requires thermal treatments up to 140 °C. Hence it was necessary to characterise the stress in Parylene films as a result of processing temperature and compare this to stress levels in SU- 8 5 and 3005 films. This study has determined the spatial variation of residual stress in Parylene-C and SU- 8 films, by combining automated measurements of strain indicator test structures and local nanoindentation measurements of Young’s modulus. These measurements have been used to wafer map strain, Young’s modulus, and subsequently residual stress in these films, as a result of processing parameter variation. It is well known that placing ferromagnetic material in close proximity to current carrying coils can further enhance the measured inductance value. However, the conductive magnetic core is also a source of loss for the microinductor. Hence, magnetic permeability, electrical resistivity and mechanical stress in the magnetic core influence the inductance value, eddy current losses and reliability of the fabricated microinductor, respectively. The ability to characterise these properties on wafer is essential for process control and verification measurements. This thesis details a test chip capable of routine measurements on NiFe films to characterise the spatial variation of these properties. Furthermore, wafer mapping measurements are reported to identify the correlation between high frequency permeability, electrical resistivity, mechanical strain and the chemical composition of two-component Permalloy film (NixFe(100 -x)) electroplated on the surface of 100 mm silicon wafers. Finally, MEMS-based inductor fabrication processes typically require a number of electrodeposition steps, which require conductive seed layers for the deposition of the coils and magnetic core material. A typical choice of seed layer is copper. However, due to copper’s paramagnetic behaviour (μ = 1) and low electrical resistivity (ρ= 6. 69 μΩ. cm) this layer contributes to eddy current losses, while acting as a thin ‘screening layer’. It is very likely that using a magnetic seed layer, within the magnetic core, will noticeably reduce eddy current related losses. However, detailed systematic experimental studies on any such improvement have not been documented in the literature. This study involves compositional, structural, electrical and magnetic characterisation of Ni 80 Fe 20 films electro-deposited on non-magnetic and magnetic seed layers (i. e. copper and nickel respectively). Mechanical strain test structures and X-ray analysis have been used to characterise the stress levels and structural properties of Ni 80 Fe 20 films electro-deposited on both copper and nickel seed layers. In addition, planar spiral micro-inductors, both with and without patterned magnetic cores, have been fabricated to determine the effect of patterning on their performance. This is in addition to quantifying the improvement in the electrical performance resulting from the enhanced magnetic and resistive contribution provided by magnetic seed layers...|$|R

Poor selection of the capacitor values may cause a pseudo-discontinuous behavior in a converter which operates, as a whole, in the continuous conduction mode. The implications of these results on output ripple and small signal response are discussed, and design guidelines are suggested. IN 1 RODUCI 10 N One of the advantages of flyback DC-DC converters is the relative ease and economy with which multiple output systems can be realized. Whereas <b>other</b> topologies require <b>inductor</b> decoupling between secondary, simple capacitive loading is sufficient for the flyback converter. Consequently, flyback converters are smaller, lighter and more economical in multiple output configurations. These characteristics probably explain their relative abundance in many commercial products in the I W- 200 W range. The analytical approaches described hitheno for multiple output flyback converters were generally {{based on the assumption that}} the multiple output topology can be reduced to a single output configuration by connecting the normalized secondary windings in parallel [I]. The apriori assumption made was that the conduction cycle for all secondary windings in a multiple output convener is the same. A closer analysis reveals however, that this assumption is not valid for the general case. Consequently, one cannot theoretically reduce the multiple output configuration to an equivalent single output convener. These problems were examined in the present study which considers the general case of a multiple output flyback converter.

Other advantages are, increased room for armature insulation, and, in polyphasers, the necessity for only two instead of three or more slip-rings. The revolving armature is still used to some extent on small machines of low voltage capacity. The alternaing current is produced by passing a coil of wire first over a north pole and then over a south pole, so that a current is first generated {{in one direction and}} then in the <b>other,</b> in the <b>inductors.</b> The current changes direction in the coil every time that it passes under a pole of the opposite polarity. At a point between the two poles, in passing from one to the other, the coil passes for a very small increment of time over a space in which there are no lines of force being cut {{and at the same time}} there is no current or E. M. F. generatedin the coil. At this point the E. M. F. generated is of minimum value or zero; but as soon as the coil begins to enter the field of the next pole, the E. M. F. begins to increase in the opposite direction until the point under the center of the pole piece or field of greatest density is reached, when the E. M. F. reaches its maximum value and again begins to decrease to zero, after which it again rises and falls in the opposite direction. When a current...|$|R
40|$|While {{a lot of}} {{time and}} {{resources}} have been placed into transceiver design, due to the pace of a conventional engineering design process, the design of a power amplifier is often completed using scattered resources; and not always in a methodological manner, and frequently even by an iterative trial and error process. In this thesis, a research question is posed which enables for the investigation of the possibility of streamlining the design flow for power amplifiers. After thorough theoretical investigation of existing power amplifier design methods and modelling, inductors inevitably used in power amplifier design were identified as a major drawback to efficient design, even when examples of inductors are packaged in design HIT-Kits. The main contribution of this research is engineering of an inductor design process, which in-effect contributes towards enhancing conventional power amplifiers. This inductance search algorithm finds the highest quality factor configuration of a single-layer square spiral inductor within certain tolerance using formulae for inductance and inductor parasitics of traditional single-π inductor model. Further contribution of this research is a set of algorithms for the complete design of switch-mode (Class-E and Class-F) power amplifiers and their output matching networks. These algorithms make use of classic deterministic design equations so that values of parasitic components can be calculated given input parameters, including required output power, centre frequency, supply voltage, and choice of class of operation. The hypothesis was satisfied for SiGe BiCMOS S 35 process from Austriamicrosystems (AMS). Several metal- 3 and thick-metal inductors were designed using the abovementioned algorithm and compared with experimental results provided by AMS. Correspondence was established between designed, experimental and EM simulation results, enabling qualification of <b>inductors</b> <b>other</b> than those with experimental results available from AMS by means of EM simulations with average relative errors of 3. 7 % for inductors and 21 % for the Q factor at its peak frequency. For a wide range of inductors, Q-factors of 10 and more were readily experienced. Furthermore, simulations were performed for number of Class-E and Class-F amplifier configurations with HBTs with ft greater than 60 GHz and total emitter area of 96 μm² as driving transistors to complete the hypothesis testing. For the complete PA system design (including inductors), simulations showed that switch-mode power amplifiers for 50 Ω load at 2. 4 GHz centre frequency can be designed using the streamlined method of this research for the output power of about 6 dB less than aimed. This power loss was expected, since it can be attributed to non-ideal properties of the driving transistor and Q-factor limitations of the integrated inductors, assumptions which the computations of the routine were based on. Although these results were obtained for a single micro-process, it was further speculated that outcome of this research has a general contribution, since streamlined method can be used with a much wider range of CMOS and BiCMOS processes, when low-gigahertz operating power amplifiers are needed. This theory was confirmed by means of simulation and fabrication in 180 nm BiCMOS process from IBM, results of which were also presented. The work presented here, was combined with algorithms for SPICE netlist extraction and the spiral inductor layout extraction (CIF and GDSII formats). This secondary research outcome further contributed to the completeness of the design flow. All the above features showed that the routine developed here is substantially better than cut-and-try methods for design of power amplifiers found in the existing body of knowledge.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis introduces an improved control principle for active du/dt output filtering in variable-speed AC drives, together with performance comparisons with previous filtering methods. The effects of power semiconductor nonlinearities on the output filtering performance are investigated. The nonlinearities include the timing deviation and the voltage pulse waveform distortion in the variable-speed AC drive output bridge. Active du/dt output filtering (ADUDT) {{is a method}} to mitigate motor overvoltages in variable-speed AC drives with long motor cables. It is a quite recent addition to the du/dt reduction methods available. This thesis improves on the existing control method for the filter, and concentrates on the lowvoltage (below 1 kV AC) two-level voltage-source inverter implementation of the method. The ADUDT uses narrow voltage pulses having a duration {{in the order of}} a microsecond from an IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor) inverter to control the output voltage of a tuned LC filter circuit. The filter output voltage has thus increased slope transition times at the rising and falling edges, with an opportunity of no overshoot. The effect of the longer slope transition times is a reduction in the du/dt of the voltage fed to the motor cable. Lower du/dt values result in a reduction in the overvoltage effects on the motor terminals. Compared with traditional output filtering methods to accomplish this task, the active du/dt filtering provides lower inductance values and a smaller physical size of the filter itself. The filter circuit weight can also be reduced. However, the power semiconductor nonlinearities skew the filter control pulse pattern, resulting in control deviation. This deviation introduces unwanted overshoot and resonance in the filter. The controlmethod proposed in this thesis is able to directly compensate for the dead time-induced zero-current clamping (ZCC) effect in the pulse pattern. It gives more flexibility to the pattern structure, which could help in the timing deviation compensation design. Previous studies have shown that when a motor load current flows in the filter circuit and the inverter, the phase leg blanking times distort the voltage pulse sequence fed to the filter input. These blanking times are caused by excessively large dead time values between the IGBT control pulses. Moreover, the various switching timing distortions, present in realworld electronics when operating with a microsecond timescale, bring additional skew to the control. Left uncompensated, this results in distortion of the filter input voltage and a filter self-induced overvoltage {{in the form of an}} overshoot. This overshoot adds to the voltage appearing at the motor terminals, thus increasing the transient voltage amplitude at the motor. This {{doctoral thesis}} investigates the magnitude of such timing deviation effects. If the motor load current is left uncompensated in the control, the filter output voltage can overshoot up to double the input voltage amplitude. IGBT nonlinearities were observed to cause a smaller overshoot, in the order of 30 %. This thesis introduces an improved ADUDT control method that is able to compensate for phase leg blanking times, giving flexibility to the pulse pattern structure and dead times. The control method is still sensitive to timing deviations, and their effect is investigated. A simple approach of using a fixed delay compensation value was tried in the test setup measurements. The ADUDT method with the new control algorithm was found to work in an actual motor drive application. Judging by the simulation results, with the delay compensation, the method should ultimately enable an output voltage performance and a du/dt reduction that are free from residual overshoot effects. The proposed control algorithm is not strictly required for successful ADUDT operation: It is possible to precalculate the pulse patterns by iteration and then for instance store them into a look-up table inside the control electronics. Rather, the newly developed control method is a mathematical tool for solving the ADUDT control pulses. It does not contain the timing deviation compensation (from the logic-level command to the phase leg output voltage), and as such is not able to remove the timing deviation effects that cause error and overshoot in the filter. When the timing deviation compensation has to be tuned-in in the control pattern, the precalculated iteration method could prove simpler and equally good (or even better) compared with the mathematical solution with a separate timing compensation module. One of the key findings in this thesis is the conclusion that the correctness of the pulse pattern structure, in the sense of ZCC and predicted pulse timings, cannot be separated from the timing deviations. The usefulness of the correctly calculated pattern is reduced by the voltage edge timing errors. The doctoral thesis provides an introductory background chapter on variable-speed AC drives and the problem of motor overvoltages and takes a look at traditional solutions for overvoltage mitigation. Previous results related to the active du/dt filtering are discussed. The basic operation principle and design of the filter have been studied previously. The effect of load current in the filter and the basic idea of compensation have been presented in the past. However, there was no direct way of including the dead time in the control (except for solving the pulse pattern manually by iteration), and the magnitude of nonlinearity effects had not been investigated. The enhanced control principle with the dead time handling capability and a case study of the test setup timing deviations are the main contributions of this doctoral thesis. The simulation and experimental setup results show that the proposed control method can be used in an actual drive. Loss measurements and a comparison of active du/dt output filtering with traditional output filtering methods are also presented in the work. Two different ADUDT filter designs are included, with ferrite core and air core <b>inductors.</b> <b>Other</b> filters included in the tests were a passive du/dtfilter and a passive sine filter. The loss measurements incorporated a silicon carbide diode-equipped IGBT module, and the results show lower losses with these new device technologies. The new control principle was measured in a 43 A load current motor drive system and was able to bring the filter output peak voltage from 980 V (the previous control principle) down to 680 V in a 540 V average DC link voltage variable-speed drive. A 200 m motor cable was used, and the filter losses for the active du/dt methods were 111 W– 126 W versus 184 W for the passive du/dt. In terms of inverter and filter losses, the active du/dt filtering method had a 1. 82 -fold increase in losses compared with an all-passive traditional du/dt output filter. The filter mass with the active du/dt method was 17 % (2. 4 kg, air-core inductors) compared with 14 kg of the passive du/dt method filter. Silicon carbide freewheeling diodes were found to reduce the inverter losses in the active du/dt filtering by 18 % compared with the same IGBT module with silicon diodes. For a 200 m cable length, the average peak voltage at the motor terminals was 1050 V with no filter, 960 V for the all-passive du/dt filter, and 700 V for the active du/dt filtering applying the new control principle...|$|R
40|$|A indução de tolerância ao alotransplante, sem auxílio de drogas imunossupressoras é um dos maiores desafios da Imunologia. Considerando o potencial tolerogênico das células dendríticas e a atividade imunorreguladora da Hsp 60, objetivamos determinar a capacidade das células dendríticas (DCs) na interação com a Hsp 60, de induzir imunorregulação, in vitro, e tolerância ao aloenxerto de pele, no sistema murino. Para tal, geramos três tipos de DCs derivadas de células da medula óssea de camundongos Balb/c: DCs imaturas (iDCs e iDCs IL- 10 tratadas com IL- 10) e DCs maduras (mDCs). As DCs foram caracterizadas quanto à sua: (i) morfologia, (ii) imunofenótipo, (iii) estabilidade do fenótipo imaturo; (iv) produção espontânea de citocinas; (v) resposta linfocitária alogenéica. Os três tipos de DCs gerados, neste trabalho, (mDCs, iDCs e iDCs IL- 10) apresentaram diferenças imunofenotípicas e funcionais em relação à estimulação de uma resposta proliferativa alogenéica. As mDCs tiveram maior expressão de moléculas coestimuladoras e maior indução de proliferação de linfócitos T (LT) alogenéicos. As iDCs IL- 10 apresentaram estabilidade do fenótipo imaturo, após desafio com LPS e mostraram baixa capacidade de induzir proliferação de LT alogenéicos. Não observamos um perfil diferencial em relação à produção espontânea de citocinas pelos três tipos de DCs, no tempo analisado. No entanto, TNF- foi a citocina mais freqüentemente detectada nos 3 tipos de DCs, principalmente nas mDCs, enquanto que a IL- 6 foi produzida em maiores quantidades pelas mDCs e a IL- 10 pelas iDCs IL- 10. Após a caracterização das diferentes DCs, estas células foram tratadas com os fragmentos da Hsp 60, por 24 horas. Avaliamos se esses fragmentos tiveram a capacidade de modificar nas DCs: (i) a expressão de moléculas coestimuladoras; (ii) a produção de citocinas; (iii) a capacidade de induzir e inibir proliferação e citocinas em coculturas autólogas; (iv) a capacidade de inibir proliferação e a produção de citocinas em resposta ao estímulo de CD 3; (v) a capacidade de induzir tolerância ao transplante de pele em camundongos via injeção de DCs tratadas com fragmentos da Hsp 60 ou com a injeção do anticorpo DEC 205 -N 3. A interação dos fragmentos da Hsp 60 com as diferentes DCs induziu modificação na expressão de moléculas coestimuladoras e na produção de citocinas. Alguns peptídeos se destacaram como predominantemente indutores de citocinas imunorreguladoras, (IL- 10 e TGF-; peptídeos p 277 e N 7), e outros como predominantemente indutores de citocinas pró-inflamatórias (TNF-, IFN- e IL- 12; peptídeos I 8 e I 2). Além disso, o peptídeo N 7 foi o maior inibidor da expressão de moléculas coestimuladoras, enquanto a proteína C-Hsp 60 ora aumentou ora inibiu essa expressão. O peptídeo N 7 teve um efeito dominante na inibição da auto-reatividade de LT dirigida às DCs, tanto proliferativa como na produção de citocinas, principalmente inflamatórias. Alguns fragmentos da Hsp 60 (C-Hsp 60, p 277 e principalmente o peptídeo N 7) foram capazes de, em alguns experimentos, inibir a proliferação e a produção de citocinas inflamatórias das coculturas de LT com DCs estimuladas com o anticorpo CD 3. Apesar da dupla atividade funcional da Hsp 60 na interação com as DCs observada, in vitro, nesse trabalho, houve um predomínio de imunorregulação. Destacamos que o peptídeo N 7 teve o perfil mais imunorregulador. Nossos dados sugerem o envolvimento de múltiplos mecanismos de ação para a atividade imunorreguladora da Hsp 60, na interação com as DCs. Apesar dos nossos protocolos não terem induzido tolerância ao aloenxerto de pele em camundongos, observamos que os animais injetados com as iDCs IL- 10 tratadas com p 277 ou N 7, tiveram uma maior sobrevida do enxerto (16 e 17 dias versus 14 dias). Assim, acreditamos que esses protocolos de indução de tolerância possam ser otimizados para o uso em modelos murinos, visando futuras aplicações na clínica em transplantes e doenças auto-imunes. The {{induction}} {{of tolerance}} to allotransplant {{without the help}} of immunosupressive drugs {{is one of the major}} challenges in immunology. Considering the tolerogenic potential of dendritic cells and the immunoregulatory activity of Hsp 60, our objective was to determine the capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) of inducing immunoregulation through the interaction with Hsp 60, in vitro, and tolerance to the skin allograft, in the murine system. For this, we have generated three types of DCs derived from bone marrow of Balb/c mice: immature DCs (iDCs and IL- 10 iDCs treated with IL- 10) and mature DCs (mDCs). The DCs were characterized as to their: (i) morphology, (ii) immunophenotype, (iii) immature phenotype stability; (iv) spontaneous cytokine production; (v) induction of allogeneic LT proliferation. The three types of DCs generated in this work (mDCs, iDCs and IL- 10 iDCs) have presented immunophenotypic and functional differences in relation to the stimulation of allogeneic proliferative response. The mDCs presented the highest expression of coestimulatory molecules and the strongest induction of allogeneic T lymphocyte proliferation. The IL- 10 iDCs presented stability of the immature phenotype after LPS challenge and showed low capacity of inducting allogeneic TL proliferation. We did not observe a differential profile in relation to the spontaneous cytokine production by all three types of DCs in the period analyzed. However, TNF- was the most frequent cytokine detected in the three types of DCs, especially in the mDCs, while IL- 6 was mostly produced by mDCs, and IL- 10 by IL- 10 iDCs. After the characterization of the different DCs, these cells were treated with the fragments of Hsp 60 for 24 hours. We evaluated if these fragments had the capacity of modifying in the DCs: (i) the expression of coestimulatory molecules; (ii) the production of cytokines; (iii) the capacity of inducing and inhibiting proliferation and cytokine in autologous cocultures; (iv) the capacity of inhibiting proliferation and cytokine production in response to CD 3 stimulation; (v) the capacity of inducing tolerance to skin allotransplantation in mice by the injection of DCs treated with fragments of Hsp 60 or by the injection of the antibody DEC 205 -N 3. The interaction of Hsp 60 fragments with the different DCs induced a modification in the expression of coestimulatory molecules and in the production of cytokines. Some peptides stood out as predominately inductors of immunoregulatory cytokines (IL- 10 and TGF-; peptides p 277 and N 7), and <b>others</b> as predominately <b>inductors</b> of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IFN- and IL- 12; peptides I 8 and I 2). In addition, the peptide N 7 was the greatest inhibitor of the expression of coestimulatory molecules, while the protein CHsp 60 at times increased, and at times decreased this expression. The peptide N 7 presented a dominant effect in the inhibition of autoreactivity of TLs directed to the DCs, both in proliferative response and in the production of cytokines, especially inflammatory ones. Some fragments of Hsp 60 (C-Hsp 60, p 277 and especially the peptide N 7) were capable of inhibiting proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines in cocultures of TLs with DCs stimulated with CD 3 antibody. Despite the dual functional activity of Hsp 60 in the interaction with DCs, in vitro, in this work we observed a predominance of immunoregulation. We highlight that the peptide N 7 presented the most immunoregulatory profile. Our data suggest the involvement of multiple mechanisms of action for the immunoregulatory activity of Hsp 60 in the interaction with DCs. Although our protocols have not induced tolerance to the skin allograft in mice, we have observed that the animals injected with the IL- 10 iDCS treated either with p 277 or N 7 presented increased allograft survival (16 and 17 days versus 14 days). Therefore, we believe that these protocols for tolerance induction can be optimized for the use in murine models, aiming future applications in the clinic in transplants and auto-immune disease...|$|R
