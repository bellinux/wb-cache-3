5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} sources, {{including}} Gardiner, {{claim that the}} ship suffered a number of cracks while firing the guns while ice-bound {{during the winter of}} 1877–78, but this incident cannot be confirmed by Russian-language sources. McLaughlin believes that any such incident would have been mentioned if it <b>occurred,</b> <b>as</b> such sources are otherwise quite candid about the ship's drawbacks.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{concentration}} of troops at EBK, the camp is overcrowded, and disturbances among the soldiers have <b>occurred.</b> <b>As</b> of mid-2009, the Ministry of Defense is attempting to alleviate the problem by relocating some personnel to Camp Tubman in Gbarnga.|$|E

5|$|Aside from dancewear and conventions, {{developments}} in agency representation <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> well. Although limited, representation for individual dancers had existed since the 1980s {{at the beginning}} of the music video era due to the pioneering work of talent agent Julie McDonald. However, the UK-based dance agencies ProDance and Superbad Talent were created to exclusively represent street dancers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} post-war period, a {{shortage}} of machinery, tools, and materials, {{as well as a}} dearth of new orders, hampered operations. Some salvage work <b>occurred,</b> <b>as</b> well as rubble-clearance and basic repairs. One of the first, rare, major contracts was for a university hospital in Bonn, 1946-49. The introduction of the German mark in 1948 {{and the beginning of the}} Wirtschaftswunder brought more new work.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{weakening}} <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> Dot neared Hainan Island on June9. The typhoon subsequently made landfall near Sanya on June10 and weakened to {{a tropical}} storm. Later that day, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin before making its {{third and final}} landfall near Hai Phong, Vietnam. Once onshore, Dot quickly degraded over the mountainous terrain of northern Vietnam, and was last noted on June12.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, {{development}} of the longer range 747-400 began. The variant had a new glass cockpit, which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three, new engines, lighter construction materials, and a redesigned interior. Development cost soared, and production delays <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> new technologies were incorporated {{at the request of}} airlines. Insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 747-400. The -400 entered service in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In February 2000, {{a tree in}} the Adventureland section {{fell onto}} the DRR's Holiday Red freight train while it was in motion, {{damaging}} the awnings and their supports on the gondolas as well as knocking off the cupola {{on top of the}} caboose before the train came to a stop. No injuries <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> a result of this accident.|$|E
5|$|In North America, it winters {{regularly}} {{along both}} coasts, ranging {{as far south}} as the Baja California Peninsula and the Gulf of California in north-western Mexico; it has been recorded as a vagrant in the interior Mexican state of Hidalgo. Some of its folk names in north-eastern North America—including cape race, cape brace, cape drake and cape racer, as well as corruptions such as scapegrace—originated from its abundance around Cape Race, Newfoundland. In Europe, it breeds in Iceland, northern Scotland, north-western Ireland (a few pairs only), Scandinavia and northern Russia, and winters along the coast {{as far south as}} parts of Spain; it also regularly occurs along major inland waterways, including the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Seas, as well as large rivers, lakes and reservoirs. It has <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> a vagrant as far south as Morocco, Tunisia and the Gambia. In Asia, it breeds in the northern stretches of Siberia, and winters along the Pacific coast as far south as China, Japan and Taiwan. It has <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> a vagrant in Mongolia.|$|E

The incident <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> the American Eagle jet was pulling into Gate G20. Damage to the two aircraft appeared to be minor and both returned to service after repair.|$|E

5|$|Reports {{into the}} crash by the Greek Air Force, and an {{independent}} investigator hired by Onassis, the Englishman Alan Hunter, concluded that it had <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of the}} reversing of the aileron connecting cables during the installation of a new control column. This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that had taken off before them had caused the crash.|$|E
