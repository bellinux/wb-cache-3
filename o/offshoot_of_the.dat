5|$|In 1783, Al-Madhkur {{lost the}} islands of Bahrain {{following}} his defeat by the Bani Utbah tribe at the 1782 Battle of Zubarah. Bahrain was not new territory to the Bani Utbah; they had been a presence there since the 17th century.

5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} ceratopsians, but closer to Triceratops than Yinlong.

The genera closely related to Psittacosaurus are all from Asia, with the exception of Aquilops, from North America.

After the war it participated in the reoccupation of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The Notitia lists a {{large number}} of units with barbarian names.

During the Principate, regular units with barbarian names are not attested until the 3rd century and even then rarely e.g. the ala I Sarmatarum attested in 3rd-century Britain, doubtless an <b>offshoot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sarmatian horsemen posted there in 175.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{interest}} in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests.

The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.|$|E
