Sotomayor has shown her individuality on the Court in a number of decisions. In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan. In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that [...] "the way to stop {{discrimination on the basis of}} race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race," [...] by stating, [...] "I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... <b>Our</b> <b>society</b> <b>is</b> too complex to use that kind of analysis." [...] In the manufacturer liability case of Williamson v. Mazda, which the court decided unanimously, she wrote a separate concurring opinion. Sotomayor's rapport with her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering with a table of contents attached. When compared to Kagan directly, one of their colleagues stated, [...] "Neither of them is a shrinking violet". Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court stated that: [...] "Both women are more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yet, because {{technology}} is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that engineers, scientists, and managers have often {{believed that they}} can use technology to shape the world as they want.

For instance, Evgeny Morozov particularly challenges two concepts: “Internet-centrism” and “solutionism." [...] Internet-centrism refers to the idea that <b>our</b> <b>society</b> <b>is</b> convinced that the Internet {{is one of the most}} stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations.
