5|$|North Kolkata is {{the oldest}} part of the city. Characterised by 19th-century architecture, {{dilapidated}} buildings, <b>overpopulated</b> slums, crowded bazaars and narrow alleyways, it includes areas such as Shyambazar, Hatibagan, Maniktala, Kankurgachi, Rajabazar, Shobhabazar, Shyampukur, Sonagachi, Kumortuli, Bagbazar, Jorasanko, Chitpur, Pathuriaghata, Cossipore, Sinthee, Belgachia, Jorabagan, and Dum Dum. The northern suburban areas like Baranagar, Noapara, Dunlop, Dakshineswar, Nagerbazar, Belghoria, Sodepur, Madhyamgram, Kestopur, Birati, Khardah up to Barrackpur are also within the city of Kolkata (as a metropolitan structure).|$|E
5|$|People {{from the}} <b>overpopulated</b> western {{highlands}} and the underdeveloped north {{are moving to}} the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment. Smaller movements are occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations {{in the south and}} east. Although the national sex ratio is relatively even, these out-migrants are primarily males, which leads to unbalanced ratios in some regions.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{the only}} U.S. National Park that permits hunting, but only of elk {{in an effort to}} keep the populations of that species regulated. This {{provision}} was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become <b>overpopulated</b> without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, {{people from}} <b>overpopulated</b> Niutao settled on Niulakita.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the first settlers came from the <b>overpopulated</b> towns and countryside of Lanarkshire and Glasgow.|$|E
25|$|There {{were few}} {{cities in the}} entire South, and Charleston (Charles Town) and New Orleans were the most {{important}} before the Civil War. The colony of South Carolina was settled mainly by planters from the <b>overpopulated</b> sugar island colony of Barbados, who brought large numbers of African slaves from that island.|$|E
25|$|This Zone was {{selected}} by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in 2004 as one of several areas for voluntary resettlement for farmers from <b>overpopulated</b> areas; no specific woredas were identified in this program. Borena became the new home {{for a total of}} 9145 heads of households and 45,725 total family members.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} reasons for the Italian {{immigration}} to Argentina: Italy was enduring economic problems caused mainly by the unification of the Italian states into one nation. The country was impoverished, unemployment was rampant, certain areas were <b>overpopulated,</b> and Italy was subject to significant political turmoil. Italians saw in Argentina a chance to build for themselves a brand new life.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, Buffalo National Park in Alberta was {{established}} with {{a herd of}} 300 plains bison. By 1916 more than 2,000 bison lived in the park, which was now <b>overpopulated.</b> As a result, many were moved to Wood Buffalo National Park in north-eastern Alberta (est. 1922). There, the plains bison and wood bison mingled and created a hybridized species of bison. The plains bison also brought new diseases which infected the existing wood bison population.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the technologically {{advanced}} U.S., war and terrorist activity have transformed Russia's cities into dangerous, <b>overpopulated</b> slums. They must also evade an unknown group of mercenaries {{claiming to have}} been sent by Aurora's supposedly dead father. The stress of humanity's situation causes Aurora to act out in strange ways and display clairvoyance abilities. On one such occasion, Aurora, seemingly for no reason, panics and runs from a crowded train station, just before it explodes in a terrorist attack.|$|E
25|$|Earth has Brazil as {{the most}} {{powerful}} nation after World War III greatly weakened the United States and destroyed the Soviet Union. Terran space travel is monopolized by the Brazilian-dominated Viagens Interplanetarias government agency. The planet is <b>overpopulated</b> and governed by a World Federation; Terrans have colonized Thor and Kukulkan, straining relations with the native inhabitants, and are responsible for maintaining a technological embargo against the primitive planets of Krishna and Vishnu in the Tau Ceti system.|$|E
25|$|The war deeply {{affected}} the local population. The Japanese enforced a harsh regime, particularly on Chinese labourers who {{they saw as}} being {{at the bottom of}} the racial hierarchy; forced labour and brutal treatment were commonplace. They decided to deport the majority of Nauru's indigenous population to the Truk islands, hundreds of miles away, where mortality was extremely high. Still <b>overpopulated</b> with troops and imported labourers, the island was subject to food shortages, which worsened as the Allies' island-hopping strategy left Nauru completely cut off.|$|E
25|$|In the 26th century, {{humanity}} {{has left}} an <b>overpopulated</b> Earth to colonize a new solar system. The central planets formed the Alliance {{and won a}} war against the outer planet Independentsâ€”those who resisted joining the Alliance. River Tam (Summer Glau) is conditioned by Alliance scientists into becoming a psychic and an assassin. She is rescued by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). During her training, River inadvertently read the minds of several top government officials and learned their secrets. Consequently, a top Alliance agent known only as the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is tasked with recapturing her.|$|E
25|$|This {{increase}} will be {{most dramatic}} on the least-urbanized continents, Asia and Africa. Surveys and projections indicate that all urban growth over the next 25 years will be in developing countries. One billion people, almost one-seventh of the world's population, now live in shanty towns. In many poor countries <b>overpopulated</b> slums exhibit high rates of disease due to unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, and lack of basic health care. By 2030, over 2 billion {{people in the world}} will be living in slums. Over 90% of the urban population of Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda, three of the world's most rural countries, already live in slums.|$|E
25|$|The 19th century, {{which brought}} {{emancipation}} to the Jews of many countries, failed to fundamentally alter {{the status of}} Moroccan Jews, but produced new divisions among them and entailed new sources of trouble. Capitalist development and European economic penetration brought prosperity to many Jewish merchants in northern Moroccan ports, but cost many Jews in the interior their traditional livelihoods, as industrial imports from Europe drove traditional Jewish crafts out of the market. As a result, many impoverished Jews migrated to <b>overpopulated</b> urban mellahs (Jewish quarters), where they struggled to survive as shopkeepers, peddlers, artisans or beggars.|$|E
25|$|Early {{conservation}} efforts {{to preserve the}} iconic bison were ultimately undermined by the federal government's goal of domesticating northern bison populations for commercial purposes. The utilitarian, scientific approach to bison management prevented the state from comprehending the complexity of local ecosystems and human cultures. The narrow focus on production resulted in poor federal wildlife management decisions, such as the transfer of thousands of plains bison from the <b>overpopulated</b> range in Buffalo National Park to the supposedly understocked range in Wood Buffalo National. The transfer had disastrous ecological consequences, including hybridization between the plains and wood bison species and the infection of the northern herds with tuberculosis and brucellosis.|$|E
25|$|Home {{rule was}} refused to the Maltese until 1921 {{although}} a partly elected legislative council was created {{as early as}} 1849 (the first Council of Government under British rule had been held in 1835), and the locals sometimes suffered considerable poverty. This {{was due to the}} island being <b>overpopulated</b> and largely dependent on British military expenditure which varied with the demands of war. Throughout the 19th century, the British administration instituted several liberal constitutional reforms which were generally resisted by the Church and the Maltese elite who preferred to cling to their feudal privileges. Political organisations, like the Nationalist Party, were created or had as one of their aims, the protection of the Italian language in Malta.|$|E
25|$|The authorities, {{fearful of}} {{starvation}} on an <b>overpopulated</b> island kept under blockade, resolved to deport the entire Nauruan population. Shortly after {{the arrival of}} the last military convoy, the Japanese called together a Nauruan council and made the announcement of the deportation of some of the islanders under the leadership of Timothy Detudamo. They refused to tell the Nauruans their destination, which increased anxiety among the population; they were only told that the island to which they would be sent had an abundance of food. Just before departure, Nakayama, second in the military hierarchy of the island, gave Detudamo a letter bearing the seal of the emperor Hirohito, indicating that the Nauruans were under his protection. This document was later used for safe-conduct by the exiles.|$|E
25|$|The {{school has}} {{consistently}} performed above average during exam season. The exams that Whitley Bay High School currently cover are GCSEs and A/AS levels. The school consistently secures {{one of the}} top two places in the North Tyneside school league tables, however, this is partially {{due to the fact that}} the other schools within the local area typically perform substantially below average. In addition it regularly features as {{one of the top}} performing state schools in the country, appearing in national newspapers: The Times and The Daily Telegraph. Whitley Bay High School regularly sends significant numbers of its more academically able students to Oxbridge, Durham University and other Russell Group universities. For example, out of the 300 <b>overpopulated</b> year 13 students in 2012, 2 people gained a place at Oxford respectively.|$|E
25|$|The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the Albertine Statute of 1848, was {{extended}} to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom {{took place in a}} framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. As Northern Italy quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and <b>overpopulated,</b> forcing millions of people to migrate abroad, while the Italian Socialist Party constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. Starting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing Somalia, Eritrea and later Libya and the Dodecanese under its rule.|$|E
25|$|Later in the epic, Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh {{the story}} of the Great Flood, which was sent by the god Enlil to annihilate all life on earth because the humans, who were vastly <b>overpopulated,</b> made too much noise and {{prevented}} him from sleeping. Utnapishtim tells how, when the flood came, Ishtar wept and mourned over the destruction of humanity, alongside the Anunnaki. Later, after the flood subsides, Utnapishtim makes an offering to the gods. Ishtar appears to Utnapishtim wearing a lapis lazuli necklace with beads shaped like flies and tells him that Enlil never discussed the flood with any of the other gods. She swears him that she will never allow Enlil to cause another flood and declares her lapis lazuli necklace a sign of her oath. Ishtar invites all the gods except for Enlil to gather around the offering and enjoy.|$|E
25|$|The {{early period}} {{coincided with the}} {{so-called}} Italian economic miracle of postwar years, an era of extraordinary growth based on rapid industrial expansion and great public works, that brought to the city a large influx of over 400,000 people, mainly from rural and <b>overpopulated</b> Southern Italy. In the last three decades, the foreign born share of the population soared. Immigrants came mainly from Africa (in particular Eritrean, Egyptian, Moroccans, Senegalese, and Nigerian), and the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe (notably Albania, Romania, Ukraine, Macedonia, Moldova), {{in addition to a}} growing number of Asians (in particular Chinese, Sri Lankans and Filipinos) and Latin Americans (Mainly South Americans). At the beginning of the 1990s, Milan already had a population of foreign-born residents of approximately 58,000 (or 4% of the then population), that rose rapidly to over 117,000 {{by the end of the}} decade (about 9% of the total).|$|E
25|$|As the {{political}} situation deteriorated, the Honduran government and some private groups came increasingly to place blame for the nation's economic problems on the approximately 300,000 undocumented Salvadoran immigrants in Honduras. Fenagh began to associate Salvadoran immigrants with illegal land invasions, and in January 1969, the Honduran government refused to renew the 1967 Bilateral Treaty on Immigration with El Salvador that had been designed to regulate the flow of individuals across their common border. In April INA {{announced that it would}} begin to expel from their lands those who had acquired property under agrarian reform without fulfilling the legal requirement that they be Honduran by birth. Attacks were also launched in the media on the impact of Salvadoran immigrant labor on unemployment and wages on the Caribbean coast. By late May, Salvadorans began to stream out of Honduras back to an <b>overpopulated</b> El Salvador.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the Spanish arrived, Cholula was {{actually}} divided into three sub entities, roughly corresponding to the municipalities of San Pedro Cholula, San AndrÃ©s Cholula and Santa Isabel Cholula. However, only the first two {{are considered to be}} part of the modern city of Cholula. San Pedro is defined by the main plaza of the city west of the Great Pyramid and area west of that. The city was important as a mercantile crossroads and a religious center, although religious practice was centered on the Quetzalcoatl Temple in San Pedro rather than on the Pyramid, which was overgrown. HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s noted he could see about 2,000 houses in the city with as many temples as days of the year. It had a population of about 100,000; however, the area was <b>overpopulated</b> leading to chronic hunger among the poor. During the Conquest, the Spanish would kill about 6,000 residents of the city in an event known as the Cholula Massacre. It is from this episode that the 365 churches legend evolves.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1930s, Poland, {{a country}} with a large {{agricultural}} sector, was significantly affected by the Great Depression, with peasants being one of the most affected groups. Polish peasantry, especially in <b>overpopulated</b> areas of Lesser Poland, was desperately poor. Prices of food products fell down, which resulted in smaller profits for the peasants. In some provinces, the countryside went backwards to the 19th century, with imminent prospect of hunger. Unemployment among youth in villages was widespread, and this grew radicalization and frustration of the impoverished people. Furthermore, the increasingly more authoritarian government (sanacja) was losing public support. Immediately after the May Coup, some leaders of peasant parties hoped that cooperation with the new government was possible. However, further events, such as destruction of Centrolew, arrest of Wincenty Witos, and the ill-fated 1930 election deeply disappointed all of them. In response to the actions of the government, in 1931 a new political party of the peasants, agrarian People's Party (Stronnictwo Ludowe, SL) was created out of three smaller parties. SL leaders, who by mid-1930s became more radical, emphasized quantity of numerous Polish peasantry and its physical strength. They claimed that peasants were real hosts of the country.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Entertainment Weekly {{listed the}} show at #17 in the [...] "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years", saying, [...] "Fringe was {{conceived}} as a mass-appeal genre procedural, with a background mythology that wouldn't detract from monster-of-the-week episodes. ... But the mythology overtook the monsters following the revelation of a parallel universe. By its third season, Fringe was <b>overpopulated</b> by multiple versions of every character. Unfortunately, that increasing narrative complexity has steadily pigeonholed it as a niche show." ...|$|E
500|$|However, HergÃ© knew {{as little}} about China {{as he did}} about the Soviet Union or the Belgian Congo. At the time most Belgians held to a {{negative}} stereotype of China, viewing it as [...] "a distant continent of a nation, barbaric, <b>overpopulated,</b> and inscrutable", and HergÃ© had long believed this view. He had included Chinese characters in two previous Adventures, in both instances depicting them according to traditional European clichÃ©s. In Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, he included two pigtailed Chinese men hired by the Bolsheviks to torture Tintin, while in Tintin in America he featured two Chinese hoodlums who plotted to eat Snowy. HergÃ© learned {{a bit about the}} country from Albert Londres' book China Madness, based on Londres' experiences in the country. He was also influenced in his portrayal of China by the 1933 German film FlÃ¼chtlinge (At the End of the World).|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Bell, Eric Goldman of IGN commented on Bell's [...] "eagerly awaited debut" [...] on the series. Matt Roush of TV Guide reported on Bell becoming a series regular on Heroes, and stated he [...] "like her more and more, especially as we see the tragic dimension of how Elle has been so cruelly used by her 'daddy,' Bob, and {{is much more than}} the flirty assassin we first met." [...] Bruce Fretts, also of TV Guide, said that Bell's portrayal of Elle was responsible for [...] "sparking Heroes to life." [...] He explains that [...] "n just a few scenes... juice up the slumping sophomore drama" [...] and her [...] "live-wire performance turned Chapter 5 into this season's strongest episode yet." [...] However, because of the large ensemble cast, Matthew Gilbert of Slate.com commented that Season Two of Heroes was [...] "even more <b>overpopulated</b> than the last, expanding from a rabble to a veritable global riot of Dubiously Gifted Ones." ...|$|E
500|$|Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone {{said that}} Hard Candy {{is the work}} of [...] "a songwriting team of American chart royalty" [...] that helps Madonna [...] "revisit her roots as an urban-disco queen. [...] For Hard Candy, she lets top-shelf {{producers}} make her their plaything." [...] Ben Thompson from The Guardian commented on the music by saying that [...] "Hard Candy is a tough, nuggety confection offering plenty for listeners to get their teeth into. [...] Whenever [...] threatens to get boring, something always happens to recapture your interest." [...] Sarah Hajibegari from The Times felt that while [...] "Hard Candy is no disaster", the album's producers have [...] "already done the same thing with Nelly Furtado, Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani." [...] Andy Gill from The Independent said that the album portrayed Madonna as [...] "how a once diverse talent has ossified into simply satisfying the sweet tooth of functional dance-pop." [...] Thomas Hausner from PopMatters wrote that the album [...] "is <b>overpopulated</b> with recycled pop that is indistinguishable and artificial, something Madonna's soothing arpeggiating vocals cannot alleviate".|$|E
500|$|The most {{controversial}} portion of Scientology's space opera is {{the myth of}} Xenu, known as [...] "Incident 2", in which Hubbard described a group of 76 planets, orbiting stars visible from Earth, organized in a Galactic Confederacy c. 75 million years ago, ruled by the dictator Xenu. The confederacy having become <b>overpopulated,</b> Xenu sent several billion of his citizens onto DC 8 planes to the planet Teegeeack (Earth), ostensibly for tax audition. There, hydrogen bombs were detonated inside volcanoes, killing the exiles, whose thetans were brainwashed on Hawaii and the Canary Islands, introducing various myths, such as the myth of Jesus, to conceal the thetans' origins. Eventually, officers of the Galactic Confederacy launched a rebellion against Xenu, which continued six years before capturing him and placing him in an electrified prison {{in the center of}} a mountain. Hubbard taught that the thetans brainwashed by Xenu's forces remained on Earth, where the [...] "body thetans", attached to human psyches, contribute to human problems; and that individuals could be freed from these brainwashed thetans and thus attain a type of salvation.|$|E
500|$|Keene's {{work has}} been publicized in Reader's Digest, National Geographic, The Washington Post, People, Life, [...] "Ripley's Believe It or Not!", and on The Rush Limbaugh Show. [...] A 2004 book, The Eagle Lady by Alaska author and {{photographer}} Cary Anderson, documents Keene's life and her relationship with the eagles. Keene received the 2004 Lifetime Meritorious Service Award from the Bald Eagle Foundation. Many of Keene's strongest supporters were local hotel owners who got extra business in the normally sluggish winter season, and photographers {{who were able to}} use clever framing of shots {{in order to make it}} appear they were photographing eagles in the wild. These photographers made enough money from these works that they bought Keene a new house with some of the profits. The news satire program The Daily Show reported on its April 17, 2006 edition that Homer had been <b>overpopulated</b> by bald eagles due in large part to Keene's activities. A crew from the show spent two days in March 2006 shooting footage for the show, including a feeding session and interview with Keene and interviews with other Homer residents about Keene and the controversy then in progress about feeding eagles.|$|E
500|$|A major {{obstacle}} for the Armenians {{residing in the}} Armenian Quarter is their Jordanian citizenship (from before 1967), because of which the Israeli government considers them [...] "permanent residents"â€”the same status as Palestinians. The Jerusalem Post wrote in 2005 that the Israeli bureaucracy [...] "considers Jerusalem Armenians to be Palestinians, which means endless delays in getting documents, and hassles at the airport." [...] A map published by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in November 2015 indicated the Armenian Quarter in the color reserved for Palestinian communities. According to Armenian researcher Tamar Boyadjian, because Armenians are considered Palestinians for all legal purposes they have difficulty obtaining travel and marriage documents. Graham Usher, a Palestine-based foreign correspondent of several Western newspapers, wrote in 2000 in {{a publication of the}} Beirut-based Institute for Palestine Studies that the Armenians [...] "were burdened with the status of being Palestinian 'residents' but ethnically Armenian. And indeed their lives, properties and heritage have been bound by the same Israeli constraints as their Palestinian compatriots." [...] The Economist also wrote in 2000 that Armenians have faced restrictions on their lives similar to those imposed on the Palestinians, such as prevention of construction of new buildings in the Armenian Quarter. The limited space in the <b>overpopulated</b> district makes housing expensive and according to Boyadjian, [...] "Most Armenians, given their current income, simply cannot afford to maintain their primary residence there." ...|$|E
500|$|The troubled times {{enveloping}} CopÃ¡n at {{this time}} are evident from the funerary tomb of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, which bears sculptures of the king performing war dances with spear and shield in hand. The sculpted column from the temple shrine has a hieroglyphic text reading [...] "toppling of the Foundation House" [...] that may refer to {{the fall of the}} CopÃ¡n dynasty. Shortage and disease afflicted the massively <b>overpopulated</b> valley of CopÃ¡n when its last known king, UkitTook', came to the throne on 6February 822. He commissioned AltarL in the style of AltarQ but the monument was never finished â€” one face shows the enthronement of the king and a second face was started but two others were completely blank. The long line of kings at the once great city had come to an end. Before the end, even the nobility had been struck by disease, perhaps because epidemics among the malnourished masses spread to the elite. With the end of political authority at the city the population collapsed to a fraction of what it had been at its height. This collapse of the city-state, which people believe occurred sometime between 800 and 830 AD, was sudden. However, the population continued to persist and even flourish between the years 750 and 900 AD, and then gradually declined soon thereafter. [...] In the Postclassic period the valley was occupied by villagers who stole the stone from the monumental architecture of the city in order to build their simple house platforms.|$|E
