Many different mechanisms have been proposed for their formation. In the LM, Plafker's (1964) tectonic model, in which subsidence results from the propagation of bedrock faults through the foreland sediments, is the most accepted. However, this model has not been verified. Here, we present new results from stratigraphic transects across the borders of three rectangular and <b>oriented</b> <b>lakes</b> in the LM. A paleosol buried under mid-Holocene sediments is used as a stratigraphic marker to assess the vertical displacement of sediments on both sides of the alleged faults. Our results show that there is no vertical displacement and, therefore, that Plafker's model can be ruled out. We suggest that, among all the proposed mechanisms behind lake formation, the combined action of wind and waves is the most likely.

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>oriented</b> thermokarst <b>lakes</b> on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska {{has been the}} subject of debate for more than half a century. The striking elongation of the lakes perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction has led to the development of a preferred wind-generated gyre hypothesis, while other hypotheses include a combination of sun angle, topographic aspect, and/or antecedent conditions. A spatio-temporal analysis of <b>oriented</b> thermokarst <b>lake</b> gyres with recent (Landsat 8) and historical (Landsat 4, 5, 7 and ASTER) satellite imagery of the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska indicates that wind-generated gyres are both frequent and regionally extensive. Gyres are most common in lakes located near the Arctic coast after several days of sustained winds from a single direction, typically the northeast, and decrease in number landward with decreasing wind energy. This analysis indicates that the conditions necessary for the Carson and Hussey (1962) wind-generated gyre for <b>oriented</b> thermokarst <b>lake</b> formation are common temporally and regionally and correspond spatially with the geographic distribution of <b>oriented</b> <b>lakes</b> on the Arctic Coastal Plain. Given an increase in the ice-free season for lakes as well as strengthening of the wind regime, the frequency and distribution of lake gyres may increase. This increase has implications for changes in northern high latitude aquatic ecosystems, particularly if wind-generated gyres promote permafrost degradation and thermokarst lake expansion...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{measures}} of polygon shapes and orientation are {{important elements of}} geospatial analysis. These kinds of measures are particularly valuable {{in the case of}} lakes, where shape and orientation patterns can help identifying the geomorphological agents behind lake formation and evolution.

Several morphometric lake attributes were determined from the resulting data set and statistically analysed regarding the lakes association with one of the three geomorphological main units of the Lena delta. Significant differences in the morphometric lake characteristics allowed the distinction of a mean lake type for each main unit. The lake types reflect the special lithological and cryolithological conditions and geomorphologic processes prevailing on each terrace. The first main unit, which represents the modern active delta, is characterized by small lakes of irregular shape, like meander scrolls and oxbow <b>lakes.</b> Large <b>oriented</b> <b>lakes</b> dominate on the second terrace that consists of Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene sands. On the third terrace, which is represented by relics of a Late Pleistocene accumulation plain with fine-grained and ice-rich deposits, typical thermokarst lakes with regular, circular shorelines prevail. Most studied lakes are thermokarst lakes by their nature, as they have been or still are expanding by thermoabrasion of shore banks and deepening of the lake basin. However, a distinction between primary and secondary thermokarst lakes can be made. Primary lakes are those initially formed by thaw subsidence, i. e. the third terrace lakes. Secondary thermokarst lakes are typically formed by other processes, e. g. the change of the fluvial channel network on the first terrace. The role of lakes on the second terrace is still debated. They appear to be typical thermokarst lakes by morphometry, but their primary initiation might have been related to inter-dune or old fluvial water bodies...|$|R

40|$|Potential {{lacustrine}} source rocks {{have been}} recognised in several Cretaceous syn-rift basins including the producing Taranaki Basin, {{but have not}} been officially recognised from drill core and seismic data. The late-Cretaceous Paparoa Coal Measures contain three lacustrine mudstone formations which outcrop in several localities and have been extensively drilled for coal mining. These formations {{are considered to be}} an easily accessible analogue for late-Cretaceous lacustrine source rocks in New Zealand and also provide valuable information regarding syn-depositional tectonics and basin formation during the late-Cretaceous. Stratigraphic columns and isopach maps were constructed from field work and drill hole descriptions and results showed variations in lithofacies across the basin. The western side of the basin is characterised by sandy lithofacies, abundant proximal turbidites and debris flows. The transition to a sub-aerial environment is marked by thick conglomerate and meter wide rip-up clasts. The central and eastern sections of the basin show massive mudstone, distal turbidites, low energy fluvial sandstones and thin, discontinuous coal. Isopach maps constructed from drill hole data identified three NNE – SSW <b>oriented</b> <b>lakes</b> with lacustrine sediment of up to 180 m thick truncated by the eastern Roa – Mt Buckley Fault Zone. It was determined fault control during deposition was to the west and the basin extended further than its current location. Revisions to isopach models highlighted a lack of change in basin orientation during deposition of the Paparoa sediments. Plate reconstructions combined with direct evidence from the basin indicate formation of the Paparoa Coal Measures could have occurred in either a rift or transtensional basin. The mudstones were geochemically assessed for hydrocarbon potential using a Source Rock Analyser (SRA). Preliminary analysis of the three mudstones has shown TOC values ranging from 1. 0 to 4. 5 wt. %, HI values ranging from 68 to 552 mHC/gTOC and Tmax results show the mudstones to range in maturity from immature to late – mature. A sample from the Waiomo Formation has excellent potential for oil generation and the low maturity results for the Goldlight Formation make it a potential shale gas resource. These results have shown the potential for hydrocarbon bearing lacustrine source rocks to exist in the Greymouth Coalfield. In addition, revisions have been made to basin formation which should be considered. Due to the availability of data from the Paparoa lacustrine source rocks, they should be used as an accessible analogue for Taranaki and other Late Cretaceous basins...|$|R

40|$|The Lena Delta in the Laptev Sea in {{northern}} Siberia {{is the largest}} delta in the Arctic covering an area of about 32. 000 km². It is situated in the zone of continuous permafrost, but is also characterized by widespread thermokarst. For many years the interest of Russian and lately also German scientists (e. g. {{within the framework of}} the German-Russian research project System Laptev Sea 2000 supported by the BMBF) has been focused on the investigation of different problems concerning biology and geosciences in this area, which serves as an interface between the Siberian mainland and the Laptev Sea. The Lena Delta can be clearly divided into an active part in the East and a passive one in the West. Furthermore, a classification is made into three main terraces, which were formed during different stages since the late Pleistocene. The first and second terraces (early to late Pleistocene) were built by fluvial action of the Lena River. The third terrace consists of relicts of a late Pleistocene accumulation plain, which was enclosed by Holocene delta progression. In addition to about 800 channels, numerous lakes occur in the Lena Delta as characteristic landforms. These are not only relevant for the reconstruction of the paleoenvironment in this area, but also for todays delta geomorphology and ecology. The lakes are obviously of different genesis, e. g. thermokarst or abandoned channel lakes, which is important for balancing methane emissions in the Lena Delta as different lake types contribute different amounts of methane to the overall methane budget. Many of them have a clear orientation of their major axes tending in the same direction, most obvious on the second terrace. The phenomenon of <b>oriented</b> <b>lakes</b> described for many arctic coastal plains has not been fully explained yet despite intense research during the past decades. Different theories on the cause of orientation have been proposed, in most of which wind is seen as the main driving force. In order to generally quantify different lake types, to investigate possible ideas about their genesis, and to test tendencies of their orientation the lakes were analyzed using remote sensing methods and spatial statistics. All lakes > 20. 000 m² were included in the analysis (more than 2. 600 lakes). Their total area is ca. 1. 865 km² which is 6 % of the delta area. Investigations were made using a Geographical Information System (GIS) based on LANDSAT- 7 ETM+ satellite data. This allowed for an effective processing of the vast study area. We analyzed parameters describing lake morphometry (e. g. area, perimeter, different form indices, orientation of the major axis) as well as the spatial distribution of lakes throughout the delta area. That includes both the geographical position and the lakes geologic-geomorphologic unit within the delta.

Three types of sedimentary structures are present within the sediments of Kern Lake. Type 1 structures consist of flame marks, load casts, and deformed clay beds. Type 2 structures are intrusive sand bodies that penetrate into adjacent sediments and are inferred to be subsurface sandblow features. Type 3 structures are irregular-shaped bodies of disrupted sand, silt, and clay and are postulated to be liquefied sediment. Density measurements of sediments sampled inside and outside sedimentary structures indicate that the structures did not compact or densify during formation into higher density configurations {{than those of the}} surrounding sediment. The Kern Lake structures were formed during three periods of seismic activity, KL- 1, KL- 2, and KL- 3. Sandblows that formed in Imperial Valley during the Imperial Valley earthquake mainshock (ML = 6. 6) on October 15, 1979, Imperial County, California, were excavated and show a definite similarity to Kern Lake structures. Using a centrifuge, experiments were conducted that modeled seismically induced liquefaction of sediment. Experimental results indicate that a minimum horizontal acceleration of 0. 20 g is necessary before sandblows will form under laboratory conditions. This g value is similar to that determined empirically (0. 13 g) from previous world-wide earthquakes. Faults in the vicinity of Kern Lake capable of generating horizontal accelerations of 0. 13 g or greater and possibly causing liquefaction of Kern Lake sediments are: Pleito, White Wolf, San Andreas, Kern Front, Big Pine, Garlock, Santa Ynez, Lockhart, and probably the unknown fault responsible for the 1812 Santa Barbara Channel earthquake. Faults capable of generating horizontal accelerations greater than 0. 2 g and considered most likely to have caused liquefaction within the sediments of Kern Lake are: San Andreas, Pleito, White Wolf, Big Pine, and Garlock. Attempts were made to date the sediments and ages of deformation using radiocarbon and paleomagnetic techniques. However, radiocarbon age dates may have been contaminated by petroleum seeps and must be considered unreliable. Type 2 structures may preserve paleomagnetic directions that existed during periods of liquefactions. Paleomagnetic age dates from sediment of a Type 2 structure suggest that deformation period KL- 2 occurred between 1420 to 1520 A. D. This period of deformation at Kern Lake occurs during the span of Sieh's (1978 a) prehistoric earthquake event V (1400 to 1510 A. D.) along the San Andreas fault and a prehistoric earthquake along the Garlock fault described by Stepp and others (1980). Historical earthquakes that occurred during 1759 - 1890 which may have caused the youngest deformation period, KL- 3 are: 1812 Santa Barbara Channel, 1852 Lockwood Valley, and 1857 Fort Tejon earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|Investigations in {{the northwestern}} part of the Willyama Complex centred on the Mt Franks - Mundi Mundi area have {{established}} a 4 km thick stratigraphic section of conformable metasediments containing thin horizons of basic volcanics in the lower two - thirds of the sequence. Establishment of this sequence was only possible once it was shown that the dominant lithological layering in metasediments is bedding, and {{that there has been}} no mesoscopic transposition during deformation. The metasediments represent a sequence of clay sands deposited in a distal shelf-slope or basin type of environment. A sequence of deformational and metamorphic events established in these rocks is regarded as an expression of the Middle Proterozoic Olarian Orogeny (c. 1695 - 1520 Ma.) and except for some reactivation of shear zones, predate deposition and deformation of the unconformably overlying Adelaidean sediments. The important D₁ deformation is a complex, progressive event with pre-S₁ static mineral growth (biotite, andalusite, sillimanite, white mica) and early minor micro-folding recognized before syn-S₁ growth and F₁ folding. An even earlier period of pre-S₁ fabric formation mainly defined by white mica, biotite and ilmenite, is not related to any visible folding and may either represent an earlier discrete event or an early phase of the D₁ event, However, as now defined, minerals outlining this pre-S₁ fabric are related to the D₁ event. The low, medium and high grade metamorphic zones defined in the field by biotite, andalusite and sillimanite respectively are pre-S₁ in age and predate F₁ folding. The intensity of metamorphism increases with depth so that there is a broad depth control on metamorphism. Relations at the andalusite/sillimanite isograd conform to a Carmichael (1969) type model and reactions took place via an intermediate sericite phase. The main effect of F₁ folding is the formation of the variably plunging variably <b>oriented</b> Kantappa - <b>Lakes</b> Nob Syncline of regional extent. Only the western limb of this fold is now visible over much of its length. This fold deforms existing metamorphic zones and thus controls the relationship of low, medium and high grade rocks {{in this part of the}} Willyama Complex. The orientation of this syncline changes from vertical in the low grade rock to inclined at depth. The western limb becomes overturned at depth so that subsequent folds are downward facing. There is also a change in fold tightness with depth - from open-tight in the low grades to tight-isoclinal in the high grades, and this is accompanied by a change in S₀/S₁ relations (from core to limb area) from non parallel to parallel. These changes are coupled with a rotation of extension direction (mass transfer direction) from subvertical to inclined and may be explained by original formation and subsequent modification of upright F₁ folds. Later modifications are recorded by open folding and overturning of S₁ - this is ascribed to a final phase of the D₁ event. Mineral growth in D₁ time resulted in the formation of S₁ varying in grade from muscovite + quartz to sillimanite. S₁ varies from homogeneous to layered, and in the latter case, consists of M + QM layers,the spacing of which is controlled by F₁ microfolding. S₁ formation involved rotation, mass transfer, and volume decrease in M layers and (re) crystallisation. The D₂ event in this area was of only minor significance. The D₃ event developed in response to NW-SE shortening and resulted in the formation of variably plunging, vertical northeast trending folds. Where SW plunging, these folds lie subparallel to L₁. The nature of the D₃ event is controlled to a large extent by S₀ / S₁ relations and folding of S₁ across unfolded S₀ occurs where S₀ lies parallel to the XY plane of the D₃ event. S₃ formed as a muscovite + quartz schistosity by rotation, re crystallisation, mass transferand mimetic growth. During the final stages of the D₃ event, north-east trending retrograde schist zones were formed. These were later reactivated during the folding of the Adelaidean. The final phase of the Olarian Orogeny consists of minor D₄ folding and crenulation. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, Department of Geology and Mineralogy, 1978...|$|R
