5|$|On {{one side}} of the road is a barber surgeon whose sign advertises Shaving, bleeding, and teeth drawn with a touch. Ecce signum! Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The {{surgeons}} and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons broke away to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a computer-based {{tool for the}} analysis of the geometry and the daylighting of Byzantine church domes to facilitate experimentation with a number of cases before any fieldwork is undertaken. Starting with a geometric derivation of the relationship between dome parameters, the digital tool builds an interactive three-dimensional model of a Byzantine church dome. The model allows the user to input the properties of the dome, the drum, any windows, and the slope of their sills. The model allows the user to define the dome using three different curvatures since such a case was identified in a Mistras church. A custom ray-tracing algorithm visualizes the path of light rays falling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> and their reflections within the dome. It was found that several parameters are interrelated and that an optimal set of proportions must be established to achieve the expected behavior of light within the dome...|$|R
25|$|Mei's {{disappearance}} prompts Satsuki and {{the neighbors}} {{to search for}} her. Eventually, Satsuki returns in desperation to the camphor tree and pleads for Totoro's help. Delighted to be of assistance, he summons the Catbus, which carries her to where the lost Mei sits. Having rescued her, the Catbus then whisks her and Satsuki over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital. The girls perch in a tree outside of the hospital, overhearing a conversation between their parents and discovering {{that she has been}} kept in hospital by a minor cold, but is otherwise doing well. They secretly leave the ear of corn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowsill,</b> where it is discovered by the parents, and return home on the Catbus. When the Catbus departs, it disappears from the girls' sight.|$|E
25|$|Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans (or CRs) often {{celebrate}} Samhain on {{the date}} of first frost, or when {{the last of the}} harvest is in and the ground is dry enough to have a bonfire. Some follow the old tradition of building two bonfires, which celebrants and livestock then walk or dance between as a ritual of purification. For CRs, it is a time when the dead are especially honoured. Though CRs make offerings at all times of the year, Samhain is a time when more elaborate offerings are made to specific ancestors. This may involve making a small shrine. Often there will be a meal, where a place for the dead is set at the table and they are invited to join. Traditional tales may be told and traditional songs, poems and dances performed. A western-facing door or window may be opened and a candle left burning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> to guide the dead home. Divination for the coming year is often done, whether in all solemnity or as games for the children. The more mystically inclined may also see this as a time for deeply communing with their deities, especially those seen as being particularly linked with this festival.|$|E

A few weeks after he returned to London he invited her {{to spend some time}} with him there. When she arrived, they went to his home where they spent the evening. [...] "He must have been really happy that night," [...] said one of the fans who often loitered outside his home.

6000|$|In 1830 {{it was a}} snug {{collection}} of modest one- and two-story frame dwellings, whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight by climbing tangles of rose vines, honeysuckles, and morning glories. Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds, touch-me-nots, prince's-feathers, and other old-fashioned flowers; while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowsills</b> of <b>the</b> houses stood wooden boxes containing moss rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame. When there was room <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was there--in sunny weather--stretched at full length, asleep and blissful, with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. Then that house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. A home without a cat--and a well-fed, well-petted, and properly revered cat--may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title? ...|$|R

He repacked the kilta with all he meant to lose, and hove it up <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>windowsill.</b> A thousand feet below lay a long, lazy, round-shouldered bank of mist, as yet untouched by the morning sun.

2500|$|On 4 March 2015, {{a formal}} {{announcement}} was made, confirming the project, with Ullman {{saying that it}} was a 'privilege to be doing this,' and [...] "I still feel as inspired to inhabit people as I did when I was six, standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> in my mother's bedroom, putting on a show." [...] Shane Allen, controller of comedy commissioning added: [...] "It's about time the Americans gave her back. Tracey has been the missing gem in the British comedy crown for too long. Talent doesn't come much bigger and the BBC audience is in for a huge treat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of their father's death, their mother would slip into a deep depression and {{spend a lot of}} time in bed. In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> in their mother's bedroom. “It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I’m a spin-off of my sister’s show, as she likes to point out.” In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Édith Piaf. [...] "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone." [...] She would also perform alone for herself after everyone had gone to bed. [...] "I'd stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself until I fell asleep. I'd interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them." [...] Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. [...] "We weren't the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!" [...] The marriage brought an end to the children's late night antics. [...] "There was a new person in her bed now and I couldn't do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." [...] Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household. The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didn't take to her upper crust accent. [...] "I had to talk like them to avoid being beaten up." ...|$|E

50|$|At first, BFG is {{reluctant}} to do so out of cowardliness and low trust in humans; but Sophie develops a plan to expose the evil giants to the Queen of the United Kingdom. Using dreams from his collection, BFG creates a nightmare, blows it into the Queen's bedroom, leaves Sophie <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Queen's <b>windowsill</b> to confirm <b>the</b> dream and retreats into the palace gardens when Sophie calls him. Because the dream included foreknowledge of Sophie's presence, the Queen believes her story, and speaks with BFG. After considerable effort by the palace staff, BFG is given a copious breakfast.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the story, a queen sits sewing at an open window during a winter snowfall when she pricks her finger with her needle, causing three drops of red blood to drip onto the freshly fallen white snow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> black <b>windowsill.</b> Then, she says to herself, [...] "How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony." [...] Some time later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but dies shortly thereafter.|$|R
5000|$|That {{same month}} a flat was broken into in Kitwe. An {{impression}} of the ball of a foot was found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>windowsill</b> and lifted. Foot impressions were taken from 60 Africans employed locally and the burglar thus identified. He was put on an identification parade and recognised by a miner who had accosted him carrying a bundle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> morning of the crime and from whom he had run away. Northern Rhodesia Police Standing Orders required all identification parades to be photographed, some thirty years before the Code of Practice for the Identification of Persons Suspected of Offences, made under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 required a similar procedure in England and Wales.|$|R

6000|$|... "But the gunshot was {{apparently}} {{the cause of}} death. Therefore the shot must have been fired some time earlier than we are told.

5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to <b>the</b> house, lands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> woman's <b>windowsill</b> and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado lifts up the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|R

6000|$|She sat without {{candle in}} the twilight, with the window wide open toward the river; the sense of oppressive heat adding itself undistinguishably to the burthen of her lot. Seated on a chair against the window, with her arm <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> she was looking blankly at the flowing river, swift with the backward-rushing tide, {{struggling}} to see still the sweet face in its unreproaching sadness, that seemed now from moment to moment to sink away and be hidden behind a form that thrust itself between, and made darkness. Hearing the door open, she thought Mrs. Jakin was coming in with her supper, as usual; and with that repugnance to trivial speech which comes with languor and wretchedness, she shrank from turning round and saying she wanted nothing; good little Mrs. Jakin would be sure to make some well-meant remarks.

6000|$|Holmes looked thoughtful. [...] "I see, Watson. You are {{sketching}} out {{a theory}} by which everything they say {{from the beginning}} is false. According to your idea, {{there was never any}} hidden menace, or secret society, or Valley of Fear, or Boss MacSomebody, or anything else. Well, that is a good sweeping generalization. Let us see what that brings us to. They invent this theory to account for the crime. They then play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof of the existence of some outsider. The stain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> conveys the same idea. So does the card on the body, which might have been prepared in the house. That all fits into your hypothesis, Watson. But now we come on the nasty, angular, uncompromising bits which won't slip into their places. Why a cut-off shotgun of all weapons--and an American one at that? How could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to them? It's a mere chance as it is that Mrs. Allen did not start out to inquire for the slamming door. Why did your guilty couple do all this, Watson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When my {{eyes opened}} next morning, a strange, still glare lay over the ceiling, and I {{looked out of}} my window on a world mantled and cold with snow. For a while I forgot the fever {{of the last few}} days in {{watching}} the birds hopping and twittering among the crumbs that Mrs Bowater scattered out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windowsill</b> for my pleasure. And yet--their every virtue, every grace, Fanny Bowater, all were thine! The very snow, in my girlish fantasy, was the fairness beneath which the unknown Self in her must, as I fondly believed, lie slumbering; a beauty that hid also from me for a while the restless, self-centred mind. How believe that such beauty is any the less a gift to its possessor than its bespeckled breast and song to a thrush, its sheen to a starling? It is a riddle that still baffles me. If we are all shut up in our bodies as the poets and the Scriptures say we are, then how is it that many of the loveliest seem to be all but uninhabited, or to harbour such dingy tenants; while quite plain faces may throng with animated ghosts? ...|$|E
