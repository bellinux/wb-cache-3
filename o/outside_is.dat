5|$|When {{only the}} <b>outside</b> <b>is</b> affected, the inner ivory is still commercially viable. As {{there are not}} yet {{verified}} techniques for identifying ivory that was previously burned, some have expressed concerns regarding the possible use {{of some of the}} burned stockpiles.|$|E
5|$|Beef steaks are {{commonly}} grilled, broiled or occasionally fried. Grilled beef steaks can be cooked at different temperatures, or for different lengths of time; the resulting cooked steak ranges from blue (very rare) to overdone. The most common {{characteristics of a}} rare steak is a soft, cold, red center. The <b>outside</b> <b>is</b> seared for flavor, while the inside is cooked to suit the diner's preference. Steaks cooked well-done are typically cooked throughout the entire cut of meat. For example, a beefsteak cooked well-done will not have any pinkness in the middle when sliced. Uncooked beef steak can be served raw, such as in steak tartare.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{the liquid}} at one section inside the thin {{descending}} limb is at 400 mOsm while <b>outside</b> it <b>is</b> 401. Further down the descending limb, the inside concentration <b>is</b> 500 while <b>outside</b> it <b>is</b> 501, so a constant difference of 1 mOsm is kept {{all across the}} membrane, although the concentration inside and <b>outside</b> <b>are</b> gradually increasing.|$|R

5|$|The {{refectory}} of {{the monastery}} is a rectangular brick building which contains a dining hall for the brethren {{as well as several}} kitchens and pantries. The Church of John the Theologian adjoins it from the east. The <b>outside</b> <b>is</b> segmented by pilasters and displays window surrounds reminiscent of traditional Eastern Orthodox church architecture. The refectory was erected in 1713, taking the place of the original wooden refectory. Its interior was overhauled in 1827 and 1837 and the restoration work was undertaken from 1976 to 1981.|$|E
5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} <b>outside</b> <b>is</b> through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E

25|$|Water in wood {{normally}} {{moves from}} zones of higher to zones of lower moisture content (Walker et al., 1993). Drying starts from {{the exterior of}} the wood and moves towards the centre, and drying at the <b>outside</b> <b>is</b> also necessary to expel moisture from the inner zones of the wood. Wood subsequently attains equilibrium with the surrounding air in moisture content.|$|E
25|$|The Tarsier Research and Development Center about 14km {{outside the}} provincial capital, Tagbilaran City, {{in the town}} of Corella, Bohol, also serves as visitor center.

If any contaminants escaped into the building's hallways, they would not escape to the outside world.|$|R

25|$|Hanuman Dhoka is {{a complex}} of {{structures}} with the Royal Palace of the Malla kings and of the Shah dynasty. It is spread over five acres. The eastern wing, with ten courtyards, is the oldest part, dating to the mid-16th century. It was expanded by King Pratap Malla in the 17th century with many temples. The royal family lived in this palace until 1886 when they moved to Narayanhiti Palace. The stone inscription <b>outside</b> <b>is</b> in fifteen languages.|$|E
25|$|Located {{four miles}} (6km) north of Akká in Mazra'a, Bahá'u'lláh used this country house during the summers from June 1877 until 1879, {{before moving to}} a larger house within Bahjí. It left Bahá'í hands for several decades and was {{slightly}} restructured with an annex added to the front. This meant that a staircase, previously on the <b>outside</b> <b>is</b> now within the house's walls. It originally belonged to `Abdu'lláh Páshá, and is located four miles (6km) north of Acre.|$|E

Fans can also look into a room designed to look like a manager's office. <b>Outside</b> <b>is</b> a display case with rotating artifacts.

25|$|At {{the gate}} to the engine, Namgoong reveals that he plans to use the highly {{flammable}} Kronole as an explosive to blow a hatch to the outside, as he observed signs the world <b>outside</b> <b>is</b> thawing and may be hospitable. Curtis confesses to him that shortly after boarding the train, the tail passengers resorted to cannibalism to survive, and he is haunted by his part in it. He was nearly ready to kill infant Edgar when Gilliam offered his own arm instead. After years of disdain for Wilford, Curtis seeks to learn what Wilford's intentions were. Franco is revealed to have survived and makes his way toward the engine.|$|E
25|$|Inner space {{divisions}} are fluid, and room size {{can be modified}} {{through the use of}} screens or movable paper walls. The large, single space offered by the main hall can therefore be altered according to the need. The separation between inside and <b>outside</b> <b>is</b> itself in some measure not absolute as entire walls can be removed, opening the temple to visitors. Verandas appear {{to be part of the}} building to an outsider, but part of the external world to those in the temple. Structures are therefore made to a certain extent part of their environment. The use of construction modules keeps proportions between different parts of the edifice constant, preserving its overall harmony.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{were the}} first colonists to settle in Colombo; {{establishing}} a small trading post, they had laid the foundations for a small fort which in time became the largest colonial fort in the island. The Dutch expanded the fort thus creating a well old fortified harbour. This came into the possession of the British in the late 1700s and by the late 19th century the seeing no threat to the Colombo Harbour, began demolishing the ramparts {{to make way for}} the development of the city. Although now there is nothing left of the fortifications, the area which was once the fort is still referred to as Fort. The area <b>outside</b> <b>is</b> Pettah or පිටකොටුව in Sinhalese which means outer fort.|$|E
