5|$|Bell {{explained}} that he, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen supervise {{all of the}} series' creative decisions, often consulting with Loeb. When the showrunners are writing the series, <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>can</b> write a script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, {{a member of the}} series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>can</b> witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E

25|$|Related to {{metacognition}} {{and abstract}} thought, perspective-taking involves {{a more sophisticated}} theory of mind.

25|$|According to Danish {{noise and}} music theorist Torben Sangild, one single {{definition}} of noise in {{music is not}} possible. Sangild instead provides three basic definitions of noise: a musical acoustics definition, a second communicative definition based on distortion or disturbance of a communicative signal, and a third definition based in subjectivity (what is noise to <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>can</b> be meaningful to another; what was considered unpleasant sound yesterday is not today).|$|E
25|$|According to Li, {{everything}} {{he has ever}} wanted {{to tell the world}} can be found in three of his films: the message of Hero is that the suffering of <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>can</b> never be as significant as the suffering of a nation; Unleashed shows that violence is never a solution; and Fearless tells that the biggest enemy of a person is himself. Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.|$|E

25|$|However, memory scepticism {{has been}} criticized as being {{applicable}} to public language, also. If <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>can</b> misremember, {{it is entirely possible}} that several people can misremember. So memory scepticism could be applied with equal effect to ostensive definitions given in a public language. For example, Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree T; but the next day both misremember which tree it was they named. If they were depending entirely on their memory, and had not written down the location of the tree, or told anyone else, then they would appear to be with the same difficulties as the individual who defined S ostensively. And so, if this is the case, the argument presented against private language would apply equally to public language.|$|E
25|$|While alcohol {{initially}} helps {{social phobia}} or panic symptoms, with longer term alcohol misuse can often worsen social phobia symptoms {{and can cause}} panic disorder to develop or worsen, during alcohol intoxication and especially during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect {{is not unique to}} alcohol but can also occur with long-term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines, which are sometimes prescribed as tranquillizers to people with alcohol problems. Approximately half of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia suffer from alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>can</b> tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Approximately half of {{patients}} attending {{mental health services}} for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia {{are the result of}} alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. Sometimes anxiety pre-existed alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence but the alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence act to keep the anxiety disorders going and often progressively making them worse. Many people who are addicted to alcohol or prescribed benzodiazepines when it is explained to them they have a choice between ongoing ill mental health or quitting and recovering from their symptoms decide on quitting alcohol or their benzodiazepines. It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>can</b> tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol or benzodiazepines will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms. Symptoms may temporarily worsen however, during alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal.|$|E
