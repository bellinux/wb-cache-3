40|$|A {{time-dependent}} {{numerical model}} {{was developed and}} used to study the interaction between planetary waves, the zonal mean circulation, and the trace constituent nitric oxide in the region between 55 km and 120 km. The factors which contribute {{to the structure of}} the nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>distribution</b> were examined, and the sensitivity of the distribution to changes in planetary wave amplitude was investigated. Wave-induced changes in the mean nitric oxide concentration were examined as a possible mechanism for the observed winter anomaly. Results indicate that vertically-propagating planetary waves induce a wave-like structure in the nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>distribution</b> and that at certain levels, transports of nitric oxide by planetary waves could significantly affect the mean nitric <b>oxide</b> <b>distribution.</b> The magnitude and direction of these transports at a given level was found to depend not only on the amplitude of the planetary wave, but also on the loss rate of nitric oxide at that level...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of a lateral {{non-uniform}} <b>oxide</b> charge <b>distribution</b> on the capacitance-voltage, C(V), response of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure. In contrast with the case of an in-depth non-uniform but laterally invariant <b>oxide</b> charge <b>distribution</b> which produces a pure voltage shift of the C(V) characteristic, we show that a lateral non-uniform charge profile can shift the curve and also stretch it under certain conditions of non-uniformity on a nanometer scale. This result is particularly important in the case of advanced MOS devices with high-permittivity gate dielectrics since such gate stacks are susceptible to present fixed charge bonding arrangements depending on the metal ion in the oxide or of the crystalline or amorphous state of the oxide. In the present study, the impact of linear, Gaussian, random and patterned <b>oxide</b> charge <b>distributions</b> are investigated for the first time using two-dimensional numerical simulations based on the solving the Poisson equation on the whole structure.

40|$|It {{is widely}} held {{that most of}} the {{oxidation}} in thermally sprayed coatings occurs {{on the surface of the}} droplet after it has flattened. The evidence in this paper suggests that, for the conditions studied here, oxidation of the top surface of flattened droplets is not the dominant oxidation mechanism. In this study, a mild steel wire (AISI 1025) was sprayed using a high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) torch onto copper and aluminum substrates. Ion milling and Auger spectroscopy were used to examine the <b>distribution</b> of <b>oxides</b> within individual splats. Conventional metallographic analysis was also used to study <b>oxide</b> <b>distributions</b> within coatings that were sprayed under the same conditions. An analytical model for oxidation of the exposed surface of a splat is presented. Based on literature data, the model assumes that diffusion of iron through a solid FeO layer is the rate limiting factor in forming the oxide on the top surface of a splat. An FeO layer only a few thousandths of a micron thick is predicted to form on the splat surface as it cools. However, the experimental evidence shows that the oxide layers are typically 100 x thicker than the predicted value. These thick, oxide layers are not always observed on the top surface of a splat. Indeed, in some instances the oxide layer is on the bottom, and the metal is on the top. The observed <b>oxide</b> <b>distributions</b> are more consistently explained if most of the oxide formed before the droplets impact the substrate...|$|R

It is shown that unconfined propane-air flames can be stabilized downstream of a NASA contra-swirl can under a wide range of airflow rates and fuel-air ratios.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} various heat {{treatments}} on the microstructure and mechanical properties of dual phase ODS steels were investigated to enhance the high strength at elevated temperature. Dual phase ODS steels have been designed by the control of ferrite and austenite formers, i. e., Cr, W and Ni, C in Fe-based alloys. The ODS steels were fabricated by mechanical alloying and a hot isostatic pressing process. Heat treatments, including hot rolling-tempering and normalizing-tempering with air- and furnace-cooling, were carefully carried out. It was revealed that the grain size and <b>oxide</b> <b>distributions</b> of the ODS steels can be changed by heat treatment, which significantly affected the strengths at elevated temperature.

40|$|The {{influence}} of oxide film defects {{generated from the}} filling process on the mechanical strength of aluminium alloy castings has been investigated. Using numerical simulation and experimental validation, the investigation aims to reveal the relationships among the liquid aluminium flow behaviour in the filling, the likely <b>oxide</b> film defect <b>distribution</b> caused by surface turbulence and the final mechanical strength of the castings. CFD modelling was used to investigate the liquid metal flow behaviour and the likely <b>oxide</b> film defect <b>distribution</b> in the filling at different ingate velocities. In particular, a numerical algorithm - Oxide Film Entrainment Tracking (OFET, 2 -D) has been proposed and developed for predicting such <b>oxide</b> film defect <b>distribution</b> in the liquid aluminium throughout the filling. Also, light microscopic and SEM techniques were used to identify the microstructures of oxide film casting defects. The Weibull statistics method was employed to quantify the effects of <b>oxide</b> film <b>distributions</b> on the mechanical strength and reliability of the acquired aluminium alloy castings for different runner systems. It was found from the numerical simulations that the ingate velocities acquired using different runner systems have significant influence on the <b>distribution</b> of <b>oxide</b> film defects generated by surface turbulence in the filling process, which results in the disparities of the final mechanical strength of the castings.

40|$|Mechanical {{alloying}} {{under various}} gas atmospheres such as Ar, an Ar-H 2 mixture, and He gases were carried out, {{and its effects}} on the powder properties, microstructure and mechanical properties of ODS ferritic steels were investigated. Hot isostatic pressing and hot rolling processes were employed to consolidate the ODS steel plates. While the mechanical alloyed powder in He had a high oxygen concentration, a milling in Ar showed fine particle diameters with comparably low oxygen concentration. The microstructural observation revealed that low oxygen concentration contributed to the formation of fine grains and homogeneous <b>oxide</b> particle <b>distribution</b> by the Y-Ti-O complex oxides. A milling in Ar was sufficient to lower the oxygen concentration, and this led a high tensile strength and fracture elongation at a high temperature.

Ammonium oxidation rates ranged from 1. 0 to 137. 4 hmol m- 3 d-l, and nitrite oxidation rates varied from undetectable to 138. 0 pmol m- 3 d-l. Conservative estimates of depth-integrated euphotic zone nitrification rates from the complete three-cruise data set were 0. 69 mmol rnd 2 d-l for nitrite oxidation and 1. 64 mmol m- 2 d-l for ammonium oxidation. The highest nitrification rates were found below the primary nitrite maximum, suggesting a significant contribution of euphotic zone ammonium oxidation to the nitrite pool below but not within this feature. A mass balance of nitrous oxide indicates that this gas is produced within the euphotic zone {{at a rate of}} 1. 68 - 7. 94 pmol m- 2 d-l.
