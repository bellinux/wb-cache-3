While the <b>older</b> <b>man,</b> who came to be nicknamed the Bus Uncle, scolded the man seated behind him, a nearby {{passenger}} used a camera phone to record the entire incident. The resulting six-minute video was uploaded to the Hong Kong Golden Forum, YouTube, and Google Videos. The clip became YouTube's most viewed video in May 2006, attracting viewers with its rhetorical outbursts and copious use of profanity by the <b>older</b> <b>man,</b> receiving 1.7million hits in the first 3 weeks of that month.|$|E

5|$|Cec Linder as Felix Leiter: Bond's CIA liaison in the United States. Linder was {{the only}} actor {{actually}} on location in Miami. Linder's interpretation of Leiter {{was that of a}} somewhat <b>older</b> <b>man</b> than the way the character was played by Jack Lord in Dr. No; in reality, Linder was a year younger than Lord. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the Felix Leiter role in Goldfinger that led the producers to recast the role. At the last minute, Cec Linder switched roles with Austin Willis who played cards with Goldfinger.|$|E

5|$|Each guest's {{positioning}} in {{the painting}} has its own meaning. In the foreground there is a dancer wearing the colours of that time period {{and there are many}} peasants in that area. In the middle there is the bride dancing with an <b>older</b> <b>man,</b> her father. On the right of the work, there is a musician playing on a pijpzak, who is watching the dance from the side. Judging by the writing utensils hanging on his belt, he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a hanging tablecloth decorated with a crown and beneath it is the bride's table. Before her table, money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing sleeping with an <b>older</b> <b>man,</b> and yet there is something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E

50|$|A {{man named}} James narrates the story, {{and is a}} {{caretaker}} for an <b>old</b> sick <b>man.</b> He {{takes care of the}} man eight hours a day and during that time, the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> is completely dependent on him for all basic needs. The <b>old</b> <b>man</b> is extremely wealthy and used to work as a dance teacher. He was so passionate about dance that he regularly has his old students come and perform for him. Throughout the story the narrator speculates the <b>old</b> <b>mans</b> homosexuality while keeping his own sexuality unconfirmed. When James is not working for the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> he spends a lot time at a nearby bar watching clips from old films. Although he spends much time taking care of the <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> his motives are questionable as he entertains selfish thoughts of stealing from the <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> James risks the health of the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> by manipulating his medications and pocketing a portion of the allotted amounts. In the end the narrator realizes that although the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> has his fortune, he is willing to sacrifice it to not feel alone.|$|R

5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the <b>older</b> <b>man</b> may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} from leave, Voss was {{dissatisfied}} with his commanding officer, Franz Walz, whom he considered insufficiently aggressive. Voss shared his sentiments with another Westphalian hussar, Leutnant Rolf Freiherr von Lersner. Walz had assumed command on 29 November 1916, just after Voss joined the jasta. An <b>older</b> <b>man</b> of 31, he was a prewar pilot and professional soldier who had flown over 300 combat missions in reconnaissance two-seaters before being appointed to command this squadron of fighter pilots. Lacking a background in fighter tactics, he compensated by allowing his more experienced pilots to follow their own inclinations, including solo excursions into British territory. The fact that Walz followed two prior brilliant fighter tacticians in his command—Oswald Boelcke and Stefan Kirmaier—only exposed his weaknesses.|$|E
