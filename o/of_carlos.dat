5|$|He {{continued}} {{as the leader}} of the UCR, and opposed the presidency <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> Menem. He initiated the Pact of Olivos with Menem in order to negotiate the terms for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. Fernando de la Rúa led a faction of the UCR that opposed the pact, and eventually became president in 1999. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and Alfonsín's faction provided the support needed for the Peronist Eduardo Duhalde to be appointed president by the Congress. Alfonsín died of lung cancer on 31March 2009, at the age of 82, and was given a large state funeral.|$|E

They were on Route6, and he was ejected from the car {{because he was not}} wearing a seat belt. He was hospitalized for 39 days. DelaRúa became president in the 1999 elections, defeating the governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde. Alfonsín was elected Senator for Buenos Aires Province in October 2001. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and the Congress appointed Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who resigned as well. Alfonsín instructed the radical legislators to support Duhalde as the new president. He also gave him two ministers, Horacio Jaunarena for Defense and Jorge Vanossi for Justice. The radical support helped Duhalde overcome the ambitions <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> Ruckauf and José Manuel de la Sota, who also had ambitions to be appointed president. Alfonsín's health problems later in the year led him to step down, to be replaced by Diana Conti.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{designation}} as a named storm, Carlos drifted generally north-northwestward while {{embedded within}} a weak steering regime. The cyclone struggled {{with a combination of}} northerly wind shear and dry air entrainment, limiting the storm's associated deep convection to the eastern quadrant. By early on June13, however, a ragged eye became evident on visible satellite imagery as the upper-level environment became increasingly conducive for intensification, and Carlos was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale at 12:00UTC. Deep convection became increasingly symmetric about the eye, and the cyclone reached its initial peak intensity six hours later with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, early on June14, the presentation <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> began to deteriorate as a result of upwelling and the ingestion of dry air; the eye became obscured and banding features decreased as evident on satellite imagery, while the eyewall became increasingly ill-defined on radar. At 00:00UTC on June15, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm about 75mi (120km) west-southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written by an American composer.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{finished}} third in the 2010–11 Premier League, to qualify for the rebranded version of the European Cup, the UEFA Champions League, for the first time. The club's league finish granted direct entry into the group stages without qualification. Their group stage opponents were Bayern Munich, Villarreal and Napoli. City's first group match was at home to Napoli. The Italians took the lead in the second half following a counter-attacking move, but five minutes later Aleksandar Kolarov scored from a free-kick to equalise, and the match finished 1–1. City then lost 2–0 at Bayern Munich, a match most notable for the refusal <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> Tevez to come on as substitute, which resulted in an exile from the first team lasting nearly six months. A double-header with Villarreal resulted in two Manchester City wins. Sergio Agüero scored a last-minute winner in the first, which finished 2–1; the second was a comfortable 3–0 victory. A 2–1 defeat at Napoli then took qualification out of Manchester City's hands, and despite a 2–0 win against group winners Bayern Munich, City {{finished third}} in the group and failed to qualify for the knockout stages.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Mendizabal {{had retreated}} to the Portuguese border after sending two battalions to {{reinforce}} the garrison at Badajoz. Weakened by the defeat at Olivenza and by Ballesteros' continued absence, he sent to La Romana for reinforcements, receiving on 14 January 1,800 men sent from Abrantes under the command <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> de España. Additionally, about 6,000 troops were sent forward from the Lines of Torres Vedras on 19 January, arriving at Elvas ten days later. When these forces joined with Mendizabal's remaining 3,000 men, a Spanish cavalry division and a brigade of Portuguese horse, the Allies had an army almost 15,000 strong—intended {{to be under the}} command of La Romana—with which to hold Soult in check. La Romana, however, died of an aneurysm on 23 January, and command of the army then fell to Mendizabal.|$|E
5|$|Music for a Time of War is a 2011 concert {{program and}} {{subsequent}} album by the Oregon Symphony under the artistic direction <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> Kalmar. The program {{consists of four}} compositions inspired by war: Charles Ives The Unanswered Question (1906), John Adams The Wound-Dresser (1989), Benjamin Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem (1940) and Ralph Vaughan Williams Symphony No. 4 (1935). The program was performed on May 7, 2011, at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon, and again the following day. Both concerts were recorded for album release. On May 12, the Oregon Symphony repeated the program at the inaugural Spring for Music Festival, at Carnegie Hall. The performance was broadcast live by KQAC and WQXR-FM, the classical radio stations serving Portland and the New York City metropolitan area, respectively. The concerts marked the Oregon Symphony's first performances of The Wound-Dresser as well as guest baritone Sanford Sylvan's debut with the company.|$|E

In August 2006, West Ham completed a major coup {{on the last day}} of the transfer window after completing the signings <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> Tevez and Javier Mascherano. The club was eventually bought by an Icelandic consortium, led by Eggert Magnússon, in November 2006. Manager Alan Pardew was sacked after poor form during the season and was replaced by former Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley.|$|E

5|$|San Martín was {{initiated}} in the Lodge of Rational Knights in 1811. They {{met at the}} house <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> María de Alvear, other members were José Miguel Carrera, Aldao, Blanco Encalada and other criollos, American-born Spaniards. They agreed {{to return to their}} home countries and join the local revolutionary movements. San Martín asked for his retirement from the military, and moved to Britain. He stayed in the country for a short time, and met many other South Americans at a lodge held at the house of Venezuelan general Francisco de Miranda at 27 Grafton Street (now 58 Grafton Way), Bloomsbury, London (the house now has a blue plaque with Miranda's name). Then he sailed to Buenos Aires aboard the frigate George Canning, along with the South Americans Alvear, Francisco José de Vera and Matías Zapiola, and the Spaniards Francisco Chilavert and Eduardo Kailitz. They arrived on 9 March 1812, to serve under the First Triumvirate.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{targets of}} the {{operation}} were the personal possessions and documents of Jacobo Árbenz and those <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> Enrique Díaz (who had been chief {{of the armed forces}} under Árbenz, and briefly his successor as president), as well as the headquarters of the Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT), and the offices of trade unions, known front organizations, and police agencies. The results of the initial searches were disappointing for the CIA; many of the offices had already been plundered both by the Guatemalan army and by other looters. The CIA were particularly interested in finding documents that mentioned the Árbenz's government's purchase of weapons from Czechoslovakia, but they were unsuccessful. They were also unsuccessful in finding any evidence that the Soviet Union had controlled the communist movement in Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> {{were from}} a {{tropical}} wave that exited {{the west coast of}} Africa on June14. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, with little evidence of its existence on satellite imagery. By June20 it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean, later spawning an area of convection, or thunderstorms, south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the system in its tropical weather outlook on June24, by which time a low pressure center developed. Gradually, the system continued to develop due to light wind shear, with rainbands and convection located near the broad center. By early on June26, the disturbance had organized enough for the NHC to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Three-E, about 130miles (210km) south-southwest of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca.|$|E

5|$|The provincial {{judiciary}} {{launched an}} investigation into the circumstances surrounding the explosion. The prosecution conducted a search and seizure at the offices of Litoral Gas to confirm the absence of customer complaints about the gas leak. Judge Juan Carlos Curto ordered the arrest <b>of</b> <b>Carlos</b> Osvaldo García, an employee of the department responsible for gas service to the area. He was captured during the night, and his assistant Pablo Miño surrendered to police the following day. According to witnesses, one employee fled in a van before the explosion, when he realized the severity of the gas leak, while another remained to try to evacuate people from the endangered area. The van belonged to García, who experienced an acute stress reaction during the trial. Curto checked the remnants of the gas employee's workshop to verify García's testimony.|$|E
5|$|Fontaneda {{explained}} in his 1571 memoir that Carlos controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee (which they called Mayaimi) {{and on the}} Florida Keys (which they called Martires). Smaller tribes of Ais and Jaega who lived {{to the east of}} Lake Okeechobee, paid regular tributes to Carlos. The Spanish suspected the Calusa of harvesting treasures from shipwrecks and distributing the gold and silver between the Ais and Jaega, with Carlos receiving the majority. The main village of the Calusa, and home <b>of</b> <b>Carlos,</b> bordered Estero Bay at present-day Mound Key where the Caloosahatchee River meets the Gulf of Mexico. Fontaneda described human sacrifice as a common practice: when the child of a cacique died, each resident gave up a child to be sacrificed, and when the cacique died, his servants were sacrificed to join him. Each year a Christian was required to be sacrificed to appease a Calusa idol. The building of shell mounds of varying sizes and shapes was also of spiritual significance to the Calusa. In 1895 Frank Hamilton Cushing excavated a massive shell mound on Key Marco that was composed of several constructed terraces hundreds of yards long. Cushing unearthed over a thousand Calusa artifacts. Among them he found tools made of bone and shell, pottery, human bones, masks, and animal carvings made of wood.|$|E
