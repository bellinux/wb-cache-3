5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced {{into the side}} of a mound, so the {{northern}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.|$|E
5|$|Aether is a {{video game}} {{designed}} by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel and published by Armor Games, released on September 3, 2008. Players control a lonely boy and an octopus-like monster that the boy encounters, solving puzzles on different planets to restore them from monochrome to color. The pair travel through space by swinging on clouds and asteroids with the monster's elongated tongue, searching other planets for life to which the boy can relate. It is also a part <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Basement</b> Collection.|$|E

40|$|The author {{extends the}} {{previously}} proposed combined asymptotic method (CAM) of seismic SSI {{analysis for the}} multi-support systems and applies it to the transportation portal as a double-support system (together with the reactor building). The key issue is <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structural dynamic stiffness matrix condensed to the supports by the modal approach. Then the condensed structural matrix is combined with the soil dynamic stiffness matrix also condensed to <b>the</b> rigid <b>basements.</b> As a result, a very simple linear system 12 ∗ 12 is solved in the frequency domain. This gives the transfer functions from the free-field motion to <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements.</b> <b>The</b> only important limitations are <b>the</b> linearity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil’s and structure’s properties and <b>the</b> rigidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements.</b> <b>The</b> results for the sample system are checked against the full SASSI solution. The results {{can be used to}} justify <b>the</b> further simplification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system...|$|R
5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood stains found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that {{this might have been}} a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E
5|$|Brian Paisley {{became the}} manager in early 1994. Paisley {{had a history}} with the Princess; he {{operated}} the small, independent Chinook Theatre out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> from 1980 to 1983. This organization was the seed of Paisley’s Fringe Theatre Event, which he founded while still working out of this space in 1982. This event was the original Edmonton International Fringe Festival, now the largest event {{of its kind in}} North America.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of the new}} {{building}} began in February 1864 with excavation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> This was on the north section of Willamette’s campus in downtown Salem. Then on July 24, {{the cornerstone of the}} building was laid into place in a ceremony. The President of the Board of Trustees, David Leslie, laid the cornerstone of the hall. This ceremony included a time capsule and a speech by Governor A. C. Gibbs.|$|E

5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been {{tampered}} with {{so it could be}} opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> {{in which they were}} housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub-basement levels that initially acted as storage facilities for both the Company's property and also the luggage of passengers. Coal was also stored in the basement, with a small railway track providing {{a link to the}} boiler room, which was used to heat the building. Many original features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> still exist, including the timber baggage racks, ship logs and other maritime documents. Several secure vaults, which in the past were used to store the most valuable passenger items, are still used today to hold historic documents, drawings and blueprints relating to the Cunard Building and also some of Cunard's Liners, such as the RMS Queen Mary.|$|E

5|$|The 15.3 to 7 mya old Campanario Formation forms much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> in the Laguna del Maule area. This {{geological}} formation contains andesitic-dacitic ignimbrites and tuffs with later dacitic dykes that were emplaced 3.6–2.0 mya. This formation {{is affected by}} various faults that extend in north-south direction. An older unit, of Jurassic-Cretaceous age, crops out northwest of the volcanic field. Other formations include an Oligocene-Miocene lacustrine formation named Cura-Mallín, and another intermediary formation named Trapa-Trapa. Trapa-Trapa is of volcanic origin and between 19 and 10 million years old. Remnants of Quaternary ignimbrites and Pliocene, early Quaternary volcanic centres, are also found around the field.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese, {{after their}} arrival in Sri Lanka in 1505, began a {{campaign}} of forced conversion and destruction of many Buddhist and Hindu temples around the island. They destroyed the Munneswaram temple completely in 1578 CE with the exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> and used {{the core of the}} building as a Roman Catholic chapel. Jesuits recorded that they used iron bars to destroy the presiding deity. According to a 1640 Portuguese records, they were able to convert 500 people from the village of Munneswaram as Roman Catholics. However, the locals and temple administrators were able to hide many of the idols of the temple complex before the destruction.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E

5|$|During his 1965-1966 world tour, Dylan {{was backed}} by a five-member rock group, The Hawks, who would later become famous as The Band. After Dylan was injured in a {{motorcycle}} accident in July 1966, four members of The Hawks came to Dylan's home in the Woodstock area to collaborate with him on music and film projects. While Dylan {{was out of the}} public's eye during an extended period of recovery in 1967, he and the members of The Hawks recorded more than 100 tracks together, incorporating original compositions, contemporary covers, and traditional material. Dylan's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, toward songs that were more intimate and which drew on many styles of traditional American music. While some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> songs are humorous, others dwell on nothingness, betrayal and a quest for salvation. In general, they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the Americana genre. For some critics, the songs on The Basement Tapes, which circulated widely in unofficial form, mounted a major stylistic challenge to rock music in the late sixties.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the gas on full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} scene in which Eminem stands on the rooftop of the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York, saying the {{introductory}} lyrics. The video cuts between scenes where he raps on the rooftop and another scene where Eminem is trapped inside a dark basement. Eminem moves closer towards the edge of the building until he leaves to go downstairs as the chorus begins. He starts walking down Market Street in Newark and jaywalks across the street, avoiding vehicles that pass by. Eminem sees distorted reflections of himself on the window of a car; he continues on, only to be surrounded by a series of mirrors. Confused, Eminem tries to escape, and {{towards the end of the}} second chorus, he breaks through a mirror to find himself in the middle of the street. Interspersing scenes show Eminem as he tries to break out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> As the camera zooms out, the viewers see him on the edge of a destroyed street while a subway tunnel can be seen below the road.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaac is a {{top-down}} dungeon crawler game, presented using two-dimensional sprites, {{in which}} the player controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters differ in speed, amount of health, amount of damage they deal, and other attributes. The game's mechanics and presentation {{is similar to the}} dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels {{in the manner of a}} roguelike game. On each floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> dungeon, the player must fight monsters in a room before continuing onto the next room. This is most commonly done by the character's tears as bullets in the style of a twin-stick shooter, but the player can also use a limited supply of bombs to damage enemies and clear out parts of the room. Other methods of defeating enemies become possible as the character gains power-ups, items that are automatically worn by the player-character when picked up that can alter the character's core attributes, such as increasing health or the strength of each tear, or cause additional side effects, such as for allowing charged tear shots to be fired after holding down a controller button for a short while, or a means to fire tears behind the character. Power-ups include passive items that improve the character's attributes automatically, active power-ups that can be used once before they are recharged by completing additional rooms in the dungeon, and single-use power-ups such as pills or Tarot cards that confer a one-time benefit when used, such as regaining full health, or increasing or decreasing all attributes of the character. The effect of power-ups stack, so that the player may come into highly-beneficial power-up combinations.|$|E
