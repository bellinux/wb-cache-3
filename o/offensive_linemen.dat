5|$|Molk {{was one of}} 54 <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen,</b> and the fourth-ranked center—behind Peter Konz, Garth Gerhart, and Ben Jones—, that {{participate}}d in the 2012 NFL Scouting Combine. However, he tore the peroneal longus tendon in his foot at the 2012 Sugar Bowl, and he had surgery on January 13. As a result, he was only {{able to participate in}} one Combine event. His 41 reps in the bench press ranked first among <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> and second at the entire combine, behind only nose tackle Dontari Poe. Molk's total was most by a center and ranks third among offensive lineman since 2000, behind only Mitch Petrus and Scott Young, who were both offensive guards.|$|E
5|$|Schilling {{was one of}} 56 <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> {{invited to}} {{participate}} in the February 24 – March 1, 2011 NFL Scouting Combine. He ranked sixth in the bench press with a total of 30 repetitions. He ranked ninth in the 20-yard shuttle with a time of 4.62.|$|E
5|$|Graham wore number 60 {{for much}} of his career, but he was forced to change it to 14 in 1952 after the NFL passed a rule {{requiring}} <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> to wear jersey numbers 50–79 so referees could more easily identify ineligible receivers. The Browns retired his number 14, while 60 remains in circulation. While at Northwestern, Graham wore number 48.|$|E

5|$|Five Maryland {{players were}} {{selected}} by postseason all-star games. Defensive lineman Jeremy Navarre {{appeared in the}} Texas vs. The Nation Game. <b>Offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> Edwin Williams and Jaimie Thomas participated in the East-West Shrine Game. Linebacker Moise Fokou played in the Under Armour Senior Bowl. Kevin Barnes was also selected {{to participate in the}} Senior Bowl very early in the season before he suffered a scapular fracture. He attended the game, but did not play due to his injury.|$|E
5|$|That {{starting}} field position {{proved a}} boon for the Virginia Tech defense, which only allowed 200total yards in the game. Tech linebacker Vince Hall led the Hokies and all defensive players with 13tackles in the game. Tech recorded one interception during the game, courtesy of Brenden Hill, who also made threetackles. Georgia's offensive line, despite starting only six scholarship <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen,</b> allowed just twosacks to the Virginia Tech defense. Chris Ellis and Noland Burchette each earned a single sack, accounting for a loss of 15totalyards.|$|E
5|$|Alabama had 10 {{returning}} starters {{from the previous}} season, including eight on offense and two on defense. The most notable departures {{from the previous year}} were linebackers Eryk Anders, Rolando McClain and Cory Reamer; cornerbacks Javier Arenas, Kareem Jackson and Marquis Johnson; defensive ends Brandon Deaderick and Lorenzo Washington; nose tackle Terrence Cody; safety Justin Woodall; <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> Drew Davis and Mike Johnson; and tight end Colin Peek. Additionally, all of special teams players were replaced following the departures of punter P.J.

5|$|All-ACC honorees were {{selected}} by a 67-member committee from the Atlantic Coast Conference Sports Media Association (ACSMA). Maryland tied with Atlantic Division Co-Champion Boston College for most All-ACC honorees at nine. Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech each secured eight All-ACC honors. Three Maryland players {{were selected}} to the first team: punter Travis Baltz, running back Da'Rel Scott, and center Edwin Williams. Linebacker Alex Wujciak {{was named to the}} second team. <b>Offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> Scott Burley and Jaimie Thomas, tight end Dan Gronkowski, wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, and defensive lineman Jeremy Navarre were named as honorable mention All-ACC players.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} in 1984 when Bill Parcells {{restored}} him to the starting quarterback's job, Phil Simms responded with a solid season in 1993. Playing in all 16 games, he completed almost 62% of his passes, threw for over 3,000yards, 15 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. The season {{marked the first time}} in seven years that Simms started every game for the Giants. Simms, Hampton, <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> Jumbo Elliot and center Bart Oates all made the Pro Bowl. In addition, Reeves was named Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. Following the season Lawrence Taylor retired and Phil Simms was released by the team, leading to his eventual retirement. Simms and Taylor had been the faces of the franchise since 1979 and 1981 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{was traded}} to the Denver Broncos in February 1965, but the Bills {{continued}} to win, ending with a 10–3–1 record and winning the AFL championship {{for the second year in}} a row. In the 1965 AFL championship game against the Chargers, when <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> Billy Shaw and Dave Behrman were injured, Saban inserted veteran Ernie Warlick opposite rookie Paul Costa in a double tight end formation, which helped the Bills win the game, 23–0. Saban was named coach of the year for the second time in a row, silencing critics who had said he was indecisive, did not use his players properly and was not a good play-caller.|$|E

50|$|Stunts are {{a special}} means of rushing the quarterback done {{to confuse the}} {{opposing}} team's offensive line. Properly executing a stunt requires two or more defensive lineman working together. One defensive lineman will take an angled path towards an <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> {{that he is not}} lined up across from. This will usually cause the <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> he is lined up across from to follow him while also occupying the <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> he angled towards. In turn, the defensive lineman who would have been blocked by the <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> that is being angled to will loop behind his teammate and rush through the gap that was created by the <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> who followed the defensive lineman taking the angle.|$|R
5|$|In the fourth, the Crimson Tide scored touchdowns on both {{of their}} {{offensive}} possessions and made the final score 48–7. The first came on a 20-yard AJ McCarron pass to Kevin Norwood and the second on a seven-yard Altee Tenpenny run. Offensively, McCarron threw for 359 yards and Drake and Yeldon ran for 106 yards and 124 respectively. This {{marked the first time}} in team history that Alabama had a 300-yard passer and two 100-yard runners in a single game. For his performance, right guard Anthony Steen was recognized as SEC <b>Offensive</b> <b>Linemen</b> of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Wildcats to 36–2–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} team must {{line up in}} a legal formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.|$|E
5|$|Of all the draft-eligible juniors, D. J. Fluker, Eddie Lacy and Dee Milliner {{declared}} their {{eligibility for}} the 2013 NFL Draft on January 11. At {{the time of}} their announcement, Milliner was projected to be a first-round pick and both Fluker and Lacy were projected to be no lower than second-round picks. Adrian Hubbard, AJ McCarron, C. J. Mosley and Anthony Steen had each previously indicated they would not declare for the draft and would return for their senior seasons. In February 2013, ten Alabama players, seven seniors and three juniors, were invited to the NFL Scouting Combine. The invited players were defensive linemen Quinton Dial, Damion Square and Jesse Williams, linebacker Nico Johnson, defensive backs Robert Lester and Dee Milliner, running back Eddie Lacy and <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> D. J. Fluker, Barrett Jones and Chance Warmack.|$|E
50|$|The Most Outstanding <b>Offensive</b> <b>Lineman</b> Award is {{annually}} {{awarded to}} the best <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> in the Canadian Football League. The two nominees for the award are the Leo Dandurand Trophy winner from the East Division, and the DeMarco-Becket Memorial Trophy winner from the West Division. Between the years of 1955 to 1973, both defensive players and <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> had {{to compete for the}} CFL's Most Outstanding Lineman Award. By the 1974 season, the league decided to make two separate awards for both defensive players and <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman.</b>|$|R

50|$|O'Donnell {{was chosen}} {{in the second}} round and 15th overall by the Saskatchewan Roughriders. O'Donnell was the fourth <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> taken in the draft, but was the highest CIS <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> selected.|$|R
5|$|Of all the draft-eligible juniors, Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Adrian Hubbard, Cyrus Kouandjio, Jeoffrey Pagan and Vinnie Sunseri {{declared}} their {{eligibility for}} the 2014 NFL Draft. At {{the time of}} their announcement, Clinton-Dix and Kouandjio were projected to be first-round picks and both Hubbard and Pagan were projected to be no lower than third-round picks. With their departures it marked the first time during the Saban era that more than three juniors declared early for the NFL Draft. In February 2014, twelve Alabama players, seven seniors and five juniors, were invited to the NFL Scouting Combine. The invited players were <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> Cyrus Kouandjio and Anthony Steen, safeties Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and Vinnie Sunseri, linebackers Adrian Hubbard and C. J. Mosley, defensive ends Jeoffrey Pagan and Ed Stinson, quarterback AJ McCarron, wide receiver Kevin Norwood, cornerback Deion Belue and punter Cody Mandell.|$|E
5|$|The umpire is {{positioned}} in the defensive backfield, {{except in the}} NFL, where he {{is positioned}} lateral to the referee {{on the opposite side}} of the formation. He watches play along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> are illegally downfield on pass plays. He monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.|$|E
5|$|With {{seven seconds}} left in {{regulation}} and the score tied at 28, Yeldon made a long run as time expired. The play was reviewed from the replay booth, and one second was put back on the clock after the referees determined Yeldon had stepped out of bounds just before time expired. Alabama then opted to attempt a game-winning 57-yard field goal, but chose freshman kicker Adam Griffith over Foster due to Foster's woes that day. Alabama failed its fourth field goal of the day with Griffith's attempt falling short, but Auburn's Chris Davis fielded it nine yards deep in his own end zone, and with no Crimson Tide skill players in his path (the field goal unit was made up almost entirely of <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen),</b> sprinted for a 109-yard touchdown return and a 34–28 Auburn win. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 42–35–1.|$|E
50|$|Muñoz was the <b>Offensive</b> <b>Lineman</b> of the Year in 1981, 1987, and 1988, and {{was awarded}} the NFL Players Association Lineman of the Year honors in 1981, 1985, 1988, and 1989. The NFL Alumni Association voted Munoz the <b>Offensive</b> <b>Lineman</b> of the Year four times (1987, 1989-1991). He won the Seagram's Seven Crowns of Sports award for <b>Offensive</b> <b>Lineman</b> of the Year in 1981 and 1986.|$|R
50|$|Bowman {{was traded}} to the Blue Bombers from the Saskatchewan Roughriders on April 1, 2009. He was traded along with non-import <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> Jean-Francois Morin-Roberge, and non-import safety Brady Browne in {{exchange}} for import <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> Dan Goodspeed. The Roughriders then traded Goodspeed to the Hamilton Tiger Cats for non-import <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> Jordan Rempel. Bowman finished the year with 925 receiving yards and 6 touchdowns.|$|R
50|$|Leonard Ray Brown, Jr. (born December 12, 1962) is {{a former}} American {{football}} <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman.</b> Following graduation from Marion High School where he started at running back, he played college football for The University of Memphis and transferred to Arkansas State University where Coach Larry Lacewell converted him to an <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman.</b> It was as an <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> that he made {{his career in the}} National Football League (NFL).|$|R
5|$|Reeves' {{impact was}} immediate. As Parcells {{had done in}} 1984, Reeves named Simms his {{starting}} quarterback. The defense returned to form, and allowed more than 20 points once all season. With two regular season games left, the Giants were 11–3 and appeared poised for a first-round playoff bye. They were upset by a Phoenix Cardinals team, {{who came into the}} game with just five wins, 17–6, in the next-to-last week of the season, setting up a winner–take–all contest against Dallas in the final regular season game. Though the Giants played well, it was Emmitt Smith's memorable performance with a separated shoulder that led the Cowboys to a 16–13 overtime win, giving the Cowboys a sweep of the season series and home-field advantage throughout the NFC Playoffs. Despite the loss, the Giants made the playoffs as a Wild Card and won their first-round game, 17–10 over the Vikings. However, they were defeated by the San Francisco 49ers 44–3 in the divisional playoffs. Simms played in all 16 games, completing nearly 62% of his passes, and threw for over 3,000 yards and 15 touchdowns. Simms, Hampton, <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> Jumbo Elliot and center Bart Oates made the Pro Bowl, and Reeves was named Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. After the season, Lawrence Taylor and Phil Simms, the two biggest figures of the late 1980s and early 1990s Giants teams, retired.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{entered the}} draft with needs at {{positions}} including offensive lineman, linebacker, defensive lineman and cornerback. In the first round, with the twentieth pick, the Bears selected Oregon offensive tackle Kyle Long. Long, {{the son of}} Pro Football Hall of Famer Howie Long and younger brother of St. Louis Rams' defensive end Chris Long, played in only 21 games while starting 15 with Oregon. In the second round, with the fiftieth pick, the Bears selected Jon Bostic, a linebacker from Florida, who recorded 68 tackles with the nation's fifth-ranked defense in 2012. Two rounds later, the Bears used their 117th overall pick on Rutgers linebacker Khaseem Greene, who holds the NCAA record for career forced fumbles with 15. In the fifth round, the Bears traded down ten spots with the Atlanta Falcons to draft Louisiana Tech offensive tackle Jordan Mills, marking {{the first time the}} team selected two <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> in the same draft since 2002. In the sixth round, Chicago selected Georgia Bulldogs defensive end Cornelius Washington, who led linebackers in the bench press at the NFL Combine with 36 repetitions at 225 pounds. Using a seventh-rounder acquired in the trade with Atlanta, the Bears drafted wide receiver Marquess Wilson, who left the Washington State football team, citing abuse from head coach Mike Leach despite setting team records with 82 receptions for 1,388 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2011, followed by 52 receptions for 813 yards and five touchdowns in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Army {{football}} {{began in}} 1890, when Navy challenged the cadets {{to a game}} of the relatively new sport. Navy defeated Army at West Point that year, but Army avenged the loss in Annapolis the following year. The rival academies still clash every December in what is traditionally the last regular-season Division I college-football game. The 2015 football season marked Navy's fourteenth consecutive victory over Army, the longest streak in the series since inception. On December 10, 2016 Army won {{for the first time}} in 14 years, beating Navy, 21–17. Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds became the first Navy QB to beat Army in four consecutive seasons, and set the NCAA rushing touchdown record in the 2015 rivalry game. Army's football team reached its pinnacle of success under coach Earl Blaik when Army won consecutive national championships in 1944, 1945 and 1946, and produced three Heisman trophy winners: Doc Blanchard (1945), Glenn Davis (1946) and Pete Dawkins (1958). Past NFL coaches Vince Lombardi and Bill Parcells were Army assistant coaches early in their careers. The football team plays its home games at Michie Stadium, where the playing field is named after Earl Blaik. Cadets' attendance is mandatory at football games and the Corps stands for the duration of the game. At all home games, one of the four regiments marches onto the field in formation before the team takes the field and leads the crowd in traditional Army cheers. From 1992 through 1996, Army won all of the games against Navy for the first time since the legendary days of Blanchard and Davis, and it introduced the fraternal group of players identifying themselves as the Fat Man Club, initiated by the <b>offensive</b> <b>linemen</b> of the Class of 1996. Between the 1998 and 2004 seasons, Army's football program was a member of Conference USA, but has since reverted to its former independent status.|$|E
50|$|On May 3, the Browns {{announced}} the signings of nine undrafted free agents. Those players are: Jesse Ainsworth, a placekicker from Arizona State; Charles Ali, a fullback from Arkansas (Pine Bluff); Mike Alston, a linebacker from Toledo; Rick Drushal, an <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> from Wooster; Hunter Funtaine, a linebacker from Vanderbilt; Mike Mason, {{a wide receiver}} from Tennessee State; Tyrone Moss, a halfback from Miami (Florida); Brent Pousson, an <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> from McNeese State; and Scott Stephenson, an <b>offensive</b> <b>lineman</b> from Iowa State.
