5|$|Despite {{surgery for}} a brain {{aneurysm}} in June 1972, Ford attended the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida. He supported Edmund Muskie for president, but later greeted nominee George McGovern {{when he visited}} Kentucky. The convention {{was the beginning of}} Ford's role in national politics. <b>Offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> McGovern campaign's treatment of Democratic finance chairman Robert Schwarz Strauss, he helped Strauss get elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee following McGovern's defeat. As a result of his involvement in Strauss' election, Ford was elected chair of the Democratic Governors' Conference from 1973 to 1974. He also served as vice-chair of the Conference's Natural Resources and Environmental Management Committee.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|When The Great Silence was {{screened}} for Darryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century Fox {{to see whether}} the film could be released on the American market, he was <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> film (to the point where he reportedly swallowed the cigar he was smoking in shock upon watching the ending), and refused to distribute it in the United States. 20th Century Fox did, however, distribute the film in Italy and several other markets. The company also considered a remake of the film starring Clint Eastwood, which eventually evolved into a largely unrelated project by Universal Pictures, Joe Kidd.|$|E

They {{argue that if}} a man may <b>offend</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{disregard}} of some forms, he may as legitimately do so <b>by</b> <b>the</b> disregard of all; and they inquire--Why should he not {{go out to dinner}} in a dirty shirt, and with an unshorn chin? Why should he not spit on the drawing-room carpet, and stretch his heels up to the mantle-shelf? ...|$|R

5|$|Peter Hervik {{said that}} the cartoon {{controversy}} must {{be seen in the}} context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002. Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that Jyllands-Posten and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate. Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|By 1264, {{the reign}} of Henry III was deeply troubled by {{disputes}} between the king and his nobility. The conflict was caused by several factors. One source of discontent was the influence two groups of royal favourites enjoyed at court: the Savoyards, relatives of Queen Eleanor of Provence, and the king's half-brothers, known as Poitevins or Lusignans. The native nobility were <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> great political influence held by these foreigners. Secondly, the king had in 1254 accepted Pope Innocent IV's offer of the crown of Sicily for his younger son Edmund. The offer involved repelling the current Hohenstaufen rulers of the island, and proved to be very expensive. Lastly, there was a personal dispute between King Henry {{and one of his}} subjects, Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. Montfort, a foreigner himself, was initially on good terms with Henry, and had in 1238 married the king's sister Eleanor. The two fell out, however, and Montfort became the leader of the opposition, together with Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. In 1258, Henry was forced to accept the so-called Provisions of Oxford, whereby he effectively surrendered control of royal government to a council of magnates. In 1259 the baronial program of reform was further elaborated upon in the Provisions of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
60|$|He {{then said}} he used often to see people's Doppelganger; at another time, as to ghosts, he said, He was like Coleridge: {{he had seen}} too many of 'em.

The Unit aims to reduce <b>offending</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of empirically sound risk assessment tools and a brokerage case management model, which targets criminogenic needs.|$|R

5|$|The {{position}} of producer and director {{was taken over}} by Naoki Yoshida, a staff member at Square Enix who had previously worked on the Dragon Quest series. Among these were other staff changes: Komoto was reassigned to become lead game designer, Akihiko Yoshida became lead scenario concept artist, Hiroshi Takai was appointed as lead artist, and Akihiko Matsui became lead combat system designer. Yoshida's main priority was to make the game a playable experience after the poor launch and subsequent reaction. Through subsequent patches to the game, multiple graphical and gameplay improvements were made: among the most notable were the addition of a job system, personal chocobos, a revamped battle system, greater customization options for gear, and multiple new dungeons and bosses. Yoshida also introduced the official Final Fantasy XIV forums in order to obtain player feedback and suggestions, and stated that interacting with and growing closer to the community would be a high priority. During this period, XIV and XI were taken offline to help with energy conservation {{in the aftermath of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. They went back online one week later as other means were found to reduce their energy usage that did not involve their online services. Due to the earthquake, a planned and partially-developed boss battle with the Primal Titan was cut and replaced by another Primal: the team felt that players might be <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Primal and associate beastribe's links with the power of earth in this context.|$|E

25|$|Dark Habits premiered at the Venice Film Festival and was {{surrounded}} in controversy due its subject matter. Despite religious critics being <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> film, {{it went on}} to become a modest critical and commercial success, cementing Almodóvar's reputation as the enfant terrible of the Spanish cinema.|$|E
50|$|Another {{explanation}} is that the Tokoloshe resembles a zombie, poltergeist, or gremlin, created by South African shamans who have been <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> someone. <b>The</b> tokoloshe may also wander, causing mischief wherever it goes, particularly to schoolchildren. Other details include its gremlin-like appearance and gouged out eyes.|$|R

The narrator is <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> idea that the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who {{turns out to be}} a magistrate) and his son Taee behave kindly towards him.|$|E
25|$|The stereotypical {{views about}} blacks {{imparted}} to s Mike Mizanin by his uncle offended Coral Smith and Nicole Mitsch when he related them, {{and they tried}} to educate him on African American culture.

(a) <b>The</b> {{ordinance}} <b>by</b> discriminating among movies {{solely on}} the basis of content has the effect of deterring drive-in theaters from showing movies containing any nudity, however innocent or even educational, and such censorship of the content of otherwise protected speech cannot be justified on the basis of the limited privacy interest of persons on the public streets, who if <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> viewing <b>the</b> movies can readily avert their eyes.

25|$|Still <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{changes in}} his story for Flower and Snake, Dan refused to {{participate}} in the follow-up to that film, Wife to be Sacrificed. In interviews, Dan claimed that this second film, which proved even more successful than Flower and Snake, was based on a story he had written, but that he had insisted his name be removed from the credits. Director Masaru Konuma, however, says that it was an original story by Yozo Tanaka.|$|E

25|$|Although ibn Janah had {{intended}} {{this to be}} an uncontroversial, supportive work, many of Hayyuj's students were deeply <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> implication that there were flaws in his research. One of them, Samuel ibn Naghrillah, wrote a book critical of the Sefer HaHasagah: discovering this (and the nature of ibn Naghrillah's critiques) in advance of its publication, ibn Janah quickly wrote a counter-argument, Sefer HaHashva'ah, claiming that ibn Naghrillah was merely jealous. This led to a long exchange of pamphlets between the two, which were later of great benefit to Hebrew grammarians.|$|E
25|$|Although some locals {{welcomed the}} fence and {{regarded}} it as a tourist attraction, others viewed it as an eyesore and embarrassment, and as a potential hazard to drivers using the road. Frequent legal attempts were consequently made to see it removed. These attempts were increased in early 2006, accompanied by a further removal of some 200 of the bras. Some locals claimed {{that a number of}} Japanese students who are being educated in nearby Wanaka could get <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fence, as well as many other Asians or South Africans.|$|E
25|$|As {{a member}} of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), Shallal was also {{personally}} <b>offended</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> scheduled appearance of The Iron Sheik and added that the event was unfit for a public school because The Iron Sheik promoted anti-Arab and anti-Iranian sentiments. When the promotion agreed to drop The Iron Sheik from the event, the ADC made a second complaint about midget wrestling. The school district eventually decided to cancel the event, along with a second show, and notified co-promoter Kevin Heilbronner by letter. The promotion cited that it had previously attracted an audience of 950 at Fairfax High School in December 1995.|$|E
