25|$|Distractor {{inhibition}} {{model is}} the oldest model that explains the negative priming effect {{as the result of}} selective attention to a target stimulus. When we pay attention to a particular stimulus, we perceive other stimuli surrounding the target as distractors in order to help focus. But when one of those distractors becomes the new target of attention, <b>our</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the target is hampered due to immediate residual inhibition. Selective attention is the ability to respond to a specific object when there are other distractors that also compete for a response. To explain this selective attention, the distractor inhibition model proposes a dual mechanism involving excitation to boost target signal and inhibition to suppress distractors. This inhibition is triggered when there is a mismatch between the internal representations of the target and a distractor. Inhibition of the distractor's internal representation is a way of helping to selectively attend to the target stimulus. This inhibition decays gradually when the stimulus is no longer present to help with the next target. However, if a distractor stimulus is re-encountered as the target, the internal representation of the distractor stimulus may continue to be suppressed because it is too soon for the decay to dissipate already. This {{is referred to as the}} transient residual inhibition. This inhibition also impairs the processing of an appropriate response to the new target stimulus and results in greater reaction time.|$|E
500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want <b>our</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

40|$|The {{norms that}} mediate <b>our</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> {{accidents}} {{play a critical}} role in facilitating social cooperation. My dissertation explores these norms with an eye towards what they can tell us about the nature of moral responsibility. Drawing on Adam Smith's brief, but important discussion of moral luck, I argue that <b>our</b> <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> accidents reveal the extent to which the obligations we incur and the moral appraisals we make of one another are often appropriately influenced by fortune. In particular, I show how making sense of these <b>responses</b> requires us <b>to</b> embrace the idea that we can sometimes be morally responsible for things without being culpable, and I argue that doing so need not do violence to our moral intuitions...|$|R

2500|$|Haggard {{developed}} a concept he called [...] "The Life-Giving Church", which amounted to his ministry practice. He believed that churches and their members either lived [...] "in the Tree of Life" [...] or [...] "in the Tree of Knowledge {{of good and}} evil", referring to the two trees in the Garden of Eden (see Gen. 2:9). He wrote a book, The Life-Giving Church, to expound on this difference, and said that motivations are the key difference between two types of Christians. For instance, Haggard proposed, two women can stand outside an abortion clinic with protest signs. The [...] "tree of life" [...] protestor is there because she loves the unborn and has compassion for the mother and father. The [...] "tree of knowledge of good and evil" [...] protestor has come because she believes abortion is evil and must be stopped. [...] "One way we can tell which tree we are living in," [...] writes Haggard, [...] "is <b>our</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> sin... {{one of the greatest}} marks of bearing His [...] character is <b>our</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> someone else's sin. If we handle others' mistakes with a life-giving attitude, then we (and they) have the opportunity to enjoy great power and freedom. But if we handle others' mistakes negatively, then we're eating from the wrong tree and will begin to die." [...] Christians who live in the [...] "tree of life," [...] writes Haggard, [...] "grow in their understanding of right and wrong, and they find great insight, wisdom, victory, and joy in the stream of Jesus' righteousness." [...] Those who dwell in the opposite tree find and display [...] "frustration, judgmental attitudes, and death." ...|$|E

2500|$|This theory {{proposes that}} {{negative}} priming effect {{is the result}} of interference due to the target being located where the distractor was once located. When the target stimulus and distractor stimulus are repeatedly placed in the same location, we know their respective location and pay attention more to the location of the target than the target itself. <b>Our</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the target is also faster because we have already identified where to pay attention. This is called Simon effect, which refers our innate tendency to respond faster and more accurately when stimuli occur in the same location. This can be explained by neuroscience in terms of neural facilitation and short-term plasticity. However, if the positions of the stimuli {{are not the same as}} before, it is no longer easy to attend to the target as it once was. The feature mismatch hypothesis states that inhibition occurs when there is a mismatch between the target and its location.|$|E
