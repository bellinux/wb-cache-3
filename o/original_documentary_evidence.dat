50|$|The {{work which}} brought him lasting renown {{and a place}} in the records of the science of history is {{entitled}} Chronicon Gottwicense, tomus prodromus (Tegernsee, 1732). Not, as might be thought, a history of the abbey, this single volume is a comprehensive work on German diplomatics, treating of manuscripts found in registers and archives, <b>original</b> <b>documentary</b> <b>evidence,</b> diplomas of German emperors and kings, and inscriptions and seals, illustrated with maps and engravings on copper. The author also discusses medieval geography, as well as the royal palace-domains (Pfalzen) and the various districts of Germany. Great learning and clear critical acumen distinguish this work, which marked an epoch in the history of German diplomatics, and has served as the basis of all later works on the same subject.|$|E

40|$|The use of area-based {{positive}} discrimination as {{a response}} to the persistent educational underachievement of children was adopted by the Labour governments elected in both 1964 and 1997. Much has been written about recent policy, but the first use of this approach during the 1960 s is, at present, no more than a footnote in the history of education. This thesis presents an historical account of the Educational Priority Area projects that took place in Liverpool and the West Riding of Yorkshire between 1968 and 1971. The lessons from the past which emerge from this 'novel' policy response to a seemingly intractable problem help us to understand the dilemmas of the present. The EPA project was part of an ideological tradition concerned with enduring pedagogical and political ideals relating to social justice and equality. Theoretically, the EPA projects raise questions about organisational structures and the agency of individuals. The actions of the Liverpool and West Riding teams challenged the ideological construction of teacher identity. Their work provided evidence that the relationship between the professional and the home is not unalterable. The approach taken was to analyse a range of primary sources including <b>original</b> <b>documentary</b> <b>evidence</b> and extensive interviews with the surviving EPA team members. The actions taken by the teams and the voices of those responsible revealed distinctive practices that contribute to existing understanding of the potential of area-based interventions. At a time when the respective roles of teachers and parents were clearly demarcated, the EP A projects demonstrated what might have been. They effectively challenged existing preconceptions held by professionals regarding their relationship with the home and provided a legacy of innovations with which to challenge educational underachievement. For anyone interested in overcoming educational inequality the EPA projects offer a contribution to debates concerned with what works, what doesn't, and why.

25|$|As {{it stands}} today, the {{monument}} {{is in part}} a reconstruction, because in 1882, {{the owner of the}} site re-erected around a third of the stones that had previously fallen, and in doing so some were moved out of their <b>original</b> positions. Using <b>documentary</b> <b>evidence</b> and lichen growth analysis, archaeologists have also established that around that time, several new stones were added to the circle in order to fill in gaps where the original stone had been lost or destroyed, although Lambrick doubted that any more than two of those currently standing were modern additions, with four of the other, smaller additions having been stolen by vandals in the 20th century.|$|R
