5|$|This module {{starts in}} one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> If {{the players have}} {{finished}} Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, they have been transported to the glacial rift via the magic chain. They will {{know that they are}} searching for some force behind the giant alliance. If the players are starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, then they have been hired by nobles to destroy the frost giants. Either way, a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations.|$|E
5|$|To develop, {{the larvae}} must be fed both nectar for {{carbohydrates}} and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing {{a small hole}} in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. Larvae are fed pollen in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways,</b> depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen {{at the base of}} the brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae.|$|E
5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

25|$|Vacancies in {{a council}} seat may be filled in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways,</b> {{either by the}} holding of a {{by-election}} or through direct appointment of an interim councillor chosen by the council in an internal vote. Normally the council is allowed to decide which process to follow in each individual case; however, if the vacancy occurs after March 31 {{in the year of}} a regularly scheduled municipal election, then the vacancy must be filled by direct appointment as provincial law prohibits the holding of a by-election in the final six months of a council term.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergency}} {{detection system}} (EDS) sensed initial development of {{conditions in the}} flight vehicle during the boost phases of flight which could cause vehicle failure. The EDS reacted to these emergency situations in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> If breakup of the vehicle were imminent, an automatic abort sequence would be initiated. If, however, the emergency condition were developing slowly enough or were of such a nature that the flight crew can evaluate it and take action, only visual indications were provided to the flight crew. Once an abort sequence had been initiated, either automatically or manually, it was irrevocable and ran to completion.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{has been criticized}} for its lack of troubleshooting support. Teachers in Peru are told to handle problems in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> If the problem is a software issue, they are to flash the computer, and if it is a hardware problem, they are to report it. In the classroom environment this black-boxing approach is being criticized for causing the teachers and students to feel disconnected with, and confused by the laptop, which results, in many cases, in the laptops eventually going unused. Several defects in OLPC XO-1 hardware have emerged in the field, and laptop repair is often neglected by students or their families (who are responsible for maintenance) due to the relatively high cost of some components (such as displays).|$|E

25|$|Then black teas are {{processed}} in either <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways,</b> CTC (Crush, Tear, Curl) or orthodox. The CTC method produces leaves of fannings or dust grades that {{are commonly used}} in tea bags but also produces higher (broken leaf) grades such as BOP CTC and GFBOP CTC (see gradings below for more details). This method is efficient and effective for producing a better quality product from medium and lower quality leaves of consistently dark color. Orthodox processing is done either by machines or by hand. Hand processing is used for high quality teas. While the methods employed in orthodox processing differ by tea type, this style of processing results in the high quality loose tea sought by many connoisseurs. The tea leaves are allowed to completely oxidize.|$|E
25|$|Viscoelastic creep {{data can}} be {{presented}} in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> Total strain can be plotted {{as a function of}} time for a given temperature or temperatures. Below a critical value of applied stress, a material may exhibit linear viscoelasticity. Above this critical stress, the creep rate grows disproportionately faster. The second way of graphically presenting viscoelastic creep in a material is by plotting the creep modulus (constant applied stress divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the viscoelastic creep modulus is independent of stress applied. A family of curves describing strain versus time response to various applied stress may be represented by a single viscoelastic creep modulus versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material's critical stress value.|$|E
25|$|Noam Chomsky's Principles and Parameters {{theory in}} the 1980s {{introduced}} {{the idea that a}} small number of innate principles are common to every human language (e.g. phrases are oriented around heads), and that these general principles are subject to parametric variation (e.g. the order of heads and other phrasal components may differ). In this theory, the dependency relation between heads, complements, specifiers, and adjuncts is regulated by X-bar theory, proposed by Jackendoff in the 1970s. The complement is sister to the head, and they can be ordered in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> A head-complement order is called a head-initial structure, while a complement-head order is called a head-final structure. These are special cases of Tesnière's centripetal and centrifugal structures, since here only complements are considered, whereas Tesnière considered all types of dependents.|$|E

25|$|Lead {{replacement}} may {{be done in}} one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> Insert {{a new set of}} leads without {{removing the}} current leads (not recommended as it provides additional obstruction to blood flow and heart valve function) or remove the current leads and then insert replacements. The lead removal technique will vary depending on the surgeon's estimation of the probability that simple traction will suffice to more complex procedures. Leads can normally be disconnected from the pacemaker easily which is why device replacement usually entails simple surgery to access the device and replace it by simply unhooking the leads from the device to replace and hooking the leads to the new device. The possible complications, such as perforation of the heart wall, come from removing the lead{s} from the patient's body.|$|E
25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> The first {{method is to}} wrap the scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of}} the scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the island}} {{location}} {{and the fact that}} the Cook Islands produce a significant array of fruits and vegetables, natural local produce, especially coconut, features in many of the dishes of the islands as does fresh seafood. While most food is imported from New Zealand, there are several Growers' Associations, such as Mangaian, Ngatangiia, Penrhyn, Puaikura, and Rakahanga, which contribute produce for local cuisine. Typical local cuisine includes arrowroot, clams, octopus, and taro, and seasonings such as fresh ginger, lime, lemon, basil, garlic and coconut. Rukau is a dish of taro leaves cooked with coconut sauce and onion. [...] A meal of octopus is known locally as Eke, and suckling pig is known as Puaka. Ika mata is a dish of raw fish marinated with lemon or lime and served with coconut cream, while Pai Ika and Keke Ika are also local fish fare. Poke is a dessert which can be made in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways,</b> either with banana and coconut milk or with pawpaw. Soursop, oranges and mangos are popular as juices. Coconut water, local beer (Cooks Lager), and coffee are popular beverages among the Cook Islanders.|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} of plumes at the volcanoes Pele and Loki {{were the first}} sign that Io is geologically active. Generally, these plumes are formed when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds of gas and dust. Additional material that might be found in these volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. These plumes appear to be formed in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> Io's largest plumes, such as those emitted by Pele, are created when dissolved sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas are released from erupting magma at volcanic vents or lava lakes, often dragging silicate pyroclastic material with them. These plumes form red (from the short-chain sulfur) and black (from the silicate pyroclastics) deposits on the surface. Plumes formed in this manner are among the largest observed at Io, forming red rings more than [...] in diameter. Examples of this plume type include Pele, Tvashtar, and Dazhbog. Another type of plume is produced when encroaching lava flows vaporize underlying sulfur dioxide frost, sending the sulfur skyward. This type of plume often forms bright circular deposits consisting of sulfur dioxide. These plumes are often less than [...] tall, and {{are among the most}} long-lived plumes on Io. Examples include Prometheus, Amirani, and Masubi. The erupted sulfurous compounds are concentrated in the upper crust from a decrease in sulfur solubility at greater depths in Io's lithosphere.|$|E
