50|$|The {{exposure}} on {{the surface}} that this procedure entailed was the great weakness of the Atlas F. It was exposed and vulnerable during this time. Titan II and Minuteman missiles could be launched from within their silos, thereby eliminating this vulnerability. Also, since the Titan did not use a cryogenic fuel or <b>oxydizer,</b> and the Minuteman was a solid fuel rocket, they could be stored fully fueled and ready to launch within a few minutes.|$|E

He became {{the leader of the}} department of liquid propellent rocket engines in NII-3 beginning in January 1938. Starting with Glushko's engines (ORM-65 and RD-1), he began a series of important engineering transformations, moving the fuel injectors to a head at one end of a cylindrical chamber, typical of modern design. The RDA-150, RDA-300 used nitric acid as an <b>oxydizer,</b> RDK-150 used liquid oxygen.|$|E

Also, since the Titan did not use a cryogenic fuel or <b>oxydizer,</b> and the Minuteman was a solid fuel rocket, they could be stored fully fueled and ready to launch within a very few minutes.The squadron's sites developed a notorious reputation due to three missile explosions. On 1 June 1963, launch complex 579-1 was destroyed during a propellant loading exercise. On 13 February 1964, an explosion occurred during another propellant loading exercise, destroying launch complex 579-5. Again, a month later, on 9 March 1964, silo 579-2 fell victim to another explosion that occurred during a propellant loading exercise. Fortunately, these missiles were not mated with their warheads {{at the time of}} the incidents. The only injury reported was that of a crewman running into barbed wire as he fled a site. (see below for site details).|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on the initiation of a heterogeneous detonation wave propagating through mixtures of liquid fuel and a gaseous <b>oxydizer.</b> The liquid fuel tested was kerosene in the forms of a spray and a film attached on tube walls. The ignition was performed by oxyhydrogen detonation. The effects {{of the content of}} oxygen in the <b>oxydizer</b> were investigated. It was found that for pure oxygen as an <b>oxydizer,</b> detonation waves were established by the combustion of kerosene, but for an <b>oxydizer</b> {{with a small amount of}} oxygen, only low Mach number shock waves with combustion waves following after were formed. For the former case, the ignition was initiated by the strong shock wave front, but for the latter case, the liquid phase seemed to be ignited by the combustion products of the initiator gas...|$|E
40|$|In {{the midst}} of {{restrictions}} issue {{on the use of}} fossil fuels, the world began to move towards the use of renewable fuels. One such fuel is bio-ethanol. Production of bio-ethanol itself leaves vinasse wastetreatment problems with large discharge. There have been many ways to treat vinasse one of which is the burning of concentrated vinasse. Combustion process is a complex process in terms physical and chemical. Complex phenomenon will be difficult to be analyzed simultaneously and comprehensively when using conventional techniques. Simulation of combustion process based on CFD can be one such solution. In the case of vinasse as fuel and air as <b>oxydizer</b> the selected combustion model is a non-premixed combustion models with probability density function. </p...|$|E
