40|$|<b>Opiates</b> {{and cocaine}} both have effects on adrenal and gonadal function. <b>Opiates</b> {{suppress}} the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, whereas cocaine leads to HPA activation. <b>Opiates</b> also cause gonadal dysfunction in {{both men and}} women. During withdrawal from <b>opiates</b> and cocaine, the HPA axis is activated which may reinforce relapse behavior. This review describes these hormonal effects and explores the potential consequences, including the effects on mood cognition and cardiovascular risk.

5|$|Tool {{was founded}} in 1988 by vocalist Maynard James Keenan and guitarist Adam Jones, who then {{recruited}} drummer Danny Carey and bassist Paul D'Amour. They initially released a demo EP in 1991 called 72826. Although demos are typically intended only for record labels, the band was so pleased with theirs that they sold copies to their fans. Tool signed to Zoo Entertainment just three months into their career, and released their first studio EP, <b>Opiate,</b> in March 1992. After touring to positive reviews, they released their first full-length album, Undertow, in April 1993. The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Vespertine is {{the fourth}} solo album by Icelandic {{musician}} Björk, released on 27 August 2001, on One Little Indian Records. It was recorded at locations in Spain, Iceland, and the United States in 2000; production began during the filming of Dancer in the Dark, which was characterized by conflict between the singer and director Lars von Trier. Björk, a self-titled coffee table book containing photographs of the singer throughout her career, was released simultaneously with the album. Vespertines sound reflected Björk's newly found interest in the music of artists such as <b>Opiate</b> and Console, who were also enlisted as producers.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Opiates</b> {{contain the}} {{narcotics}} morphine, codeine, and papaverine which provide pain relief. <b>Opiates</b> activate μ-opioid receptors {{in the brain}} which alter the brain's perception of sensory input, alleviating pain and sometimes inducing pleasure for a short time period. When intravenously administered, <b>opiates</b> can relieve neuropathic pain but only for a time between 4 and 24 hours. After this time window, the pain returns and the patient must be treated again. Although this method of treatment has been proven to reduce pain, the repetitive use of <b>opiates</b> has also been linked to the activation of the brain's reward system and therefore poses a threat of addiction. Heavy doses of <b>opiates</b> can also cause constipation, and respiratory depression. [...] More common side effects include light-headedness, dizziness, sedation, itching, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. [...] The potential destruction <b>opiates</b> can cause have drawn many doctors and patients away from their use.|$|R
30|$|Our {{study is}} a {{follow-up}} to a previous study {{on the effects of}} intraperitoneal neublization of ropivacaine throughout laparoscopic gynecological procedures. The previous study was done using long acting <b>opiates.</b> The current study, using short-acting <b>opiates</b> combined with nebulization of 100  mg ropivacaine, showed no improvement in patients’ outcome in terms of post-operative pain as well as usage of <b>opiates</b> post-operatively.|$|R
40|$|The International {{association}} {{for the study of}} pain and the World medical association stated that receiving a fair treatment of pain is a right of each individual. Moderate or high intensity cases of pain are treated with <b>opiates.</b> In Italy, in 2010, a new legislation has been issued, one of the most advanced on the topic of the treatment of pain and the usage of <b>opiates.</b> Although the legislative progresses, the consumption of <b>opiates</b> is not so common and ranks far behind the other European countries. The analysis of the spread of <b>opiates</b> in the treatment of pain pointed out relevant differences in terms of gender, age, region, cancer, type of opioid prescribed. It should then take action to make consistent use of <b>opiates</b> in pain therapy, focusing in particular on cancer patients and territorial differences. The analysis of religiosity as a potential barrier to pain management and <b>opiates</b> usage allowed us to conclude, however, that it is a factor that influences the number of prescriptions of <b>opiates,</b> even if the moderate effect. Public policies should respect personal choices (also religious ones), but it is important broadcasting some appropriate information campaigns which allow to make independent and informed choices.

5|$|In spring 1881, Marcus found Behan in {{bed with}} the wife of a friend and kicked him out, {{although}} she still used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. Earp had a common-law relationship with Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as his wife in the June 1880 census. She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, a commonly used <b>opiate</b> and painkiller. There are no contemporary records in Tombstone of a relationship between Josephine and Earp. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Josephine together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs. But Earp and Marcus certainly knew each other, as Behan and Earp both had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} <b>opiate</b> painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E
25|$|Identical {{drugs can}} produce {{different}} results {{depending on the}} route of administration. For example, some drugs are not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract and their action after enteral administration is therefore different from that after parenteral administration. This can be illustrated {{by the action of}} naloxone (Narcan), an antagonist of opiates such as morphine. Naloxone counteracts <b>opiate</b> action in the central nervous system when given intravenously and is therefore used in the treatment of <b>opiate</b> overdose. The same drug, when swallowed, acts exclusively on the bowels; it is here used to treat constipation under <b>opiate</b> pain therapy and does not affect the pain-reducing effect of the <b>opiate.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Opiates,</b> such as {{heroin and}} morphine, {{function}} as an analgesic by binding to opioid {{receptors in the brain}} and gastrointestinal tract. This binding reduces the perception of and reaction to pain, while also increasing pain tolerance. <b>Opiates</b> are hypothesized to be used as self-medication for aggression and rage. <b>Opiates</b> are effective anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, and anti-depressants, however, people tend to self-medicate anxiety and depression with depressants and stimulants respectively, though this is by no means an absolute analysis.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt has {{previously}} been demonstrated that <b>opiates</b> interact directly with P-glycoprotein in drug resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Callaghan, R. and Riordan, J. R. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16059 – 16064). In this study we have {{examined the effects of}} several <b>opiates</b> on the growth of drug sensitive and resistant CHO and human MCF 7 cell lines. The growth of P-glycoprotein expressing cells was inhibited by the <b>opiates</b> pentazocine, pethidine and naloxone {{to a greater extent than}} in drug sensitive cells. Since P-glycoprotein is localised at the plasma membrane the effects of <b>opiates</b> on membrane biophysical properties were investigated. The <b>opiates</b> caused a fluidizing effect in membranes from P-glycoprotein expressing cells and decreased the basal level of P-glycoprotein phosphorylation. In addition, they were able to increase the leakage of the membrane impermeant compound 6 -carboxyfluorescein entrapped in model membrane vesicles. The ability to alter membrane biophysical properties correlated with the inhibitory effects on growth of drug resistant cells. These results suggest that the collateral sensitivity of P-glycoprotein expressing cell lines to <b>opiates</b> is mediated by the drugs' effects on the plasma membrane...|$|R

25|$|Using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) {{researchers}} {{have shown that}} reward dependence is linked to <b>opiate</b> receptor binding (the endorphine system) in the bilateral ventral striatum: a core substrate of the reward circuit which is strongly implicated in addictive behavior development. These findings demonstrate that people with high reward dependence (who feel a greater need for social rewards and verbal approval) have more <b>opiate</b> receptors found in the ventral striatum, whereas people with low reward dependence have a lower concentration of receptors. It is then suggested that increased ventral striatal <b>opiate</b> receptors could provide the biological link between personality traits and substance abuse risk.|$|E
25|$|Despite these laws, {{the late}} 19th century saw an {{increase}} in <b>opiate</b> consumption. This {{was due to the}} prescribing and dispensing of legal opiates by physicians and pharmacists to relieve painful menstruation.
