The region is characterized by a low-carbon power matrix and a potential to produce over 78 PWh from non-traditional renewable energy technologies (NRETs). However, bias toward fossil fuels and the perceived cost disadvantages prevent further market entry of renewable energy. Additional (societal) benefits of employing renewables are considerable but typically left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> comparisons. A consideration of these benefits may offer a rationale to promote investment and support regulations that would contribute to the deployment of these NRET technologies. We quantify societal benefits in terms of avoided costs (climate change avoided costs, avoided pollution control costs, avoided energy security costs) and economic benefits (improvements in the balance of payments and job creation). Results indicate that societal benefits are sufficiently large enough to compensate the cost disadvantage of solar and wind energy against fossil alternatives, justifying the eventual wholesale entry of these options. ...|$|E

Treatment programs, {{regardless}} of their funding sources, are faced with constant pressures to keep costs to a minimum and to justify every expenditure. Yet accounting for costs takes time that might better be spent on treatment itself. Also, program staff trained in helping people may not be proficient in tracking money. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, {{as part of its}} mission to assist programs that treat substance abusers, has sponsored research related to cost issues. The results of these studies are available to treatment programs at no cost as part of NIDA's policy of transferring technology as soon as possible. One example of this is Measuring and Improving Cost, Cost-Effectiveness, and Cost-Benefit for Substance Abuse Treatment Programs: A Manual. The manual describes several ways to determine cost effectiveness and benefits, ranging from simple educated estimates to sophisticated, computerized methods. It even shows you how to find people at little or no cost to help you collect and analyze the data. No background in accounting or research is needed to use the methods described in the manual. The hands-on format and step-by-step instructions, exercises, and worksheets are designed to guide professionals from a variety of disciplines and educational backgrounds through the collection and analysis of data on costs, procedures, effectiveness, and benefits.

However, after adjusting for self-reported health, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> pocket <b>cost</b> per consultation was inversely associated with use <b>of</b> services. The <b>out</b> <b>of</b> pocket <b>cost</b> was generally lower for women with low socioeconomic status but cost was also directly related to geographical remoteness.

There are also many traditional services offering a very extensive network of community based activities. Expenditure pattern and financing trends in Indonesia's health care sector, has complex characteristic. Funds flow into the sector a variety of sources.  The major ones being allocation for government revenues both central and local government, payments by households (e. g. fees for services, drug purchase), employer contribution to health care for employees; premium through social financing scheme, foreign loans and grants and very limited from NGOs. The study aims to explore the type of health care services and the cost by BUMN (employer)  for they employees. The study was design as a cross sectional study. It was calculated 138 BUMN out of six sectors By using purposive sampling method it was plan the sampling was 36 BUMN or 25 % of the total BUMN. The data collection was primary data by using the questionnaire, which was colleted by visited the company and by mail. The study results showed that 26 BUMN or 70 % of the sample plan have been included In this study. The data and Information have been collected was year 1998, 1999, and 2000. The results of the study showed that 80 % of the companies provide they own health care services tor their employees, It is only 8 % was through Insurance, and 12 % using both. It was showed that 60 % out of 80 % have they own hospitals or clinics, which all of the companies provide out - patient services and 50 % provide in-patient services. Almost all of the companies provide services to family members of the employees, and its only 18 %, which provide services to the retired employees. The unit cost was varies among sectors and by year. In 1998 the annually unit cost per capita was between Rp 134, 854. 00 (the lowest) to Rp 1, 831, 401. 00 (the highest), In 1999 it was between Rp 335, 836. 00 (the lowest) to Rp 2, 288, 386. 00 (the highest), and in 2000 it was between Rp 539, 590. 00 (the lowest) to Rp 2, 835, 197. 00 (the highest).

The total cost for health care services in year 1998 was 1, 013 billion rupiah, 1, 3445 billion rupiah in 1999, and slightly decreased to become 1, 254 billion rupiah in 2000 due to decreased number of employees. The data showed that it was expended 25. 2 - 32. 2 % for outpatient services,  20 to 37. 2 % for inpatient services, 29. 1 - 42. 2 % for drugs, 6. 3 - 8 % for surgery, and 2. 4 - 2. 8 % for laboratory services.
