5|$|The move to top team IFK Göteborg {{went well}} and Augustinsson played {{most of the}} games during the pre-season. When Svenska Cupen began in March, he was first-choice as left-back and played two games in the group stage. IFK Göteborg later won the cup against Djurgården in the final. Just a couple <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the start of 2013 Allsvenskan, {{he picked up a}} knee injury while playing for Sweden U21 which kept him out of action for five months. On his Allsvenskan debut on 25 August 2013 in an away match against Malmö FF he {{suffered}} another injury, which meant that he would be out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Yellow Fever and How to Cure It was {{a three-part}} story by Robert Holmes {{that would have}} taken place in Singapore and {{featured}} the Autons as the monsters, with both the Rani and the Master appearing, the Brigadier would have also returned. The first episode was commissioned on 26 October 1984, before being put on hold. The entire story was subsequently commissioned on 6 February 1985, only a couple <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> news of the planned hiatus broke. Nathan-Turner hoped to have Graeme Harper direct the adventure. After the news of the hiatus, Holmes was asked by the production team to continue with the story but as six 25 minute episodes, this version seeing the removal of the Master from the plot. Holmes reportedly only completed a story outline before the planned Season 23 was completely cancelled. The basic premise had the Master and the Rani operating under the guise of a travelling street theatre, the story would open with Peri seeing the Statue of Liberty on the scanner screen, and she would think she was back in America, only to find they were in a massive cultural garden with many miniature landmarks on display.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{donations}} from wealthy followers, {{the group was}} well-armed and trained. Some members, like al-Otaybi, were former military officials of the National Guard. Some National Guard troops sympathetic to the insurgents smuggled weapons, ammunition, gas masks and provisions into the mosque compound over a period <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the new year. Automatic weapons were smuggled from National Guard armories and the supplies were hidden {{in the hundreds of}} tiny underground rooms under the mosque that were used as hermitages.|$|E

25|$|A couple <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> Mötley Crüe {{was set to}} {{tour the}} New Tattoo album, Castillo became ill while {{performing}} with his mariachi side project Azul at the Cat Club in Hollywood. Immediately after the show Castillo took a cab to nearby Cedars Sinai Hospital where he collapsed as he was being admitted. The doctors discovered a duodenal ulcer that had ruptured his stomach and performed emergency surgery that saved Castillo’s life. While taking time off from Mötley Crüe to recover from his surgery, he discovered a small lump on his jaw and a month later, after it had grown to {{roughly the size of}} a golf ball, he sought treatment and was diagnosed with Squamous cell Carcinoma, a common form of cancer that is not usually fatal if it is discovered early but can spread rapidly if left untreated. The cancer went into remission in mid-2001, and he was rumored to be rejoining Osbourne's solo band for that summer Ozzfest tour (along with Geezer Butler on bass), though these rumors were later revealed to be untrue.|$|E

Homer would later feel guilt, believing that the incident prompted Mona to leave him and his father. Mona solves Homer's problem by telling him that the fishing trip never {{played a role in}} her leaving.|$|E

500|$|A couple <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the NBA {{season was}} {{originally}} scheduled to start, Reuters and Bloomberg Businessweek speculated on {{the prospect of}} increased interest in the National Hockey League (NHL) among NBA fans.

Businessweek wrote, [...] "Just maybe, the NBA's sketchy situation is already having {{a positive effect on}} the NHL."

Criss spent five weeks in New York City, the last three starring in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying from January 3 through 22, 2012.|$|E
500|$|The cast {{found out}} a couple <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> filming the episode that parts would be in animation. The {{animated}} portions were produced with Zoic Studios. Over an eight-week period, the studio defined the primary Fringe characters into their animated counterparts, and used footage of the actors and fight scene choreography to provide motion for the characters. The animators used a stand-in for Nimoy so {{that he did not}} have to fly to Vancouver from Los Angeles. The studio aimed to achieve a mixed look between stylized and authenticity to allow them to focus on animating the characters' emotions. The work also include recreating some of the settings already established from Fringe, such as Bell's office. Other parts of Olivia's dreamscape were handpainted scenes, projected onto 3D plates and used within the animation software. Andrew Orloff, Zoic's creative director commented, [...] "This project was one of the most intensive and rewarding we have worked on in Zoic’s history. It was an incredible undertaking, from the amazing writers at Fringe to the animation production that is both steeped in tradition and groundbreaking." [...] The episode ultimately contained sixteen minutes of animation; executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that the amount of man hours placed into the episode was [...] "by far" [...] the longest the series has had to date. The writers have cited Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Waltz with Bashir as influences for the episode.|$|E

2500|$|While {{preparing}} {{for his role}} as Bickle, De Niro was filming Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 in Italy.

[...] De Niro obtained a cab driver's license, and when on break would pick up a cab and drive around New York for a couple <b>of</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>before</b> returning to Rome to resume filming 1900. De Niro apparently lost 35 pounds and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of Arthur Bremer. When he had time off from shooting 1900, De Niro visited an army base in Northern Italy and tape-recorded soldiers from the Midwestern United States, whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.|$|E

Stewart then quit, and was not replaced for some time. Connolly and Tucker had a chance meeting with Wainman, who was now producing, and knew of two aspiring songwriters, Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who {{were looking for a}} group to sing over some demos they had written together. Connolly, Priest and Tucker provided the vocals on a track called [...] "Funny Funny" [...] which featured Pip Williams on guitar, John Roberts on bass and Wainman on drums. The latter began offering the track to various recording companies. The band held auditions for a replacement guitarist and settled on Welsh-born Andy Scott. He had most recently been playing with Mike McCartney (brother of Paul) in the Scaffold. As a member of the Elastic Band, he had played guitar on two singles for Decca, [...] "Think of You Baby" [...] and [...] "Do Unto Others". He also appeared on the band's lone album release, Expansions on Life, and on some recordings by the Scaffold. The band rehearsed for a number <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> Scott made his live debut with Sweet on 26 September 1970 at the Windsor Ballroom in Redcar.|$|E
