40|$|Far-infrared Spitzer {{observations}} of elliptical galaxies are inconsistent with simple steady state models of dust creation in red giant stars and destruction by grain sputtering {{in the hot}} interstellar gas at T ~ 10 ^ 7 K. The flux at 24 microns correlates with <b>optical</b> <b>fluxes,</b> suggesting that this relatively hot dust is largely circumstellar. But fluxes at 70 and 160 microns do not correlate with <b>optical</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Elliptical galaxies with similar L_B have luminosities at 70 and 160 microns (L_ 70 and L_ 160) that vary over a factor ~ 100, implying an additional source of dust unrelated to that produced by ongoing local stellar mass loss. Neither L_ 70 /L_B nor L_ 160 /L_B correlate with the stellar age or metallicity. <b>Optical</b> line <b>fluxes</b> from warm gas at T ~ 10 ^ 4 K correlate weakly with L_ 70 and L_ 160, suggesting that the dust {{may be responsible for}} cooling this gas. Many normal elliptical galaxies have emission at 70 microns that is extended to 5 - 10 kpc. Extended far-infrared emission with sputtering lifetimes of ~ 10 ^ 8 yrs is difficult to maintain by mergers with gas-rich galaxies. Instead, we propose that this cold dust is buoyantly transported from reservoirs of dust in the galactic cores which is supplied by mass loss from stars in the core. Intermittent energy outbursts from AGNs can drive the buoyant outflow. Comment: 26 pages; Accepted by Ap...|$|R

40|$|Sco X- 1 {{has been}} the subject of many multi-wavelength studies in the past, being the {{brightest}} persistent extra-solar X-ray source ever observed. Here we revisit Sco X- 1 with simultaneous short cadence Kepler optical photometry and MAXI X-ray photometry over a 78 day period, as well as optical spectroscopy obtained with HERMES. We find Sco X- 1 to be highly variable in all our datasets. The <b>optical</b> <b>fluxes</b> are clearly bimodal, implying the system can be found in two distinct optical states. These states are generally associated with the known flaring/normal branch X-ray states, although the flux distributions associated with these states overlap. Furthermore, we find that the optical power spectrum of Sco X- 1 differs substantially between optical luminosity states. Additionally we find rms-flux relations in both optical states, but only find a linear relation during periods of low optical luminosity. The full optical/X-ray discrete correlation function displays a broad ~ 12. 5 hour optical lag. However during the normal branch phase the X-ray and <b>optical</b> <b>fluxes</b> are anti-correlated, whilst being correlated during the flaring branch. We also performed a Cepstrum analysis on the full Kepler light curve to determine the presence of any echoes within the optical light curve alone. We find significant echo signals, consistent with the optical lags found using the discrete cross-correlation. We speculate that whilst some of the driving X-ray emission is reflected by the disk, some is absorbed and re-processed on the thermal timescale, giving rise to both the observed optical lags and optical echoes.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{unprecedented}} short-term variations {{detected in the}} <b>optical</b> <b>flux</b> from the black hole binary system, V 4641 Sgr. Amplitudes of the optical fluctuations were larger at longer time scales, and surprisingly reached ~ 60 % around a period of ~ 10 min. The power spectra of fluctuations are characterized by a power law. It is the first case in black hole binaries that the optical emission was revealed to show short-term and large-amplitude variations given by such a power spectrum. The optical emission from black hole binaries is generally dominated by the emission from the outer portion of an accretion disc. The rapid optical fluctuations however indicate that the emission from an inner accretion region significantly contributes to the <b>optical</b> <b>flux.</b> In this case, cyclo-synchrotron emission associated with various scales of magnetic flares is the most promising mechanism for the violently variable optical emission.

We found that the X-ray and optical light curves are well correlated in both objects, although the amplitudes of outbursts in X-rays are smaller than those in the optical. The ratio of the outburst amplitudes in X-rays and the optical in both objects is close to ~ 0. 6. This is significantly higher than was observed during the outburst of the non-magnetic dwarf nova U Gem, in which this ratio was only ~ 0. 03.

40|$|While 2 % {{of active}} galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit narrow {{emission}} lines with line-of-sight velocities that are significantly offset from {{the velocity of}} the host galaxy's stars, {{the nature of these}} velocity offsets is unknown. We investigate this question with Chandra/ACIS and Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 observations of seven velocity-offset AGNs at z< 0. 12, and all seven galaxies have a central AGN but a peak in emission that is spatially offset by < kpc from the host galaxy's stellar centroid. These spatial offsets are responsible for the observed velocity offsets and are due to shocks, either from AGN outflows (in four galaxies) or gas inflowing along a bar (in three galaxies). We compare our results to a velocity-offset AGN whose velocity offset originates from a spatially offset AGN in a galaxy merger. The <b>optical</b> line <b>flux</b> ratios of the offset AGN are consistent with pure photoionization, while the <b>optical</b> line <b>flux</b> ratios of our sample are consistent with contributions from photoionization and shocks.
