40|$|We {{report on}} a {{successful}} experiment of computeraided theorem discovery {{in the area of}} logic programming with answer set semantics. Specifically, with the help of computers, we discovered exact conditions that capture the strong equivalence between a set <b>of</b> a <b>rule</b> <b>and</b> the empty set, a set <b>of</b> a <b>rule</b> <b>and</b> another set <b>of</b> a <b>rule,</b> a set S <b>of</b> two <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> a subset <b>of</b> S with one <b>rule,</b> a set <b>of</b> two <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> a set <b>of</b> another <b>rule,</b> <b>and</b> a set S <b>of</b> three <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> a subset <b>of</b> S with two rules. We prove some general theorems that can help us verify the correctness of these conditions, and discuss the usefulness of our results in program simplification. ...|$|R

5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance <b>of</b> <b>rules,</b> <b>and</b> must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E

5|$|By 1873, {{the college}} {{students}} playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The {{only way to}} score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify {{the first set of}} intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{aspects of}} adult {{attachment}} have been studied. The organization {{and stability of}} the mental working models that underlie the attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment. Developmental psychologists interested in the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes. The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they have a set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We give an {{overview}} of results, presented {{in the form of}} a poster at CSL 03 /KGC, about a general study of the notions <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> derivability <b>and</b> admissibility in Hilbert-style proof systems. The basis of our investigation consists in the concept of “abstract Hilbert system”, a framework for Hilbert-style proof systems in which it is abstracted from the syntax of formulas and the operational content <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b> We Hilbert systems, propose two variant notions <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> derivability, s-derivability <b>and</b> m-derivability, and investigate how these four notions are related. Furthermore, we consider relations that compare abstract Hilbert systems with respect to rule admissibility or with respect to one of the three notions <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> derivability, <b>and</b> study their interrelations. Finally, notions <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> elimination <b>and</b> the notions <b>of</b> <b>rule</b> admissibility <b>and</b> derivability.

This study was conducted at 27 departments in Pekanbaru with 75 respondents. The data were analyzed by using PLS (Partial Least Square) analysis technique, while the method of determining the sample is by using purposive sampling method. The result shows that <b>rule</b> enforcement <b>and</b> morality <b>of</b> apparatus have direct influence toward tendency of accounting fraud. Nonetheless, compensation system <b>and</b> compliance <b>of</b> accounting <b>rules</b> variable do not have influence toward tendency of accounting fraud. The influence of compensation system, compliance <b>of</b> accounting <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> morality <b>of</b> apparatus was significantly affecting the unetichal behavior, but rule enforcement variable does not have influence toward unethical behavior.
