5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting the consent of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the choice is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to some, the {{simplest}} {{explanation is that}} Joseph Smith authored the Book of Mormon himself, without the intentional complicity <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b> One argument for this {{theory is that the}} Book of Mormon reflects Smith's life experiences. There are, for instance, claimed parallels between the tree of life vision in the Book of Mormon and a dream of Joseph Smith, Sr.|$|E
25|$|The War of the Worlds {{presents}} {{itself as a}} factual account of the Martian invasion. The narrator is a middle-class writer of philosophical papers, somewhat reminiscent of Doctor Kemp in The Invisible Man, with characteristics similar to author Wells {{at the time of}} writing. The reader learns very little about the background of the narrator or indeed <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> in the novel; characterisation is unimportant. In fact none of the principal characters are named, aside from the astronomer Ogilvy.|$|E
5000|$|The game also ends {{immediately}} if {{a player}} manages to pop a [...] "Racing Dirigible" [...] while there are two Submarines in his score pile, or a Submarine when there are three Dirigibles in his score pile. In that case, the player who popped the card immediately wins, regardless <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else's</b> score.|$|R

"Father--father," [...] {{interrupted}} Mildred, soothingly, though {{ready to}} sink with shame {{at the idea}} of Admiral Bluewater's being an auditor of such a conversation; [...] "you forget yourself, and overlook my wishes.

50|$|A lone Cylon Raider appears when Adama is suspiciously off-ship. A combat air patrol disarms it, but Col. Tigh deploys a Raptor {{to gather}} data on the enemy. Shortly after, Adama appears with Tigh's estranged wife, Ellen, who {{everyone}} thought {{had died in the}} initial Cylon attacks. Adama is suspicious of her sudden appearance and orders Dr. Baltar to put her blood test ahead <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else's.</b>|$|R
25|$|After the war, Essinger hired Dr. Fridolin Friedmann to be {{headmaster}} of the school, but {{his tenure}} was brief, caused by her interference with his work. In addition, after the war, {{a number of}} the refugee teachers left the school. Already difficult to staff, the situation did not improve after the war; rather, the low salary and remote location made recruitment of new teachers increasingly difficult. In 1948, her eyesight failing badly, unable to manage it herself and, according to some, unable to conceive <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> running the school, Essinger closed Bunce Court School.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} flood, a {{campaign}} arose for Scouts across the United States to voluntarily send CARE packages {{in order to}} help comfort the family and friends of Alden Brock or the staff at Philmont Scout Ranch. These CARE packages could either have been sent to Philmont, to the home of the Brock family, or to the homes <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> with a connection to Alden. Additionally, another fundraiser was created in California by Troop 380 exclusively for the Brock family, which is sometimes referred to as the Brock Fund.|$|E
25|$|Flipnote Studio was {{developed}} by Yoshiaki Koizumi and Hideaki Shimizu. The two began working on the project without the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> at Nintendo EAD Tokyo. It was initially designed {{as a tool for}} taking notes with the name Moving Notepad, and it was considered early on as a possible WiiWare application to transmit these notes from a DS to the Wii to be shared with other users of the application. When the Nintendo DSi was announced, it was decided by Nintendo president Satoru Iwata that the company would work with Hatena, as the latter had recently shifted its R department to Kyoto, where Nintendo Corporate Labs is located.|$|E

25|$|If {{we accept}} pains as special qualia known {{absolutely}} but exclusively by the solitary minds that perceive them, {{this may be}} taken to ground a Cartesian view {{of the self and}} consciousness. Our consciousness, of pains anyway, would seem unassailable. Against this, one might acknowledge the absolute fact of one's own pain, but claim skepticism about the existence <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else's</b> pains. Alternatively, one might take a behaviorist line and claim that our pains are merely neurological stimulations accompanied by a disposition to behave.|$|R
25|$|The afternoon's final {{qualifying}} session {{took place}} in similar good weather conditions to the morning's running. The Ligier drivers {{were the first to}} set quick times, and then the leading drivers began to complete their first runs: Schumacher took provisional pole position with a time of 1:23.139, set twentyminutes into the session, and Berger went 0.5seconds to move up to third. Five minutes later, Hill lowered the benchmark to 1:23.294; Schumacher responded with a time of 1:22.742 eight minutes afterwards; and then Hill put pole position beyond the reach <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> after completing a lap in 1:22.115. Schumacher was unable to improve his time on his final run, and then Hill trimmed the pole time to 1:21.952 with his own last effort of the session. It was a dominant performance from the Williams team leader, who went fastest in each of the circuit's three timing sectors, and set three distinct lap times which were all faster than Schumacher's best. Whilst Hill was delighted with his performance, Schumacher found that his Benetton was more difficult to control, and he blamed the disruptive effect of his collision with Frentzen in the morning session for the 0.8second gap between him and Hill.|$|E
25|$|BMF and the Penan tribe {{tried to}} search for Manser without any success. Areas around the Limbang river were searched by the Penan people. Penan {{expedition}} teams tracked Manser to his last sleeping place. They followed Manser's machete cuts into the thick forests until the trail reached the swamp {{at the foot of}} Bukit Batu Lawi. There was no trace of him in the swamp, going back from the swamp, or trace <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> coming into the area. BMF sent a helicopter to circle the limestone pinnacles. However, none of the search teams were willing to scale the last 100 metres of steep limestone that formed the peak of Batu Lawi. It is possible that Manser fell {{down the side of the}} mountain but neither his body nor his belongings have been found. However, two local guides who brought Manser across the jungles of Sarawak were found. In desperation, fortune tellers and Penan necromancers were called. All of them agreed Bruno Manser was still alive. On 18 November 2000, BMF requested that the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) search for Bruno Manser. Investigations were carried out at the Swiss Consulate in Kuala Lumpur and the Swiss Honoarary Consulate in Kuching.|$|E

Reich toasted: [...] "To a bride who moves at a velocity that exceeds that <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> in Washington, and a groom who moves at a velocity that exceeds 17,000 miles per hour."

It was said that Charles once expressed a great desire to break his father's watch and was not restrained or punished when he duly smashed it on the floor. On another occasion, when Henry had promised his son that he could watch the demolition of a wall on his estate and found that it had already been destroyed, he ordered the workmen to rebuild the wall and demolish it again, with Charles watching.|$|E

50|$|In {{precision}} or exact-prediction games, {{all players}} choose their winning condition independently: to win precisely a predicted number of tricks (Oh Hell) or card points (Differenzler). Each player's bid stands (in partnership games the partners' bids are often combined), and each player or partnership then {{tries to take}} exactly the number of tricks or points they bid, and are rewarded or penalized for doing so independently <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else's</b> success or failure in meeting their bid. This type of game began to mature in the 20th century. Other games generally falling into the exact-prediction category are Spades and Ninety-Nine.|$|R

[...] Kent said, [...] "As the character Lofty was being developed, we couldn't think <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> to better to play him.

2500|$|Head {{designed}} the FW07 for the [...] season with Frank Dernie {{picking up the}} aerodynamic development and skirt design. This was the team's first ground effect car, a technology first introduced by Colin Chapman and Team Lotus. Williams also obtained membership of the Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA) which expressed a preference for teams to run two cars, so Jones was partnered by Swiss driver Clay Regazzoni. It {{was not until the}} seventh round of the championship, the , that they achieved a points-scoring position. Regazzoni came close to taking the team's first win but finished second, less than a second behind race winner Jody Scheckter. The next round at Dijon is remembered for the final lap battle between René Arnoux and Gilles Villeneuve, but also saw both cars finish in the points for the first time; Jones was fourth with Regazzoni sixth. The team's first win came at the – their home Grand Prix– when Regazzoni finished almost 25 seconds ahead <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{the death}} of Howard Anthony in 1954, Heath was bought by Daystrom Company, a {{management}} holding company that also owned several other electronics companies. Daystrom was absorbed by oilfield service company Schlumberger Limited in 1962, and the Daystrom/Schlumberger days were Heathkit's most successful. Those years saw some [...] "firsts" [...] in the general consumer market. The early 60s saw {{the introduction of the}} AA-100 integrated amplifier. This was a unit of reliable quality (and affordable) that was produced several years before any other major hi-fi company produced anything comparable. The early 70s saw Heath introduce the AJ-1510, an FM tuner using digital synthesis, and the GC-1005 digital clock. Again, these components were quality products and were produced well ahead <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> in the industry. In 1974, Heathkit started [...] "Heathkit Educational Systems", which expanded their manuals' clear writing style into general electronics and computer training materials. Heathkit also expanded their expertise into digital and, eventually, computerized equipment, producing among other things digital clocks and weather stations with the new technology.|$|E

2500|$|Edging {{closer and}} without {{reference}} {{points in the}} whiteout they realised they had got very close to a person {{on their hands and}} knees – Davidson was still up on the plateau trying to crawl for help. [...] away, the closest they could manage, two crew were unloaded but after they had reached the casualty they could not carry her to the helicopter because her legs were locked in a kneeling position. The helicopter could get no closer because when it applied power the blowing snow obliterated vision so one of the crew jumped out to lead it in the right direction using the winch wire. There was no sign <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> from Davidson's group. Davidson was taken by helicopter to Aviemore where she was met by ambulance. She was in the advanced stages of hypothermia and her hands were frozen solid but, although she was confused and barely able to speak, she managed to let her rescuers know {{that the rest of the}} party was close to where she had been rescued.|$|E

Sarah believed {{that she had a}} right to enforce her political advice, whether Anne personally liked it or not, and became angry if she stubbornly refused to take it. She seems to have underestimated Anne's strength of character, continuing to believe she could dominate a woman whom foreign Ambassadors noted had become [...] "very determined and quite ferocious". Apart from her notorious bad temper, Sarah's main weakness has been described as [...] "an almost pathological inability to admit the validity <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>else's</b> point <b>of</b> view".|$|R
