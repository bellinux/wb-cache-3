Some network operators do not have their own radio access network at all. These are called mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) and are marked in the tables as such.

50|$|In {{response}} to the European migrant crisis the Swedish government mandated ID checks on all trains coming from Denmark from December 2015. As checks performed by the Swedish police took up to 20 minutes per train, timetables were severely disrupted. Beginning on 4 January 2016, transport operators would be fined if any improperly documented people {{were found to be}} brought into Sweden. As a result, DSB has restructured the timetable, constructed a fence between the platforms at CPH Airport station, and introduced its own ID checks in order to gain entrance to the Malmö-bound platform at CPH Airport station. The frequency of trains across the bridge has been reduced to a maximum of 3 tph. Apart from the reduced frequency, services from Sweden to Denmark run as usual to Helsingør during the day and Østerport in the evenings, with no ID checks entering Denmark. In the reverse direction, these services terminate at København H and run empty to CPH Airport, where they pick up passengers after the <b>operator</b> <b>ID</b> check to proceed to Swedish destinations. To travel from København H to CPH Airport, passengers can use the Copenhagen Metro or a 3tph shuttle between CPH Airport and Nivå (which runs to Helsingør at a lower frequency in the evenings when trains from Sweden do not go that far). This shuttle reverses on the Danish-bound platform at CPH Airport, and maintains a 6tph service north of København H.|$|E

30|$|As is {{commonly}} {{the case in}} production databases, we assume a query plan to be left-deep. In a left-deep query plan, a join takes two inputs: one from a single base relation (i.e. table) providing immediate input (referred to as the “inner relation”); and another one potentially derived as an intermediate result from {{a different set of}} relations (the “outer relation”). The identity of the inner relation and the set of tables comprising the outer relation uniquely determine the estimated best cost for an individual join operator. This is true regardless of the in which the outer relation was derived [11]. For convenience in our presentation, we call this information the operator’s id, because we use it to represent an operator in the BIP. For example, the root operator in Figure  9 a takes accountProfile as an inner input and {holding, account} as an outer input. The operator’s id is then {(holding, account), accountProfile}. We will refer to the union of these two inputs as a join set (the set of tables joined by that operator). For example, the join set of the aforementioned operator is {holding, account, accountProfile}. Notably, while the join sets for the roots of Figure  9 a & b are the same, Figure  9 b’s root node has the <b>operator</b> <b>id</b> {(accountProfile, account), holding} allowing us to differentiate the operators in our BIP formulation. Our task in this section is to collect statistics for the possible join operators with unique ids.|$|E

We conjecture the number of permutations sortable by n − 5 passes, and also {{the form of a}} formula for the general case n − k, which involves a polynomial expression. 1. Background We view permutations as words without repeated letters; if π is a permutation of an n element set and π(i) = πi, then we write π = π 1 [...] . πn. The stack sorting operator S can be defined recursively on permutations of finite subsets of { 1, 2, [...] . } as follows. If π is empty then S(π) = π. If π is nonempty write π as the concatenation π = LnR, where n is the greatest element of π and L and R are the subwords to the left and right of n respectively. Then S(π) = S(L) S(R) n. For example, S(42513) = 24135.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Link Analysis (LA) is a popular ergonomics tool used to study and improve the layout of workspaces (Ferreira and Hignett, 2005); to study abstract relationships, for example between criminals (Harper and Harris, 1975) or ill people (Stuster and Chovil, 1994). It {{can also be used}} as a data (event) recording method to capture interactions to assist the understanding of staff behaviour and interactions with their environment (McDonald and Dzwonczyk, 1988). Currently, most researchers still rely on the manual method to perform LA. However, the traditional pen and paper method is cumbersome, time consuming and gives limited outputs. Since 1964, when Haygood et al. (1964) succeeded in improving the manual method of LA, researchers have been trying to use computer techniques to enhance the performance and increasing efficiency of LA. However, these methods may also have limitations. To address these limitations a Computerised Link Analysis (CLA) system has been developed. The CLA system is not only a computerised LA application (layout creating, event recording and result generating) which is able to reduce the time and effort compared to the manual method, but is also an integrated task analysis tool incorporating traditional LA functions, basic task analysis functions (recording detailed description of operator activities, as components of Hierarchical Task Analysis), and time-motion functions (recording time stamps of operator activities). Additional outputs that are not part of traditional LA comprise time-event lists (start/end time, duration, chronology, additional notes, importance and <b>operator</b> <b>ID),</b> processed link diagrams (with the link direction and frequency), as well as the conventional LA results of link diagrams and link tables. The CLA system was developed in four phases, including pre-test developments (CLA v 1. 01 -v 1. 05) and post-test developments (CLA v 1. 05 - v 1. 12). The pre-test developments are also called early software developments, iv and in this phase, the system was developed according to the specifications which were produced based on the limitations of LA and other computer-aided LA methods. Then three iterative tests were designed to test the functions of the system to make sure it performs reliably under both laboratory and real world conditions: The Technical Validation Test (CLA v 1. 05 -v 1. 08) was carried out in a laboratory environment, aiming to ensure that the software and hardware for the CLA system worked technically and that the outputs achieved an acceptable level of accuracy (reliability testing and debugging). The Usability Test (CLA v 1. 08 -v 1. 11) was carried out in a laboratory environment, aiming to test the software and hardware by observing the performance of 12 system operators as they used CLA, collecting user feedback after the test, and identifying possible improvements from users. The beta test (CLA v 1. 11 -v 1. 12) was carried out in a field environment, aiming to make sure the faults identified in the Technical Validation and Usability tests were fixed; to review real-time data recording and analysis abilities and identify further improvements by using the CLA system in a complex real-life environment, Emergency Department (ED) at an UK hospital.

40|$|We {{describe}} the classical Schwinger model as {{a study of}} the projective modules over the algebra of complex-valued functions on the sphere. On these modules, classified by π 2 (S 2), we construct hermitian connections with values in the universal differential envelope which leads us to the Schwinger model on the sphere. The Connes-Lott program is then applied using the Hilbert space of complexified inhomogeneous forms with its Atiyah-Kähler structure. This Hilbert space splits in two minimal left ideals of the Clifford algebra preserved by the Dirac-Kähler <b>operator</b> D = <b>i(d</b> − δ). The induced representation of the universal differential envelope, in order to recover its differential structure, is divided by the unwanted differential ideal and the obtained quotient is the usual complexified de Rham exterior algebra over the sphere with Clifford action on the ”spinors ” of the Hilbert space. The subsequent steps of the Connes-Lott program allow to define a matter action, and the field action is obtained using the Dixmier trace which reduces to the integral of the curvature squared.
