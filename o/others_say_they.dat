5|$|During {{a mission}} which {{occurred}} on a disputed date, either 23 January or 25 January, Overton and his squadron commander, ace Edwin L. Heller flew {{north of the}} Yalu River in search of MiG formations. Heller and Overton both shot down aircraft, some sources say {{this was one of}} Overton's first five victories, while <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> were his sixth and seventh, for which he never received credit, but Heller was struck by a MiG and crashed. He was either 60 or 150 miles north of the Yalu River line, so a rescue attempt was not made. This was later seen as one of the reasons Overton was singled out for reprimand for crossing the Yalu River. Most sources attribute Overton with only five victories.|$|E
5|$|The army group's {{previous}} commander, Georg von Küchler, had {{pleaded for}} permission to withdraw to the Panther Line in Estonia, which was still only half-completed at that stage. Model immediately cracked down on such talk, instituting a new policy he called Shield and Sword (Schild und Schwert). Under this doctrine, ground would only temporarily be ceded, to gather reserves for an immediate counter-attack that would drive the Red Army back and relieve pressure on {{other areas of the}} front. These statements of aggressive intent won over Hitler and OKH, who had no substantial reserves to send him, but were still unwilling to lose territory. Historians have since debated their significance, some claiming that Shield and Sword was Hitler's invention, while <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> were a calculated ploy by Model to disguise his true intent—to pull back to the Panther Line.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} consequences of guilds {{have led to}} heated debates among economic historians. On the one side, scholars say that since merchant guilds persisted over long periods {{they must have been}} efficient institutions (since inefficient institutions die out). <b>Others</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> persisted not because they benefited the entire economy but because they benefited the owners, who used political power to protect them. Ogilvie (2011) says they regulated trade for their own benefit, were monopolies, distorted markets, fixed prices, and restricted entrance into the guild. Ogilvie (2008) argues that their long apprenticeships were unnecessary to acquire skills, and their conservatism reduced the rate of innovation and made the society poorer. She says their main goal was rent seeking, that is, to shift money to the membership {{at the expense of the}} entire economy.|$|E
500|$|Faust was {{initially}} hired by Hasbro {{to create a}} pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization. Faust said she was [...] "extremely skeptical" [...] about taking the job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys to be boring and unrelatable. My Little Pony {{was one of her}} favorite childhood toys, but she was disappointed that her imagination at the time was nothing like the animated shows, in which the characters, according to Faust, [...] "just had endless tea parties, giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying". With the chance to work on My Little Pony, she hoped to prove that [...] "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she incorporated into the design of the characters and the show many elements that contradicted idealized stereotypes of girls, such as diverse personalities, the message that friends can be different and can get into arguments but still be friends, and the idea that girls should not be limited by what <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> can or cannot do. Elements of the characters' personalities and the show's settings were based on her own childhood imagination of the ponies' adventures, in part inspired by the animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up, such as Transformers and she considered that she was making Friendship Is Magic [...] "for me as an eight-year-old". Faust still aimed for the characters to be [...] "relatable" [...] characters, using stereotypical [...] "icons of girliness" [...] (such as the waif or the bookworm) in order to broaden the appeal of the characters for the young female audience.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common reasons {{reported}} for sexually harassing behavior is because the harasser thinks it is funny to do so. In their 2006 study, the AAUW found that this was the most common rationale for harassment by boys—59 percent used it. Less than one-fifth (17%) of those boys who admitted to harassing <b>others</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> did so because they wanted a date with the person. (AAUW, 2006) Other researchers assert that the [...] "I thought it was funny" [...] rationale is a fallacy, and the true reasons align more with that of a need to assert power and induce fear in others—more in line with bullying. These hazing behaviors develop in school, continue in high school and college, eventually moving into the workplace. (Boland, 2002) ...|$|E

During the show, the chairman of the GPB board of trustees, Levan Gakheladze, announced that a divided board had voted to suspend the show pending further consideration. Comments from trustees and critics revealed deep divisions between supporters and opponents of the church's stance — some decrying church interference, <b>others</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> could not ignore insistences from church leaders, and one board member stating that [...] "The opinion of the Patriarch II is more important for me than the law." ...|$|R

The latter was generally torn in a fantastic manner at the elbows, skirts, and collars, and fastened with every variety of button, tape, and string. Their weapons were the caubeen, the alpeen, and the doodeen of the country--the latter a short but dreadful weapon of offence. At {{the demise of the}} venerable Theobald Mathew, the nation had laid aside its habit of temperance, and universal intoxication betokened their grief; it became afterwards their constant habit. Thus do men ever return to the haunts of their childhood: such a power has fond memory over us!
