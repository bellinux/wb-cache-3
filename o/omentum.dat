5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the <b>omentum</b> may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{rationalization}} of mesenteric and peritoneal fold anatomy {{permits the}} surgeon to differentiate both from intraperitoneal adhesionsâ€”also called congenital adhesions. These are highly variable among patients and occur in several locations. Congenital adhesions occur between the lateral {{aspect of the}} peritoneum overlying the mobile component of the mesosigmoid, and the parietal peritoneum in the left iliac fossa. During lateral to medial approach of mobilizing of the mesosigmoid, these must be divided first before the peritoneum proper can be accessed. Similarly, focal adhesions occur between the undersurface of the greater <b>omentum</b> and the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. These can be accessed after dividing the peritoneal fold that links the greater <b>omentum</b> and transverse colon. Adhesions here must be divided to separate the greater <b>omentum</b> off the transverse mesocolon, thus allowing access to the lesser sac proper.|$|E
25|$|From {{its upper}} part, it joins {{to the neck}} of the {{pancreas}} at a well-marked prominence, the omental tuber, which abuts the lesser <b>omentum.</b> Its right edge is marked by a groove for the gastroduodenal artery.|$|E
25|$|Interposed {{between the}} hepatic and splenic flexures, the greater <b>omentum</b> adheres to the {{transverse}} colon along a further band or fold of peritoneum. Dissection through this allows {{access to the}} cephalad (top) surface of the transverse mesocolon. Focal adhesions frequently tether the greater <b>omentum</b> to the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. The left colon {{is associated with a}} similar anatomic configuration of peritoneal folds; the splenic peritoneal fold is contiguous with the left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold at the splenic flexure. Division of the latter similarly allows for the separation of the left colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and frees it from the retroperitoneum. The left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold continues distally at the lateral aspect of the mobile component of the mesosigmoid.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of adhesions {{begins with}} good {{surgical}} technique to minimize {{trauma to the}} tissue and thus reparative responses by the body. Several drugs and substances are {{used to try to}} prevent adhesion formation. Preoperative use of DMSO, a free radical scavenger, potassium penicillin, and flunixin meglumine may be given. The thick intestinal lubricant carboxymethylcellulose is often applied to the GI tract intraoperatively, to decrease trauma from handling by the surgeon and provide a physical barrier between the intestine and adjacent intestinal loops or abdominal organs. It has been shown to double the survival rate of horses, and its use is now a standard practice. Hyaluraonan {{can also be used to}} produce a physical barrier. Intraperitoneal unfractionated heparin is sometimes used, since it decreases fibrin formation and thus may decrease fibrinous adhesions. Omentectomy (removal of the <b>omentum)</b> is a quick, simple procedure that also greatly decreases the risk of adhesions, since the <b>omentum</b> is one organ that commonly adheres to the intestines. The abdomen is usually lavaged copiously before the abdomen is sutured closed, and anti-inflammatories are given postoperatively. A laparoscope may be used post-surgery to look for and break down adhesions, however there is risk of additional adhesions forming post-procedure. Encouraging motility post-surgery can also be useful, as it decreases the contact time between tissues. Adhesion-induced colic has a poor prognosis, with a 16% survival rate in one study.|$|E
25|$|The {{mesentery}} of {{the small}} intestine arises from {{the root of the}} mesentery (or mesenteric root) and is the part connected with the structures in front of the vertebral column. The root is narrow, about 15cm long, 20cm in width, and is directed obliquely from the duodenojejunal flexure at {{the left side of the}} second lumbar vertebra to the right sacroiliac articulation. The root of the mesentery extends from the duodenojejunal flexure to the ileocaecal junction. This section {{of the small}} intestine is located centrally in the abdominal cavity and lies behind the transverse colon and the greater <b>omentum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, several hoax {{web sites}} have {{appeared}} on the Internet purporting to describe the world's first pregnant man. While sometimes relying on legitimate scientific claims, in reality, no such experiment has ever been reported. Fertility clinician Cecil Jacobson claimed to have transplanted a fertilized egg from a female baboon to the <b>omentum</b> in the abdominal cavity of a male baboon in the mid-1960s, which then carried the fetus for four months; however, Jacobson did not publish his claims in a scientific journal, and was subsequently convicted on several unrelated counts of fraud for ethical misconduct.|$|E
25|$|Metastasis in {{ovarian cancer}} {{is very common}} in the abdomen, and occurs via exfoliation, where cancer cells burst through the ovarian capsule {{and are able to}} move freely {{throughout}} the peritoneal cavity. Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the <b>omentum</b> and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the lymphatic system and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the infundibulopelvic ligament, the broad ligament, and the round ligament. The most commonly affected groups include the paraaortic, hypogastric, external iliac, obturator, and inguinal lymph nodes. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian {{cancer is}} staged using the FIGO staging system and uses {{information}} obtained after surgery, which can include a total abdominal hysterectomy via midline laparotomy, removal of (usually) both ovaries and Fallopian tubes, (usually) the <b>omentum,</b> pelvic (peritoneal) washings, assessment of retroperitoneal lymph nodes (including the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes), appendectomy in suspected mucinous tumors, and pelvic/peritoneal biopsies for cytopathology. Around 30% of ovarian cancers that appear {{confined to the}} ovary have metastasized microscopically, which is why even stage-I cancers must be staged completely. 22% of cancers presumed to be stage I are observed to have lymphatic metastases. The AJCC stage {{is the same as}} the FIGO stage. The AJCC staging system describes the extent of the primary tumor (T), the absence or presence of metastasis to nearby lymph nodes (N), and the absence or presence of distant metastasis (M). The most common stage at diagnosis is stage IIIc, with over 70% of diagnoses.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the first}} good {{description}} of the sphenoid bone, he showed that the sternum consists of three portions and the sacrum of five or six; and described accurately the vestibule {{in the interior of}} the temporal bone. He not only verified the observation of Etienne on the valves of the hepatic veins, but he described the vena azygos, and discovered the canal which passes in the fetus between the umbilical vein and the vena cava, since named ductus venosus. He described the <b>omentum,</b> and its connections with the stomach, the spleen and the colon; gave the first correct views {{of the structure of the}} pylorus; observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man; gave the first good account of the mediastinum and pleura and the fullest {{description of the}} anatomy of the brain yet advanced. He did not understand the inferior recesses; and his account of the nerves is confused by regarding the optic as the first pair, the third as the fifth and the fifth as the seventh.|$|E
2500|$|An Air Force flight surgeon, Major Barry Armstrong, {{examined}} {{the body and}} judged the death [...] "suspicious", suggesting that Arush had been lying prone on the ground when he was killed. He {{also noted that the}} amount of <b>omentum</b> which had passed through the first wounds suggested the 29-year-old Arush had been breathing for at least 2 or 3 minutes before the final gunshots to his head were fired.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transverse}} colon {{is the part}} of the colon from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure (the turn of the colon by the spleen). The {{transverse colon}} hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold of peritoneum [...] called the greater <b>omentum.</b> On the posterior side, the transverse colon is connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the transverse mesocolon.|$|E
2500|$|Implantation sites can be {{anywhere}} in the abdomen but can include the peritoneum outside of the uterus, the rectouterine pouch (culdesac of Douglas), <b>omentum,</b> bowel and its mesentery, mesosalpinx, and the peritoneum of the pelvic wall and the abdominal wall. The growing placenta may be attached to several organs including tube and ovary. [...] Rare other sites have been the liver and spleen, giving rise to a hepatic pregnancy or splenic pregnancy, respectively. Even an early diaphragmatic pregnancy has been described in a patient where an embryo began growing {{on the underside of}} the diaphragm.|$|E
2500|$|Surgery {{has been}} the {{standard}} of care for decades and may be necessary in obtaining a specimen for diagnosis. [...] The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby {{invasion of other tissues}} by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may [...] remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the <b>omentum</b> (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.|$|E
2500|$|Ovarian cancer {{metastasize}}s {{early in}} its development, often before {{it has been}} diagnosed. High-grade tumors metastasize more readily than low-grade tumors. Typically, tumor cells begin to metastasize by growing in the peritoneal cavity. More than 60% of women presenting with ovarian cancer have stage-III or stage-IV cancer, when it has already spread beyond the ovaries. Ovarian cancers shed cells into the naturally occurring fluid within the abdominal cavity. These cells can then implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, including the uterus, urinary bladder, bowel, [...] lining of the bowel wall, and <b>omentum,</b> forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected.|$|E
2500|$|Mast cell {{tumors are}} an {{uncommon}} occurrence in horses. [...] They usually occur as benign, solitary masses {{on the skin}} of the head, neck, trunk, and legs. [...] Mineralization of the tumor is common. [...] In pigs and cattle, mast cell tumors are rare. [...] They tend to be solitary and benign in pigs and multiple and malignant in cattle. [...] Mast cell tumors are found in the skin of cattle most commonly, but these may be metastases from tumors of the viscera. [...] Other sites in cattle include the spleen, muscle, gastrointestinal tract, <b>omentum,</b> and uterus.|$|E
2500|$|In humans, {{the stomach}} lies between the {{oesophagus}} and the duodenum (the {{first part of}} the small intestine). It is in the left upper part of the abdominal cavity. The top of the stomach lies against the diaphragm. Lying behind the stomach is the pancreas. A large double fold of visceral peritoneum called the greater <b>omentum</b> hangs down from the greater curvature of the stomach. Two sphincters keep the contents of the stomach contained; the lower oesophageal sphincter [...] (found in the cardiac region), at the junction of the oesophagus and stomach, and the pyloric sphincter at the junction of the stomach with the duodenum.|$|E
5000|$|The greater <b>omentum</b> (also {{the great}} <b>omentum,</b> <b>omentum</b> majus, gastrocolic <b>omentum,</b> epiploon, or, {{especially}} in animals, caul) {{is a large}} apron-like fold of visceral peritoneum that hangs down from the stomach. It extends from the greater curvature of the stomach, passing {{in front of the}} small intestines and doubles back to ascend to the transverse colon before reaching to the posterior abdominal wall. The greater <b>omentum</b> is larger than the lesser <b>omentum,</b> which hangs down from the liver to the lesser curvature. The common anatomical term [...] "epiploic" [...] derives from [...] "epiploon", from the Greek epipleein, meaning to float or sail on, since the greater <b>omentum</b> appears to float {{on the surface of the}} intestines. It is the first structure observed when the abdominal cavity is opened anteriorly.|$|E
50|$|The lesser <b>omentum</b> (small <b>omentum</b> or gastrohepatic <b>omentum)</b> is {{the double}} layer of {{peritoneum}} that {{extends from the}} liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach (hepatogastric ligament) and {{the first part of}} the duodenum (hepatoduodenal ligament).|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{organs and}} {{structures}} in the body {{are more prone to}} adhesion formation than others. The <b>omentum</b> is particularly susceptible to adhesion formation; one study found that 92% of post-operative adhesions were found in the <b>omentum.</b> It appears that the <b>omentum</b> is the chief organ responsible for [...] "spontaneous" [...] adhesions (i.e. no prior history of surgery). In another study, 100% of spontaneous adhesion formations were associated with the <b>omentum.</b>|$|E
