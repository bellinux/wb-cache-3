In order/disorder phase transitions of crystalline solids isotope effects are known {{to play an important role}} [1]. But in studies of glass-forming liquids it is often tacitly assumed that such effects are negligible. This is surprising in view of the fact that isotope labeling is a much used tool in studies dealing with soft condensed matter when employing nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (NMR) as well as other experimental techniques [2]. There are only a few reports where either anomalous [3] or else effectively missing [4] isotope effects have provided important insights into the dynamics of the amorphous state. On the other hand, isotope shifts of melting points, Tm, particularly those emerging from proton vs. deuteron substitution are on the order of 0. 5 - 5 K as documented for a large number of substances [1]. The calorimetric glass transition temperature, Tg, for many families of glass formers is related to Tm via the empirical relationship $T_{m}/T_{g} approx 1. 5 $ [5]. This rule thus rationalizes the observation of corresponding Tg shifts detected in adiabatic calorimetry studies [6].

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulation results on the small-molecule glass former <b>ortho-terphenyl</b> (OTP). The data can be described well using the coupling model of relaxation. The dynamic susceptibility calculated from the density-density time correlation function is shown to approximately conform to the scaling laws of mode coupling theory. Since the dynamic singularities of mode coupling theory are absent in the coupling model, both approaches to high frequency structural relaxation cannot be correct; the conformance to mode coupling theory indicates the non-uniqueness of mode coupling theory interpretation of data from fragile liquids. The non-cooperative relaxation time for density fluctuations in OTP is found {{to have the same}} activation energy as the shear viscosity in the high temperature limit. This illustrates the relationship between microscopic dynamic variables and the short time behavior of macroscopic properties, when the former are analyzed according to the coupling model.

The contributions of the internal and structural relaxations to the phonon damping can be separated using high pressure, due to their very different pressure dependences.

The softer liquids have markedly higher entropies and lower Kauzmann temperatures than their Lennard-Jones counterparts, and remain diffusive down to appreciably lower temperatures.

Measurements of the [superscript 1]H T[subscript 1] and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments showed the crystallization process led to phase separation of the polarization agent, creating an inhomogeneous distribution of radicals within the sample. Consequently, the effective radical concentration was decreased in the bulk OTP phase, and long-range [superscript 1]H–[superscript 1]H spin diffusion was the main polarization propagation mechanism.
