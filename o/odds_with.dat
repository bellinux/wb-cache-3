5|$|Although Pericles was a {{main source}} of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic {{literary}} style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style. This might, however, {{be the result of}} the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.|$|E
5|$|As Chief Minister, Modi favoured {{privatisation}} {{and small}} government, {{which was at}} <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> {{the philosophy of the}} RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth 6.6trillion were signed.|$|E
40|$|We have recalculated the {{summarised}} <b>odds</b> ratios, <b>with</b> 95 % {{confidence intervals}} (CIs), {{for the relationship}} between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and lung cancer based on the odds ratios for the individual epidemiological studies given in the Environmen-tal Protection Agency Report in 1992. Using DerSimonian’s method, the summarised <b>odds</b> ratio, <b>with</b> 95 % CI, for all the studies combined was estimated as 1. 28 (1. 13, 1. 46). This method was used as the odds ratios for the individual studies indicated heterogeneity. This heterogeneity may arise because of differences in factors such as socio-economic status, hous-ing or occupational environment among the countries where the epidemiological studies were carried out. If so, the summarised odds ratio for all the studies combined may not be an important parameter. Using Sugita’s method, which enables us to eliminate publication bias indirectly, the summarised <b>odds</b> ratio, <b>with</b> 95 % CI, for the 11 studies in the USA was estimated as 1. 11 (0. 97, 1. 28). Without eliminating publication bias, the value was 1. 19 (1. 01, 1. 38). Including odds ratios from two new studies, the summarised odds ratio for the USA was found to be nearly equal to the value with publication bias eliminated. The <b>odds</b> ratios, <b>with</b> 95 % CIs, summarised above do not demonstrate whether or not ETS is a significant risk factor for lung cancer. The association between ETS and lung cancer is certainly weak...|$|R

5|$|As well as Groening, Simon {{was often}} at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Brooks and {{production}} company Gracie Films. While working on The Simpsons, he and Brooks had co-created the series Sibs (1991) and Phenom (1993) {{as part of}} a multi-series deal for ABC. Simon did not want to work on either series, both of which were poorly received and swiftly canceled, which put a strain on the pair's relationship.|$|E
5|$|Bede's scriptural commentaries {{employed}} the allegorical {{method of interpretation}} and his history includes accounts of miracles, which to modern historians has seemed at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> his critical approach to the materials in his history.

5|$|Brown's {{views on}} the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP {{consensus}} placed him at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> some of his fellow Republicans and prominent Tea Party conservatives, including Glenn Beck.

5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> {{the realities of the}} impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{declined}} {{the invitation to}} become a Royal Academician in 1942, having previously been nominated, but refused because of his connection to Epstein.

5|$|In 1912 Shaw {{invested}} £1,000 for a one-fifth {{share in}} the Webbs' new publishing venture, a socialist weekly magazine called the New Statesman, which appeared in April 1913. He became a founding director, publicist, and in due course a contributor, mostly anonymously. He was soon at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the magazine's editor, Clifford Sharp, who by 1916 was rejecting his contributions—"the only paper {{in the world that}} refuses to print anything by me", according to Shaw.|$|E
50|$|Association Tornado Zadar mostly {{supports}} basketball club KK Zadar, {{but also}} soccer club NK Zadar {{as well as}} other sport teams from Zadar. It is accustomed that any match of the KK Zadar is followed by a group of Tornado supporters. They don't have exact rivalry (although some see Šibenski funcuti group from Šibenik as their rivals) but they are <b>with</b> <b>odds</b> mostly <b>with</b> clubs from Zagreb, or internationally from Serbia and their respective ultras. Throughout the era of former Yugoslavia the tensions were high on matches with KK Crvena Zvezda.|$|R
30|$|Odds ratio {{can also}} be used in the {{interpretation}} of the developed model. The odds ratio is defined as the ratio of the <b>odds</b> of those <b>with</b> the risk factor to the odds for those without the risk factor. Generally, the <b>odds</b> ratio associated <b>with</b> a one-unit increase in the risk factor can be computed by the exponential function of the regression coefficient of that risk factor [19].|$|R

5|$|In {{the state}} {{legislative}} elections of 1830, the ascendent Whig Party {{gained control of}} both houses of the General Assembly. Rowan's strict adherence to Jeffersonian democracy and leadership of the New Court faction during the court controversy of the 1820s had put him at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Whig founder Henry Clay. By this time, however, not even Rowan's fellow Democrats endorsed his re-election. Henry Clay was elected instead.|$|E
5|$|Japanese theatre styles {{have been}} applied to The Tempest. In 1988 and again in 1992 Yukio Ninagawa brought his version of The Tempest to the UK. It was staged as a {{rehearsal}} of a Noh drama, with a traditional Noh theatre {{at the back of}} the stage, but also using elements which were at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Noh conventions. In 1992, Minoru Fujita presented a Bunraku (Japanese puppet) version in Osaka and at the Tokyo Globe.|$|E

5|$|Moon further {{strengthened}} {{the reversal of}} traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums. His style was at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the hi-hat, and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.|$|E
5|$|Music {{critics have}} {{frequently}} {{commented on the}} recurring theme in Britten's operas from Peter Grimes onward of the isolated individual at <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> a hostile society. The extent to which this reflected Britten's perception of himself, pacifist and homosexual, in the England of the 1930s, 40s and 50s is debated. Another recurrent theme is the corruption of innocence, most sharply seen in The Turn of the Screw.|$|E
