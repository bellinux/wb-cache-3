To support teachers <b>of</b> mathematically <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> students to find appropriate solutions, several innovative projects were conducted in schools using funds provided by the New Brunswick, Canada, Department of Education. This article presents one such initiative: a collaborative project we developed with two middle school teachers to enrich the mathematical experience of their most advanced students. We worked with 40 students from both schools, involving them in creating mathematics problems using multimedia tools for the CAMI (Communauté d’apprentissages multidisciplinaires interactifs) 1 website. We analyzed {{the richness of the}} problems created by the participants (Manuel, 2010), as well as students’ perceptions of their experiences, collected through semi-structured interviews. Students appreciated the experience, and recommended that the project be continued in following years. Most of the problems created by students were moderately rich, and included multiple steps, but were similar to those used in classrooms. Some students stated that they were more comfortable solving problems than creating new ones, which suggested that they found the task challenging. Our results showed that specific programs for students interested in mathematics could provide positive experiences and challenges. Our research also suggested that problem posing in mathematics classrooms needs to be investigated in more depth...|$|R

40|$|This study {{uses the}} New Zealand primary school setting, {{to attempt to}} {{identify}} giftedness and talent, and the behaviours identified by Whitmore (1980) as those associated with underachievement in these able students. The researcher trials one method for identifying able students in the New Zealand context using data already collected in New Zealand schools. The Enrichment Triad (Renzulli, 1997) is used to devise an intervention to gauge possible reversal effects in the presence <b>of</b> underachievement in <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> students. This study is written {{at a time when}} New Zealand schools are preparing themselves to meet the new requirements of the National Administration Guidelines (NAGs) that must be implemented by 2005. These guidelines specifically charge schools with demonstrating their ability to meet the needs <b>of</b> their <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> students. Within this population the author contends, there is a subgroup of able student who are underachieving. The reasons for the underachievement are varied and well evidenced in overseas literature (Siegel & Reis, 2003; Laycook, 1979; Rimm, 1986; Clark, 1992; Butler-Por, 1987). What is needed, the author contends, is a consistent approach to identifying these <b>gifted,</b> underachieving students, <b>and</b> an individualised plan based on student interests, for beginning the reversal of this underachievement...|$|R
40|$|What {{do we want}} to know? Which {{types of}} classroom-based {{interventions}} improve the educational achievement of pupils identified as <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented?</b> What was our focus? There is an expectation that all English schools and local authorities support the education of pupils identified as <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented.</b> In part, these requirements are a response to parents and schools requesting greater help in meeting the needs of these pupils. The validity and urgency of these concerns was confirmed by those government inspections which reported that sufficient challenge for <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils was uncommon in many mainstream schools (Hansard 1999, Freeman 1998). What did we find? The review supports the use of personalised learning and differentiation. There was evidence in favour of the appropriate use of streaming, differentiated provision within mixed ability classes, and individualised programmes. However, effective provision within mixed ability classes presumes a positive classroom climate. The quality and character of group interactions was identified as a significant factor in the effectiveness <b>of</b> support for <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils. There was evidence that collaborative and group activities helped <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils perform better at some tasks. The role of the teacher was highlighted as especially important in promoting and maintaining positive group work. Studies indicated that enrichment programmes that help <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils develop self-regulation and higher order thinking skills had a positive effect on their achievement and engagement. What are the implications? The review endorses the policy of focusing support for <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils in mainstream settings. The Classroom Quality Standards materials, which emphasise personalised, differentiated learning, are therefore generally well-placed to offer specific guidance. It is suggested that the Classroom Quality Standards take account of the review findings in future manifestations, especially emphasising the importance of class organisation, group interaction and enrichment strategies that develop skills such as self-regulation and higher order thinking. Teachers and schools should be cautious about over-generalising, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> treating <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils as a homogeneous group. It is vital to be sensitive to individual needs and the mediating effects of the teacher, the curriculum and the classroom context. Likewise, there is no one strategy or approach to social interaction that will work all of the time with all <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils. Most forms <b>of</b> provision for <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils occur in social settings, and pupils’ abilities to deal with such contexts are likely to be important factors in academic success and personal motivation. The teacher has an important role to play in generating and sustaining contexts for appropriate social interactions. There is an urgent need for funded research focused on English and on educational settings. In particular, studies are needed that explore the distinctive needs <b>of</b> individual <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> pupils, their social interactions and their pedagogies. How did we get these results? In total, 20, 947 studies were identified for screening through systematic searches of 18 bibliographic databases of published literature, specialist websites and hand-searching sources. Of these, 101 studies were included for the mapping stage of the review. After the further revision of the review question and additional exclusion criteria, the remaining 15 studies were subjected to in-depth synthesis...|$|R
