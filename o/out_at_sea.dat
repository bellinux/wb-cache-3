5|$|The six British {{troops on}} board the Infantry Landing Ships, HMS Princess Astrid and HMS Maid of Orleans and the two French troops on LCIs 523 and 527 left the Solent on 5 June 1944. When <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> they were {{informed}} that the invasion {{was going to be}} in Normandy and more specifically Ouistreham.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} the whale was found dead, {{floating}} <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged onto the beach. John Struthers, the Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale {{and had it}} transported to his yard in Dundee. On the first Sunday that it was there, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E
5|$|After a lacuna in the {{manuscript}} of the poem, Hymiskviða abruptly picks up again with Thor and Hymir in a boat, <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Hymir catches a few whales at once, and Thor baits his line {{with the head of}} the ox. Thor casts his line and the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr bites. Thor pulls the serpent on board, and violently slams him in the head with his hammer. Jörmungandr shrieks, and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in {{the manuscript}}.|$|E

5|$|After the cyclone has passed, devastation often continues. Standing {{water can}} cause the spread of disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed, hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward. <b>Out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> ships {{take advantage of their}} known characteristics by navigating through their weaker, western half.|$|E
5|$|For over a century, {{reports from}} the world's oceans have been {{received}} real-time for safety reasons and to help with general weather forecasting. The reports are coded using the synoptic code, and relayed via radio or satellite to weather organizations worldwide. Buoy reports are automated, and maintained by the country that moored the buoy in that location. Larger moored buoys are used near shore, while smaller drifting buoys are used farther <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the film, Uhura and Chekov {{visit the}} {{aircraft}} carrier USS Enterprise. The real Enterprise, <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> at the time, was unavailable for filming, so the non-nuclear-powered carrier USS Ranger (CV-61) was used. Oakland International Airport {{was used for the}} foreground element of Starfleet Headquarters. Scenes in the San Francisco Bay were shot at a tank on Paramount's backlot.|$|E

5|$|Another {{individual}} {{known as}} Captain Haddock {{had lived in}} this period, who had commanded a fire ship, the Anne and Christopher. It was recorded by David Ogg that this captain and his ship had been separated from their squadron whilst <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> and so docked at Málaga to purchase goods that could be taken back to Britain and sold for a profit. For this action, Haddock was brought before an admiralty tribunal in 1674, where {{he was ordered to}} forfeit all profits from the transaction and suspended from his command for six months.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E
5|$|Low, still captaining the Fancy, sailed north. He {{captured}} a whaling vessel 80miles (130km) <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> {{and in a}} foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound {{and the loss of}} Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death. They were lucky, and reached Nantucket, Massachusetts, after a difficult journey. Remaining off the coast of North America, Low's crew took a fishing boat near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.|$|E
50|$|A lot of {{maintenance}} is carried <b>out</b> while <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> or in port by ship's crew.However {{a large number}} of repair and maintenance works can only be carried out while the ship is out of commercial operation, in a ship repair yard.|$|R
50|$|Black {{first made}} a name for himself in the mid-1940s in boat racing. He set a world record in his second time <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Salton <b>Sea.</b> People liked his motors, and he quickly started a {{business}} out of his garage.|$|R
50|$|Rodrigo desperately wants a {{relationship}} with Mary. However, after Elise's death, he turns Mary's attentions toward Jack and decides to leave New York. The film ends with Rodrigo gazing <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the <b>sea</b> and the Statue of Liberty as he sets sail back to Europe.|$|R
5|$|On October 6, {{small craft}} {{warnings}} were issued for the Dutch islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, despite predictions that Hazel would {{pass to the}} north; these warnings were canceled a day later. After the storm had turned northward, tropical cyclone warnings were posted for Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and {{the waters of the}} Mona Passage. Small craft near Jamaica were advised to head for port ahead of the storm. The U.S. Navy completed extensive preparations at its Guantanamo Bay base, ordering about 1,000 civilians into hardened, fortified Quonset huts, flying aircraft out of the storm's path, and positioning surface ships <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of weather ships {{proved to be}} so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) had established a global network of 13weather ships by 1948, with seven operated by the United States, one operated jointly by the United States and Canada, two supplied by the United Kingdom, one maintained by France, one a joint venture by the Netherlands and Belgium, and one shared by the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden. The United Kingdom used Royal Navy corvettes to operate their two stations, and staffed crews of 53 Met Office personnel. The ships were <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> for 27days, and in port for 15days. Their first ship was deployed on July 31, 1947.|$|E
5|$|The unusual {{behaviour}} of {{the bombers}} concerned Kapitän zur See Mecke. At 00:00 on 28 March, {{he issued a}} warning {{that there might be}} a parachute landing in progress. At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships' crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters. During all this a lookout reported seeing some activity <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.|$|E
60|$|She paused, {{looking at}} me even more strangely than before, till I turned my eyes, indeed, and stared <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the <b>sea,</b> wishing that I were in it, or {{anywhere}} away from this lovely and imperious woman whom I was sworn to obey in all things.|$|R

5|$|These small {{whales are}} also {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> whales dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas. Polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> cause large waves, heavy rain, {{flood and}} high winds, disrupting international shipping and, at times, causing shipwrecks. Tropical cyclones stir up water, leaving a cool wake behind them, which causes {{the region to}} be less favorable for subsequent tropical cyclones. On land, strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, and other outside objects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. The storm surge, or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone, is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones, historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths.|$|E
5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{memorial}} {{is around}} 120 metres long, and is mostly made of pink granite, {{with a central}} window looking <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the <b>sea.</b> A pair of railway rails are at the approach to the memorial, and {{the central part of}} the memorial has two wooden bridge crossings. It also includes several inscribed stele, including one signed by Elie Wiesel.|$|R

5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> northern elephant seals dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for protection.|$|E
5|$|While at {{the funeral}} for Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Libby, a boat comes into view <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Jack, Sayid, and Sawyer swim out to it and climb onto the boat. They hear music coming from inside it. Shots are fired from inside the boat through the boat hatch entrance. After {{breaking}} the hatch open, they find a drunken Desmond piloting the boat. The next day, after Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) prevents Locke from destroying the computer that controls the timer, Locke enlists Desmond's help in letting the timer run down to zero. Desmond hotwires the blast doors shut, locking Eko outside the computer room and Desmond and Locke inside of it. Eko, distraught, seeks Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) help. The two attempt to use dynamite to blow the blast door open, but the blast doors are unscathed, while they are both injured.|$|E

50|$|A {{research}} vessel (RV or R/V) is a ship or boat designed, modified, and/or equipped to carry <b>out</b> research <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Research vessels {{carry out a}} number of roles. Some of these roles can be combined into a single vessel but others require a dedicated vessel. Due to the demanding nature of the work, {{research vessel}}s are often constructed around an icebreaker hull, allowing them to operate in polar waters.|$|R
