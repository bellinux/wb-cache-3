2500|$|The Victorian Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 {{included}} the earliest legislation to authorise child removal from Aboriginal parents. The Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines had been advocating such powers since 1860. Passage of the Act gave the colony of Victoria a wide suite of powers over Aboriginal and [...] "half-caste" [...] persons, including the forcible removal of children, especially [...] "at risk" [...] girls. Through the late 19th and early 20th century, similar policies and legislation were adopted by {{other states and}} territories, such as the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of <b>Opium</b> <b>Act</b> 1897 (Qld), the Aborigines Ordinance 1918 (NT), the Aborigines Act 1934 (SA), and the 1936 Native Administration Act (WA).|$|E

2500|$|The Chinese Diaspora (1800s to 1949) {{first began}} during the 19th-century due to famine and {{political}} upheaval, {{as well as}} rumors of wealth to be had outside of Southeast Asia. Chinese emigrants to cities such as San Francisco, London, and New York brought with them the Chinese manner of opium smoking, and the social traditions of the opium den. The Indian Diaspora distributed opium-eaters in the same way, and both social groups survived as [...] "lascars" [...] (seamen) and [...] "coolies" [...] (manual laborers). French sailors provided another major group of opium smokers, having gotten the habit while in French Indochina, where the drug was promoted and monopolized by the colonial government {{as a source of}} revenue. Among white Europeans, opium was more frequently consumed as laudanum or in patent medicines. Britain's All-India <b>Opium</b> <b>Act</b> of 1878 formalized ethnic restrictions on the use of opium, limiting recreational opium sales to registered Indian opium-eaters and Chinese opium-smokers only and prohibiting its sale to workers from Burma. Likewise, American law sought to contain addiction to immigrants by prohibiting Chinese from smoking opium {{in the presence of a}} white man.|$|E

5000|$|The Protection of Aboriginals and Restriction of the Sale of <b>Opium</b> Amendment <b>Act</b> 1934 {{extended}} {{the provisions of}} the 1897 Act and the powers of the Chief Protector. It enabled compulsory medical examinations, and also allowed for [...] "uncontrollable" [...] Aboriginal people or [...] "half-castes" [...] (the definition of this term was changed to include South Sea Islander people) to be sent to an institution. The latter enabled the incarceration of people at the Fantome Island lock hospital for non-medical reasons.|$|R
5000|$|... 60th United States Congress passed House bill , {{better known}} as the Smoking <b>Opium</b> Exclusion <b>Act</b> of 1909, which U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt enacted into law on February 9, 1909. Public Law 60-221 was {{effective}} after the first day of April 1909 imposing an unlawful Act to import any derivative, any form, or preparation of opium into the United States. The statutory law authorizes the importation of the psychoactive drug provided any opium derivatives and preparations will be for medicinal purposes only.|$|R
50|$|The 1908 drug law {{created a}} black market for opium, and law {{enforcement}} officials believed {{that the only way to}} stop this black market was through imprisonment for offenders, so the <b>Opium</b> and Drugs <b>Act</b> 1911 was passed by Parliament. This created harsher penalties for drug offenders and also expanded the list of prohibited drugs to include morphine and cocaine, while cannabis was included in 1923. During World War I, all provinces enacted prohibition, a decision repealed in all areas except Prince Edward Island by 1929. In 1921 the penalties of the <b>Opium</b> and Drugs <b>Act</b> were expanded to provide for a seven-year prison sentence for crimes committed under the Act. The amendment also made it an offence to be in a building that contained narcotics, notably shifting the burden of proof to the defendant for this crime. Whipping and deportation became penalties for violations of the 1911 Act in 1922.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States {{cultivation}} of poppies for food is illegal. [...] However, {{this is not}} typically enforced for poppies grown or sold for food or ornamental purposes. In addition, [...] "Opium poppy and poppy straw" [...] are also prohibited. As the opium poppy is legal for culinary or esthetic reasons, poppies were once grown as a cash crop by farmers in California. The law of poppy cultivation in the United States is somewhat ambiguous. The reason for the ambiguity is because the <b>Opium</b> Poppy Control <b>Act</b> of 1942 (now repealed) stated that any opium poppy should be declared illegal, even if the farmers were issued a state permit. § 3 of the <b>Opium</b> Poppy Control <b>Act</b> stated: It shall be unlawful for any person who is not the holder of a license authorizing him to produce the opium poppy, duly issued {{to him by the}} Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with the provisions of this Act, to produce the opium poppy, or to permit the production of the opium poppy in or upon any place owned, occupied, used, or controlled by him. This led to the Poppy Rebellion, and to the Narcotics Bureau arresting anyone planting opium poppies and forcing the destruction of poppy fields of anyone who defied the prohibition of poppy cultivation. Though the press of those days favored the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, the state of California supported the farmers who grew opium poppies for their seeds for uses in foods such as poppyseed muffins. Today, this area of law has remained vague and remains somewhat controversial in the United States. The <b>Opium</b> Poppy Control <b>Act</b> of 1942 was repealed on 27 October 1970.|$|R
2500|$|At the US federal level, {{the legal}} actions taken {{reflected}} constitutional restrictions under the enumerated powers doctrine prior to reinterpretation of the commerce clause, {{which did not}} allow {{the federal government to}} enact arbitrary prohibitions, but did permit arbitrary taxation. Beginning in 1883, opium importation was taxed at [...] to [...] per pound, until the <b>Opium</b> Exclusion <b>Act</b> of 1909 prohibited the importation of opium altogether. In a similar manner, the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914, passed in fulfillment of the International Opium Convention of 1912, nominally placed a tax on the distribution of opiates, but served as a de facto prohibition of the drugs. Today, opium is regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration under the Controlled Substances Act.|$|R
50|$|Carr's Tristram and Iseult (1906), a pseudo-medieval drama, was {{produced}} at the Adelphi Theatre starring Matheson Lang, Lily Brayton and Oscar Asche.

Carr's theory of the play was that Jasper, {{under the influence of}} <b>opium,</b> attempted to <b>act</b> upon his murderous impulses, but Drood, overhearing his uncle's ravings, was able to escape. This was followed by an adaptation of Goethe's Faust, for Tree in 1908, in collaboration with Stephen Phillips.|$|R
50|$|Half-Caste Act was {{the common}} name given to Acts of Parliament passed in Victoria and Western Australia in 1886.

50|$|In 1832, Tao was tasked by the Daoguang Emperor with {{fixing the}} problem, which was deemed {{especially}} acute {{in light of}} the outflow of silver in the years leading up to the First <b>Opium</b> War. <b>Acting</b> on the advice of his classmates Wei Yuan and Bao Shichen, two other officials in the reform group, Tao took immediate action to end the Ming franchise system in favor of a relatively open market. Any merchant of good standing could buy salt distribution tickets for the purchase of single shipments of large or small amounts which could be retailed anyplace the merchant wished. The tickets themselves could be bought and sold. Tao's reforms opened the system up to small scale traders, depriving the hereditary merchants and the smugglers of their profits and lowering costs to the consumer. However, Tao could not meet the optimistic commitments he had made to the emperor.|$|R
50|$|In the United States it {{is legal}} to {{purchase}} poppy seeds but all {{other parts of the}} plant are considered a schedule II controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substance Act of 1970. The <b>Opium</b> Poppy Exclusion <b>Act</b> of 1942 bans growing of the poppy in many cases but is generally not a problem for gardeners as the plant is widely grown for the flowers and for seeds for replanting and cooking, and for much of US history poppies were a significant cash crop, with the government especially pushing for farmers to grow more poppies for medicinal use during wars up to World War I.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{morphine}} and codeine {{are common}} alkaloids found in several poppy varieties, and are important drugs {{for much of}} the world. Australia, Turkey and India are the most important producers of poppy for medicinal use, while the USA, the UK, France, Australia and Hungary are the largest processors. In the United States, opium is illegal, as is possession or cultivation of the flower itself. However, the law is seldom enforced when poppies are grown for culinary or ornamental use. The <b>Opium</b> Poppy Control <b>Act</b> Of 1942 led to the “Poppy Rebellion”, and a battle between California farmers and the federal government. Today, the law and its enforcement remain vague and controversial, even inciting episodes between gardeners and [...] "the poppy police".|$|R

2500|$|Cannabis was criminalized {{in various}} {{countries}} {{beginning in the}} early 20th century. In the United States, the first restrictions on sale of cannabis came in 1906 (in District of Columbia). It was outlawed in Jamaica (then a British colony) in 1913, in South Africa in 1922, and in the United Kingdom and New Zealand in the 1920s. Canada criminalized cannabis in the <b>Opium</b> and Drug <b>Act</b> of 1923, before any reports of the use of the drug in Canada. In 1925 a compromise was made at an international conference in The Hague about the International Opium Convention that banned exportation of [...] "Indian hemp" [...] to countries that had prohibited its use, and requiring importing countries to issue certificates approving the importation and stating that the shipment was required [...] "exclusively for medical or scientific purposes". It also required parties to [...] "exercise an effective control of such a nature as to prevent the illicit international traffic in Indian hemp and especially in the resin".|$|R
50|$|Harry J. Anslinger was {{appointed}} its first commissioner by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon under President Herbert Hoover. Under Anslinger, the bureau lobbied for harsh penalties for drug usage. The FBN is credited for criminalizing {{drugs such as}} cannabis with the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, as well as strengthening the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914. Even so, {{the main focus of}} the FBN was fighting opium and heroin smuggling. One instance against opium was The <b>Opium</b> Poppy Control <b>Act</b> of 1942. To that end the FBN over time established several offices overseas in France, Italy, Turkey, Beirut, Thailand and other hotspots of international narcotics smuggling. These agents (never totaling more than 17) cooperated with local drug enforcement agencies in gathering intelligence on smugglers and also made undercover busts locally. The work against heroin and opium was however hamstrung by US foreign policy considerations: during the Vietnam War for instance great importance was placed on investigating minor Vietnamese smugglers that could be connected to the resistance while investigations of large scale smugglers from the US ally Thailand were left unfinished.|$|R
50|$|This disproportionality has stemmed in racialization {{for many}} years. It is {{important}} to understand the background of the war on drugs. The earliest influences can be seen in early Chinese immigration for railroad buildings. One of the first acts against drugs was the <b>Opium</b> Exclusion <b>Act</b> of 1909. It prohibited the smoking of opium, ingested by a vast percentage of caucasian housewives in America, but smoked mainly by Asian American immigrants coming to build the railroads. These immigrants were targeted with anti-Asian sentiment as America had a stigma that they came solely to take away jobs. Experts say that the easiest thing to do if we can't remove our problems by killing them is to throw them in jail, and America found a way to do this by criminalizing aspects of ethnic traditions and practices. This continued with African Americans and cocaine and led to the cycle that we now see today. The Sentencing Reform Act emerged as the ultimate culmination to this. By going tough on crimes, the United States federal government tried to increase consistency on federal sentencing. This stemmed from a tough on crime campaign headed largely by Ronald Reagan. The Crime rate was steadily dipping by upwards of an average of 8 percent each year, and 12 percent in violent crime in the years preceding the bill pointing to numerous questions at the true motive of the bill. Many experts, such as Michael C. Campbell, a doctorate in the department of criminology at the University of Missouri- St.Louis, declares that the scheme of a war on crime was used for political action. Fear was created among the citizens of the state and thus the country looked to him to keep their doors safe. The effects of this bill on the incarceration are shown in the diagram to the right. The effects on crime per 100,000 capita released by {{the department of homeland security}} states that violent crimes remained to steadily decrease; however, in the 10 years following the bill, crimes such as rape, theft, robbery, and murder grew by 6, 4, 3, and 2 percent, respectively. It {{is important to}} understand the political domination that a war on drugs and crime created, and thus shapes the prison industrial complex today. While incarceration stays at an all time high, crime was actually decreasing.|$|R
