5|$|According to the <b>operational</b> <b>doctrine</b> {{developed}} by the RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise the operational lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E

25|$|After Rommel's first offensive, a {{reorganisation}} of British command took place. In November 1941, the British Eighth Army was activated under Lieutenant General Sir Alan Cunningham. Its first offensive failed disastrously as German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel blunted the thrust.

Cunningham was relieved of command and Major General Neil Ritchie was put in his place. However, a second British offensive in late 1941 turned Rommel's flank {{and led to the}} relief of Tobruk. Again Cyrenaica fell into British hands, this time the advance went as far as El Agheila. However outside events again intervened to impede British efforts; as the British attack reached El Agheila Japan attacked in the Far East. That meant that reinforcements that had been destined for the Middle East went elsewhere. This was to have disastrous effects.|$|E

40|$|In Command and Control, {{humans have}} {{to make sense of}} the {{situation}} to support decision making on the required action. Development of an Air Defence Control system through a Systems Engineering process starts with assessment of existing systems to determine its ability to support operations within the modern and complex combat environment. This leads to further assessment of concepts with new technology, structures and process to solve the perceived problems. This process is difficult as Command and Control is a sociotechnical system where the human, process, structure and technical system, must be exercised in unison within a complex operational environment. This paper highlights the requirements of Command and Control system analysis and experimentation to propose an approach that considers the cognitive and social attributes of the human with the dynamic complexity of the operation environment.

In {{the first half of the}} 1890 s Alfred Tirpitz honed its abstract strategic axioms on the realities of modern naval warfare and Germany's defence needs to produce precisely defined <b>operational</b> <b>doctrines.</b> During the second half of the decade these were in turn superseded by an ideology of sea power which provided a completely different interpretation of the tasks and capabilities of navies.

500|$|Westland Helicopters, {{which had}} a long-standing licence {{agreement}} with Sikorsky Aircraft {{to allow it to}} build Sikorsky's helicopters, extended the agreement to cover the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King soon after the Sea King's first flight in 1959. Westland proceeded to independently develop the Sea King, integrating a significant proportion of components from British suppliers; key changes include the use of a pair of Rolls-Royce Gnome turboshaft engines and the implementation of an automatic flight control system. On this matter, authors Jim Thorn and Gerald Frawley stated that: [...] "Despite appearances, Westland's Sea King [...] very different aircraft from Sikorsky's". Many {{of the differences between the}} Westland-built Sea King and the original helicopter were as a result of differing <b>operational</b> <b>doctrine.</b> While the U.S. Navy Sea Kings were intended to be under tactical control of the carrier from which they operated, the Royal Navy intended its helicopters to be much more autonomous, capable of operating alone, or coordinating with other aircraft or surface vessels. This resulted in a different crew arrangement, with operations being controlled by an observer rather than the pilot, as well as fitting a search radar.|$|E

The plan worked, as the bombers arrived without being intercepted, but the southward journey had given the Germans a one-hour warning, as the Freya radar {{had picked up the}} bombers [...] off the coast. As the bombers passed down the coast, anti-aircraft artillery fire from ships and harbour defences was noted. Once in the target area they also came under heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire from Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven. Ships near Schillig Roads also opened fire. The bombers replied with their machine guns to throw the gunners off. German fire was at the correct height but exploded behind the bombers. Soon after, the formation was over Wilhelmshaven harbour, with Gneisenau and Scharnhorst at anchor beneath them. However, the ships were too close to shore and Kellett chose not to risk dropping bombs to avoid civilian casualties. Kellett—commanding the formation—had been ordered to attack at minimum altitude (about [...] ).

The infantry would now work with heavy artillery to break through the enemy's possibly fortified forward positions, thus allowing the mobile troops to exploit the breach to penetrate enemy's defensive positions and destroy rear support and service units and ultimately lines of communications. Infantry units received substantial {{increase in the number of}} automatic weapons and supporting artillery, and there was a concerted effort to improve leadership qualities of the officer corps, including teaching and encouraging use of initiative. The many cavalry formations that still existed in the Red Army changed their tactics from the usual cavalry role to that of mobile mounted infantry to support the tanks, but less reliant on fuel and support, thereby reducing the logistic tail of the operational formation. Significant attention was paid to development of close air support (CAS) although there was a serious impediment in the industrial capability to provide enough radios to the military units.|$|R
