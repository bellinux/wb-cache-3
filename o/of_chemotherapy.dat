5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects <b>of</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use <b>of</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin {{is more effective than}} older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy {{the tumor}} was inoperable, but he looked around for other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course <b>of</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, but sometimes people lived for years.|$|E

40|$|Introduction:Recent {{clinical}} trials incorporating maintenance chemotherapy into the initial treatment of advanced {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) have highlighted {{the benefits of}} exposing patients to second-line therapies. We, therefore, determined the predictors and impact <b>of</b> second-line <b>chemotherapy</b> administration in a contemporary, diverse NSCLC population. Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC from 2000 to 2007 at clinical facilities associated with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Demographic, disease, treatment, and outcome data were obtained from hospital tumor registries. The association between these variables was assessed using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Results:A total of 406 patients in this cohort received first-line chemotherapy and were included in the analysis. Mean age was 59 years, 28 % were women, and 59 % were white. Among these patients, 197 (49 %) received second-line chemotherapy. Among those patients who had not progressed after four to six cycles <b>of</b> first-line <b>chemotherapy,</b> 67 % received second-line <b>chemotherapy.</b> Receipt <b>of</b> second-line <b>chemotherapy</b> was significantly associated with patient insurance type (p = 0. 007), number of cycles <b>of</b> first-line <b>chemotherapy</b> (p < 0. 001), and receipt of prechemotherapy palliative radiation therapy (p = 0. 005) but was not associated with patient age, gender, race, histology, or year of diagnosis. In a multivariate model, second-line chemotherapy administration remained associated with insurance type (p = 0. 003), number of cycles <b>of</b> first-line <b>chemotherapy</b> (p < 0. 001), and receipt of prechemotherapy palliative radiation therapy (p = 0. 008). The number of cycles <b>of</b> first-line <b>chemotherapy</b> and administration <b>of</b> second-line <b>chemotherapy</b> were associated with overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Conclusions:In this unselected, contemporary, and diverse cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC, 67 % of individuals whose disease had not progressed after four to six cycles <b>of</b> first-line <b>chemotherapy</b> eventually received second-line <b>chemotherapy.</b> Markers <b>of</b> socioeconomic status, symptom burden, and response to and tolerance <b>of</b> first-line <b>chemotherapy</b> were associated with receipt <b>of</b> second-line <b>chemotherapy.</b> These factors may assist in the selection of patients most likely to benefit from maintenance chemotherapy...|$|R
5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily <b>of</b> <b>chemotherapy,</b> and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{focus has}} been to reduce therapy for low and {{intermediate}} risk neuroblastoma while maintaining survival rates at 90%. A study of 467 intermediate risk patients enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed the hypothesis that therapy could be successfully reduced for this risk group. Those with favorable characteristics (tumor grade and response) received four cycles <b>of</b> <b>chemotherapy,</b> and those with unfavorable characteristics received eight cycles, with three-year event free survival and overall survival stable at 90% for the entire cohort. Future plans are to intensify treatment for those patients with aberration of 1p36 or 11q23 chromosomes {{as well as for}} those who lack early response to treatment.|$|E

5|$|Robson {{defeated}} bowel {{cancer in}} 1992, a malignant melanoma in 1995, and a tumour {{in his right}} lung and a brain tumour, both in 2006. Treatment of these conditions had left him partially paralysed due to a stroke caused by the brain tumour, and also with a partially prosthetic upper jaw after the melanoma was surgically removed. His fifth diagnosis of cancer in 2007, consisting of cancerous nodules in both lungs, was diagnosed as terminal in February 2007, and as of December 2008, was being controlled through bouts <b>of</b> <b>chemotherapy.</b> After these experiences, and following his fifth diagnosis with cancer, Robson devoted the remaining {{years of his life}} to helping fight the disease. On 25 March 2008, he launched the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. By November 2008, the Foundation had raised £1million.

Paul collapses from pneumonia and is hospitalised. Nick tells Paul that his cancer is in remission, but Georgia claims that Paul never had cancer and Nick is found to have doctored Paul's patient files. He is arrested soon after.

5|$|On 27 May, 41-year old former Welsh {{international}} Rob Edwards {{was appointed}} new Tranmere Rovers manager with John McMahon {{staying at the}} club as assistant manager. It was the first managerial experience for Edwards, who had been an assistant at Exeter City previously. The next day, the first signing was made – 22-year old Welsh striker Eliot Richards signed a two-year contract. He was followed by his Bristol Rovers teammate midfielder Matthew Gill. Previously Gill had spent three seasons with Exeter, winning back-to-back promotions from the Conference National and League Two together with Edwards. Further Edwards signings were young central defender Michael Ihiekwe from Wolverhampton Wanderers, ex-Rotherham United striker Kayode Odejayi, 24-year old defender Marcus Holness from Burton Albion, Scottish midfielder Marc Laird released by Southend United and 30-year old defender Danny Woodards, while Evan Horwood cancelled his contract with Tranmere Rovers by mutual consent to return to Northampton Town, where he had spent end of the previous season on loan.

Affected by Jim's death, Rhys goes to the gym looking for distraction and he befriends Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan). Rhys flirts with Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), but she rebuffs his advances. Jade later asks for Rhys' help in getting her housemate, Michelle Tran (HaiHa Le), to move out.
