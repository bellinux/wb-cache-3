Elaborately quilted petticoats might be displayed by a cut-away dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the farthingale was popular.

40|$|The {{weight of}} the {{clothing}} worn by primary school children {{has a great deal}} to do with their growth and health. In this connection, the present writer conducted a monthly ｍeasurement of the weight of primary school children's clothing at each season, selecting two farm-villages in Osaka Prefectures. The results obtained are as follows(See Figures inserted) : Boys are mostly more heavily clothed than girls. Both boys and girls wear heavier clothes in spring than in autumn. Generally speaking, about 70 % of the boys and girls examined are clothed rationally, that is, neither too thickly nor too thinly. (whether or not a boy or a girl is rationally clothed is determined in this case by M±δ, M standing for the average value of the weight of clothing, and δ for the standard deviation.) However, too thick clothing is more noticeable among boys than among girls. When measured separately, the outer garment is heavier than the underwear in the case of boys, as compared with girls. Again, the clothing worn from waist up has more weight than that worn from waist down in the case of girls, as compared with boys. With regard to boys, the upper part of the body is comparatively too scantily clothed in summer, while the lower part comparatively too lightly in winter. Adaptation to seasonal changes is made by underwears rather than by <b>outer</b> garments, by <b>clothing</b> covering the upper part of the body than the lower part. Generally speaking, the difference between the maxiｍum and minimum weight of clothing according to seasonal changes is exceedingly great, and there are children who are either too heavily or too lightly clothed. Rational adaptation to seasonal changes by means of clothing, therefore, is sincerely to be desired...|$|R

2500|$|The {{crinoline}} or hooped petticoat {{had grown}} to its maximum dimensions by 1860. As huge skirts began to fall from favor, around 1864, {{the shape of the}} crinoline began to change. Rather than being dome-shaped, the front and sides began to contract, leaving volume only at the back. The [...] "American" [...] cage, a hooped petticoat partially covered in fabric, came in bright colors made possible by the new aniline dyes. This was followed by a hybrid of the bustle and crinoline sometimes called a [...] "crinolette". The cage structure was still attached around the waist and extended down to the ground, but only extended down the back of the wearer’s legs. The crinolette itself was quickly superseded by the true bustle, which was sufficient for supporting the drapery and train {{at the back of the}} skirt.Under the corset, a chemise was worn. A chemise is typically short sleeve and knee length made of linen or cotton. The chemise and stockings worn were meant to soak up any perspiration and protecting the <b>outer</b> <b>clothing.</b> Due to the many layers of dress, the women of the southern elite would take short naps to rest from wearing their large dress and escape the harsh southern heat and the constraining whalebone corsets.|$|E
5000|$|Tunics {{were worn}} {{by men and}} boys; a habit (סודרא) and a central hat (כומתא) worn by married men in {{accordance}} with a teaching in the Babylonian Talmud. Normally, Jews did not don gentile garb, seeing {{that there was a}} distinct style of clothing for Jews, and another style for Arabs or other non-Jews. These bounds, however, were drawn to extend only to certain pieces of clothing, but not to all pieces of clothing. Some pieces of clothing were indeed similar to those worn by non-Jews. German ethnographer Erich Brauer (1895 - 1942) described the clothing worn by Yemen's Jews in the following manner: Instead of trousers, the Yemenite Jews (as well as Yemen's Arabs) carry a piece of cloth worn around the hip (loincloth), called maizar. The expression fūṭa, quoted by Sapir (Jacob Saphir), is used the same piece of clothing by the Jews in Aden and partly also by Arabs from Yemen. The maizar consists of one piece of dark-blue cotton that is wound a few times around the waist and which is held up by a belt made of cloth material or leather. The maizar is allowed to reach down to the knees only. Today, the Yemenites will therefore wear made like unto short-length trousers, called sirwāl, of the traditional loincloth beneath their tunics.A blue shirt that has a split that extends down to the waistline and that is closed at neck level is worn over the maizar. If the shirt is multicolored and striped, it is called tahṭāni, meaning, 'the lower.' If it is monochrome, it is called antari. Finally, the <b>outer</b> layer of <b>clothing,</b> worn over the maizar and antari, is a dark-blue cotton tunic (Arabic: gufṭān or kufṭān). The tunic is a coat-like garment that extends down to the knees which is fully open in the front and is closed with a single button in the neck. Over the tunic, the Jewish people were not allowed to wear a girdle.|$|R
40|$|Background: Melanoma has {{the highest}} {{mortality}} rate of skin cancer in New Zealand, and has the third highest incidence rate of cancer overall. The severity of melanoma can be reduced through early detection, which can be achieved through early recognition of suspicious lesions. Osteopaths are primary health care practitioners, who can often examine a patient with {{the removal of the}} <b>outer</b> layers of <b>clothing.</b> As primary practitioners, they have a duty to provide for the general health of their patients, whilst the removal of clothing also allows an opportunity for non-invasive screening. As such, osteopaths may be in a good position to provide screening and risk assessment services for their patients. Purpose: Both the New Zealand Cancer Control Strategy: Action Plan 2005 - 2010 and the Report on the Early Detection of Skin Cancer in New Zealand by the Early Detection Advisory Group (2006) recommend action by associated health care providers to help improve the early detection of melanoma. This study aims to provide a baseline view of the current situation of melanoma screening within the New Zealand osteopathic community, and explore the role this community can play in the early detection of melanoma through development and dissemination of a self-completed questionnaire. Method: A self-completed questionnaire was developed incorporating both quantitative and qualitative aspects, encompassing practitioner demographics, attitudes and beliefs, current practices and knowledge. A short skill quiz was also included to investigate the ability of osteopathic practitioners to recognise melanoma and assess the level of knowledge in the community. This questionnaire underwent limited pilot testing and was assessed for validity and reliability before being distributed to registered members of the Osteopathic Council of New Zealand. Three hundred and fifty questionnaires were distributed through both postal and email services, resulting in 71 valid returns (a return rate of 20. 3 %). Results: A majority of osteopaths in New Zealand believed that skin cancer detection was important in New Zealand; with 93 % believing it would benefit their patients, and 94 % believing it was an issue in their region. Eighty-seven percent of practitioners believed osteopathy could help to reduce the mortality from skin cancer; however only 58 % believed it was within their scope of practice to recognise skin cancer in their patients, with 15 % answering that they were unsure. Despite this, 79 % believed that they had a responsibility to manage their patient’s general health, and 92 % believed {{they should be able to}} recognise a wide range of pathologies. Practitioners’ confidence in their knowledge was not high, however, with 79 % believing they did not have enough knowledge about skin cancer and melanoma, and 30 % believing that skin cancer was very difficult to detect clinically. A number of osteopaths reported they already looked for suspicious lesions on their patients, with 44 % noting this often or always occurred. This was weakly correlated with how often practitioners asked their patients to disrobe during examination (r =. 254, p < 0. 05). A significant number of practitioners noted that they only occasionally noted suspicious lesions on their patients (51 %), and a similar number (49 %) noted that they only occasionally discussed skin cancer with their patients. Patient initiated discussions regarding skin cancer were less common, with 59 % of practitioners noting this seldom or never happened. Referrals for suspicious lesions were also rare, again with 59 % of practitioners noting this seldom or never occurred. A higher frequency of referrals was also moderately correlated with a belief that skin cancer was difficult to detect clinically (r =. 430, p < 0. 01). The reasons given for referral varied from referring for any lesion that caused patient or practitioner concern, to only referring those lesions for which the clinical signs were indicative of melanoma. Practitioners’ beliefs regarding their knowledge showed that most practitioners believed their knowledge of risk factors for melanoma and knowledge of melanoma detection was reasonable, but were less confident with being able to determine a melanoma from a benign mole or determining which moles would require referral to a skin specialist. These views were supported by the results of the skill quiz, although practitioners tended to over-estimate their knowledge of risk factors. Practitioners showed good sensitivity in image recognition of melanoma (75. 2 %), however specificity was poor (44. 4 %). Overall, practitioners believed osteopathy could play a role in the early detection of melanoma due to good opportunity, such examination being both part of the service and falling under the osteopathic philosophy of holism. Practitioners believed osteopathy could play a role in referral and patient education, but practitioner education and knowledge was a limiting factor. Conclusions: Osteopaths consider melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer is an important topic in New Zealand, and early detection of melanoma would benefit their patients. They feel that osteopathy can be involved in the early detection of melanoma, both in the role of recognition and referral, and in patient education and support. For this to occur, however, educational courses and resources must be made available to increase the skill levels of the community. A significant proportion of osteopaths already check their patients for suspicious lesions as part of their routine examination; however there may be a tendency to over-refer benign lesions, especially for those osteopaths who are less confident in their skills in melanoma recognition...|$|R

[...] After being shot, some victims fell in the pit, others collapsed along the edge. [...] Becu, who also gave the command to shoot, walked among the victims and shot again the still-living ones with his pistol. [...] More victims were then brought up, shot, and pushed into the grave. [...] When the pit was full, Latvians covered it up with sand.
