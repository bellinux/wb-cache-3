6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kit. [...] "We'll let it alone, if you like, {{but there}} won't be much <b>of</b> <b>your</b> hay <b>left</b> when the flood breaks through, and I imagine {{you could be}} made {{responsible}} for other damage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How? Why, {{from the}} people of the marquis, who stopped here to drink a cup of wine when he passed to Granada {{yesterday}} with his company and two se√±oras. He said that the San Antonio had sunk, but told us nothing <b>of</b> <b>your</b> being <b>left</b> aboard <b>of</b> her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, but I {{observe the}} second half of a return ticket in the palm <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's a very steep place," [...] he announced, without, however, looking back. [...] "Randy, {{when you}} reach it, catch hold of the spur <b>of</b> ice with <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand and put your foot just beneath it. Tell Earl to do the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Craving your pardon, Colonel Mac-Ivor, {{not quite}} so easily as ye seem to opine. I grant most <b>of</b> <b>your</b> folk <b>left</b> the Highlands {{expedited}} as it were, and free from the incumbrance of baggage; but it is unspeakable the quantity of useless sprechery which they have collected on their march. I saw one fellow <b>of</b> yours (craving <b>your</b> pardon once more) with a pier-glass upon his back.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Turn your back, {{and hold}} your course past the isle of Albion, {{with the white}} cliffs, and so keep with the land on <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand, and the unsailed sea on your right hand, till you mark the pillars <b>of</b> Heracles on <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> then take <b>your</b> course west by south, and a curse on you!

6000|$|... "Sure! You know a {{good thing}} when you see one. Why," [...] he went on warmly, [...] "there is stuff in these reminiscences which would stir the blood of a jellyfish. Let me quote you another passage, {{to show that they}} are not only enthralling, but helpful as well. Let me see, where is it? Ah, I have it. 'A bully good way of putting a guy out of {{business}} is this. You don't want to use it in the ring, because rightly speaking it's a foul, but you will find it mighty useful if any thick-neck comes up to you in the street and tries to start anything. It's this way. While he's setting himself for a punch, just place the tips of the fingers <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand {{on the right side of}} the chest. Then bring down the heel <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand. There isn't a guy living that could stand up against that. The fingers give you a leverage to beat the band. The guy doubles up, and you upper-cut him with your right, and out he goes.' Now, I bet you never knew that before, Mr. Philpotts. Try it on your parishioners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, you unlucky being!' sighed she. 'Do {{you know}} that this calf is so swift that in a single day he can run three times round the world? Take heed to what I tell you. Bind one end of this silk thread to the left fore-leg of the calf, and the other end to the little toe <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> foot, so that the calf {{will never be able to}} leave your side, whether you walk, stand, or lie.' After this the prince went to bed and slept soundly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{accidental}} resemblance has deceived you {{as to the}} miniature," [...] he said, while Paul {{was looking}} for the proper number among the letters of Mr. Monday. [...] "No--no--that cannot be the picture <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mother. She <b>left</b> no child. Assheton did you say, was the name <b>of</b> <b>your</b> father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Harris," [...] Jacob {{reminded}} her, [...] "it is {{two years}} since I <b>left</b> one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> eggs. I <b>left</b> it then because I was miserable. I am leaving it this morning because--I have had good news. I can't eat. Later on--later on, Mrs. Harris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are most}} curious and interesting," [...] replied the dervish. [...] "If you apply a little <b>of</b> it to <b>your</b> <b>left</b> eye you will behold {{in an instant}} all the treasures hidden {{in the bowels of}} the earth. But beware lest you touch your right eye with it, or your sight will be {{destroyed}} for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|One day {{the maiden}} {{took him into}} a secret chamber, where a little gold box was {{standing}} on a silver table. Pointing to the box, she said, 'Here is my greatest treasure, whose like {{is not to be}} found in the whole world. It is a precious gold ring. When you marry me, I will give you this ring as a marriage gift, and it will make you the happiest of mortal men. But in order that our love may last for ever, you must give me for the ring three drops of blood from the little finger <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} knife and tried to strike the youth, and he even tried to cut himself with it, but found it impossible. Then he asked the maiden to show him how to split stones and rocks {{with the help of}} the ring. So she led him into a {{courtyard}} where stood a great boulder-stone. 'Now,' she said, 'put the ring upon the thumb <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand, and you will see how strong that hand has become. The youth did so, and found to his astonishment that with a single blow of his fist the stone flew into a thousand pieces. Then the youth bethought him that he who does not use his luck when he has it is a fool, and that this was a chance which once lost might never return. So while they stood laughing at the shattered stone he placed the ring, as if in play, upon the third finger of his left hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{simplicity}} itself," [...] said he; [...] "my eyes {{tell me that}} on {{the inside}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they {{have been caused by}} someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge {{on the right side of}} his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the minor}} details <b>of</b> <b>your</b> advance are <b>left</b> entirely to <b>your</b> direction. If, however, {{you think it}} {{practicable}} to use <b>your</b> cavalry south <b>of</b> you, so as to cut the railroad about Hicksford, {{about the time of}} the general advance, it would be of immense advantage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unusual, yes," [...] {{answered}} Alfred, gravely. [...] "And I cannot {{but wonder}} what motives actuated our coming to Fort Henry. I came to seek my fortune. You came to bring sunshine {{into the home}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> brother, and <b>left</b> <b>your</b> fortune behind you. Well, your motive has the element of nobility. Mine has nothing but that of recklessness. I would like to read the future." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} trouble about that," [...] I answered. [...] "There is all your income {{that has been}} accumulating for years, and besides that I have saved two-thirds <b>of</b> what <b>your</b> father <b>left</b> to me, as I consider, in trust for you. There is plenty of cash." ...|$|R
5000|$|Put {{your left}} foot on the line, then place your right foot on the line ahead <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>left,</b> {{with the heel of}} your right foot against the toe <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>left</b> foot.|$|E

50|$|The {{people felt}} embarrassed {{and called him}} back again the next day. This time, when he asked the same question, the people replied yes. So Nasreddin said, Well, since you already know what I am going to say, I won't waste any more <b>of</b> <b>your</b> time! and <b>left.</b>|$|R
6000|$|A light {{broke in}} on the Supervisor's brain. In {{the midst of his}} preoccupation as a {{forester}} he suddenly became the father. His eyes narrowed and his face darkened. [...] "That's so. The old rip could make a whole lot of capital out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> being <b>left</b> in camp that way. At the same time I don't believe in dodging. The worst thing we could do would be to try to blind the trail. Was Tony here last night when you came?" ...|$|R
