While her sister was on trial, Maureen—eight months pregnant—was attacked in the lift of the building in which she and David lived. Their home was vandalised, and hate mail was regularly posted through their letterbox. Maureen feared for her children: [...] "I couldn't let my children out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>sight</b> when they were little. They were too young to tell them why they had to stay in, to explain why they couldn't go out to play like all the other children." ...|$|E

We managed to get some toys for Johnny from a {{merchant}} inside. (16 July)Johnny was not well to-day, and I feared he might be sickening for small-pox. (31 July)Johnny's rosy cheeks, which he never lost, excited great admiration; he passed {{most of his time}} in the square next to us with the Sikhs, who were very fond of him, and used to give him chappatties (native bread), though they could not have had much to eat themselves, poor men! (28 August) [...] Mrs. Case and Johnny were walking in the square next to ours to-day, when a Sikh officer passed them, and directly afterwards he was hit in the arm by a bullet. No place was really safe, and I never liked having the children out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>sight.</b> (18 October) During the siege, we had picked up a little white hen, which used to run about and pick up what it could. Just before Colonel Campbell became so very ill, we had decided to kill and eat it, when one morning Johnny ran in and said, 'Oh, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg!' We took it at once to Colonel Campbell, it being a great luxury in those days. The hen laid one every day for him till he died, and then ceased for the rest of the siege; but we would not kill it then. (12 November) I had at first put the two boys into a dhoolie with their ayah, but they got separated from us, and it was fully a quarter of an hour before I found them, so I would not let them go from me again [...] [...] [...] poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it [...] than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. [...] (19 November) ...|$|E

[...] 16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. 17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: {{the same is}} Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.|$|E

They halted for a time {{on the edge of}} the wood and then came forward in an open line. They kept walking nearer to us and not looking at us, but away to the right of us. Even when they began to be hit, and their officers' {{whistles}} woke them up, they didn't seem to see us. One or two halted to fire, and then they all went back towards the wood again. They went slowly at first, looking round at us, then the shelter of the wood seemed to draw them, and they trotted. I fired rather mechanically and missed, then I fired again, and then I became earnest to hit something, made sure <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>sighting,</b> and aimed very carefully at a blue back that was dodging about in the corn. At first I couldn't satisfy myself and didn't shoot, his movements were so spasmodic and uncertain; then I think he came to a ditch or some such obstacle and halted for a moment. [...] "GOT you," [...] I whispered, and pulled the trigger.|$|R

Then I cast my eyes on the rough descent and the wonderful void beneath me. In my mind lingered a pleasing consciousness <b>of</b> <b>my</b> last <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the old plainsman.

60|$|It is {{needless to}} say that I failed to keep the secret <b>of</b> <b>my</b> depravity from the {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother. The <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> her grief was the first influence that sobered me. In some degree at least I restrained myself: I made the effort to return to purer ways of life.

I gradually defined one feature after another. The balconies of the central saloon where first I met Bianca beneath its roof; the terrace where we so often had passed the delightful summer evenings; the awning that shaded her chamber window--I almost fancied I saw her form beneath it. Could she but know her lover was in the bark whose white sail now gleamed on the sunny bosom <b>of</b> the sea! <b>My</b> fond impatience increased as we neared the coast.

Then I was placed on a tombstone, by way of encouragement; after which, they sent me to live among paupers. I ran away at ten years old, and went to sea, where I've played the part of man-of-war's-man, privateer's-man, smuggler, mate, master, and all hands; everything, in short, but a pirate and mutineer. I've been a bloody hermit, Mr. Van Tassel, and if that won't take the resemblance to anything human out of a fellow, his face is as unchangeable as that on a gold coin." ...|$|R
