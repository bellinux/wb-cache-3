60|$|Tiumen {{is a town}} of over 15,000 inhabitants, and is {{the first}} town arrived at in Siberia proper, the {{frontier}} between Russia and that country running between Ekaterinburg and that town. Here the prisoners were at once placed on board a steamer, and Godfrey was glad indeed to throw himself down upon the bed, where he slept without waking until the steamer got {{under way in the}} morning. He was delighted to see that the port-hole was not, as in the first boat, blocked by an <b>outside</b> <b>shutter,</b> but that he could look out over the country as they passed along. For a time the scenery was similar to that which they had been passing over, bare and desolate; but it presently assumed a different character; fields of green wheat stretched away from the river side; comfortable-looking little villages succeeded each other rapidly as the steamer passed along, and save for the difference of architecture and the peculiar green domes and pinnacles of the little churches he might have been looking over a scene in England.|$|E
60|$|Lady Northmoor {{was carried}} into a bedroom, and Constance was shut {{out into a}} room that photographed itself on her memory, even in that moment--a room like a box, with a rough table, a few folding-chairs, an easel, water-coloured {{drawings}} hung about in all directions, a big travelling-case, a few books, a writing-case, Mrs. Bury's sitting-room in fact, which, as a regular sojourner, she {{had been able to}} secure and furnish after her need. From the window, tall, narrow, latticed, with a heavy <b>outside</b> <b>shutter,</b> she saw a village green, a little church with a sharp steeple, and pointed-roof houses covered with shingle, groups of people, a few in picturesque Tyrolese costume, but others in the ordinary badly cut edition of cosmopolitan human nature. There was a priest in a big hat and white bordered bands discussing a newspaper with a man with a big red umbrella; a party drinking coffee under a pine tree, and beyond, those strange wild pointed aiguilles pointing up purple and red against the sky.|$|E
60|$|Charley and I {{had reason}} {{to call it the}} most {{friendly}} of villages, I am sure, for in a week's time the people were so glad to see us go by, though ever so frequently {{in the course of a}} day, that there were faces of greeting in every cottage. I had known many of the grown people before and almost all the children, but now the very steeple began to wear a familiar and affectionate look. Among my new friends was an old old woman who lived in such a little thatched and whitewashed dwelling that when the <b>outside</b> <b>shutter</b> was turned up on its hinges, it shut up the whole house-front. This old lady had a grandson who was a sailor, and I wrote a letter to him for her and drew at the top of it the chimney-corner in which she had brought him up and where his old stool yet occupied its old place. This was considered by the whole village the most wonderful achievement in the world, but when an answer came back all the way from Plymouth, in which he mentioned that he was going to take the picture all the way to America, and from America would write again, I got all the credit that ought to have been given to the post-office and was invested with the merit of the whole system.|$|E
5000|$|The Haywain Triptych is a panel {{painting}} by Hieronymus Bosch, currently {{housed in the}} Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain. A date of around 1516 has been established by means of dendrochronological research. The central panel, signed [...] "Jheronimus Bosch", measures 135 by 200 centimeters and the wings measure 147 × 66 cm. The <b>outside</b> <b>shutters</b> feature a version of Bosch's The Wayfarer.|$|R
60|$|The Bank {{offered no}} {{violence}} to the wholesome monotony of the town. It was another red brick house, with black <b>outside</b> <b>shutters,</b> green inside blinds, a black street-door up two white steps, a brazen door-plate, and a brazen door-handle full stop. It was a size larger than Mr. Bounderby's house, as other houses {{were from a}} size to half-a-dozen sizes smaller; in all other particulars, it was strictly according to pattern.|$|R
50|$|The Council Chamber {{was greatly}} altered in the mid-18th century and was formalised by the {{inclusion}} of four matching doorways with eight-panel doors, {{one of which was}} false and included merely for the sake of symmetry. Other 18th-century changes include the lengthening of the spits in the kitchen chimney so that they could be turned on the outside wall, the making of two new closets in the Jury Chamber under the Music Loft and the removal of the <b>outside</b> <b>shutters</b> and their being placed inside.|$|R
50|$|The window {{shutters}} are manually controlled. Each window has a knob with {{a direct}} mechanical linkage to the <b>outside</b> <b>shutter</b> assembly. O-rings {{are used to}} prevent air leakage.|$|E
50|$|On {{a balcony}} whose door has an <b>outside</b> <b>shutter,</b> a special door handle {{is used on}} the outer side. The {{protruding}} part of such handle (usually ring-shaped) can be folded sideways, so that the shutter can be fully closed without being obstructed by the door handle.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{came out}} of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets, haggard and worn. He turned from his own class and his own quarter, taking nothing but a little bread as he walked along, towards the hill on which his {{principal}} employer lived, in a red house with black <b>outside</b> <b>shutters,</b> green inside blinds, a black street door, up two white steps, BOUNDERBY (in letters very like himself) upon a brazen plate, and a round brazen door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop.|$|R
6000|$|LOUKA. If you please, madam, all {{the windows}} are to be closed and the {{shutters}} made fast. They say there may be shooting in the streets. (Raina and Catherine rise together, alarmed.) The Servians are being chased right back through the pass; {{and they say they}} may run into the town. Our cavalry will be after them; and our people will be ready for them you may be sure, now that they are running away. (She goes out on the balcony and pulls the <b>outside</b> <b>shutters</b> to; then steps back into the room.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Philadelphia.--An old place, full of Dutch women, in [...] "bellus top" [...] bonnets, selling vegetables, in long, open markets. Every {{one seems}} to be {{scrubbing}} their white steps. All the houses look like tidy jails, with their <b>outside</b> <b>shutters.</b> Several have crape on the door-handles, and many have flags flying from roof or balcony. Few men appear, and the women seem to do the business, which, perhaps, accounts for its being so well done. Pass fine buildings, but don't know what they are. Would like to stop and see my native city; for, having left it {{at the tender age of}} two, my recollections are not vivid.|$|R

60|$|The Grimsel is CERTAINEMENT a {{wonderful}} place; {{situated at the}} bottom of a sort of huge crater, the sides of which are utterly savage GEBIRGE, composed of barren rocks which cannot even support a single pine ARBRE, and afford only scanty food for a herd of GMWKWLLOLP, it looks as if it must be completely BEGRABEN in the winter snows. Enormous avalanches fall against it every spring, sometimes covering everything to the depth of thirty or forty feet; and, in spite of walls four feet thick, and furnished with <b>outside</b> <b>shutters,</b> the two men who stay here when the VOYAGEURS are snugly quartered in their distant homes can tell you that the snow sometimes shakes the house to its foundations.|$|R
2500|$|Being {{produced}} to {{the same}} specification, both GE/ALCO and EMD MRS-1s are very similar in appearance and can easily be mistaken; they are both C-C road-switchers that are very low in profile in order to fit within European loading gauges.

60|$|She started {{forward again}} in the {{direction}} of her own house. He followed her at a sufficient interval to keep her faintly distinguishable figure in sight until she had crossed three streets, and {{near the end of the}} next block glided up the steps of a house not far from the one where he remembered to have left Blandford. As he joined her, she had just succeeded in opening the door with a pass-key, and was awaiting him. With a gesture of silence she took his hand in her cold fingers, and leading him softly through the dark hall and passage, quickly entered the kitchen. Here she lit a candle, turned, and faced him. He could see that the <b>outside</b> <b>shutters</b> were bolted, and the kitchen evidently closed for the night.|$|R
60|$|They went to Town {{three days}} later. While the taxi was {{skirting}} Lord's Cricket-ground, Gyp slipped {{her hand into}} Fiorsen's. She was brimful of excitement. The trees were budding in the gardens that they passed; the almond-blossom coming--yes, really coming! They were in the road now. Five, seven, nine--thirteen! Two more! There it was, nineteen, in white figures on the leaf-green railings, under the small green lilac buds; yes, and their almond-blossom was out, too! She could just catch a glimpse over those tall railings of the low white house with its green <b>outside</b> <b>shutters.</b> She jumped out almost {{into the arms of}} Betty, who stood smiling all over her broad, flushed face, while, from under each arm peered forth the head of a black devil, with pricked ears and eyes as bright as diamonds.|$|R

60|$|Carl {{had never}} made b'lieve fairies or princes; rather, {{he was in the}} secret world of boyhood a soldier, a trapper, or a swing-brakeman on the M. & D. R.R. But he was bespelled by the {{suggestion}} of grandeur in the iron fence and gracious trees and dark carriage-shed of the House with Shutters. It was a large, square, solid brick structure, set among oaks and sinister pines, once the home, or perhaps the mansion, of Banker Whiteley, but unoccupied for years. Leaves rotted before the deserted carriage-shed. The disregarded steps in front were seamed with shallow pools of water for days after a rain. The windows had always been darkened, but not by broad-slatted <b>outside</b> <b>shutters,</b> smeared with house-paint to which stuck tiny black hairs from the paint-brush, like the ordinary frame houses of Joralemon. Instead, these windows were masked with inside shutters haughtily varnished to a hard refined brown.|$|R

60|$|My trade lasted all winter--(that of 1813--14,) and by March I {{had gained}} {{the sum of}} eighty French crowns. Dollars I was afraid to hold {{on account of the}} base money. The ice now began to give way, and a few of us, who had been {{discussing}} the matter all winter, set about forming serious plans to escape. My confederates were a man of the name of Johnson, who had been taken in the Snapdragon privateer, and an Irishman of the name of Littlefield. Barnet, the Mozambique man, joined us also, making four in all. It was quite early in the month, when we made the attempt. Our windows were long, and had perpendicular bars of wrought iron to secure them, but no cross-bars. There was no glass; but <b>outside</b> <b>shutters,</b> that we could open at our pleasure. Outside of the windows were sentinels, and there were two rows of pickets between us and the shore.|$|R
60|$|When Jaaf first drew our {{attention}} to the Injins, they were advancing in a long line, by the highway, and at a moderate pace; leaving us time to shift our own position, did we deem it necessary. My uncle was of opinion it would never do to remain out on the lawn, exposed to so great a superiority of force, and he took his measures accordingly. In the first place, the females, mistresses and maids--and there were eight or ten of the last--were requested to retire, at once, to the house. The latter, with John at their head, were directed to close all the lower <b>outside</b> <b>shutters</b> of the building, and secure them within. This done, and the gate and two outer doors fastened, it would not be altogether without hazard to make an assault on our fortress. As no one required a second request to move, this part of the precaution was soon effected, and the house placed in a species of temporary security.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} {{controversy}} {{about the use of}} the skins, Daggett continuing to regard them as cargo. Necessity and numbers prevailed in the end, and the whole building was lined with them, four or five deep, by placing them inside of beckets made of the smaller rigging. By stuffing these skins compactly, within ropes so placed as to keep all snug, a very material defence against the entrance of cold was interposed. But this was not all. Inside of the skins Stimson got up hangings of canvass, using the sails of the wreck for that purpose. It was not necessary to cut these sails--Daggett would not have suffered it--but they were suspended, and crammed into openings, and otherwise so arranged as completely to conceal and shelter every side, as well as the ceilings of both rooms. Portions were fitted with such address as to fall before the windows, to which they formed very warm if not very ornamental curtains. Stephen, however, induced Roswell to order <b>outside</b> <b>shutters</b> to be made and hung; maintaining that one such shutter would soon count as a dozen cords of wood.|$|R
60|$|They {{went out}} without further discourse; and Mr. Bounderby piloted the new {{acquaintance}} who so strongly contrasted with him, {{to the private}} red brick dwelling, with the black <b>outside</b> <b>shutters,</b> the green inside blinds, and the black street door up the two white steps. In the drawing-room of which mansion, there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl Mr. James Harthouse had ever seen. She was so constrained, and yet so careless; so reserved, and yet so watchful; so cold and proud, and yet so sensitively ashamed of her husband's braggart humility - from which she shrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a blow; that {{it was quite a}} new sensation to observe her. In face she was no less remarkable than in manner. Her features were handsome; but their natural play was so locked up, that it seemed impossible to guess at their genuine expression. Utterly indifferent, perfectly self- reliant, never at a loss, and yet never at her ease, with her figure in company with them there, and her mind apparently quite alone - it was of no use 'going in' yet awhile to comprehend this girl, for she baffled all penetration.|$|R

60|$|Jim {{agreed to}} the {{prudence}} of the suggestion, and they {{went up to the}} house.

6000|$|It was {{simultaneous}} {{with the}} bang {{of a violent}} blow struck on the <b>outside</b> of the <b>shutter.</b> They could hear suddenly the snorting of a horse, the restive tramping of hoofs on the narrow, hard path {{in front of the}} house; the toe of a boot struck at the shutter again; a spur jingled at every blow, and an excited voice shouted, [...] "Hola! hola, in there!" ...|$|R
60|$|Meinik {{returned}} {{with him to}} the window, and posted himself outside, standing in the shadow; while Stanley stepped in through the open casement which, indeed, was provided only with a <b>shutter</b> <b>outside.</b> This would ordinarily have been closed but, owing to the illness of the prisoner, and the strong desire of the governor that he should live to be sent to Ava, it had been opened to allow a free passage of air.|$|R
6000|$|... "When Susan {{came from}} her room, to breakfast, at eight o'clock, I pointed out to her the {{extraordinary}} height and violence of the surf, and the singular appearance of the clouds of heavy rain sweeping down the valleys before us. At this time I had so little apprehension of what was coming, that I talked of riding down to the shore when the storm should abate, as I had never seen so fierce a sea. In {{about a quarter of}} an hour the House-Negroes came in, to close the <b>outside</b> <b>shutters</b> of the windows. They knew that the plantain-trees about the Negro houses had been blown down in the night; and had told the maid-servant Tyrrell, but I had heard nothing of it. A very few minutes after the closing of the windows, I found that the shutters of Tyrrell's room, at the south and commonly the most sheltered end of the House, were giving way. I tried to tie them; but the silk handkerchief which I used soon gave way; and as I had neither hammer, boards nor nails in the house, I could do nothing more to keep out the tempest. I found, in pushing at the leaf of the shutter, that the wind resisted, more as if it had been a stone wall or a mass of iron, than a mere current of air. There were one or two people outside trying to fasten the windows, and I went out to help; but we had no tools at hand: one man was blown down the hill in front of the house, before my face; and the other and myself had great difficulty in getting back again inside the door. The rain on my face and hands felt like so much small shot from a gun. There was great exertion necessary to shut the door of the house.|$|R
50|$|The Quaker Meetinghouse {{occupies}} a prominent position overlooking the Maple Street Cemetery {{from a high}} point near its western end. It is a simple rectangular two story wood frame building measuring 28 ft by 36 ft. In typical Quaker fashion, both the interior and exterior lack any significant ornamentation. The exterior is finished in wooden clapboards, and has an asymmetrical main facade with two entrances, one for men and one for women. The doors and <b>outside</b> window <b>shutters</b> are made of simple wooden planking. A chimney pierces the roof ridge near the building's western end. The interior was partitioned to separate {{the men from the}} women, although portions of the divider were movable. Seating consisted of benches, and there were fireplaces located on the women's side of both floors.|$|R
50|$|The {{triptych}} currently resides at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, Austria. The <b>outside</b> of the <b>shutters</b> panel {{are painted}} in grisaille on panel, while the inside shutters {{and the center}} panel are painted in oil. The left and right panels measure 167.7 x 60 cm and the center panel measures 164 x 127 cm.

5000|$|The deep eaves of the {{farmhouse}} roof helped {{to protect the}} interior from driving rain.

6000|$|Bell {{tried for}} a time to carry her head high; but Sandy ceased to whistle at his loom, and the scandal was a rolling stone that soon passed over him. Briefly it {{amounted}} to this: that a bairn born within two hours of midnight on Saturday {{could not have been}} ready for christening at the kirk next day without the breaking of the Sabbath. Had the secret of the nocturnal light been mine alone all might have been well; but Betsy Munn's evidence was irrefutable. Great had been Bell's cunning, but Betsy had outwitted her. Passing the house on the eventful night, Betsy had observed Marget Dundas, Bell's sister, open the door and creep cautiously to the window, the chinks in the <b>outside</b> <b>shutters</b> of which she cunningly closed up with [...] "tow." [...] As in a flash the disgusted Betsy saw what Bell was up to, and, removing the tow, planted herself behind the dilapidated dyke opposite, and awaited events. Questioned at a special meeting of the office-bearers in the vestry, she admitted that the lamp was extinguished soon after twelve o'clock, though the fire burned brightly all night. There had been unnecessary feasting during the night, and six eggs were consumed before breakfast-time. Asked how she knew this, she admitted having counted the egg-shells that Marget had thrown out of doors in the morning. This, with the testimony of the persons from whom Sandy had sought condolence on the Saturday night, was the case for the prosecution. For the defence, Bell maintained that all preparations stopped when the clock struck twelve, and even hinted that the bairn had been born on Saturday afternoon. But Sandy knew that he and his had got a fall. In the forenoon of the following Sabbath the minister preached from the text, [...] "Be sure your sin will find you out;" [...] and in the afternoon from [...] "Pride goeth before a fall." [...] He was grand. In the evening Sandy tendered his resignation of office, which was at once accepted. Wobs were behindhand for a week owing to the length of the prayers offered up for Bell; and Lang Tammas ruled in Sandy's stead.|$|R
25|$|Petrus Christus’ {{portrait}} of a bride and groom visiting a goldsmith is a typical example of a transitional still life depicting both religious and secular content. Though mostly allegorical in message, the figures of the couple are realistic and the objects shown (coins, vessels, etc.) are accurately painted but the goldsmith is actually a depiction of St. Eligius and the objects heavily symbolic. Another similar type of painting is the family portrait combining figures with a well-set table of food, which symbolizes both the piety of the human subjects and their thanks for God’s abundance. Around this time, simple still-life depictions divorced of figures (but not allegorical meaning) were beginning to be painted on the <b>outside</b> of <b>shutters</b> of private devotional paintings. Another step toward the autonomous still life was the painting of symbolic flowers in vases {{on the back of}} secular portraits around 1475. Jacopo de’ Barbari went a step further with his Still Life with Partridge, Iron Gloves, and Crossbow Arrows (1504), among the earliest signed and dated trompe-l'œil still-life paintings, which contains minimal religious content.|$|R
