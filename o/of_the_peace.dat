The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace),</b> and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of}} the campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E

5|$|In 1195 Walter {{issued an}} {{ordinance}} by which four knights were appointed in every hundred {{to act as}} guardians <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace,</b> a precursor {{to the office of}} Justice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Peace.</b> His use of the knights, who appear {{for the first time in}} political life, is the first sign of the rise of this class who, either as members of parliament or justices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace,</b> later became the mainstay of English government. In 1198, Walter requested a carucage, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or carucate, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar ordered them to be made by a sworn jury in every hundred. It is likely that those jurors were elected.|$|E
