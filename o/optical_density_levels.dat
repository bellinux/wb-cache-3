40|$|A {{high-end}} drum film digitiser (Tango, Germany) and a calibrated linear microdensitometer {{developed by}} PTB {{were used to}} assess the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the noise power spectra (NPS) of 3 mammographic screen film systems at <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> <b>levels</b> of 0. 8, 1. 5 and 2. 5. The use of a drum scanner to assess MTF and NPS data appears to be adequate but requires an appropriate characterisation of the scanner to verify its internal noise level and its MTF. It is further necessary to calibrate the scanner output in terms of visual diffuse optical densities. Processing of two-dimensional digital data of grating images need to be more strictly defined for accurate MTF measurements of screen-film systems. Nevertheless, even now it seems to be feasible to use commercially available high-end and well calibrated scanners to assess screen film systems. This is especially important for quality assurance purposes because important parameters of screen film systems such like MTF and NPS can now be determined without using sophisticated microdensitometers which are not commercially availabl...|$|E
40|$|Polysaccharides {{derived from}} Salmonella typhimurium {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) representing the O-antigen factors 1, 4, 5, and 12 and the O-antigen factors 6 and 7 from Salmonella choleraesuis LPS were derivatized with the photoreactive compound anthraquinone and subsequently covalently coupled to microtiter polystyrene plates by ultraviolet irradiation. Both polysaccharide antigens could be coupled simultaneously {{to the same}} microtiter plate. The coated surface was used in indirect ELISA for the determination of serum antibodies from pigs infected with bacteria of the two Salmonella groups and from uninfected pigs. This ELISA proved itself by having a good long-term durability and {{a high degree of}} reproducibility, including low day-to-day variations and low interplate variations. Furthermore, the ELISA showed good specificity and sensitivity when data were compared with the <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> <b>levels</b> of a panel of pig sera as determined by a conventional ELISA on the basis of passive coating of the two Salmonella LPS antigens (the mix-ELISA). The covalent anthraquinone mix-ELISA shows promise as a stable and durable alternative to the existing conventional ELISA for serological surveillance of Salmonella infections in pigs.

40|$|Background: Celiac {{disease is}} a life-long {{autoimmune}} condition, affecting genetically susceptible individuals that may present with thromboembolic phenomena. This thrombophilia represents a puzzle with multiple constituents: hyperhomocysteinemia, B 12 and folate deficiency, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutations, and protein C and S deficiency due to vitamin K deficiency. However, the well known thrombogenic factors, antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin and antiprothrombin have never been explored in celiac disease. Methods: The serum autoantibody levels were determined in 248 individuals, classified into three groups. Group 1 comprised 70 children with definitive celiac disease (age: 7. 04 ± 4. 3 years, male to female ratio 1. 06) and group 2 comprised 88 normal children (age: 6. 7 ± 4. 17 years, male to female ratio 0. 87), representing controls. The pediatric populations were compared to group 3, which included 90 adults who were family members (parents) of group 1 (age: 34. 6 ± 11. 35 years, male to female ratio 1. 2). Antibodies were checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

40|$|Background: Screening for IgA {{deficiency}} {{in patients with}} coeliac disease is essential because of the increased incidence of IgA deficiency associated with the disease, which usually relies on the estimation of IgA levels in each case. Aim: To devise a method of excluding IgA deficiency without measuring total serum IgA in each case. Materials and methods: The <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> readings on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of 608 routine samples received for tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibody testing for coeliac disease were compared with their total IgA concentrations. Dilution experiments were also carried out to ensure linear relationships between <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> on ELISA and IgA concentrations and to compare the sensitivities for TTG and endomysium antibodies in TTG-positive samples. Results and discussion: A clear relationship was shown between total IgA concentration and TTG <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> readings by ELISA. To ensure a positive TTG result if antibodies are present, {{it was possible to}} recommend an <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> <b>level</b> above which all samples have sufficient IgA. Samples with <b>optical</b> <b>density,</b> 0. 05 should be investigated further by estimating total IgA and, if low, samples should be subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy testing for IgA and IgG endomysium antibodies.

40|$|Introduction: Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) {{remains a}} very challenging diagnosis. The first {{objective of this}} study was to compare the performance of the IDH/PF 4 PaGIA (R) with the Asserachrom (R) HPIA ELISA. The main purpose was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the combination of the H/PF 4 PaGIA (R) with the clinical " 4 T's" score as a screening strategy. Materials and Methods: 102 patients with clinical suspicion of HIT were classified into risk groups using the 4 T's score. The presence of HIT antibodies was assessed by two immunoassays and confirmed by a functional flow cytometric assay. Results: Comparison of the ID-H/PF 4 PaGIA (R) with the Asserachrom (R) HPIA ELISA demonstrated a comparable technical performance, being an excellent screening test to rule out HIT (negative predictive value or NPV= 100 %). According to the 4 T's score, HIT was excluded in all tow risk patients (NPV= 100 %). ELISA <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly different between all riskgroups (P-values< 0. 01). In contrast, due to the tow positive predictive value (22 %) and weak positive likelihood ratio (2. 6), a positive ID-H/PF 4 PaGIA (R) result did not considerably increase the probability of HIT. Conclusion: Our study confirms the combination of the 4 T's score with the ID-H/PF 4 PaGIA (R) as a reliable strategy to rule out HIT. Yet, confirming positive ID-H/PF 4 PaGIA (R) results by flow cytometry within 1 - 2 h after blood sampling remains necessary. This novel clinical-laboratory approach can contribute in a rapid and reliable way to the definite diagnosis of HIT...|$|E

The main objective of the present work was to characterize the presence of neurotrophins in extraocular motoneurons and muscles of the adult rat. We also compared these results with those obtained from other cranial motor systems, such as facial and hypoglossal, which indeed suffer neurodegeneration. Immunocytochemical {{analysis was used to}} describe the expression of nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin- 3 in oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, facial, and hypoglossal nuclei of adult rats, and Western blots were used to describe the presence of neurotrophins in extraocular, facial (buccinator), and tongue muscles, which are innervated by the above-mentioned motoneurons. In brainstem samples, brain-derived neurotrophic factor was present both in extraocular and facial motoneuron somata, and to a lesser degree, in hypoglossal motoneurons. Neurotrophin- 3 was present in extraocular motor nuclei, while facial and hypoglossal motoneurons were almost devoid of this protein. Finally, nerve growth factor was not present in the soma of any group of motoneurons, although it was present in dendrites of motoneurons located in the neuropil. Neuropil <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> <b>levels</b> were higher in extraocular motoneuron nuclei when compared with facial and hypoglossal nuclei. Neurotrophins could be originated in target muscles, since Western blot analyses revealed the presence of the three molecules in all sampled muscles, to a larger extent in extraocular muscles when compared with facial and tongue muscles. We suggest that the different neurotrophin availability could be related to the particular resistance of extraocular motoneurons to neurodegeneration.

40|$|Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the causative {{agent of}} {{ruminant}} Johne's disease, presents a particular challenge {{with regard to}} infection mitigation on dairy farms. Diagnostic testing strategies to identify and quantify MAP and associated antibodies are imperfect, and certain facets {{of the relationship between}} diagnostic tests remain to be explored. Additional repeated-measures data from known infected animals are needed to complement the body of cross-sectional research on Johne's disease-testing methods. Statistical models that accurately account for multiple diagnostic results while adjusting for the effects of individual animals and herds over time can provide a more detailed understanding of the interplay between diagnostic outcomes. Further, test results may be considered as continuous wherever possible so as to avoid the information loss associated with dichotomization. To achieve a broader understanding of the relationship between diagnostic tests, we collected a large number of repeated fecal and milk samples from 14 infected cows, in addition to bulk milk samples, from 2 low-prevalence dairy herds in the northeast United States. Predominately through the use of mixed linear modeling, we identified strong associations between milk ELISA optical density, fecal quantitative PCR, and fecal culture in individual animals while concurrently adjusting for variables that could alter these relationships. Notably, we uncovered subtleties in the predictive abilities of fecal shedding level on milk ELISA results, with animals categorized as disease progressors reaching higher ELISA <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> <b>levels.</b> Moreover, we observed that spikes in fecal shedding could predict subsequent high ELISA values up to 2 mo later. We also investigated the presence of MAP in individual milk samples via PCR and noted an association between poor udder hygiene and MAP positivity in milk, suggesting some level of environmental contamination. The paucity of positive milk samples and the complete absence of detectable MAP in the bulk tank throughout the study period indicate that contamination of milk with MAP may not be of chief concern in low-prevalence herds. An enhanced understanding of the interrelationships between diagnostic tests can only benefit the development of testing strategies and objectives, which in turn may lessen MAP infection prevalence in dairy herds...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether genetic factors, which have been previously associated with cross-sectional macular pigment levels in the retina or serum lutein, also influence response to supplementation. To this end we conducted an association study in 310 subjects from the TwinsUK cohort between variants in 8 candidate genes and serum lutein and retinal macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (MPOD) <b>levels</b> before and after supplementation. Four variants were associated with MPOD response to supplementation (p <  0. 05) : rs 11057841 (SCARB 1), rs 4926339 (RPE 65), rs 1929841 (ABCA 1) and rs 174534 (FADS 1). We also confirmed previous associations between rs 6564851 near BMCO 1 (p <  0. 001) and rs 11057841 within SCARB 1 (p =  0. 01) and baseline measures of serum lutein; while the latter was also associated with MPOD response, none of the BMCO 1 variants were. Finally, there was evidence for association between variants near RPE 65 and ELOVL 2 and changes in lutein concentration after supplementation. This study is the first to show association between genetic variants and response to carotenoids supplementation. Our findings suggest an important link between MP response and the biological processes of carotenoids transport and fatty acid metabolism...|$|R

We performed a screening of two compound libraries, the Enzo and the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM) oncology collection library, for anti-Candida activity based on the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. From a total of 844 drugs, 26 agents showed activity against Candida albicans. Of those, 12 were standard antifungal drugs (SADs) and 7 were off-target drugs previously reported to be active against Candida spp. The remaining 7 off-target drugs, amonafide, tosedostat, megestrol acetate, melengestrol acetate, stanozolol, trifluperidol, and haloperidol, were identified with this screen.

Materials and Methods: Four experimental batches of trivalent FMD vaccine were prepared with different available oil adjuvants which included Montanide ISA 201, 206, 61 and 50. Results: The results indicated that vaccines emulsified using Montanide ISA 201 and Montanide ISA 206 adjuvants elicited a protective humoral immune response from the 2 nd week postvaccination (WPV) as for ISA 201 with serum neutralization test (SNT) and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) antibody titers of 1. 62 ± 0. 047 a and 1. 8 ± 0. 049 a, 1. 59 ± 0. 076 a and 1. 836 ± 0. 077 a, and 1. 71 ± 0. 06 b and 1. 96 ± 0. 074 b for serotypes O, A, SAT 2, respectively, and for ISA 206 at SNT and ELISA antibody titers of 1. 5 ± 0. 082 a and 1. 84 ± 0. 084 a, 1. 56 ± 0. 037 a and 1. 818 ± 0. 052 a, and 1. 5 ± 0. 106 a,b and 1. 81 ± 0. 104 a,b for FMD virus serotypes O, A and SAT 2, respectively. For ISA 61 and ISA 50, the protective antibody titer appeared in the 3 rd WPV. In the ISA 61 FMD vaccine, SNT and ELISA titer were 1. 59 ± 0. 076 a and 1. 9 ± 0. 094 a, 1. 53 ± 0. 056 a and 1. 83 ± 0. 070 a, and 1. 5 ± 0. 082 a and 1. 84 ± 0. 094 a for serotypes O, A and SAT 2, respectively, and in the case of ISA 50 FMD vaccine, the SNT, and ELISA titer were recorded for serotypes O, A and SAT 2 respectively, 1. 59 ± 0. 037 a and 1. 8 ± 0. 030 a, 1. 68 ± 0. 056 a,b and 1. 916 ± 0. 065 a,b, and 1. 65 ± 0. 082 a and 1. 9 ± 0. 09 a. On estimating the cellular immune response, the highest delta <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> <b>levels</b> for ISA 201 (0. 395 - 0. 460) and ISA 206 (0. 375 - 0. 428) were observed on 14 and 21 days post vaccination (DPV) respectively, while the highest levels of lymphoproliferation for ISA 61 (0. 375 - 0. 455) and ISA 50 (0. 411 - 0. 430) were on 21 and 28 DPV, respectively. Conclusion: The duration of immunity from Montanide ISA oils (201, 206, 61 and 50) FMD vaccines is a long-lived immunity which ranged between 32 and 38 weeks post vaccination but the Montanide ISA 201 FMD vaccine is superior to the others in the rapid cellular immune response of the vaccinated animals which showed its highest level within 14 days post vaccination...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{involved a}} number of related studies with the principal aim of assessing the variability in chromatic sensitivity in "normal" trichromats and colour deficient observers. An important outcome was {{the development of a}} new method for accurate and efficient measurement of chromatic sensitivity and the establishment of reliable statistical limits that describe the distribution of redgreen(RG) and yellow-blue (YB) chromatic sensitivity in normal trichromats. Chromatic sensitivity was assessed using a computer-based psychophysical procedure that employs spatiotemporal luminance contrast (LC) masking techniques to isolate the use of colour signals. The colour-defined stimuli were buried in dynamic LC noise and moved diagonally across a square. The subject's task is to indicate one of the four possible directions of stimulus motion by pressing the corresponding response button. The Colour Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test was optimised for stimulus size and background luminance level to provide an efficient measure RG and YB chromatic sensitivity. Colour detection thresholds are assessed along 16 directions in chromaticity space, selected to yield maximum information on RG and YB chromatic sensitivity loss and to distinguish between deutan and protan deficiencies. The CAD test was used to measure chromatic discrimination thresholds in 472 observers. The results made it possible to evaluate the screening and diagnostic efficiency of the CAD test in comparison with {{a number of}} established clinical colour vision tests, e. g., Nagel anomaloscope and Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plates. The specificity and sensitivity of the CAD test versus the Nagel anomaloscope (223 subjects) was found to be 100 % and 97. 5 %, respectively. The diagnostic agreement with respect to the Nagel anomaloscope was 0. 99; only two subjects showed inconsistent classification deficiency. Chromatic thresholds measured in normal trichromats were also examined and the variability amongst normal colour vision was investigated. The data obtained were used to establish the statistical limits for the standard normal observer on the CAD test. A template based on these limits was generated and provides an efficient way of separating accurately colour deficient from normal trichromats. The high specificity found is consistent with the correct detection of minimal colour deficiencies that sometimes go undetected in other colour vision tests. Molecular genetic analysis was also carried out in a small group of subjects with unusual colour deficiencies in an attempt to understand the genotype-phenotype relationship between predicted and observed colour vision losses. A comparison of genetic results from DNA sequencing and chromatic detection thresholds measured on the CAD test suggests that the separation of 30 nm between peak sensitivity of L and M normal photoreceptor pigments is not an absolute requirement for an observer to exhibit normal colour vision as assessed with conventional colour vision tests. The macular pigment (MP) optical density was also measured in 23 subjects selected for their higher than normal levels of pigment as a result of their participation in a carotenoid supplementation trial. This pre-receptoral filter absorbs light preferentially in the short wavelength region of the visible spectrum and has been shown to affect colour matches. Contrary to expectations, the findings of this investigation showed no correlation between YB thresholds and MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> <b>levels.</b> A model that explains this finding was produced confirming the observed experimental findings. In addition, the model also predicts a small improvement in RG chromatic discrimination sensitivity with increased MP optical density in the eye...|$|E

The subjects were recruited from 1995 to 2000 {{as part of an}} ongoing cancer case control study. Cases were patients with newly diagnosed cancers of the cervix (n = 946), other anogenital organs (n = 80), the oral cavity and pharynx (n = 102), the oesophagus (n = 369) or the prostate (n = 205). The comparison group consisted of 2, 055 age and sex-matched patients randomly selected from the same data base, diagnosed at the same hospitals, but with a vascular disease or with a cancer unrelated to HPV infection. Subjects' sera were randomly and blindly allocated onto ELISA plates. <b>Optical</b> <b>density</b> (OD) <b>levels</b> of anti-HPV- 16 IgG of > 0. 45 and ≥ 0. 767 were taken to be cut-offs for negative, medium and high antibody levels.

40|$|Two-dimensional {{infrared}} spectroscopy {{is a powerful}} tool for studying molecular structure and kinetics. However, standard ways of implementing the technique are not amenable to samples with high <b>optical</b> <b>densities.</b> In this paper, we demonstrate that a shaper-based automated 2 D IR spectrometer largely compensates for most of the distortions caused by high <b>optical</b> <b>densities.</b> By comparing a series of 2 D IR spectra collected with varying concentrations and sample thicknesses, we find that high quality 2 D IR spectra can be obtained at <b>optical</b> <b>densities</b> of > 1. 2 when these spectra are collected using a pulse shaping method recently developed in our lab. Furthermore, distortions due to high OD primarily appear along the pump axis and are largely absent along the probe axis. Using this knowledge, we have applied our approach to study a high <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> sample of a truncated form of the human islet amyloid peptide that is involved in Type 2 diabetes. Our methodology promises to aid in the interpretation of 2 D IR lineshapes for systems where the <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> cannot be controlled, such as in protein folding or chemical reactions where large changes in <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> occur during the kinetics. close 3...|$|R

30|$|The {{experiment}} {{results showed}} that <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> of oil (Fig.  8) decreases after each subsequent filtration stage because asphaltenes are deposited {{on the surface of}} the pore space and their concentration in oil at outlet from the core is reduced. It can be assumed that relative change in <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> will characterize the same relative decrease in the amount of asphaltenes in oil in accordance with the Bouguer–Lambert–Beer law. <b>Optical</b> <b>density</b> of the initial oil corresponds to asphaltene concentration of 0.76 % by weight. In accordance with Eq.  13, concentrations of asphaltenes in oil after filtration stages of 2, 3 and 4 are 0.69 %, 0.59 % and 0.36 %, respectively. Degassed oil in the core (filtration stage 4) has the lowest <b>optical</b> <b>density.</b>|$|R
40|$|This review {{compares the}} results of studies that have {{investigated}} the impact of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (MPOD) with those that have investigated the reliability of techniques used to measure macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density.</b> The review will focus on studies that have used heterochromatic flicker photometry for measurement of macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density,</b> as {{this is the only}} technique that is currently available commercially to clinicians. We identified articles that reported on supplementation with lutein and/or zeaxanthin and/or meso-zeaxanthin on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> measurement techniques published in peer-reviewed journals, through a multi-staged, systematic approach. Twenty-four studies have investigated the repeatability of MPOD measurements using heterochromatic flicker photometry. Of these, 10 studies provided a coefficient of repeatability or data from which the coefficient could be calculated, with a range in values of 0. 06 to 0. 58. The lowest coefficient of repeatability assessed on naïve subjects alone was 0. 08. These values tell us that, at best, changes greater than 0. 08 can be considered clinically significant and at worst, only changes greater than 0. 58 can be considered clinically significant. Six studies assessed the effect of supplementation with up to 20 mg/day lutein on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> measured using heterochromatic flicker photometry and the mean increase in macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> ranged from 0. 025 to 0. 09. It seems reasonable to conclude that the chance of eliciting an increase in macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> during six months of daily supplementation with between 10 and 20 mg lutein that is of sufficient magnitude to be detected by using heterochromatic flicker photometry on an individual basis is small. Commercially available heterochromatic flicker photometers for macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> assessment in the clinical environment appear to demonstrate particularly poor coefficient of repeatability values. Clinicians should exercise caution when considering the purchase of these instruments for potential monitoring of macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> in response to supplementation in individual patients...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that macular pigment (MP) and melanin may protect against age-related maculopathy (ARM). To check this, MP and melanin <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> were measured in a random population-based sample of subjects 55 years of age or older. Spectral fundus reflectance of the fovea was measured in one eye per subject in a 2. 3 degrees detection field with a fundus reflectometer. The sample consisted of 199 men and 236 women. Analysis with a fundus reflectance model yielded individual estimates for the MP and melanin <b>optical</b> <b>density.</b> Diagnosis of ARM was based on grading of standardized fundus transparencies. Eyes were stratified in four exclusive stages of ARM. MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (at 460 nm) was 0. 33 +/- 0. 15 in eyes without ARM (n = 289) and 0. 33 +/- 0. 16 in eyes at any stage of ARM (n = 146). Melanin <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (at 500 nm) was 1. 18 +/- 0. 19 in eyes without ARM and 1. 20 +/- 0. 21 in eyes at any stage of ARM.

Methods: MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (measured psychophysically using heterochromatic flicker photometry [HFP]), and serum concentrations of L and Z (quantified using high-performance liq-uid chromatography [HPLC]), were recorded every month for 24 consecutive months. Results: Mean MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (±SD) was 0. 361 (0. 086) and 0. 369 (0. 074) for right and left eyes, respectively.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> of two microfilled and two microhybrid resins, {{as well as}} the composition of these materials with regard to their <b>optical</b> <b>density.</b> Cavities prepared in 12 2 -mm- or 4 -mm-thick acrylic plastic plates were filled with Z 250 (3 M-ESPE), A 110 (3 M-ESPE), Charisma (Heraeus-Kulzer) and DurafillVS (Heraeus-Kulzer). The resin increments (2 -mm-thick) were light-cured for 40 s. Three 0. 12 -s radiographic exposures were made of each # 2 acrylic plastic plate. DenOptix system optical plates were used to obtain the digital images. Three readings of the composite resin surface were made in each radiograph, totalizing 216 readings. The mean of highest and lowest grey-scale values was obtained. Two specimens of each composite resin were prepared for SEM analysis of the chemical elements related to <b>optical</b> <b>density,</b> using energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX). The results were subjected to Shapiro-Wilk's test, ANOVA, Tukey's test at 1 % level of significance and Pearson's correlation. The mean grey-scale values at 2 mm and 4 mm were: Z 250 = 154. 27 a and 185. 33 w; A 110 = 46. 77 b and 63. 05 y; Charisma = 163. 40 c and 200. 46 z; DurafillVS = 43. 92 b and 58. 99 x, respectively.
