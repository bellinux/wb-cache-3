50|$|The {{air-cooled}} engine has a gear-driven counterbalancer {{as well as}} a proprietary cylinder wall plating similar to a Nikasil coating. The coating, marketed as Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material or SCEM, is nickel-phosphorus-silicon-carbide based, reducing weight (by eliminating a steel liner) and improving heat transfer, allowing for tighter and more efficient piston-to-cylinder clearance. Valves are adjustable via 'screw and locknut' type clearance adjusters. The engine features an <b>oil</b> sump <b>sight</b> <b>glass,</b> enabling visual <b>oil</b> checks, and uses 87 octane fuel.|$|R
50|$|The {{one piece}} {{lubricator}} {{body is a}} gunmetal casting and incorporates the condensing chamber, the oil reservoir and the <b>sight</b> <b>glasses.</b> Passages within the body interconnect these areas. The body is fitted with a steam valve, a water valve, an <b>oil</b> control valve. <b>Sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are fitted at the front & back of the body {{on each of the}} feeds, these feeds are fitted with individual feed regulating valves for controlling the feed rate for each outlet. The oil control valve was used to either turn the supply off/on, or to shut off the supply to the cylinders and just supply the air compressor with oil whilst the locomotive is stationary on lubricators with a center feed. Each feed is also fitted with a drain valve for cleaning each <b>sight</b> <b>glass.</b> The body is also fitted with an oil chamber drain for draining the condensed water from the oil chamber.|$|R

50|$|Industrial {{observational}} instruments {{have changed}} with industry itself. More structurally sophisticated than the water gauge, the contemporary <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> — {{also called the}} sight window or sight port — {{can be found on}} the media vessel at chemical plants and in other industrial settings, including pharmaceutical, food, beverage and bio gas plants. <b>Sight</b> <b>glasses</b> enable operators to visually observe processes inside tanks, pipes, reactors and vessels. The modern industrial <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> is a glass disk held between two metal frames, which are secured by bolts and gaskets, or the glass disc is fused to the metal frame during manufacture. The glass used for this purpose is either soda lime glass or borosilicate glass, and the metal, usually a type of stainless steel, is chosen for desired properties of strength. Borosilicate glass is superior to other formulations in terms of chemical corrosion resistance and temperature tolerance, as well as transparency. Fused <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are also called mechanically prestressed glass, because the glass is strengthened by compression of the metal ring. Heat is applied to a glass disc and its surrounding steel ring, causing a fusion of the materials. As the steel cools, it contracts, compressing the glass and making it resistant to tension. Because glass typically breaks under tension, mechanically prestressed glass is unlikely to break and endanger workers. The strongest <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are made with borosilicate glass, because of the greater difference in its coefficient of expansion.|$|R

50|$|The 7th Class {{represented}} a considerable advance {{in design and}} power. They were the first South African locomotives to be equipped with sight feed lubricators which allowed a <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> to be positioned in the cab, where the rate of oil feed to the cylinders could be observed.

5000|$|The {{separator}} is {{only effective}} {{as long as}} there is an air space inside the chamber. The separator can fail if either the mixed inlet is overwhelmed with supply material, or the liquid drain is unable to handle the volume of liquid being collected. The separator may therefore be combined with some other liquid level sensing mechanism such as a <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> or float sensor. In this manner, both the supply and drain flow can be regulated to prevent the separator from becoming overloaded. (Agastya, Bayu) ...|$|R

50|$|The 1970s {{were the}} heyday of Malins Engineers. The MM1 {{received}} a vaporising burner in 1970, both Minors got overflow plugs in 1975, the engines were converted to solid fuel in 1977 for the domestic market (it had happened earlier for export) and in 1978 the entire range (except for the MM1) received <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> on the boiler instead of the overflow plug. By the late 1970s the range was looking tired and so, with considerable investment from the Malins family, in 1979 the SE range was superseded by the SP range.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{technical}} feasibility of a pilot treatment train of ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis (RO), and multi-effect distillation (MED) for coal seam gas (CSG) produced water treatment. A total of 12, 000 L of CSG produced water was processed from the Gloucester Basin in New South Wales (Australia). The results demonstrate the technical feasibility {{to obtain an}} overall clean water recovery of 95 % and a final brine containing mostly sodium bicarbonate up to of 48 g/L. Stable operations of the pilot RO and MED systems at 76 % and 80 % recovery, respectively, were achieved. The results show that anti-scalant addition could effectively prevent scaling during MED operation. Mass balance analysis and analytical measurement suggest that precipitation of calcium, magnesium and silica might have occurred. Indeed, mineral deposition on the <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> of the MED evaporative chamber became visible after 3 days of continuous operation. However, no evidence of mineral precipitation or scaling could be observed on the evaporative tubes of the MED system. In addition, the mineral deposition on the <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> was completed removed by chemical cleaning {{at the end of}} the pilot evaluation program. The obtained RO permeate and MED distillate were of high quality and could be blended with UF filtrated CSG produced water for irrigation to reduce the treatment demand...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the days}} runs, the train is shoved back to clear the shop lead switch, with the cars being tied down, and the engine spotted for the night of the track pans to clean the fire the next morning. The fire is banked and the boiler is filled with water to sit through the {{overnight}} hours. Once that is complete the <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are shut off, along with the air compressor and check valves to the boiler, the dynamo, blower, and injector lines are closed, and finally the turret is shut off and the stack is gagged.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{is drawn}} from the sump by the oil pump and {{delivered}} to the three inner main bearings and to the other bearings within the crank chamber. Oil is led into {{the centre of the}} crankpins by oil scoops which lubricate the big end bearings from inside. The end main bearings and each of the four cylinders receive measured doses of oil through a mechanical automatic lubricator. This lubricator, driven by chain, contains positive pumps to force the oil through each of six feed-pipes. Mounted on the dashboard the lubricator's <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> give visual confirmation oil is circulating.|$|R
5000|$|Compressed air {{enters the}} inlet port and passes over a needle valve orifice {{attached}} to a pick-up tube. This tube - often equipped with a sintered bronze filter - is submerged into a reservoir bowl filled with light machine oil. Oil is pulled up by the venturi effect, and emitted as an aerosol at the outlet port. The needle valve is typically situated within a clear polycarbonate or nylon housing to aid in oil flow rate adjustment.Some compressor oils and external chemicals can cause polycarbonate and/or nylon <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> to be degraded and create a safety hazard ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report shows}} that inlet air {{velocity}} {{can play a}} critical role in maintaining proper fluidization and, ultimately, uniform drying. The mechanism by which air velocity affects fluidization has been discussed by various researchers [4 – 5]. An indication of good fluidization is a free downward flow of the granules at the <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> of the drying bowl, but such limited observation could be misleading. In such cases, the exhaust air temperature can be used to detect poor fluidization. If the exhaust air temperature rises more rapidly than anticipated, as seen with process 1 (Figure 1), it is an indication that fluidization is incomplete...|$|R
50|$|The DV {{range was}} {{available}} in range of sizes with capacities ranging from 8 to 36 pints, {{and the number of}} feeds from 1 to 26. Each of the lubricators consist of a reservoir, a ratchet assembly, a sliding shaft assembly, and the pump units. A screwed oil filler cap is fitted to the lockable hinged lid of the reservoir and a <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> for indicating the oil level is fitted to the front face of the reservoir. The pumps of the DV type lubricator are operated by a sliding shaft assembly, unlike the Silverton or Wakefield lubricators which are operated by a rotating camshaft.|$|R
50|$|The SP3 {{was based}} on the MEC1 Meccano engine, which first {{appeared}} in 1965. It was basically the same except for a solid fuel burner, <b>sight</b> <b>glass,</b> whistle instead of the steam dome, plastic gears instead of metal ones on the crank shaft for driving Meccano models. It carried two makers marks — a Mamod and a Meccano type scalloped edge decal. The baseplate was silver painted. The boiler was a standard Mamod drawn type tube as used on the SP2, SP4 and SR1a. It could drive the whole series of workshop tools. The exhaust was a simple open port in the engine frame as per the MEC1.|$|R
