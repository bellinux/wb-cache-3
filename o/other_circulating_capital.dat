40|$|The goal of {{the article}} lies in {{identification}} of impact of the fiscal policy {{on the state of}} <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> in the corporate sector in Ukraine and in other countries. The article underlines conceptual approaches to improvement of the state tax policy with consideration of a necessity of formation of own financial resources for formation of <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> by subjects of the corporate sector. It justifies scientific and practical measures on reduction of the tax load on the production capital, that is, on that part of the fixed and <b>circulating</b> <b>capital,</b> which regularly and directly participates in creation of the added value. It offers a list of tax privileges for subjects of the corporate sector that direct profit into accumulation of the own capital base, including in the part of increase of the <b>circulating</b> <b>capital.</b> Realisation of the proposed recommendations should facilitate fast accumulation of financial resources for further formation of the <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> in the corporate sector, since this is an indispensable condition of high efficiency of corporate finance and economic activity in general...|$|R

50|$|As noted above, the {{distinction}} between constant and variable capital overlaps with {{the distinction}} between fixed <b>capital</b> and <b>circulating</b> <b>capital.</b> Constant capital has both fixed and circulating components: for example, the fixed constant capital would include a factory and the machinery in it, while the <b>circulating</b> constant <b>capital</b> would include the raw materials used and the intermediate inputs produced by the factory.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, I do {{not believe}} that, as things are {{actually}} transacted, improvements in production are often, if ever, injurious, even temporarily, to the laboring-classes in the aggregate. They would be so if they took place suddenly to a great amount, {{because much of the}} capital sunk must necessarily in that case be provided from funds already employed as <b>circulating</b> <b>capital.</b> But improvements are always introduced very gradually, and are seldom or never made by withdrawing <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> from actual production, but are made by the employment of the annual increase. I doubt if there would be found a single example of a great increase of fixed capital, at a time and place where <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> was not rapidly increasing likewise.|$|R

There is hardly any increase of fixed capital which does not enable the country to contain eventually a larger <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> than it otherwise could possess and employ within its own limits; for there is hardly any creation of fixed capital which, when it proves successful, does not cheapen the articles on which wages are habitually expended.|$|R

40|$|Economists have {{neglected}} {{to study the}} phenomenon of vanishing uncertainties and risks in the production process as maturing goods approach the final consumer who is eager to buy them at established prices. We fill this gap in resurrecting Adam Smith’s long-forgotten notion of social <b>circulating</b> <b>capital.</b> Then the propensity to consume appears as the volume, and the discount rate as the marginal productivity of social <b>circulating</b> <b>capital.</b> It {{turns out that the}} rate of interest and the discount rate are entirely different concepts animated by entirely different forces.

5000|$|Fixed {{capital is}} a concept in {{economics}} and accounting, first theoretically analyzed in some depth by the economist David Ricardo. It refers {{to any kind of}} real or physical capital (fixed asset) that is not used up in the production of a product. It contrasts with <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> such as raw materials, operating expenses and the like.|$|R
60|$|There {{is a great}} {{difference}} between the effects of circulating and those of fixed capital, {{on the amount of}} the gross produce of the country. <b>Circulating</b> <b>capital</b> being destroyed as such, the result of a single use must be a reproduction equal to the whole amount of the <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> used, and a profit besides. This, however, is by no means necessary in the case of fixed capital. Since machinery, for example, is not wholly consumed by one use, it is not necessary that it should be wholly replaced from the product of that use. The machine answers the purpose of its owner if it brings in, during each interval of time, enough to cover the expense of repairs, and the deterioration in value which the machine has sustained during the same time, with a surplus sufficient to yield the ordinary profit on the entire value of the machine.|$|R
