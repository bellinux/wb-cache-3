40|$|Abstract. I {{will present}} {{the state of the}} art of the final {{sensitivity}} calibration of the STIS spectroscopic echelle modes. This includes 1) the derivation of a new absolute sensitivity for all primary settings, 2) a quantification of sensitivity variations as a function of time, 3) a characterization of the echelle blaze function (shape and shift) versus time and location on the detector (e. g., changes due to monthly <b>offsettings),</b> and 4) the determination of an on-orbit absolute sensitivity calibration for all secondary settings. I will quantify the improvements in terms of flux accuracies, and I will give an overview of the tools implemented into the pipeline in order to correctly take the above mentioned issues into account when calibrating STIS echelle data. 1...|$|E
40|$|CONCLUSION The {{analysis}} of the exposure measurement problem {{has shown that the}} proper measurement of counterparty exposure for portfolios of derivatives transactions is a complex task that cannot be performed without making a lot of simplifying assumptions. Because of the complicated interaction of correlation effects and <b>offsettings</b> from different transactions, the single transaction framework which is currently used by most banks is definitely not capable of accurately determining the portfolio credit risk. When simulation techniques are applied to estimate exposure, the accuracy of exposure estimations can be increased significantly. However, a lot of modelling choices has to be made concerning the valuation of transactions and the stochastic model of underlying market rates. Because the system has to make projections of market rates into the far future, the choice of an appropriate stochastic model for market rate dynamics is crucial in order to prevent unreasonable scenarios. The predominant application of models based on Brownian Motion in today’s bank risk management therefore leads to questionable results in respect to derivatives exposure evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract One of the {{available}} techniques of constructing circular models, offsetting has not been paid much attention, in particular {{for the construction of}} arc models. Here making use of the method of offsetting on bivariate distributions, l-arc models are constructed. The method of transforming a bivariate linear random variable to its directional component is called <b>OFFSETTING</b> and the respective distribution of directional component is called OFFSET DISTRIBUTION which is a univariate circular model. By employing the concept of arc models, we obtain Offset Semicircular Cauchy model. Here we obtain Arc models directly by applying offsetting on a linear bivariate models such as Bivariate Beta and Bivariate Exponential models. Existence of these arc models occur in natural phenomenon. Some of the newly proposed semicircular/arc models are bimodal models and the population characteristics of the offset semicircular and arc models are studied...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the biodiversity offsetting programme for England {{initiated by the}} UK government in 2011 and abandoned in 2014. Offsetting enables developers to purchase biodiversity credits, representing conservation gain somewhere else, to compensate for residual loss on the development site, ensuring no net loss of biodiversity overall. Recent years have seen increasing interest globally in market-based instruments for nature conservation, which advocates promise will deliver win-win outcomes, facilitating economic growth and safeguarding of nature at the same time, through market efficiencies. Political ecologists, on the other hand, have long highlighted the contradictions encountered in efforts to commodify nature. Drawing on Marxist political ecologies and literature on the neoliberalisation of nature, this thesis examines why the UK government was unable to establish its proposed biodiversity offsetting programme in a particular geographical and historical setting, in a climate of fiscal austerity and growth-orientated deregulation. As the government attempted to enrol sympathetic actors, disputes soon emerged over the purpose and technical details of the proposals. Deeper tensions were quickly revealed: the government’s non-negotiable position that offsetting should impose no new costs on developers, {{that it should be}} voluntary and that no new resources would be provided for planning authorities administering the policy locally, meant that it could not convince <b>offsetting’s</b> advocates – let alone its detractors – that it would achieve either meaningful biodiversity outcomes. Nor could it stimulate a substantial offset market, which it hoped would lubricate the planning system and accelerate land development, which was its primary goal. The thesis explores how the government’s non-interventionist, strictly pro-growth conditions played out in different moments of the policymaking process. It argues that it was precisely <b>offsetting’s</b> appeal to government, predicated on its promise of a win-win for development and conservation, in a neoliberal world of limited and diminishing public resources, which undermined the possibility of its implementation. Though the English case is specific, the thesis concludes that this underlying tension appears politically hard-wired into the very concept of offsetting, raising questions over its meaningful implementation anywhere...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography, photographs, figures. In {{this thesis}} I examine the United Kingdom?s {{biodiversity}} offsetting program. Offsetting {{is a new}} form of "market-based" conservation and an attempt by environmentalists and bureaucrats to "sell nature to save it" (McAffee, 1999). Critics contend that such programs intensify the commodification of nature "all the way down," producing financial products out of un-consumable species diversity. However, by tracing the enactment of biodiversity offsetting on a field in the Vale of Whitehorse through the eyes of six key-informants, I argue that the narrative of commodification along with the offsetting program's functioning run into multiple barriers [...] but that some offsets nonetheless occur. To understand the paradoxical phenomena of the labors that enable exchange also pulling apart nature's commodity-form, I first observe the development of a metric and to produce biodiversity commodities. I show the cognitive failures that the commodity's coherence rested upon. One failure in particular, the orderliness of bureaucratic practice, serves as the point of departure for my examination of <b>offsetting's</b> implementation in the field. Through this examination I argue that the processes of producing of biodiversity's commodity-form were not compatible with those of producing the state's claims to legitimacy, and became subsumed within these bureaucratic procedures. Using Bruno Latour's concept of "circulating references" I argue that the logics of ecosystem commodities produced by regulatory fiat stretch the logics of administrative claims to legitimate domination in uncomfortable and potentially destabilizing ways. This, I suggest, causes low-level administrators to produce bureaucratic nature, and not, as the program intends, commodified nature, for fear of losing their legitimacy. I conclude that the political ecology of environmental governance could benefit from an increased focus on everyday state practices...|$|R
