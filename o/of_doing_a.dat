5|$|In the mid-1980s, Nickelodeon was {{approached}} by production and consulting groups with the idea <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> game show for children, a first for the network. Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults, {{but they did not}} have a game show targeted at their demographic. Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse Trap. The pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby. Double Dare was green-lighted and announced in June 1986.|$|E

The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he paid id a US$100,000 advance on the project. Mark Rein, who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> retail Wolfenstein project to FormGen, which had published id's December 1991 Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter, overcoming the publisher's concerns over Wolfensteins proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the idea}} <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> {{straight}} re-release {{of the game}} initially seemed like a straight-forward task, the implementation proved somewhat more complicated, due to the different architectures of a PC and a DS.
