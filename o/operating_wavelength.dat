50|$|All {{optical fibers}} undergo some darkening {{depending}} {{on a number}} of factors that include: ionization type, optical fiber core glass composition, <b>operating</b> <b>wavelength,</b> dose rate, total accumulated dose, temperature and power propagating through the core. Since attenuation is composition dependent, it is observed that fibers having pure silica cores and fluorine down doped claddings are amongst the most radiation hard fibers. The presence of dopants in the core such as germanium, phosphorus, boron, aluminum, erbium, ytterbium, thulium, holmium etc. compromises the radiation hardness of optical fibers. To minimize damage consequences, it is better to use a pure silica core fiber at higher <b>operating</b> <b>wavelength,</b> lower dose rate, lower total accumulated dose, higher temperature (accelerated recovery) and higher signal power (photo-bleaching). In addition to these intrinsic steps, external engineering may be required to shield the fiber from the effects of radiation.|$|E

40|$|In principle, multiwavelength {{radiation}} thermometry {{allows one}} to correctly measure the temperature of surfaces of unknown and varying surface emissivity. Unfortunately, none of the practical realizations proposed in the past proved to be sufficiently reliable because of a strong influence of the errors arising from incorrect modeling of the emissivity and of {{the limited number of}} <b>operating</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> The use of array detectors allows a high degree of flexibility both in terms of number and spectral position of the working wavelength bands. In the case of applications at high temperatures, i. e., near 2000 C or above, an analysis of the theoretical measuring principles of multiwavelength thermometry, suggests the opportunity of investigating the possible advantages in extending the <b>operating</b> <b>wavelengths</b> toward the ultraviolet region. To this purpose, a simulation program was developed which allows investigation of the effect of different influencing parameters.

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of a profilometer {{is that it}} is not accurate when the size of the features of the surface are close to the same size as the stylus. Another disadvantage is that profilometers have difficulty detecting flaws of the same general size as the roughness of the surface. There are also limitations for non-contact instruments. For example, instruments that rely on optical interference cannot resolve features that are less than some fraction of the <b>operating</b> <b>wavelength.</b> This limitation can make it difficult to accurately measure roughness even on common objects, since the interesting features may be well below the wavelength of light. The wavelength of red light is about 650 nm, while the average roughness, (Ra) of a ground shaft might be 200 nm.|$|E

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1936, it was {{realized}} that the Luftwaffe would turn to night bombing if the day campaign did not go well, and Watson-Watt had put another of the staff from the Radio Research Station, Edward Bowen, in charge of developing a radar that could be carried by a fighter. Night time visual detection of a bomber was good to about 300 m, and the existing Chain Home systems simply {{did not have the}} accuracy needed to get the fighters that close.

50|$|The {{simplest}} absorption scheme can {{be applied}} to TESs operating in the near-IR, optical, and UV regimes. These devices generally utilize a tungsten TES as its own absorber, which absorbs up to 20% of the incident radiation. If high-efficiency detection is desired, the TES may be fabricated in a multi-layer optical cavity tuned to the desired <b>operating</b> <b>wavelength</b> and employing a backside mirror and frontside anti-reflection coating. Such techniques can decrease the transmission and reflection from the detectors to negligibly low values; 95% detection efficiency has been observed. At higher energies, the primary obstacle to absorption is transmission, not reflection, and thus an absorber with high photon stopping-power and low heat capacity is desirable; a bismuth film is often employed. Any absorber should have low heat capacity with respect to the TES. Higher heat capacity in the absorber will contribute to noise and decrease the sensitivity of the detector (since a given absorbed energy will not produce as large of a change in TES resistance). For far-IR radiation into the millimeter range, the absorption schemes commonly employ antennas or feedhorns.|$|E
50|$|In general, a {{microwave}} imaging system has two parts, namely: {{hardware and software}} (or post-processing). The hardware part collects data from the sample under test. A transmitter antenna sends EM waves towards the sample under test (e.g., human body for medical imaging). If the sample is made of only homogeneous material which extends to infinity, theoretically no EM wave will be reflected. Introduction of any anomaly which has different properties (i.e., electrical/magnetic) {{in comparison with the}} surrendering homogeneous medium may reflect a portion of the EM wave. The bigger the difference between the properties of the anomaly and the surrounding medium is, the stronger the reflected wave will be. This reflection will be collected and measured by the same antenna (in monostatic case) or a different receiver antenna (in bistatic case).To increase cross-range resolution of the imaging system, several antennas should be distributed over an area (which is called sampling area) with a spacing less than the <b>operating</b> <b>wavelength.</b> However, by having several antennas placed close to each other, the mutual coupling between antennas may degrade the accuracy of the collected signals. Moreover, transmitter and receiver system will become very complex. To address these problems, one single scanning antenna is used instead of several antennas. Later, when the antenna finishes scanning the entire sampling area, one can put together collected data all over the sampling area and process them together, simultaneously. In fact, a synthetic (virtual) aperture is produced by moving the antenna (similar to the synthetic aperture radar principle). Later, the collected data, which is sometimes referred to as raw data, is fed into the software for processing. Depending on the applied processing algorithm, microwave imaging techniques can be categorized as quantitative and qualitative.|$|E
