5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>context.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As the World Wide Web {{becomes a}} large source of digital music, the music {{recommendation}} system {{has got a}} great demand. There are several music recommendation systems for both commercial and academic areas, which deal with the user preference as fixed.

This paper proposes a context-aware music recommendation system (CA-MRS) that exploits the fuzzy system, Bayesian networks and the utility theory in order to recommend appropriate music with respect to <b>the</b> <b>context.</b> We have analyzed the recommendation process and performed a subjective test to show {{the usefulness of the}} proposed system...|$|R
