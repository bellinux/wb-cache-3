40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{systematic}} feasibility analysis {{of the separation of}} minimum-boiling azeotropes, maximum-boiling azeotropes and the low relativ voltatility mixtures in batch extractive distillation in a rectifier and in a stripper. Light, intermediate and heavy entrainers are applied in each case to realise the separation. Moreover, batch heterogeneous extractive distillation with heavy entrainer is studied here. General feasibility methodology is developped for the rectifier and for the stripper presented in <b>organigrammes.</b> Summarized tables show all the results provided by the feasibility analysis, namely, the feasibility conditions, the limiting operational parameters and the separation sequence. The main results of the feasibility analysis are justified by simulations and experimentsTOULOUSE-ENSIACET (315552325) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
