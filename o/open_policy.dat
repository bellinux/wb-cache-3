25|$|The League {{competition}} {{is made up}} of fixtures of fifty overs per side, with each team playing the others in their division both home and away. The strength of the League and its players is in part assisted by the League management having an <b>open</b> <b>policy</b> on the payment of players and no particular limit on the number of professional players in each game. However, teams are limited to one overseas player. In 2008 some first division sides have fielded as many as six players with professional (first-class) credentials.|$|E
40|$|Research outlets are {{increasingly}} adopting <b>open</b> data <b>policies</b> as a requisite for publication, including studies with human subjects data. We investigated whether <b>open</b> data <b>policies</b> influence participants' rate of consent by randomly assigning participants to view consent forms {{with and without}} discussion of <b>open</b> data <b>policies.</b> No participants declined to participate, regardless of condition, nor did rates of drop-out vs. completion vary between conditions. Furthermore, no significant change in potential consent rates was reported when participants were openly asked {{about the influence of}} <b>open</b> data <b>policies</b> on their likelihood of consent. However, follow-up analyses indicated possible poor attention to consent forms, consistent with previous research. Moreover, thematic analysis of participants' considerations of <b>open</b> data <b>policy</b> indicated multiple considerations such as concerns regarding confidentiality, anonymity, data security, and study sensitivity. The impact of <b>open</b> data <b>policies</b> on participation raises complex issues at the intersection of ethics and scientific innovation. We conclude by encouraging researchers to consider participants as stakeholders in <b>open</b> data <b>policy</b> and by providing recommendations for <b>open</b> data <b>policies</b> in human subjects research...|$|R

40|$|Faculty at {{a growing}} number of colleges and {{universities}} have adopted <b>open</b> access <b>policies.</b> Most of these policies follow the Harvard "opt out" model, including, Duke, Kansas, MIT, Georgia Tech, University of California and many others. Working with an opt out <b>open</b> access <b>policy,</b> faculty give universities permission to upload scholarly articles to institutional repositories such as IUPUI ScholarWorks. If an author wants to publish in a journal that refuses to support compliance with the policy, or if the author has other objections to sharing the manuscript, the author may send a notification to the university indicating that they wish to opt out. These policies show the faculty's commitment to sharing knowledge while also maximizing exposure to an author's scholarship.
