25|$|The {{philosophy}} of mathematics is {{the branch of}} philosophy that studies the assumptions, foundations, and implications of mathematics, and purports to provide a viewpoint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> methodology of mathematics, and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.

25|$|Mathematics {{always played}} a special role in {{scientific}} thought, serving since ancient {{times as a}} model of truth and rigor for rational inquiry, and giving tools or even a foundation for other sciences (especially physics). Mathematics' many developments towards higher abstractions in the 19th century brought new challenges and paradoxes, urging for a deeper and more systematic examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> criteria of mathematical truth, as well as a unification of the diverse branches of mathematics into a coherent whole.|$|E
25|$|As a {{genre of}} {{contemporary}} history, post colonialism questions and reinvents {{the manner in}} which a culture is being viewed, challenging the narratives expounded during the colonial era. Anthropologically, it records human relations between the colonists and the peoples under colonial rule, seeking to build an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> practice of colonial rule. As a critical theory, it presents, explains, and illustrates the ideology and practice of neocolonialism with examples drawn from history, political science, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and human geography. It also examines the effects of colonial rule on the cultural aspects of the colony and its treatment of women, language, literature, Christian thought, and humanity.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to its role as intermediate host for several economically important trematode species, Tarebia granifera has colonized water reservoirs, dams and ponds on the premises of three large industrial plants in northern KwaZulu-Natal and been pumped out {{of at least one}} of them, blocking water pipes and damaging equipment. This generally happens when snail densities are high and the damage is due to individuals being crushed so that pieces of shell and soft tissue are carried into machinery. Details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> extent of this damage and the costs incurred are not available. There is no doubt that Tarebia granifera is able to pass unharmed through pumps, probably as juveniles.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{quarantine}} checkpoints instituted by Peter I {{and expanded}} by Catherine II were sufficient to prevent plague from reaching {{inside the country}} in peacetime, but they proved to be inadequate in time of war. The system regarded all epidemics as external threats, focusing on border control, and paid less attention to domestic measures. The epidemic blocked the logistics of Rumyantsev's army, and as the state tried to push more reserves and supplies to the theatre, peacetime quarantine controls had to be lifted. Plague swept into Poland and Ukraine; by August 1770 it reached Bryansk. Catherine refused to admit the plague in public, although she was clearly aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> proportions of the threat, as evidenced by her letters to Governor of Moscow Pyotr Saltykov.|$|E
25|$|The {{music for}} the film was {{composed}} by Geir Bøhren and Bent Åserud. They traveled to Svalbard to gather inspiration {{and found that the}} lack of vegetation distorted one's sense of direction. Inspiration was gathered more from the associations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> culture in Svalbard, rather than that of a traditional action film. This included such elements as listening to whale and Inuit song. For the storm scenes, the team made a Richard Wagner-inspired piece, which was distinct from the Inuit-inspired music. At the end of the piece was a flute melody, which was then adapted to become the theme song, Svalbardtema. Although the music was not mentioned in the original reception, it later became very popular and has become a de facto anthem for the archipelago. Bøhren and Åserud established themselves as film music composers with Orion's Belt and composed the music for nearly all of Solum's later films.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Janus and Vesta {{touches on the}} question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> function of the gods of beginning and ending in Indo-European religion. While Janus has the first place Vesta has the last, both in theology and in ritual (Ianus primus, Vesta extrema). The last place implies a direct connexion with {{the situation of the}} worshipper, in space and in time. Vesta is thence the goddess of the hearth of homes {{as well as of the}} city. Her inextinguishable fire is a means for men (as individuals and as a community) to keep in touch with the realm of gods. Thus there is a reciprocal link between the god of beginnings and unending motion, who bestows life to the beings of this world (Cerus Manus) as well as presiding over its end, and the goddess of the hearth of man, which symbolises through fire the presence of life. Vesta is a virgin goddess but at the same time she is considered the mother of Rome: she is thought to be indispensable to the existence and survival of the community.|$|E
25|$|West and Central African {{religious}} practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in {{which members of}} the community, overcome by force (or ashe, nyama, etc.), are excited {{to the point of}} going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or mantric drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in Gabon and Cameroon is the Okuyi, practiced by several Bantu ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness. When this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, practitioners are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech. Further, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.|$|E

By {{the end of}} August open leads were beginning to appear, and sometimes {{it was possible to}} discern a sea-swell under the ship.

Although Duperré's squadron was technically weaker than the four British frigates combined, Willoughby's signal was misleading as the French had taken up a strong crescent shaped battleline in the bay and could cover the mouth of the channel through which the British ships could only pass one at a time. Duperré also anticipated the arrival of reinforcements from Port Napoleon under Governor Charles Decaen at any time and could call on the support of soldiers and gun batteries on shore. In addition, French launches had moved the buoys marking the channel through the coral reef to confuse any British advance.|$|E
