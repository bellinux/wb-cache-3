25|$|Art {{certainly}} cannot advance under {{compulsion to}} traditional forms, and nothing {{in such a}} field is more stifling to progress than limitation {{of the right to}} experiment with a new technique. The foolish judgments of Lord Eldon about <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> proscribing the works of Byron and Southey, and the finding by the jury under a charge by Lord Denman that the publication of Shelley's Queen Mab was an indictable offense are a warning to all who have to determine the limits of the field within which authors may exercise themselves. We think that Ulysses is a book of originality and sincerity of treatment and that it has not the effect of promoting lust. Accordingly it does not fall within the statute, even though it justly may offend many.|$|E

40|$|How we {{perceive}} {{the world is}} very constrained by our sensory apparatus, and how experience allows us to learn about our environment. Bees {{have a very different}} visual system to humans; including the capacity to see ultraviolet wavelengths, and images are constructed from a multifaceted compound eye. This system has evolved to become highly efficient at finding flowers in complex natural environments. So what do bees perceive? <b>One</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> the Novel Laureate Karl von Frisch showed bees can see colour, and recently it has been possible to reconstruct photographic representations of how bees see colour and spatial information. Furthermore, it has been possible to do testing with free-flying bees to understand how their visual system can do holistic processing, or enable face recognition, size comparisons, or even bind multiple simultaneous rules. Thus an insect brain with less than one million neurons can teach us a lot about how perception is a combination of both sensory apparatus and individual experience...|$|R
25|$|Constructed over <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> {{the clock}} {{on top of the}} main head house is the largest {{operating}} hand-wound clock mechanism in New England. The clock is styled after London's Big Ben, and has a 12-foot wide face. The mechanism weighs over 400 pounds. In 2008, the clock underwent a six-week restoration and repair. The clock mechanism was completely disassembled and transported to a nearby workshop, where replacement pieces had to be fabricated by hand. The clock, once one of many in the city, is a hallmark of a bygone era—something that commuters rely on to make their trains, and which visitors admire for its historical presence. The stone eagle that sits atop the clock is eight feet wide and weighs over eight tons. The eagle imitates the figurines commonly placed atop classically styled buildings.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, Vetsera's {{remains were}} {{disturbed}} again, {{this time by}} Helmut Flatzelsteiner, a Linz furniture dealer who was obsessed with the Mayerling affair. It was initially reported that her bones were strewn round the churchyard for the authorities to retrieve, but Flatzelsteiner actually removed them at night for a private forensic examination at his expense, which finally took place in February 1993. [...] Flatzelsteiner told the examiners that the remains were those of a relative killed some <b>one</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> who had possibly {{been shot in the}} head or stabbed. One expert thought this might be possible, but since the skull was not only in a state of disintegration, but was actually incomplete, this could not be confirmed. Flatzelsteiner then approached a journalist at the Kronen Zeitung to sell both the story and Vetsera's skeleton. That these were Vetsera's remains was confirmed through forensic examination. The body was re-interred in the original grave in October 1993 and after a court case Flatzelsteiner paid the abbey some 2000 Euros by way of damages.|$|E
