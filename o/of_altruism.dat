5|$|Social {{ecological}} behaviours are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied {{for this type of}} relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples <b>of</b> <b>altruism</b> among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} pre-Crisis continuity, Kathy Kane, a wealthy Gotham City heiress and former circus performer, decides {{to use her}} skills and resources to become a costumed crime-fighter. This is partly out <b>of</b> <b>altruism</b> and partly to attract the romantic attentions of Batman. During the Silver Age of Comics, Batwoman guest-starred occasionally in Batman stories published from 1956 to 1964. While Batman wished for Kane to retire from crime-fighting due to the danger, she remained his ally, even when she temporarily became {{a new version of}} Catwoman. In 1961, Batwoman was joined by her niece Betty Kane, the Bat-Girl. Kathy and Betty were romantically interested in Batman and Robin, respectively. Robin seemed to return Bat-Girl's affection, while Batman remained aloof. In 1964 however, DC dropped Batwoman, as well as Bat-Girl, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite from the Batman titles, which were undergoing a revamp under editor Julius Schwartz that eliminated many of the sci-fi elements that were introduced in the 1950s. However, Batwoman continues to make appearances in stories published during the next few years in the Batman-Superman team-up book World's Finest. The character would later reappear in the late 1970s, made guest appearances in the Batman Family and Freedom Fighters comic book series, often fighting crime alongside Barbara Gordon, who had become the new Batgirl. In a story depicting Batwoman as a retired crimefighter, she becomes the owner of a circus, which she keeps until killed by the League of Assassins and the brainwashed Bronze Tiger.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{explains}} {{the relationships among}} altruism, social interaction, culture, and social capital. Findings: The theoretical models developed here show that, through social interaction, cultural process creates higher average level <b>of</b> psychological <b>altruism</b> and also a more uniform level <b>of</b> psychological <b>altruism</b> <b>of</b> a society. Moreover, social capital can be defined and measured as the average level <b>of</b> psychological <b>altruism</b> <b>of</b> a society. Practical and Social implications: This precise definition for social capital is important {{to prevent it from}} being variably translated into many indicators or variables in research. This variability can undermine both the ability to compare one research to another as well as the accuracy of the results. 1 page(s...|$|R

25|$|The {{fundamental}} principles of Jainism {{revolve around the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>altruism,</b> not only for humans but for all sentient beings.

The first Tirthankara, Rishabhdev introduced the concept <b>of</b> <b>altruism</b> for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.|$|E

25|$|Strong {{reciprocity}}.

25|$|People may compete over {{getting the}} {{benefits}} of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits <b>of</b> <b>altruism</b> occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs <b>of</b> <b>altruism</b> in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the existence <b>of</b> true <b>altruism,</b> the authors assessed {{the link between}} empathic concern and helping by (a) employing an experimental perspective-taking paradigm used previously to demonstrate empathy-associated helping and (b) assessing the empathy-helping relationship while controlling {{for a range of}} rel-evant, well-measured nonaltruistic motivations. Consistent with previous research, the authors found a significant zero-order relationship between helping and empathic concern, the purported motivator <b>of</b> true <b>altruism.</b> This empathy-helping relationship disappeared, however, when nonaltruistic motivators (oneness and negative affect) were taken into account: Only the nonaltruistic factors of oneness (merged iden-tity with the victim) and negative affect mediated helping, whereas empathic concern did not. Evidence for true altruism remains elusive. The empathy-altruism hypothesis holds that empathic concern for another leads to truly selfless motivation to help that other. In a long line of research, Batson and his colleagues have generated support for this hypothesis (see Batson, 1991, for a review), thereby suggesting a magnanimous fundamental view of human nature: Indi-viduals are capable <b>of</b> pure <b>altruism,</b> <b>of</b> acting with the truly selfless motivation to benefit another.

25|$|Judaism defines {{altruism}} as {{the desired}} goal of creation. The famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated {{that love is}} the most important attribute in humanity. This is defined as bestowal, or giving, which is the intention <b>of</b> <b>altruism.</b> This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. Kabbalah defines God as the force of giving in existence. Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{originally}} {{suggested that}} high relatedness could arise in two ways: direct kin recognition between individuals or limited dispersal, or population viscosity, which can keep relatives together. The {{easiest way to}} generate relatedness between social partners is limited dispersal, a mechanism in which genetic similarity correlates with spatial proximity. If individuals do not move far, then kin usually surrounds them. Hence, any act <b>of</b> <b>altruism</b> would be directed primarily towards kin. This mechanism {{has been shown in}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, where cooperation is disfavored when populations are well mixed, but favored when there is high local relatedness.|$|E
25|$|When {{biologists}} {{interested in}} evolution theory first started examining social behaviour, some apparently unanswerable questions arose, {{such as how}} the birth of sterile castes, like in bees, could be explained through an evolving mechanism that emphasizes the reproductive success of as many individuals as possible, or why, amongst animals living in small groups like squirrels, an individual would risk its own life to save {{the rest of the}} group. These behaviours may be examples <b>of</b> <b>altruism.</b> Of course, not all behaviours are altruistic, as indicated by the table below. For example, revengeful behaviour was at one point claimed to have been observed exclusively in Homo sapiens. However, other species have been reported to be vengeful including chimpanzees, as well as anecdotal reports of vengeful camels.|$|E

25|$|P. dominula is {{a social}} insect that lives in colonies. They are haplodiploid insects, as are other Polistes species. The haploid males produce {{identical}} haploid sperm, and diploid females produce haploid eggs through meiosis. In most social insects, colonies are composed of related individuals, and social insects are assumed to help close relatives according to W. D. Hamilton's theory of kin selection. However, in P. dominula, 35% of the nest mates are unrelated. In many other species, unrelated individuals only help the queen when no other options are present. In this case, subordinates work for unrelated queens even when other options may be present. No other social insect submits to unrelated queens in this way. This seemingly unfavorable behavior parallels some vertebrate systems. This unrelated assistance may be evidence <b>of</b> <b>altruism</b> in P. dominula.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that because snowball Earth would {{undoubtedly}} have decimated the population size of any given species, the extremely small populations that resulted would all have been descended from a small number of individuals (see founder effect), and consequently the average relatedness between any two individuals (in this case individual cells) would have been exceptionally high as a result of glaciations. Altruism is known to increase from rarity when relatedness (R) exceeds the ratio of the cost (C) to the altruist (in this case, the cell giving up its own reproduction by differentiating), to the benefit (B) to the recipient <b>of</b> <b>altruism</b> (the germ line of the colony, that reproduces {{as a result of the}} differentiation), i.e. R > C/B (see Hamilton's rule). The evolutionary pressure of the high relatedness in the context of a post-glaciation population boom may have been sufficient to overcome the reproductive cost of forming a complex animal, for the first time in Earth's history.|$|E
25|$|While {{the link}} between ethnic {{heterogeneity}} and under provision of public goods is generally accepted, there is little consensus around the causal mechanism underlying this relationship. To identify possible causal stories, Humphreys and Habyarimana ran a serious of behavioral games in Kampala, Uganda that involved several local participants completing joint tasks and allocating money amongst them. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, they find that participants did not favor the welfare of their co-ethnics disproportionately. It was only when anonymity was removed and everyone's ethnicity was known did co-ethnics decide to favor each other. Humphreys and Habyarimana argue that cooperation among co-ethnics is primarily driven by reciprocity norms that tend to be stronger among co-ethnics. The possibility of social sanctions compelled those who would not otherwise cooperate with their co-ethnics to do so. The authors find no {{evidence to suggest that}} co-ethnics display a greater degree <b>of</b> <b>altruism</b> towards each other or have the same preferences. Ethnic cooperation takes place because co-ethnics have common social networks and therefore can monitor each other and can threaten to socially sanction any transgressors.|$|E
