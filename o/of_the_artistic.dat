5|$|An {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>artistic</b> {{personality of}} Gasparo Cairano {{has to be}} mediated by a proper contextualization of the contemporary art scene of Brescia. He {{can be referred to}} as a novice artist at the beginning, when the Lombard migrant, like many of his contemporaries, arrived in Brescia during the innovative construction of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli and started a successful career. That historic moment, with the municipality in search of innovating artists, was also beneficial: he proved able to interpret in stone the boastful self-celebration of the high offices, public and private, of renaissance Brescia. He quickly became the leading innovator of sculptural practice in the region, continually outperforming the already weak competition, which appeared mainly in the shape of Sanmicheli and Antonio della Porta.|$|E
