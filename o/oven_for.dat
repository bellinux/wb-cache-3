5|$|In 1797, Louis Nicolas Vauquelin {{received}} {{samples of}} crocoite ore. He produced chromium trioxide (CrO3) by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric acid.

25|$|Since CD-Rs {{in general}} cannot be logically erased to any degree, the {{disposal}} of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Heating the disc in a microwave <b>oven</b> <b>for</b> 10–15 seconds effectively destroys the data layer by causing arcing in the metal reflective layer, but this same arcing may cause damage or excessive wear to the microwave oven. Many office paper shredders {{are also designed to}} shred CDs.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{magnetron}} is {{a fairly}} efficient device. In a microwave <b>oven,</b> <b>for</b> instance, a 1.1-kilowatt input will generally create about 700 watts of microwave power, an efficiency of around 65%. (The high-voltage and {{the properties of the}} cathode determine the power of a magnetron.) Large S band magnetrons can produce up to 2.5 megawatts peak power with an average power of 3.75kW. Some large magnetrons are water cooled. The magnetron remains in widespread use in roles which require high power, but where precise control over frequency and phase is unimportant.|$|E
25|$|Turkeys {{are usually}} baked or roasted in an <b>oven</b> <b>for</b> several hours, often while the cook prepares the {{remainder}} of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is necessary because the dark meat requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment than the white meat (which is very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills prior to serving.|$|E

25|$|Modern-day frozen dinners {{tend to come}} in {{microwave}}-safe containers. Product lines {{also tend}} to offer a larger variety of dinner types. These dinners, also known as microwave meals, {{can be purchased at}} most supermarkets. They are stored frozen. To prepare them, the plastic cover is removed or vented, and the meal is heated in a microwave <b>oven</b> <b>for</b> a few minutes. They are convenient since they essentially require no preparation time other than the heating, although some frozen dinners may require the preparer to briefly carry out an intermediate step (such as stirring mashed potatoes midway through the heating cycle) to ensure adequate heating and uniform consistency of component items.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the most}} evident {{trace of the}} iron {{industry}} {{in the region is}} the forge of Gysinge. This forge was established in 1668 initially for the production of arms. The forge's location permitted a good access to metal, extracted at the mine of Dannemora, to wood and to the energy of the Gysinge rapids. The forge grew rapidly and in the 18th century there were constructed around the forge homes, mills, stables, a manor and even a hotel. In the 18th century, the forge was {{one of the largest in}} the country, with 50 people working at the mill proper, and 3000 people connected to the forge in other ways. The forge was also the first in the world to use an <b>oven</b> <b>for</b> induction, the oven Kjellin. The forge closed at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Selkirk set {{out from}} Montreal with around 140 {{discharged}} soldiers from the De Meuron and De Watteville regiments, his sergeant's detachment of the 37th Regiment and around 150 HBC servants {{with a number of}} artillery and even an <b>oven</b> <b>for</b> heating cannonballs. His plan was to travel the Great Lakes route but to avoid Fort William by taking the Fond-du-lac / Rainy Lake route to the Red River. On March 20, Colin Robertson’s men captured Fort Pembina, arrested several NWC employees and Métis and confiscated the fort’s arms and ammunition. Around this time, Governor Semple built the armed schooner named “Cuthullin” to deny NWC access to Lake Winnipeg and put it under the command of Lieutenant Holte. He also erected a battery on the shore of the Red River to prevent NWC boats from passing. In his spare time, Colin Robertson tested the readiness of the HBC blockade by floating an old, empty boat down river, unbeknown to the blockaders. Upon seeing it, the men rushed out and began firing at it without orders.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} process of TV dinners is highly automated and undergoes three major steps. Those steps are food preparation, tray loading, and freezing. During food preparation, {{vegetables and fruits}} are usually placed on a movable belt and washed, then are placed into a container to be steamed or boiled for 1–3 minutes. This process {{is referred to as}} blanching, and is used as a method to destroy enzymes in the food that can cause chemical changes negatively affecting overall flavor and color of the fruit and vegetables. As for meats, prior to cooking, they are trimmed of fat and cut into proper sizes. The fish is usually cleaned and cut into fillets, and poultry is usually washed thoroughly and dressed. Meats are then seasoned, placed on trays, and are cooked in an <b>oven</b> <b>for</b> a predetermined amount of time. After all the food is ready to be packaged, it is sent to the filling lines. The food is placed in its compartments as the trays pass under numerous filling machines; to ensure that every packaged dinner gets an equal amount of food, the filling devices are strictly regulated.|$|E

The well-lit kitchen had several hearths and an <b>oven</b> <b>for</b> cooking, a well and a cellar for storage. Above the kitchen was a large room, probably used as a winter parlour.
