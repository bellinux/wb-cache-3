5|$|In 2008, the Utzon Center, its art, {{architecture}} and design credited to the noted architect Jørn Utzon, is also dedicated to him. It was built {{next to the}} Limfjord at the central harbour front in Aalborg. Born in Copenhagen, Utzon grew up in Aalborg. The centre contains an exhibition on Utzon's work, which includes the Sydney Opera House, as well as educational displays on {{architecture and}} design. The centre consists of several individual buildings creating a special place around a courtyard on a platform. The tall sculptural roofs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium</b> and the boat-hall, both on the harbour front, and the library facing the park area and the city are set off by the lower roofs of the exhibition and workshop areas inside the complex.|$|E
5|$|The £3million {{refurbishment}} by Fry, {{the most}} extensive programme of work since the theatre had been saved from virtual collapse almost 30 years before, included an expanded foyer, improved lift and disabled access to the stalls and royal circle levels, complete refurbishment of the bars {{and the creation of}} The Jeremy Fry Bar, in the former cellars of The Garrick's Head pub, and redecoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium.</b> Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage, and an extensive rewiring and lighting programme around the entire building, with new fire alarm systems, air-conditioning and lighting, all designed to improve the building's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30%. The design was by architects of the Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios, and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work.|$|E

5|$|With the {{departure}} of the Drury Lane company in 1794, the theatre returned to opera, hosting the first London performances of Mozart's La clemenza di Tito in 1806, Così fan tutte and Die Zauberflöte in 1811, and Don Giovanni in 1816. Between 1816 and 1818, John Nash and George Repton made alterations to the façade and increased the capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium</b> to 2,500. They also added a shopping arcade, called the Royal Opera Arcade, which has survived fires and renovations and still exists. It runs along the rear of the theatre. In 1818–20, the British premieres of Gioachino Rossini's operas Il barbiere di Siviglia, Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra, L'italiana in Algeri, La Cenerentola and Tancredi took place, and the theatre became known as the Italian Opera House, Haymarket by the 1820s.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} is highlighted by decorative elements that fill the spaces, such as columns, the decoration on the walls, floors and <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ceilings. <b>The</b> <b>auditorium</b> stresses <b>the</b> grandiosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space, <b>the</b> rhythmic organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balconies, which are highly decorated, in Neo-Baroque elements.|$|R

25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium's</b> {{main floor}} seating, the {{backstage}} {{areas and the}} entire stage (including <b>the</b> inlaid circle <b>of</b> wood from <b>the</b> Ryman's stage) was underwater during the flood. While the Grand Ole Opry House's stage was replaced thereafter, the Ryman circle was restored and again placed at center stage in the Grand Ole Opry House before shows resumed. The remediation following the flood also resulted in a renovated backstage area, including <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> more dressing rooms and a performer's lounge.|$|R
25|$|While {{the actors}} were {{attempting}} to quell the panic, the head usher, Thomas Rocheford, went to the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium</b> to open the Flood's Alley special exit door on {{the east end of}} the vestibule, opposite of the Washington Street entrances, one of the three special exit doors designed by architect Jackson. Since the doors were rarely used, he found the locking mechanism corroded; he was initially unable to open the doors. He found a small piece of metal in his pocket and with this was able to release the doors. This action enabled the people on the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium</b> to evacuate the building fairly quickly, but Rocheford's action came at a cost. The open doors furnished airflow for the fire on the stage, which immediately grew in intensity.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} had a bipartite plan. A walled forecourt led through a stoa {{to the main}} entrance, centrally located at the east wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium.</b> A rectangular substructure held wooden benches where the assembly sat {{to listen to the}} speakers. Stone buttressing, connected to this substructure, supported the south retaining wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{was equipped with}} the first central air conditioning system and the theater {{was the first to}} be entirely lit by incandescent light bulbs.

25|$|The Santa Clara US Army ROTC Battalion was {{established}} in 1861 due to {{the outbreak of the}} American Civil War. The unit was known as the Senior Company of Cadets. On September 10, 1863, Leland Stanford, then Governor of California, presented the Corps of Cadets with forty Springfield rifles, Model 1839. Today, the rifles are preserved in the University Museum. In return for his generosity, an armory was built in his honor in 1936. The armory was located southwest of the athletic field with the pistol range located below the stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{decoration}} and layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium</b> {{is meant}} to resemble a royal Egyptian courtyard. While the stage is a decent size, at 35 feet (10.7 m) across, the backstage space is very small because of its original use as a vaudeville theatre. When the theatre first opened, it had seating for 1,600 guests, {{but as a result}} of the 1980s renovation that dropped to 1,483 seats. Four more seats were removed in late 2000 to comply with disability laws. The 1,430-seat auditorium is DeKalb County's largest.|$|E

25|$|The {{translation}} of plays poses many {{problems such as}} the added element of actors, speech duration, translation literalness, {{and the relationship between}} the arts of drama and acting. Successful play translators are able to create language that allows the actor and the playwright to work together effectively. Play translators must also take into account several other aspects: the final performance, varying theatrical and acting traditions, characters' speaking styles, modern theatrical discourse, and even the acoustics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium,</b> i.e., whether certain words will have the same effect on the new audience as they had on the original audience.|$|E
25|$|Work on the Jersey Arts Centre {{started in}} 1981 when the Education Committee made {{available}} the redundant domestic science building in Saint Helier.

In 1992 the public acquired the former garrison church of St James and work started in 1998 to convert it into an arts venue.

25|$|The {{building}} has {{a variety of}} architectural elements from various buildings around the globe that President Baker, CU's president {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, admired. The design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium</b> is primarily Neo-Gothic, with the primary materials being sandstone and red tile, like the rest of campus. The result is a unique building, with two large towers and sprawling ivy, that sets itself apart from the rest of the CU campus. Macky was refurbished in 1986, with improved seating, custom carpeting, modern plumbing and an elevator. Currently there is an electronic bell system in the towers of Macky which rings the hours during the day.|$|E
