5|$|The Una-class {{submarine}} (also {{known as}} Type 911) was {{a class of}} six midget submarines built for the Yugoslav Navy at the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata (English: Special objects shipyard) during the 1980s. They were designed with the purpose <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> small minefields and transporting naval special forces, with or without their submersibles, in shallow waters that were inaccessible for larger submarines.

40|$|ABSTRACT Data from inbred lines, one (D) {{selected}} for part record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> {{and the other}} (C) un{{selected for}} any trait, were analyzed. After 19 generations of continuous full sib matings, the C line showed significant decreases in part record egg number, 32 -week egg weight, shell thickness, full record egg number and part record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> but nonsignificant decreases in hatchability, full record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay,</b> and laying house mortality. Age at first egg, Haugh unit and mature body weight showed significant increases in this line. The D line {{was similar to the}} C line in its response to the same intensity of inbreeding for all traits except full record egg number, part record rate, and fertility, each of which showed a significant decrease, and Haugh unit and full record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay,</b> which showed nonsignificant increases. Results indicated that the small advantages selection conferred on the inbred line in part record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> (the selection criterion), full record egg number, and full record rate <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> were ac-companied by undesirable changes in other traits, resulting in later sexual maturity, larger body weight, lower Haugh unit, fertility, and hatchability compared with the unselected line...|$|R

5|$|Many {{species of}} chaetotonid gastrotrichs {{reproduce}} entirely by parthenogenesis. In these species, the male {{portions of the}} reproductive system are degenerate and non-functional, or, in many cases, entirely absent. Though the eggs have a diameter of less than 50 µm, they are still very large {{in comparison with the}} animals' size. Some species are capable <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> eggs that remain dormant during times of desiccation or low temperatures; these species, however, are also able to produce regular eggs, which hatch in one to four days, when environmental conditions are more favourable. The eggs of all gastrotrichs undergo direct development and hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days. In the laboratory, Lepidodermella squamatum has lived for up to forty days, producing four or five eggs during the first ten days of life.|$|E
5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.|$|E
40|$|Abstract__ This article aims at {{examining}} lay {{clubs and}} religious associations in rural {{seventeenth and eighteenth}} century Brabant, by testing some recent sociological conclusions concerning present social life. While the structures <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> clubs where more democratic, religious clubs were less open. All members <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> clubs were enabled {{to participate in the}} administration of their association. Also, frequent social interaction in such societies promoted horizontal values among their members. In religious clubs, interactions between board and members where based on hierarchal relations, and only vertical relations where stimulated. Membership <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> associations was limited in a way as well: a refined pattern of manners distinguished members <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> societies already in the fifteenth century. This social separation was consolidated in the seventeenth and eighteenth century, as poor inhabitants were excluded from the lay societies...|$|R

The commonly perceived negative view <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> assessor activities was thought to have been induced by myth, professional superiority and negative statements also similarly made in other countries rather than being based on the very views of those who actually had an insight as lay or professional judges into the effective functioning of the system. The objectives of that research were two-fold: not only did they intend to convey a full picture <b>of</b> the current <b>lay</b> assessor system based on specialist literature, legislation analysis and the opinions <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> and professional judges, but they also brought forward de lege ferenda proposals to the legislator if it was so desired.

Before World War I, soldiers of the Kingdom of Serbia developed the custom <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> a badnjak on a fire in their barracks. In the succeeding Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the military badnjak ceremony was further elaborated and standardized in army service regulations, but the tradition ended at the outbreak of World War II. Since the early 1990s, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve in which the badnjak plays a central role. Parishioners festively cut the sapling {{to be used as}} the badnjak and take it to their church, where it is consecrated by a priest before it is ceremonially placed on a fire built in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|The royal touch (also {{known as}} the king's touch) was a form <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> on of hands, whereby French and English monarchs touched their subjects, {{regardless}} of social classes, {{with the intent to}} cure them of various diseases and conditions. The thaumaturgic touch was most commonly applied to people suffering from tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (better known as scrofula or the King's Evil), and exclusively to them from the 16th century onwards. The disease rarely resulted in death and often went into remission on its own, giving the impression that the monarch's touch cured it. The claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, the Mongol leader Genghis Khan, once a vassal of the Jurchens, rose {{up against}} the Jin dynasty. In the ensuing Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty, the nomadic invaders avoided direct attacks on the Jin fortifications. Instead, when they could, the Mongols simply rode around the walls; an {{effective}} example of this tactic is in 1211, when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling. The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls, {{such as those in}} Gubeikou, often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them. The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass: instead <b>of</b> <b>laying</b> siege, the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the opened gates. In 1215, Genghis Khan besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing (modern-day Beijing). The Jin dynasty eventually collapsed following the siege of Caizhou in 1234. Western Xia had already fallen in 1227, and the Southern Song resisted the Mongols until 1279.|$|E

5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} breeds {{during winter}} in colonies that may include other large waterbirds {{such as the}} spot-billed pelican. The nest is a large platform of twigs placed {{at the end of}} a near-horizontal branch of a tall tree. Nests are rarely placed in forks and an unobstructed top canopy allows the birds to fly easily from and to the nests. In the Nagaon nesting colony in Assam, tall Alstonia scholaris and Anthocephalus cadamba were favourite nest trees. The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree. While crowding at these sites, male birds mark out their nesting territories, chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them. They may also arch their body and hold their wings half open and drooped. When a female perches nearby, the male plucks fresh twigs and places it before her. The male may also grasp the tarsus of the female with the bill or hold his bill close to her in a preening gesture. A female that has paired holds the bill and head to the breast of the male and the male locks her by holding his bill over her neck. Other displays include simultaneous bill raising and lowering by a pair. The clutch, usually of three or four white eggs, is laid at intervals of one or two days and incubation begins after the first egg is laid. Both parents incubate and the eggs hatch at intervals of one or two days, each taking about 35 days from the date <b>of</b> <b>laying.</b> Adults at the nest have their legs covered with their droppings and this behaviour termed as urohidrosis is believed to aid in cooling during hot weather. Adults may also spread out their wings and shade the chicks. The chicks are fed at the nest for about five months. The chicks double in size in a week and can stand and walk on the nest platform when they are a month old. At five weeks, the juveniles leap frequently and can defend themselves. The parent birds leave the young along for longer periods at nest at this stage. The young birds leave the nest and fly around the colony when about four months but continue to be fed occasionally by the parents.|$|E

40|$|A {{study with}} a 2 × 3 × 2 {{factorial}} arrangement {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of 2 dietary protein levels (high = CPh and low = CPl) during rearing, 3 dietary energy levels (3, 000, MEh 1; 2, 800, MEs 1; and 2, 600, MEl 1, kcal/kg AMEn, respectively) during the first phase <b>of</b> <b>lay,</b> and 2 dietary energy levels (2, 800, MEs 2; and 3, 000, MEh 2, kcal/kg AMEn, respectively) during the second phase <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> on body composition and reproduction in broiler breeders. No meaningful interactions for energy and protein treatments within the different phases of the study were found and, therefore, this paper focusses on the main effects. Pullets fed the CPl diet had a 12. 8 % higher feed intake, 14 % lower breast muscle, and 97 % higher abdominal fat pad portion at 22 wk age. The increased abdominal fat pad and decreased breast muscle of the CPl compared to the CPh birds increased hatchability during the first phase <b>of</b> <b>lay,</b> due to a decreased embryonic mortality between d 10 to 21 of incubation, and increased egg production during the second phase <b>of</b> <b>lay.</b> Feeding birds the MEh 1 and MEl 1 diets slightly decreased egg production compared to the MEs 1 birds. Birds fed the MEh 1 diet showed a higher mortality compared to the birds fed the MEs 1 and MEl 1 diets. Feeding birds the MEh 2 diet did not affect egg production, increased hatchability of fertile eggs, decreased embryonic mortality between d 3 to 21 of incubation, and increased the number of first-grade chicks. It was concluded that a low-protein diet during rearing changed body composition with positive effects on incubation traits during the first phase <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> and improved egg production during the second phase <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> in broiler breeders. A high-energy or low-energy diet compared to a standard diet during the first phase <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> slightly decreased total and settable egg numbers while a high-energy diet during the second phase <b>of</b> <b>lay</b> increased hatchability and number of saleable chicks...|$|R
