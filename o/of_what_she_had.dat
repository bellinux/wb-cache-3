The gospels of the New Testament, especially Luke, mention Jesus speaking to or helping women publicly and openly. Martha's sister Mary sat at Jesus' feet being taught, a privilege reserved {{for men in}} Judaism. Jesus had female followers who were his sponsors, and he stopped to express concern for the women of Jerusalem {{on his way to}} be crucified. Mary Magdalene is stated in the Gospels to be the first person to see Jesus after his resurrection. In the narratives, Jesus charged her to tell others <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen, even though the testimony of a woman at that time was not considered valid.|$|E

The track is the first official single off her third solo album This Is What the Truth Feels Like, which she began working on summer 2015. Stefani said much of the previous material she worked on in 2014 felt forced and inauthentic, the opposite <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> originally wanted. The album's second single, [...] "Make Me Like You", was released on February 12, 2016. This Is What the Truth Feels Like was released on March 18, 2016, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 84,000 album-equivalent units sold in its first week, earning Stefani her first number-one album on the chart as a solo artist. To further promote the album, Stefani embarked on her This Is What the Truth Feels Like Tour with rapper Eve in the United States. The singer voiced DJ Suki in the animated film Trolls, which was released on November 4, 2016.

Sulkowicz further stated that NYPD officers [...] "badly mistreated" [...] her and [...] "were dismissive <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to say".

[...] Accordingly, Seibert was not informed of her Miranda rights before the interrogation began. [...] After about 40 minutes of questioning, Seibert made an incriminating statement. [...] She was given a 20-minute break. [...] When the questioning resumed, she was given her Miranda warnings, and reminded <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> admitted before the break.

[...] The FCA charges Quark with his mother's misdeeds, about which she is unrepentant, feeling that women {{should have the same}} rights and privileges as men.

2500|$|Young Katherine both {{drew and}} wrote as hobbies, but her first formal {{training}} in painting was at the Corcoran Art School in Washington, D.C., in 1919–1920. After {{she and her mother}} went back to Italy in 1920, she studied art in Rome for several years, learning conventional techniques and styles. She particularly enjoyed painting outdoors in the Roman Campagna with teacher Oronato Carlandi and fellow students. Much later, Sage stated that “these were the happiest days of my life”, and she told friend and gallery owner Julien Levy in 1961 that her campagna experience shaped her “perspective idea of distance and going away.” [...] Nonetheless, in later years Sage usually claimed that she was self-taught, perhaps because, as one of her biographers, Judith Suther, states, most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> learned in Rome bore so little relationship to the kind of painting she eventually did that “she felt as if she had studied with no one.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The play {{provoked}} {{something of}} an upset. There were complaints about the [...] "horrific" [...] content (particularly the infamous Room 101 scene where Smith is threatened with torture by rats) and the [...] "subversive" [...] nature of the play. Most were worried by the depiction of a totalitarian regime controlling the population's freedom of thought. There was also {{a report in the}} Daily Express newspaper of 42-year-old Beryl Merfin of Herne Bay collapsing and dying as she watched the production, under the headline [...] "Wife dies as she watches", allegedly from the shock <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen. An anonymous reviewer in The Times wrote: [...] "Inevitably, in a dramatic presentation of the book much of the irony is lost; and the weakness of this television version was that concentrating on the action it reduced the ideological explanation so drastically that it robbed the story of at least half its power". It was a [...] "pictorial simplification" [...] of [...] "Orwell's vision". The writer, however, admired the performances of Cushing, Mitchell and Morell.|$|E

2500|$|The {{one issue}} of FIRE!! to be {{published}} contained stories by several of the Niggerati, most of which had transgressions of moral and aesthetic boundaries as their themes. [...] Thurman's story Cordelia the Crude was {{a story about a}} sixteen-year-old black girl becoming a prostitute [...] an image that would have outraged black critics of the time, whose view of black female sexuality was that images of it should be moral. [...] Nugent's story was Smoke, Lilies and Jade, an overtly homoerotic story with black and Latino protagonists, and the first such story published by an African American. [...] Hurston submitted two stories, one of which, her play Color Struck (a reworked version <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> won the 1925 Opportunity contest with), Thurman had considered printing under a nom de plume, in order to prevent the issue being too [...] "Zoraish". [...] Like the other stories, Color Struck condemned the bourgeois attitude of envying whites, on biological and intellectual grounds, its subject being that of a woman who was so conscious of the colour of her skin that she missed out on the love of a good man. [...] Her other submission was a short story entitled Sweat, which Hemenway praises as being [...] "a remarkable work, her best fiction of the period", and observes that such stories could have led to the magazine's eventual success, had it not suffered from the other problems.|$|E
