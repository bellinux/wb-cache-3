5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> secondary status of their gender.|$|E

5|$|Criticism of {{the film}} also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press. Horowitz points out {{that much of the}} Jewish {{activity}} seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life. Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> link between violence and sexuality is not explored further. History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.|$|E

At the culmination of the decade ecofeminism had spread to both coasts and articulated an intersectional analysis <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment.

The following year, his indignation at the harsh criticism of his ambitious composition The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian caused him to return to Italy, where he assumed directorship of the French Academy in Rome in 1835.
