5|$|In late May 2011, Sukhoi {{delivered}} the first Su-35S to Akhtubinsk to conduct state joint tests with the Defence Ministry {{to prepare the}} aircraft for operational service. Before {{the start of the}} tests, the aircraft's Su-35's avionics and integrated defence systems were reportedly not up to the standard of American aircraft. The first of two stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> commenced in August 2011. By March 2012, the two prototypes and four production aircraft were conducting flights as the air force tested the type's technical characteristics, which were assessed {{by the end of that}} year to have generally complied with requirements.

40|$|This Thesis {{is focused}} on the most {{important}} phase <b>of</b> criminal proceedings, <b>the</b> <b>trial.</b> <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this thesis is to form theoretical and practical analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and also to take into consideration <b>the</b> conclusions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jurisprudence and <b>the</b> foundations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Czech Criminal Procedure Code. The Thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter deals with <b>the</b> fundamental principles <b>of</b> criminal proceedings and their mutual relations. These principles represent foundation upon which the whole criminal proceedings including <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> are based. <b>The</b> application <b>of</b> these principles is not absolute and the Czech Criminal Proceedings Code regulates many exceptions. The second chapter describes <b>the</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and is about <b>the</b> delivery <b>of</b> criminal charge, notice to appear in court, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> persons on <b>trial,</b> <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> measures related to <b>the</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and other decisions.

5|$|A {{few days}} {{after the end of the}} Battle of Vukovar, there were 2,000 detainees in the camp. Detainees usually spent several days in the camp, during which some of them were interrogated, beaten and killed. Up to 10,000 detainees passed through the camp before it was closed in March 1992, when the United Nations Protection Force {{deployed}} to the area. Anywhere between 15 and 800 inmates may have been killed at the camp, though the latter figure includes approximately 700 people who are missing and presumed dead. The events in the camp formed part of three indictments issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. , two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> are ongoing, while the trial of Slobodan Milošević was terminated following his death.|$|E
5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet {{in children and}} young people with epilepsy, as well as six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among {{children and young people}} for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and only one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

5|$|After their {{fitting-out}} stage, the {{two ships}} were put through sea trials {{to ensure they}} met their contracted specifications. The first attempt at putting Michigan through a trial was conducted at the navy's traditional testing grounds off Rockland, Maine beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on a sand bar. Although Michigan was pulled off without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying the completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> until 20–24 June. The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910—making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's —and its shakedown cruise lasted until 7 June.|$|E
5|$|Although Camet {{successfully}} completed all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> required of {{him by the}} nascent Argentine Olympic Committee, he {{did not attend the}} 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, although his name was on the official register as a non-participant. After taking a brief break to finish his law degree, {{he was part of the}} Argentine fencing delegation sent to the 1928 Summer Olympics. There, as the substitute on the foil team foil, he won a bronze medal, Argentine's only medal in that sport as of 2008. Although he sat out the first two matches with Norway and Spain, he replaced Héctor Lucchetti during the matches against Belgium and all subsequent events. At the time of his death in 2007, in Buenos Aires, Camet was believed to be the world's oldest living Olympic competitor.|$|E

Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut out, so {{he could no longer}} speak his rebellion, and his right hand cut off, so that he could no longer write letters. Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern-day Georgia and was cast in the {{fortress}} of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of Tsageri.

5|$|Melbourne spent {{ten weeks}} at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, having her new bow fitted. Following the repairs, Melbourne was {{involved}} in Strategic Reserve deployments and exercises in Southeast Asia from June until September 1964. During this deployment, the carrier visited Subic Bay, where the RAN performed flight deck trials with S-2 Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and A-4 Skyhawk attack fighters. The success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials,</b> along with the discovery that Melbourne was able to operate both aircraft with relatively minor modification, led the Australian Government to approve the purchase of these aircraft.|$|E

A programme of 160 hours of flying, simulating airline service, took place over the following 19 days and included a break for maintenance on 16 November. The programme also allowed Skyways pilots to gain further experience towards the 50 hours in command they needed before they could fly the aircraft in service.

40|$|This {{is a study}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Conspiracy <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> 1969 - 1970, where eight radical {{leaders were}} tried in {{connection}} to the riots during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this thesis is to explore <b>the</b> meanings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> to American society in 1970 and from today's historical vantage point. Differing from first-hand accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> in <b>the</b> early 1970 s, this study examines the different public perspectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> such primary sources as underground newspapers, the defendants' writings, and appeals documents. Particular attention {{is devoted to the}} interpersonal relationships between <b>the</b> leading participants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> (<b>the</b> judge, attorneys, defendants, jurors, journalists, and spectators). The thesis is organized to highlight the major issues and controversies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial,</b> while still addressing the personalities involved in the case. <b>The</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> in an era of active American radicalism is examined {{both before and after the}} case was tried. An entire chapter is devoted to examining the diverse participants in <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> and <b>the</b> different roles they played in the event. Since <b>the</b> <b>trial</b> was so controversial because of legal issues and <b>the</b> conduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> courtroom participants, a chapter has been devoted to both of these areas.

5|$|The Supreme Court of Indiana has {{original}} and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas, including {{the practice of}} law, discipline or disbarment of judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the state. When the Court accepts a case, it reviews the documentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> in the lower court and sometimes allows oral arguments before making a decision. In some cases the justices will issue a decision without hearing arguments from either side and will base their decision solely on evidence submitted in the lower courts. The Court can order a new trial {{to take place in}} the local court, overturn the decision of lower courts and enforce its own decision, or uphold the decision of lower courts.|$|E

Finn, being supportive, leaves a walkie talkie with Jake, who absentmindedly begins to narrate the events around him.

5|$|Australian Submarine Corporation {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the delivery of the Rockwell combat system, but had little ability to enforce this. Rockwell was contracted to deliver the combat system by 9 September 1993, but was unlikely to do so. ASC's management board voted to issue a default notice to Rockwell as the American company had defaulted on the contract, but was ordered by the Department of Defence to retract the default notice and accept gradual delivery of partially completed versions of the combat system—referred to as 'releases' and 'drops'—until the complete system had been delivered. Sea trials of Collins were unable to commence until Release 1.5 of the combat system software was delivered; because of ongoing delays {{in the provision of}} the software, the early phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> were completed using stand-alone equipment By March 1994, the combat system had become the major area of concern for the submarine project: assembly of the system was almost nine months behind schedule, and at least 20% of the software had not been compiled. The combat system continued to be a problem during the next few years, with progressive drops offering little improvements in performance over the previous version, and the completion date of Release 2—the designation for the full contractual realisation of the combat system software—was continually postponed.|$|E

One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trials</b> {{forced him to}} miss the second Swansea {{encounter}} of the season, played away on 12 November 1966; {{his place in the}} Llanelli team was given to a youth debutant from the Felinfoel club, Phil Bennett. Bennett became one of the greatest fly-halves produced by Wales, but he was kept from the Wales squad in his early career by the presence of John. In 1966, John was awarded his first international cap for Wales, taking David Watkins place at fly-half for the match against the touring Australia team. This was seen as a surprise move by the Welsh Rugby Union selectors, as Watkins had recently returned from a British Lions tour where he was team captain. Wales lost to Australia 11–4, the first time the Welsh had been beaten by the 'Wallabies', due to poor form in the midfield, with the criticism aimed at John, Gerald Davies and John Dawes. Although experiencing defeat in his first international, John managed to gain revenge over Australia just over a month later when the same team faced Llanelli at Stradey Park. Llanelli beat the Wallabies 11–0 after a bruising forward contest. John himself scored a try, and then added to his tally with a dropped goal.|$|E
