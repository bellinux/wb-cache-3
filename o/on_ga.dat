Due to the {{increase}} of energy need {{as a consequence of}} rapid population growth, structuring and mega investments in metropolitan cities, optimum operation of natural gas network infrastructure has become an important goal. The fact that this goal can be realized with smart network concept has prioritized the need for new investments to be made as per smart network concept. In metropolitans, natural gas must be transmitted to customers with speci c temperatures and pressure rates. The necessity to supply natural gas sustainable and e cient way by evaluating the parameters such as weather temperatures, consumption amounts, business processes, eld equipment defects requires smart network systems. Infrastructure asset management of natural gas, which has a vital role in the cities, must be performed adequately. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the smart grid maturity and to discuss improvement potentials for companies distributing natural gas for the city. Several maturity models were compared in order to generate smart grid maturity model and accordingly smart grid maturity roadmap has been established. Field applications of four natural gas distribution companies were evaluated to determine key performance indicators which govern the maturity level and the importance rate of smart grid systems by using Analytical Hierarchy Process. Action plans were de ned according to smart grid by using GAP analysis results for companies that desire a change and development on smart grid. Additionally, smart grid maturity level of Istanbul was examined by using the established model and the comparative analysis results have been presented. Therefore, with the results presented in this study, smart grid maturity level analysis and necessity steps for improvement activity have been stated for natural gas distribution.
