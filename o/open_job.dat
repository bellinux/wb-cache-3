25|$|A {{medical school}} graduate, a piano enthusiast, a former sportswriter, a {{one-time}} automobile dealership owner, and a veteran {{football and basketball}} coach, Doc Stewart quickly became a popular figure across diverse segments of the University population. His oratory eloquence landed him an <b>open</b> <b>job</b> offer {{from the head of}} the UT English Department. After having coached the football team to an undefeated season, Stewart turned to implementing an entirely new style of basketball at Texas—one that emphasized ball movement and man-to-man defense and that essentially dispensed with the dribble altogether. Texas entered the season expected to finish third or fourth in conference play behind TCU, Oklahoma A, and possibly Texas A Texas opened the season with a one-point win and two four-point wins over Southwestern—an opponent that had lost its previous six games against the Longhorns by an average of almost 20 points—leading to concern in the local newspapers. Contrary to prognostications, Texas opened the conference slate with two wins over Oklahoma A and sweeps of six other conference series to reach 14–0 in conference play, securing at least a share of the SWC championship with six games remaining, all away from Austin. The Longhorns next traveled more than 500 miles by train to open a long and bitter basketball rivalry with the Arkansas Razorbacks, then in their first year of competition in the sport, earning four- and 11-point wins in Fayetteville. Despite its unblemished record, Texas was still predicted to lose at least one game to the Aggies in College Station. The Longhorns instead managed 24–14 and 17–11 victories over the Aggies to finish as the last undefeated team in Texas and SWC history at 23–0. Senior guard Abb Curtis would later receive retroactive recognition for the 1924 season as UT's second-ever consensus first-team All-American in basketball.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first steps}} towards {{inclusion}} of black Durham {{residents in the}} work force occurred during World War II, when the federal government reluctantly allowed black workers to fill up <b>open</b> <b>job</b> positions in Durham, left by those who went to fight in the war. What seemed a promising step towards civil rights efforts faded as soldiers returned {{at the end of the}} war to reclaim their positions in society. Both black men and women lost their factory jobs at the shutdown of several major wartime plants that were no longer needed post-war. [...] Oliver Harvey, who later led the organizational efforts of Local 77, was affected by the wartime demand for black employees.|$|E

While some matching models include a distribution of different wages, others are simplified by ignoring wage differences, and just imply that workers pass through an unemployment spell of random length before beginning work.|$|E

50|$|With {{cyclical}} unemployment, {{the number}} of unemployed workers exceeds {{the number of}} job vacancies, so that even if full employment were attained and all <b>open</b> <b>jobs</b> were filled, some workers would still remain unemployed. Some associate cyclical unemployment with frictional unemployment because the factors that cause the friction are partially caused by cyclical variables. For example, a surprise decrease in the money supply may shock rational economic factors and suddenly inhibit aggregate demand.|$|R

The opportunity to study abroad is a major vehicle of entry to western countries for Asian women. Moving to the West to study is a common career move for Asian women in their 20s, allowing them to abandon the traditional marriage track and pursue economic ventures outside the home.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{practice}} of sport psychology expanded throughout the 1980s and 1990s, some practitioners {{expressed concern that the}} field lacked uniformity and needed consistency to become [...] "a good profession." [...] The issues of graduate program accreditation and the uniform training of graduate students in sport psychology were considered by some to be necessary to promote the field of sport psychology, educate the public on what a sport psychologist does, and ensure an <b>open</b> <b>job</b> market for practitioners. However, Hale and Danish (1999) argued that accreditation of graduate programs was not necessary and did not guarantee uniformity. Instead, these authors proposed a special practicum in applied sport psychology that included greater contact hours with clients and closer supervision.|$|E
