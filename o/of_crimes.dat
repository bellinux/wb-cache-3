While numerous studies have examined adults’ Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime,</b> research examining adolescents’ Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> is limited. Previous research using adolescents has found parental attachment decreases males’ Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> while increased parental supervision inflates Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> for both genders. The current study examines the differing relationships between attachment, supervision and Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> further by investigating if parental style can help account for these different parental influences. Using a questionnaire design, 203 college students, answered questions measuring perceived parental influences (attachment, supervision, and style), socially desirable responding, Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime,</b> Threat <b>of</b> Victimisation (avoidant behaviour, Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime,</b> and risk <b>of</b> <b>crime),</b> with other demographic and crime related variables. Using regression and correlation, female and non-Caucasian adolescents {{were found to have}} higher Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> and Threat <b>of</b> Victimisation. Contrary to previous findings, adolescents who have more secure attachments and more supervision had greater Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime.</b> Parental attachment was found to have stronger relationships to males’ Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime,</b> while for females, supervision was more influential. Relationships were also found between females’ Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> and Threat <b>of</b> Victimisation, and socially desirable responding. Using structural equation modelling it was found for both genders that the influences of parental style and attachment were indirectly related to Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> through parental supervision, and socially desirable responding. This pattern of results suggests partly that the relationship between Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> and parental influences may be due to adolescents reporting the amount of fear they think they ought to report, but not their actual level of fear. This suggests that gender differences in Fear <b>of</b> <b>Crime</b> are partly due to gendered socialisation. Females report more fear because of reinforced beliefs of vulnerability and encouraged expression of fear through interaction, behaviour and communication, to some extent, with parents.

40|$|Reported levels <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> {{continue}} to fall, but fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> remains a significant social problem. Previous studies have identified several factors that predict fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> (e. g. age and gender) however; {{it is not}} obvious how this information {{can be used to}} help distinguish between individuals in larger groups. Personality is predictive of other lifestyle outcomes yet its relationship with fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> remains unknown. We examined personality correlates <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> alongside other well-established predictors. A total of 301 participants completed the HEXACO-PI-R personality scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. Higher levels of emotionality (r =. 37) and lower levels of honesty-humility (r = -. 18) correlated with increased levels <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> related fear; however, prior victimisation did not improve a subsequent model.

Analyzing survey data collected from students at an urban university, the researcher finds that (1) females are far more fearful than their male counterparts; (2) religiosity is not informative on varying levels <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> in the sample.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> victimization {{is a result}} of many factors including age, gender, race, income, neighbourhood variables, prior victimization and so on. The present research was conducted to test the following hypotheses: (I) fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> victimization is dependent on the country in which one lives; (2) socio-demographic characteristics affect fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> victimization; (3) economic status affects fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> victimization; and (4) prior experience of victimization affects fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> victimization. Using a structured questionnaire, constructed for the purpose, data were collected from a sample of 725 students from the city ofChennai (India) and 715 students from Mito City in Japan. The results of the study revealed that there was a difference in the level <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> victimization between the respondents from India and Japan. Fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> victimization was influenced by some factors such as gender, age and the place of residence of respondents.

40|$|Fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> is implicated as a {{risk factor}} for poorer mental health, yet few studies have {{explored}} whether there is a causal relationship between fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> and health, or tested the direction of the relationship. Does, for example, heightened fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> lead to poorer mental health, or could poorer mental health exacerbate fear <b>of</b> <b>crime?</b> RESIDE participants in Perth, Australia, completed a questionnaire three years after moving to their neighbourhood (2007 - 2008, n = 1230), and again four years later (2011 - 2012, n = 531). The impact <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> on psychological distress (Kessler- 6) was examined in SAS using the Proc Mixed procedure (marginal repeated measures model with unrestricted variance pattern). Models controlled for demographics and time, and progressively adjusted for avoidance behaviours (i. e., walking, community participation, social cohesion). This approach was repeated with psychological distress as the independent variable and fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> as the outcome. For each increase in one standard deviation (SD) in fear <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> psychological distress increased by 0. 680 (p = 0. 0001), however in the reversed models, for each one SD increase in psychological distress, fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> increased by 0. 152 (p = 0. 0001). To help explain these results, temporal order models examined whether baseline values predicted follow-up values. There was a significant association between psychological distress (at baseline) and fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> (at follow-up), but no association between fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> (at baseline) and psychological distress (at follow-up). The findings suggest a bi-directional relationship exists between fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> and mental health, however it appears that higher psychological distress over time leads to higher fear <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> rather than the reverse. Furthermore, the pathway connecting fear <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> and mental health appears to be direct, rather than via constrained social and physical activities...|$|R
