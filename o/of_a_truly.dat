In 1956 he was one of three Muhammadiyah members who presented their concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> Islamic society, one which emphasised social education. During this time he was more active with Masyumi, and after the 1955 Constituent Assembly election, Fakih was made a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia. This assembly, meant to reach an agreement for a new national constitution, failed to gain a consensus, and was disbanded by president Sukarno with his decree of 5 July 1959. That year Fakih collaborated with Hamka, Joesoef Poear Abdullah, and Ahmad Joesoef to launch the magazine Pandji Masjarakat. Sukarno later disbanded Masyumi on 17 August 1960 after leading Masyumi members, such as Mohammad Natsir and Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, were involved with the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia; Fakih had been involved in the negotiations with the Revolutionary Government, working with Mohammad Roem.|$|E

25|$|To Leo the Great, Mariology is {{determined}} by Christology. If Christ were divine only, everything about him would be divine.

25|$|The final {{emergence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> indigenous English-language {{poetry in}} the United States {{was the work}} of two poets, Walt Whitman (18191892) and Emily Dickinson (18301886). On the surface, these two poets could not have been less alike. Whitman's long lines, derived from the metric of the King James Version of the Bible, and his democratic inclusiveness stand in stark contrast with Dickinson's concentrated phrases and short lines and stanzas, derived from Protestant hymnals.|$|E

25|$|The Goldwater-Nichols Act {{reworked}} {{the command}} {{structure of the}} United States military, thereby making the most sweeping changes to the United States Department of Defense since the department {{was established in the}} National Security Act of 1947.

One of the first reorganizations resulting from both the Department of Defense analysis and the legislation was the formation of the U.S. Special Operations Command in 1987.|$|E
25|$|In 1858 King Surendra {{bestowed}} upon Jung Bahadur Kunwar the honorific title of Rana, an old title denoting martial glory used by Rajput princes in northern India. He then became Jung Bahadur Rana, and the later prime ministers descended {{from his family}} added his name to their own in honour of his accomplishments. Their line {{became known as the}} house of the Ranas. Jung Bahadur remained prime minister until 1877, suppressing conspiracies and local revolts and enjoying the fruits of his early successes. He exercised almost unlimited power over internal affairs, taking for his own use whatever funds were available in the treasury. He lived in the high style of an Anglicised native prince in the British Raj, although unlike the Indian princes he was the ruler <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> independent nation, an ally rather than a subordinate of the British.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the size}} of the {{dispersed}} phase may be difficult to measure, and because colloids have the appearance of solutions, colloids are sometimes identified and characterized by their physico-chemical and transport properties. For example, if a colloid consists of a solid phase dispersed in a liquid, the solid particles will not diffuse through a membrane, whereas with a true solution the dissolved ions or molecules will diffuse through a membrane. Because of the size exclusion, the colloidal particles are unable to pass through the pores of an ultrafiltration membrane with a size smaller than their own dimension. The smaller {{the size of}} the pore of the ultrafiltration membrane, the lower the concentration of the dispersed colloidal particles remaining in the ultrafiltered liquid. The measured value of the concentration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> dissolved species will thus depend on the experimental conditions applied to separate it from the colloidal particles also dispersed in the liquid. This is particularly important for solubility studies of readily hydrolyzed species such as Al, Eu, Am, Cm, or organic matter complexing these species.|$|E
25|$|The {{prospect}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> national rugby league {{competition in}} addition to the introduction of pay television in Australia attracted the attention of global media organisation, News Corporation, and it followed that professional rugby league was shaken to its very foundations in the mid-1990s {{with the advent of the}} Super League war. Initially a conflict over broadcasting rights, it became a dispute as to who controlled the sport and which traditional clubs would survive into the new national era, as News Limited formed their own Super League and admitted some former ARL clubs, poaching players from the original ARL league with high salaries. With twenty-two teams of highly varying quality playing in two competitions that year, crowd attendances and corporate sponsorships were spread very thinly, and many teams found themselves in financial difficulty. The ARL undertook moves to invite the traditional clubs that had moved to the Super League competition back into a re-unified competition. Following a period of negotiation with News Corporation, on 23 September 1997 the ARL announced that it was forming a new company to conduct the competition in 1998. On 7 October News' Manaaki Ranginui announced that he was confident that there would be a single competition in 1998. On 19 December, representatives of clubs affiliated with the Australian Rugby League gathered at the Sydney Football Stadium to decide whether to accept News Limited's offer of a settlement – eventually voting in favour by 36 votes to 4. As a result, in the following months the National Rugby League, jointly owned by the ARL and News Limited, was formed.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} German Ideology, Marx {{turned to}} a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding [...] "the theory and tactics" [...] <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> [...] "revolutionary proletarian movement" [...] operating from the standpoint <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>truly</b> [...] "scientific materialist" [...] philosophy. This work was intended to draw {{a distinction between the}} utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded {{one person at a time}} to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book The Poverty of Philosophy (1847) and offered it as a response to the [...] "petty bourgeois philosophy" [...] of the French anarchist socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as expressed in his book The Philosophy of Poverty (1840).|$|E
