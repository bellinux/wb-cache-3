25|$|As the American colonies came to {{identify}} more with their <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> {{and the concept}} of liberty, rather than as vassals of the British empire, icons that were unique to the Americas became increasingly popular. The rattlesnake, like the bald eagle and American Indian, came to symbolize American ideals and society.|$|E
25|$|Antisemitism {{has been}} {{explained}} in terms of racism, xenophobia, projected guilt, displaced aggression, and the search for a scapegoat. Some explanations assign partial blame to the perception of Jewish people as unsociable. Such a perception may have arisen by many Jews having strictly kept to their <b>own</b> <b>communities,</b> with their own practices and laws.|$|E

25|$|The {{immigration}} routes {{still have}} an effect today. Immigrants often formed their <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> and some areas have a pronounced ethnicity, such as Dutch, German, Polish, Finnish, and many others. Since many immigrants settled {{for a time in}} New England before moving westward, many areas on the U.S. side of the Great Lakes also have a New England feel, especially in home styles and accent.|$|E

25|$|Much of Indigenous {{feminism}} {{has taken}} shape around issues {{that resulted from}} colonial practices. Indigenous feminism {{is a direct result}} of, and a direct answer to the colonization and continued oppression of Indigenous peoples around the world. The need to question cultural practices from within allows Indigenous women to actively shape their <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> and helps encourage self-determination and cultural ownership. Differentiating Indigenous feminism from white feminism illuminates the ways that white feminism does not fully account for Indigenous experiences.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, the Panama YMCA {{was given}} its {{first piece of}} property, a 40-acre (16 ha) piece of land for a day camping and nature centre site, {{allowing}} it to expand its programmes. The camp allowed the Panama YMCA to expand a great deal and became a major resource for various programmes. The camp also {{was used as a}} conference centre. The National Volunteers used it as a leadership training area, learning community development techniques that they could take back to their <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b> The Girl and Boy Scouts as well as church groups also used the area.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{geography}} is often {{considered part of}} a broader postmodern approach to the subject which is not primarily concerned with the development of conceptual theory in itself but rather focuses on the real experiences of individuals and groups in their own localities, upon the geographies that they live in within their <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b> In addition to its analysis of the real world, it also critiques existing geographical and social studies, arguing that academic traditions are delineated by patriarchy, and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the male bias of academic study.|$|E
25|$|While {{civilian}} communities {{had organized}} {{ways to deal}} with the care and transportation of the sick and dying {{as far back as the}} bubonic plague in London between 1598 and 1665, such arrangements were typically ad hoc and temporary. In time, however, these arrangements began to formalize and become permanent. During the American Civil War, Jonathan Letterman devised a system of mobile field hospitals employing the first uses of the principles of triage. After returning home, some veterans began to attempt to apply what had they had seen on the battlefield to their <b>own</b> <b>communities,</b> and commenced the creation of volunteer life-saving squads and ambulance corps.|$|E

25|$|The boatmen (usually {{with their}} families) were a rough {{independent}} lot, forming a class within themselves, and intermarrying {{within their own}} group. They frequently fought amongst each other for any reason, be it racial slurs (real or perceived), precedence at a lock, or for exercise. They fought with lockkeepers over company rules, or even with the company for changes in toll rates. During winter when the boats were tied up, they often lived in their <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> away from others. One boat captain observed that on the canal, {{women and children were}} as good as the men, and if weren't for the children, the canal wouldn't run one day.|$|E
25|$|Deaf-community sign languages, on {{the other}} hand, arise where deaf people come {{together}} to form their <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b> These include school sign, such as Nicaraguan Sign Language, which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as Bamako Sign Language, which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, {{as in the case}} of ASL.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} small {{immigrant}} communities of Spaniards, Italians, Basque and Lebanese. African slaves were imported to Mexico through the Veracruz port. At one point, they outnumbered Europeans {{and a significant}} number ran away from haciendas and plantations to form their <b>own</b> <b>communities,</b> sometimes allied with indigenous groups. One such rebellion was led by Yanga, who successfully negotiated a free African community with Spanish authorities in 1609. Like other groups, many of African descent would intermarry with other groups, with the category of “mulatto” existing in the old colonial caste system for those with African blood. Today, {{the vast majority of}} Afro Mexicans in Veracruz {{and other parts of the}} country are spread out and intermixed with the rest of the population.|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] means [...] "island" [...] in Japanese. In Amami Ōshima {{and other}} islands, {{it also means}} (one's <b>own)</b> <b>community</b> within the island. Such a {{semantic}} extension can be understood {{by the fact that}} many communities had little contact with the outside because they were geographically isolated by the vast sea in the front and heavy mountains in the back. Thus shima-uta originally means songs transmitted in one's <b>own</b> <b>community.</b> A report states that elderly people only refer to their <b>own</b> <b>community's</b> songs as shima-uta; songs from other communities are not considered shima-uta. In written Japanese, the specialized meaning of shima is sometimes indicated by the use of katakana (シマ), instead of the conventional kanji (島).|$|R
