5|$|Buddhist texts {{recount the}} birth of the Buddhist Chinnamunda. One tale tells of Krishnacharya's disciples, two Mahasiddha ("great perfected ones") sisters, Mekhala and Kanakhala, who cut their heads, <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> to their guru, and then danced. The goddess Vajrayogini also {{appeared}} in this form and danced with them. Another story recalls how the Mahasiddha princess Lakshminkara, cut off her head as a punishment from the king and roamed with it in the city, where citizens extolled her as Chinnamunda-Vajravarahi.|$|E
5|$|From 2005 to 2009, {{the series}} {{remained}} largely unmentioned, with the rights still fully belonging to Take-Two. In 2006, German-based Yager Development pitched a cover-based shooter to publisher 2K Games, who rejected the original concept of futuristic soldiers without Dubai as a setting. However, 2K <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> {{a chance to}} develop a reboot for the Spec Ops series, promising {{that they would have}} a lot of creative freedom. Development began in early 2007, with most other fundamentals of the initial game intact. While the game is an installment in the Spec Ops series, the team chose to use new ideas and intentionally avoided using existing elements of the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Move is {{the tenth}} studio album by Christian rock band Third Day. Released on October 19, 2010, {{the album was}} the band's first after guitarist Brad Avery left Third Day. The band wanted the album to be a {{departure}} from the modern rock stylings of Revelation (2008), intending to show more of their southern rock roots. Third Day chose to work with producer Paul Moak on the album and recorded it at their own studio, feeling it <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> more creative freedom. Primarily a southern rock album, Move also has significant influence from gospel music.|$|E

5|$|Myst co-creators and {{brothers}} Rand and Robyn Miller often created fictional worlds and stories as young children. Their vision was refined by {{the works of}} fantasy and science fiction writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov; Star Wars <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> a glimpse at an exciting, fully realized fictional world. Younger brother Robyn began working on a children's novel called Dunnyhut; though he never completed the work, elements from the story influenced aspects of Mysts story.|$|E
5|$|Pod is {{the debut}} album by the American {{alternative}} rock band the Breeders, released on 4AD in May 1990. The group {{began when the}} Pixies' Kim Deal and Throwing Muses' Tanya Donelly became friends in 1988 and decided {{they would like to}} create music together. Abandoning their initial idea of focusing on dance music, they recorded a country-influenced demo with musicians including violinist Carrie Bradley and bassist Ray Holiday in 1989. When 4AD cofounder Ivo Watts-Russell heard the demo, he <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> money to re-record the songs for an album release.|$|E
5|$|The {{directors}} had {{twelve days}} to film two episodes each, equating to approximately {{five minutes of}} screen-time per day. Langan asked Father Ted director Declan Lowney to helm the first two episodes after his successful direction of the pilot. Lowney declined in order to shoot a film in Ireland with Terence Stamp; production on it was scheduled to begin in October 1997 and would have overrun into Cold Feets production calendar. Funding for Lowney's film fell through {{and he took the}} two episodes of Cold Feet after Langan <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> to him a second time. The other two directors were Mark Mylod and Nigel Cole.|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{stay with}} the Danish consul, the family were shipped to a refugee camp {{on the island of}} Büyükada in the Dardanelles Strait near Istanbul, Turkey, where the Kulikovsky family shared three rooms with eleven other adults. After two weeks, they were {{evacuated}} to Belgrade in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Regent Alexander Karageorgevich, later to become King Alexander I, <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> a permanent home there, but Dowager Empress Marie summoned her daughter to Denmark. The Grand Duchess complied, and the family arrived in Copenhagen on Good Friday 1920. They lived with Kulikovsky's mother-in-law, Dowager Empress Marie, at first at the Amalienborg Palace and then at the royal estate of Hvidøre. Kulikovsky and Marie did not get along; he was resentful of his wife acting as Marie's secretary and companion, and Marie was distant toward him.|$|E
5|$|However, the Taiwanese Aboriginal {{peoples who}} were {{previously}} {{allied with the}} Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the later Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> amnesty; the Sincan Aboriginals then proceeded {{to work for the}} Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions while the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E

5|$|Indonesian {{law does}} not require that arrested people be {{immediately}} charged with an offence, and by 22 April 2005 no charges had yet been laid. Police indicated that the five arrested at the airport would be charged with drug trafficking, which carries the death penalty, while those arrested in the hotel would be charged with the lesser offence of drug possession, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment. It was suggested that Andrew Chan recruited the other eight to act as drug mules – couriers who would not arouse suspicion while carrying heroin to Australia – and <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> A$10,000 to A$15,000 each {{to carry out this}} task, and given A$5000 spending cash.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, {{the fleet}} {{transporting}} the two first brigades arrived in Navarino bay, where the joint Franco-Russo-British squadron was berthed. The Egyptian army was concentrated between Navarino and Methoni. Thus, the landing was risky. The fleet sailed toward the Gulf of Koroni {{protected by a}} fortress held by the Ottomans. The expeditionary corps began to disembark without meeting any opposition {{on the evening of}} August 29, finishing on the morning of August 30. A proclamation by governor Capodistria had informed the Greek population of the imminent arrival of a French expedition. The locals rushed up before the troops as soon as they set foot on Greek soil and <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> food.|$|E
5|$|Other {{aspects of}} the excise law also caused concern. The law {{required}} all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 {{miles away from the}} small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protester's ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> office space or housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident Federal tax official.|$|E

5|$|To placate {{physical}} retailers {{affected by}} the digital exclusivity period, Universal <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> a deluxe version of Songs of Innocence that contains four additional songs, along with several acoustic versions of the record's songs. The bonus tracks were exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores and music streaming services for five weeks; the iTunes Store then released the ten deluxe edition tracks under the title Songs of Innocence + on 18 November 2014. Retailers also received catalog deals that discounted U2's albums in stores by US$3 {{for a period of}} time. A Grammy Awards spokesperson initially said the album would not be eligible for consideration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards because {{it would not have been}} available for purchase prior to the 30 September eligibility deadline. However, this ruling was reversed after UMG released a limited-edition vinyl pressing of the album to retailers on the cutoff date.|$|E
5|$|After {{over a year}} of live shows, rehearsals and a {{recording}} of a demo (known as the Live Demonstration tape), the band's big break came in May 1993 when they were spotted by Creation Records co-owner Alan McGee. Oasis were invited to play a gig at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut club in Glasgow, Scotland, by a band called Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along {{with a group of}} friends, hired a van and made the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry to the club as they were not on that night's set list, which reportedly caused the band to bully their way in (although the band and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they managed to get into the club). They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see 18 Wheeler, one of his own bands. McGee was so impressed he <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> {{a recording}} contract; they however did not sign until several months later. Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis ended up signing a worldwide contract with Sony, which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.|$|E
5|$|By 2011, {{several of}} the {{strippers}} JC's Girls members had spoken with in San Diego had begun attending a Bible study hosted by the organization and the chapter had helped one stripper leave the sex industry and gain unrelated employment. In March 2011, the chapter sent a delegation to Adultcon at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where Scher and Brown spoke with conference attendees and <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> prayer. That July, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she could {{spend more time with}} her family, handing the leadership of the organization to Scher and Brown. In June 2012, Scher gave up her co-leadership of the organization to focus on her family, leaving the leadership to Brown. By 2013, the organization had established guidelines regulating the transition of women from the sex industry into participation in the evangelistic activities of JC's Girls. The woman must consistently attend a Bible study for four months, read Francine Rivers' book Redeeming Love, and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry. Brown left JC's Girls in April 2014 and Laura Bonde took over leadership of the organization.|$|E

5|$|Having {{heard of}} Sweyn's defeat by Magnus, Harald {{met up with}} his fellow exile in Sweden (who was also his nephew), {{as well as with}} the Swedish king Anund Jacob, and the three joined forces against Magnus. Their first {{military}} exploit consisted of raiding the Danish coast, in an effort to impress the natives by demonstrating that Magnus <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> no protection, and thus leading them to submit to Harald and Sweyn. Learning about their actions, Magnus knew that their next target would be Norway. Harald may have planned to be taken as king of his father's petty kingdom, and thereafter claim the rest of the country. In any case, the people were unwilling to turn against Magnus, and on hearing news of Harald's schemes, Magnus (abroad at the time) went home to Norway with his entire army. Instead of going to war, Magnus's advisors recommended the young king not fight his uncle, and a compromise was reached in 1046 in which Harald would rule Norway (not Denmark) jointly with Magnus (although Magnus would have precedence). Notably, Harald also had to agree to share half of his wealth with Magnus, who at the time was effectively bankrupt and badly in need of funds. During their short co-rule, Harald and Magnus had separate courts and kept to themselves, and their only recorded meetings nearly ended in physical clashes.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Warne and Waugh had met John in Colombo, Australia {{defeated}} Pakistan in {{a one-day}} match, scoring 7/179 and restricting Pakistan to 9/151 in reply. There were suspicions that the Pakistanis had thrown {{the game by}} batting slowly, although Warne said he had genuinely tried his best, pointing {{out that he was}} named man-of-the-match. Warne and May had alleged that Malik <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> money to bowl badly {{on the final day of}} the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes. Warne denied that he had thrown the match, again pointing out he was named man-of-the-match. Waugh had alleged that Malik offered him money to help Australia lose a one-day match during the same tour. He denied the allegation that he did so. Waugh scored an unbeaten 121, but it was not enough to prevent Australia from suffering a nine-wicket defeat.|$|E
5|$|Judy {{also pointed}} out the {{approach}} of hostile Japanese aircraft long before any of the human crew could hear them. This first occurred prior to the outbreak of war, when the aircraft would fly low over the Gnat with Judy barking at them until they had passed. On an outing to Jiujiang, Jefferey took Judy for a walk outside of the city but she ran ahead, pulling him with her. He realised as he looked back {{that she had been}} pulling him away from a Leopard. In November 1937, the Gnat met with the American river gunboat USS Panay. After the Panay held a party for the two ship's companies, the Gnat crew departed and only realised afterwards that Judy was not with them. They contacted the Panay via signal lamp, but they insisted that they had not seen her. The following morning, the crew heard from a Chinese trader that Judy was on board the Panay after all. In retaliation, a party boarded the American vessel and stole the ship's bell. Afterwards they contacted the Panay and <b>offered</b> <b>them</b> the bell back in return for Judy. She was returned within the hour.|$|E
