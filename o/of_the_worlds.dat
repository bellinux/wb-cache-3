5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1981 title Defender, Williams searched for new {{creative}} staff. Believing video games to be the future of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list of ideas that included game ideas for The War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Worlds</b> and Joust, Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications dictated the selection; Newcomer's vision of The War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Worlds</b> was infeasible, but Joust could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using Defenders hardware.|$|E
