25|$|Note {{that there}} are some {{resources}} which make the mistaken assumption that all red fruits contain lycopene, when in fact many are pigmented by other chemicals. An example is the blood orange, which is colored by anthocyanins, while other red colored oranges, such as the Cara cara navel, and <b>other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit,</b> such as pink grapefruit, are colored by lycopene.|$|E
50|$|The brand's {{popularity}} derives {{both from}} its unique flavor {{and from the}} design of its 25 cl (8 oz) bottle made {{in the shape of}} a pear with a pebbly texture meant to recall the peel of an orange or <b>other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit.</b> Larger bottles also include the pebbly texture but use a more regular bottle shape rather than maintaining the proportions of the smaller bottles.|$|E
50|$|Shangjuan forms a shrub {{or small}} tree, which is {{commonly}} thorny. Leaves are notable {{for a large}} petiole, resembling those of the related Kaffir lime and Ichang papeda, and are fragrant. The large fruit has a flavor resembling a mixture of lemon and grapefruit, and is occasionally used {{as a substitute for}} those fruits. Like <b>other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> with C. ichangensis ancestry, the shangjuan is relatively cold-tolerant.|$|E

50|$|Kirkwood's {{subtropical}} climate makes it ideal {{for the growing}} of citrus fruits and this has made it the citrus capital of the Eastern Cape. Indeed, Kirkwood {{is the center of}} one of the largest citrus-growing regions in South Africa with approximately 120 square kilometres (30,000 acres) of citrus orchards. Approximately 18 million cartons of oranges, lemons, grapefruit and <b>other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> are exported from this region each year.|$|E
50|$|Another {{theory is}} that the drink was named after British Royal Navy Surgeon Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Gimlette KCB (1857-1943), who {{allegedly}} introduced this drink as a means of inducing his messmates to take lime juice as an anti-scurvy medication. (Limes and <b>other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> have been used by the Royal Navy for the prevention of scurvy since the mid-18th century.) However, neither his obituary notice in the BMJ, The Times (6 October 1943) nor his entry in Who Was Who 1941-1950 mention this association.|$|E

50|$|A zester (also, citrus zester or lemon zester) is {{a kitchen}} utensil for obtaining zest from lemons and <b>other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit.</b> A kitchen zester is {{approximately}} four inches long, with a handle and a curved metal end, {{the top of}} which is perforated with a row of round holes with sharpened rims. To operate, the zester is pressed with moderate force against the fruit and drawn across its peel. The rims cut the zest from the pith underneath. The zest is cut into ribbons, one drawn through each hole.|$|E
50|$|<b>Other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> hybrids {{have been}} able to help the economy in Florida over the years as a way to extend the orange season. Many of these fruits are not {{necessarily}} combinations of two different fruits, like how an orangequat is, but they have been hybridized to grow through colder months, begin ripening earlier, have longer harvesting periods; all of these traits are {{used to be able to}} extend the overall length of citrus season in Florida. By extending the harvest period, many farmers are able to grow and sell more product, which then provides them with more income and will in turn improve the economy in Florida.|$|E
50|$|The Mexican lime tree, {{a slender}} tree which grows to heights of 2.0 - 4.0 m, bears scentless flowers (with white stems and yellow anthers) that mature into fruits, singly, in pairs or in larger clusters. The fruit, which is {{generally}} 25 - 51 mm in diameter, as it ripens, changes its peel color from green to pale-yellow. The greenish-yellow pulp of the fruit, with its inseparable 6-15 segments, is juicy and highly acidic with flavor and aroma. It has either a few or many small seeds. Though the climatic conditions under which the Mexican lime thrives is moist, with annual precipitation {{in the range of}} 2,000 - 3,800 mm the tree is more capable of enduring drought conditions than <b>other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> varieties. However, in excessive rainfall, trees may be infected with fungus. The Mexican lime is also more sensitive to cold than the lemon, and can be grown only in protected locations.|$|E

5000|$|Murphy and {{his family}} lived on a ranch located at 7514 N Central Ave and Orangewood Ave in Phoenix. He began to develop his land and experimented with the {{importation}} cultivation of 1,800 orange and <b>other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> trees which he imported from California. The success of his experimentation helped opened the eastern markets to the Arizona landowners and farmers. Murphy established the Valley citrus industry in the northern extension of Central Avenue in 1895. The roadway, which he developed, was first paved in 1920. It cut through the Orangewood subdivision. Known as the [...] "Murphy Bridle Path", it begins at Bethany Homes Road and ends {{two and a half}} miles north at the Arizona Canal. The earliest reference to the Murphy Bridle Path, that the city's historic preservation office discovered, was in 1948 when the bridle path was dedicated by the [...] "Arizona Horse Lover's Club." [...] The North Central Avenue streetscape is now on the Phoenix Historic Property Register and has been nominated to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
40|$|Large {{amounts of}} Citrus peel (rich in poly-phenolic compounds) are {{generated}} as {{a by-product of}} the juice processing industry. Development of alternative, higher valued products utilizing peel waste from grapefruit, oranges, Valencia and <b>other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> would benefit citrus juice processors by providing them with means to profitably process their peel waste and to avoid environmentally hazardous dumping. Citrus peel waste [CPW, comprised of peel, membranes and juice vesicles] contains {{a high level of}} polyphenols and has been used for the production of animal feed, single-cell protein, fibre, enzyme(s), immobilization support & bio-sorbent for heavy metal removal. Naringin (a major tri-hydroxy flavonoid glycoside) is available in large amounts in citrus peel, processed juice and can be extracted from citrus peel waste 1. The extracted naringin is further hydrolysed by rhamnosidase to produce D-rhamnose for the production of ethanol and other fermentation products. We have produced a recombinant enzyme 2 that has the ability to catalyse the cleavage of terminal rhamnoside groups from naringin to prunin and rhamnose. We have recovered important sugar “D-rhamnose” from the processed waste which would be utilized for ethanol production 3. This presentation will summarize current efforts to develop an enzymatic treatment which would facilitate the economical processing of citrus waste for bioenergy generation. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Amino {{acids in}} orange juice may hold {{clues to the}} mostly secret, highly {{successful}} attack strategy of a powerful plant pathogen. Recent studies of these compounds may {{pave the way to}} a safe, effective, environmentally friendly way to vanquish this orchard enemy. Known as Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, this microbe causes citrus greening disease, also called “Huanglongbing,” or “HLB. ” (See article on page 4). Agricultural Research Service chemist Andrew P. Breksa III and University of California-Davis professor Carolyn M. Slupsky have compared the amino acid composition of juice from commercially grown oranges. They used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study juice from oranges grown on either HLBpositive trees or HLB-negative trees. Their investigation is apparently the first to do so, the scientists say. The research has yielded distinctive profiles of the kinds and amounts of 11 different amino acids in 3 types of oranges: fruit from healthy trees, symptom-free fruit from HLB-positive trees, and fruit with HLB symptoms from HLB-positive trees. With further research, the profiles may prove to be “a reliable, rapid, and early indicator of the presence of the HLB pathogen in an orchard,” Breksa says. For growers, an early indicator of HLB would be valuable. Here’s why: HLB can be a silent killer, living quietly and undetected for years in a grove of oranges, grapefruits, lemons, or <b>other</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit.</b> The amino acid profiles may have another use, as well. They may reveal clues to mechanisms underlying the microbe’s mode of attack. “No one understands precisely how the pathogen overcomes the defense system a citrus tree can ordinarily mobilize when it’s under siege,” Breksa says. Trees need amino acids for growth, development, and defense. But what if the HLB pathogen were causing havoc with the trees’ ability to create, use, and recycle these amino acids...|$|E
