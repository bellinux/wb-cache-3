50|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Gamma base, the player is immediately ambushed by the Gamma forces, which {{have already been}} taken over by Nexus. After the player survives the ambush and develops countermeasures to ‘Nexus’ infection, Nexus takes control of the remaining NASDA satellites and attempts to destroy the player. However, before he can succeed, the Project captures a NASDA missile site, and shoots down the <b>orbiting</b> <b>laser</b> <b>weapons.</b> It is learned that the scientist Dr. Reed, who was bankrupted by the US military, transformed himself into the Nexus virus and was responsible for the holocaust by infiltrating the ‘NASDA’ systems. At this point, the survivors of the Alpha and Beta bases arrive, and the three Project teams launch a full-scale assault on Nexus. The Project destroys Nexus and can begin rebuilding civilization.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the employability of <b>laser</b> <b>weapons</b> on a Navy Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) class ship to counter small and fast boat threats. A general model of <b>laser</b> <b>weapons</b> is established {{to identify the}} attributes that characterize the <b>laser</b> <b>weapon</b> system. Quantitative values of each attribute are compared with current laser systems (that are under development) to identify potential laser types for employment on the Navy ship. In addition, plausible operational scenarios of suicide attacks by multiple (up to three) small and fast motor boats equipped with Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) against LCS-class ships are drawn up. These provide input parameters for computation of the required laser parameters to neutralize such threats. Based on the chosen laser technology and the calculated laser parameters, the requirements for employment of the <b>laser</b> <b>weapon</b> system on a Navy ship are determined.

40|$|The {{paper will}} give an {{overview}} over the <b>laser</b> <b>weapon</b> activities at RWM (Rheinmetall Waffe Munition) {{over the last}} years. Starting from the actual scenarios for <b>laser</b> <b>weapon</b> applications as: CRAM (Counter Rocket Artillery Mortar), Air Defence and UXO (unexploded ordnance) clearing. The basic requirements of a future <b>laser</b> <b>weapon</b> as beam diameter, beam quality, tracking capability, adaptive optics were deduced. For the UXO scenario a mobile directed energy laser demonstrator for humanitarian mine and UXO clearing based on fiber lasers is presented. Based on the parameters the system concept including the cooling system, power supply and the integration into the armoured vehicle TM 170 are explained. The contribution show first experiments of UXO and IED clearing. Different technical approaches to achieve laser power in the 100 kW regime combined with very good beam quality are discussed to fulfil {{the requirements of the}} CRAM and Air Defence scenario. Spectral coupling and the beam superimposing both are performed by Rheinmetall Waffe Munition. At the spectral coupling the basic technology parameters for the fiber laser and the dielectric grating as the latest results were put into context with the power levels reached at other groups. For the beam super imposing technology the basic experiments regarding the tracking capability and compensation of the atmosphere on the test range at Unterlüß will be explained. A generic 10 kW <b>Laser</b> <b>Weapon</b> Demonstrator based on 2 <b>Laser</b> <b>Weapon</b> Modules (LWM) from RWM each 5 kW fiber Laser with beam forming and tracking integrate by the team of RWM and RAD (Rheinmetall Air Defense) into a Ground based Air Defend system consisting of Skyguard and Millenium turret are presented. The flight path of the UAV within the valley of the life firing range at Ochsenboden Switzerland is shown. Selected results of the successful tests against UAV's are presented. It shows the capability of the generic 10 kW <b>Laser</b> <b>Weapon</b> Demonstrator to track and to destroy the target. From these results the next steps of Rheinmetall Waffe Munition for a 100 kW class <b>laser</b> <b>weapon</b> are explained...|$|R
