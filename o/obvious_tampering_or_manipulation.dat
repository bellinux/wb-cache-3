30|$|In recent years, {{with the}} {{increasing}} popularity and usage of digital cameras, together {{with the development of}} image editing technologies, it has become much easier for people with minimal expertise to edit image data. Image <b>tampering</b> <b>or</b> <b>manipulation</b> is often carried out as simple entertainment or as the initial step of a photomontage, which is popular in the field of image editing. However, the use of manipulated images for malicious purposes can have adverse consequences on human society because it is difficult to detect tempered images with the human eyes [1]. Therefore, the development of reliable image forgery detection methods is important to enable us to determine the authenticity of the images. Recently, various kinds of image forgery detection approaches have been proposed [2, 3].|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The reprehensible use of {{technology}} such as powerful editing software and sophisticated digital cameras leads to image <b>tampering</b> <b>or</b> <b>manipulation.</b> The <b>tampered</b> data is being illegally used and distributed through high-speed digital networks. Hence techniques {{to solve the problem}} of unauthorized copying, tampering, and multimedia data delivery through the internet are very much in demand. Information hiding, is the key issue, consists mainly of steganography and digital watermarking. Development of image tampering detection algorithms in active and passive methods became a significant research work. In this paper, comparative analysis on the performance of two algorithms such as 3 LSB and DWT was reported. These two algorithms are designed in active method i. e. it uses digital watermarking in the background. Any tampering/modification on the watermarked image results in the change in the intensity levels, so in turn the coefficient values. The extraction procedure results in the watermark whose bit value reflects the respective changes. The 3 LSB method proves to be superior to DWT method in terms of detection and localization.

30|$|Integrity and authenticity: in this scheme, the AuthenticationValue {{filed in}} the GOOSE/SMV message is enabled with {{signature}} authentication based on the HMAC algorithm to ensure the integrity and authenticity of GOOSE/SMV messages, which prevents the data from being <b>tampered</b> <b>or</b> forged during the transmission. Furthermore, we define the data structure of the Authentication value of MMS and adopt peer entity authentication based on the SM 2 algorithm to verify the integrity and authenticity of MMS messages. The method of hashing the date of MMS messages by the SM 3 algorithm can prevent an unauthorized modification. By this way, attackers cannot arbitrarily <b>tamper</b> <b>or</b> forge messages.|$|R

Digital images have also been used as cover data for transmitting secret information in the field of steganography. In this paper, we introduce a new set of features for multimedia forensics to determine if a digital image is an authentic camera output or if it has been <b>tampered</b> <b>or</b> embedded with hidden data. We perform such image forensic analysis employing three sets of statistical noise features, including those from denoising operations, wavelet analysis, and neighborhood prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively distinguish digital images from their <b>tampered</b> <b>or</b> stego versions.
