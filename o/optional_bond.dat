40|$|A {{multilayer}} article comprises a substrate comprising {{a ceramic}} or a silicon-containing metal alloy. The ceramic is a Si-containing ceramic or an oxide ceramic {{with or without}} silicon. An outer layer overlies the substrate {{and at least one}} intermediate layer is located between the outer layer and thc substrate. An <b>optional</b> <b>bond</b> layer is disposed between thc 1 least one intermediate layer and thc substrate. The at least one intermediate layer may comprise an optional chemical barrier layer adjacent the outer layer, a mullite-containing layer and an optional chemical barrier layer adjacent to the bond layer or substrate. The outer layer comprises a compound having a low coefficient of thermal expansion selected from one of the following systems: rare earth (RE) silicates; at least one of hafnia and hafnia-containing composite oxides; zirconia-containing composite oxides and combinations thereof...|$|E
50|$|Muthia is an Indian food. The name {{is derived}} from the way it is made, from the 'gripping' action of the hand. It resembles sausage, but is a vegan dish. It is made up of {{chickpea}} flour, methi (fenugreek), salt, turmeric, chili powder, and an <b>optional</b> <b>bonding</b> agent/sweetener such as sugar and oil. It is a staple of Gujaratis. This dish is supposed to be good for keeping bowel movement regular, because it includes fenugreek.|$|R
5000|$|... 10PASS-TS PHYs {{deliver a}} minimum of 10 Mbit/s over {{distances}} of up to 750 m, using ITU-T G.993.1 (VDSL) technology over a single copper pair. These PHYs may also support an <b>optional</b> aggregation or <b>bonding</b> of multiple copper pairs, called PME Aggregation Function (PAF).|$|R
40|$|A sulphamate {{compound}} is described. The compound {{is suitable}} for use as an inhibitor of both oestrone sulphatase activity and aromatase activity. A preferred compound has general formula (II) wherein F represents a phenolic ring structure (the first ring structure), J represents the third ring structure, I represents a phenolic ring structure (the second ring structure), G is an <b>optional</b> double <b>bond,</b> H is a link joining the second ring structure to the third ring structure, and Y represents a suitable second group; wherein any one of ring structures F, J and I has bound thereto a sulphamate group...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the first in a series}} that we devote to {{studying}} the problems of valuation and hedging of defaultable game options in general, and convertible corporate bonds in particular. Here, we present mathematical foundations for our overall study. Specifically, we provide several results characterizing the arbitrage price of a defaultable game option in terms of relevant Dynkin games. In addition, we provide important results regarding price decomposition of defaultable options. These general results are then specified to the case of convertible bonds, yielding in particular a decomposition of convertible <b>bonds</b> in an <b>optional</b> and a <b>bond</b> component. Defaultable game options, Convertible securities, Convertible bonds, Semimartingale market,...|$|R
2500|$|Included in this {{category}} are bid bonds (guaranty that a contractor will {{enter into a contract}} if awarded the bid); performance bonds (guaranty that a contractor will perform the work as specified by the contract); payment bonds (guaranty that a contractor will pay for services, particularly subcontractors and materials and particularly for federal projects where a mechanic's lien is not available); and maintenance bonds (guaranty that a contractor will provide facility repair and upkeep for a specified period of time). [...] There are also miscellaneous contract bonds that do not fall within the categories above, the most common of which are subdivision and supply bonds. Bonds are typically required for federal government projects by the Miller Act and state projects under [...] "little Miller Acts". In federal government, the contract language is determined by the government. In private contracts the parties may freely contract the language and requirements. Standard form contracts provided by American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) make <b>bonding</b> <b>optional.</b> If the parties agree to require bonding, additional forms such as the performance bond contract AIA Document 311 provide common terms.|$|R
