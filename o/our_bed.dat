500|$|Crickets {{have from}} time to time {{appeared}} in poetry. William Wordsworth's 1805 poem The Cottager to Her Infant includes the couplet [...] "The kitten sleeps upon the hearth, The crickets long have ceased their mirth". John Keats's 1819 poem Ode to Autumn includes the lines [...] "Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft / The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft". The Chinese Tang dynasty poet Du Fu (712–770) wrote a poem that in the translation by J. P. Seaton begins [...] "House cricket... Trifling thing. And yet how his mournful song moves us. Out in the grass his cry was a tremble, But now, he trills beneath <b>our</b> <b>bed,</b> to share his sorrow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elvis Presley {{reportedly}} spent {{days and}} nights with his friends and employees from the Memphis Mafia. They were a big family and Elvis lived in a [...] "milieu of a protective brotherhood." [...] Gerald Marzorati says that Elvis [...] "couldn't go anywhere else without a phalanx of boyhood friends." [...] Even the girls he dated lamented, [...] "Whenever you were with Elvis {{for the most part}} you were with his entourage. Those guys were always around". According to the singer's cousin Billy Smith, Elvis got into bed with Smith and his wife Jo [...] "many times at Graceland when we would spend the night there in Lisa's room, or on tour in the hotel, and at the trailer on the property at Graceland. ... we were all three there talking for hours about everything in the world! Sometimes he would have a bad dream and come looking for me to talk to, and he would actually fall asleep in <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> with us. That happened a lot of times, and we thought nothing of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Mark Crispin Miller, Graceland became for Presley [...] "the {{home of the}} {{organization}} that was himself, was tended by a large vague clan of Presleys and deputy Presleys, each squandering the vast gratuities which Elvis used to keep his whole world smiling." [...] The author adds that Presley's father Vernon [...] "had a swimming pool in his bedroom", that there [...] "was a jukebox next to the swimming pool, containing Elvis' favorite records" [...] and that the singer himself [...] "would spend hours in his bedroom, watching his property on a closed-circuit television." [...] According to the singer's cousin, Billy Smith, Presley {{spent the night at}} Graceland with Smith and his wife Jo many times: [...] "we were all three there talking for hours about everything in the world! Sometimes he would have a bad dream and come looking for me to talk to, and he would actually fall asleep in <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> with us." [...] Priscilla Beaulieu also lived at Graceland for five years before she and Elvis wed in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 1, 1967. Their daughter Lisa Marie Presley was born on February 1, 1968, and spent the first years of her life on the estate until her parents divorced in 1972, and she moved to California with her mother. Every year around Christmas, Lisa Marie Presley and all her family would go to Graceland to celebrate Christmas together. Lisa Marie often goes back to Graceland for visits.|$|E
60|$|Stockton let {{the remark}} pass without further comment; still, he {{appeared}} to be doing some hard thinking. He put Dick {{at one end of the}} long cave, me at the other. <b>Our</b> <b>bedding</b> was unpacked and placed at our disposal. We made <b>our</b> <b>beds.</b> After that I kept my eyes open and did not miss anything.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. Yes, it's common {{knowledge}} that we go to <b>our</b> <b>beds</b> at ten. [Chuckling] That's what we're counting on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Lord, ma'am, don't say that! We {{can never}} rest in <b>our</b> <b>beds</b> if such things are to happen," [...] gasped Bedford, backing to the door.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And why's <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> {{so hard to}} {{the bones}} [...] Excepting where it's cold?' 'Oh, that's because it is {{precious}} stones [...] Excepting where 'tis gold.|$|E
60|$|A few decayed {{leaves and}} boughs formed <b>our</b> <b>bed,</b> and a scanty supply of yams and taro, brought to us once a day, {{constituted}} our food.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And why's <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> {{so hard to}} {{the bones}} [...] Excepting where it's cold?' [...] 'Oh, that's because it is {{precious}} stones [...] Excepting where 'tis gold.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good gracious, Monica, it is a mercy that we {{have not}} been murdered in <b>our</b> <b>beds.</b> There was a house broken into at Forest Hill last week. Shall we go down and shut it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Live!' cried Martin. 'Yes, it's {{easy to say}} live; but if {{we should}} happen not to wake when rattlesnakes are making corkscrews of {{themselves}} upon <b>our</b> <b>beds,</b> it may be {{not so easy to}} do it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite, as you see. Our two selves and Mary Warren I {{believe to}} be the only persons in the house out of <b>our</b> <b>beds.</b> She has left us, a little hurt, perhaps, and we are quite alone." ...|$|R
60|$|He treated us quite kindly, {{even though}} he ordered his {{followers}} to bind us down to <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> upstairs, and to tie a cloth round our mouths so that our cries could not be distinctly heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's half frozen, Sam. The {{best thing}} {{will be to}} put it into <b>our</b> <b>bed,</b> that has just got warm. I will warm it up a little milk. It's no use taking it into the ward, tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you forgot," [...] he whispered, [...] "that {{my mother}} said as she would come and see us every night in <b>our</b> <b>bed?</b> If yer cries, she'll see as we're terrible unhappy, and that will make her unhappy too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We {{shall have}} it hiding under <b>our</b> <b>beds</b> and biting pieces {{out of our}} feet before long,” said Egbert, and from what Amanda knew of this {{particular}} otter she felt that the possibility was not a remote one.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} we may sleep in <b>our</b> <b>beds</b> to-night without fear of molestation," [...] the Bishop remarked, [...] "although {{if it had been}} the wish of the meeting, I would have {{broached}} the matter to Mr. Stenson." ...|$|R
60|$|Then we parted, {{and having}} placed both <b>our</b> <b>beds</b> in one chamber, slept soundly enough, for {{we were very}} tired, till we were awakened in the morning by the baying of those horrible death-hounds, being fed, I suppose, in a place nearby.|$|R
60|$|As to <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> rooms, {{you must}} know that all the apartments in this house are named after {{different}} plays of Shakspeare, the name being printed conspicuously over each door; so that the choosing of our rooms made us a little sport.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{between him}} and his Maker," [...] said the voice. [...] "The poor young man had set his heart on we know where. As we make <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> so we must lie on it, miss. It's for nobody to judge: though it may be a lesson." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a vivid charm in the scene. The poplars were in tender leaf. The moon, {{round and}} brilliant, was rising {{just above the}} {{mountains}} to the east, as we made <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> and went to sleep with the singing of the stream in our ears.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course this}} feature will grow {{more and more}} trying, {{but it will be}} human nature to cease to set it down; there will be five weeks of it yet--we must try to {{remember}} that for the diarist; it will make <b>our</b> <b>beds</b> the softer.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile we three, being {{thoroughly}} {{knocked up}} with our day's work, took a good draught of cocoa-nut lemonade, and throwing ourselves on <b>our</b> <b>beds,</b> fell fast asleep. The savages, it seems, followed our example, and in half-an-hour the whole camp was buried in repose.|$|R
60|$|We {{were all}} too {{exhausted}} for more discussion and putting that off {{until the next}} day we sought <b>our</b> <b>beds.</b> It was hardly any wonder that I felt myself jumping even in my sleep, and started up wildly more than once in the dead of night.|$|R
60|$|I had {{not counted}} {{that it would}} be {{possible}} for us to indulge in slumber after Uncle 'Rasmus had carried off the blankets; but yet before he was well on his way toward the village both of us were wrapped in sleep as profound as even when <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> was softer.|$|E
6000|$|Ber. I will {{remember}} I have been your wife; [...] And therefore, dying, beg from heaven your life: [...] Be all the discords of <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> forgot, [...] Which, virtue witness, I did never spot. [...] What errors I have made, though while I live [...] You cannot pardon, {{to the dead}} forgive.|$|E
60|$|We {{had been}} up since three o'clock that morning, and the day's travel had been exhausting. I had just enough energy left to scrape up a huge, soft pile of pine needles upon which to make <b>our</b> <b>bed.</b> After that all was {{oblivion}} until I was awakened by the ringing strokes of Nielsen's axe.|$|E
6000|$|We sought <b>our</b> <b>beds</b> early. The night {{down in that}} deep, open canyon was {{the coldest}} we had experienced. I slept but little. At dawn all was hoar-white with frost. It {{crackled}} under foot. The air had a stinging bite. Yet how sweet, pure, cold to breathe! ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} we {{appeared}} among our fellow-travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our journey; nor could any man suggest {{that we had been}} any where but in <b>our</b> <b>beds,</b> as travellers might be supposed to be, to fit themselves for the fatigues of that day's journey.|$|R
60|$|Our {{clothing}} was wet {{to the inner}} threads, and we were tired and muddy also, but our thoughts were on the horses rather than upon ourselves. We soon had a fire going and some hot supper, and by ten o'clock were stretched out in <b>our</b> <b>beds</b> for the night.|$|R
6000|$|I [...] Ha, for {{the snow}} and hoar! [...] Ho, for our fortune's made! [...] We can shape <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> without sheets to spread, [...] And our graves without a spade. [...] So foolish Life adieu, [...] And ingrate Leader too. [...] --Ah, but we loved you true! [...] Yet--he-he-he! and ho-ho-ho-!-- [...] We'll never return to you.|$|E
60|$|Hard though <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> was, both us lads {{fell asleep}} shortly {{after we were}} in a {{position}} to invite slumber, and, without heed to the many dangers which surrounded us, slept soundly and peacefully until being awakened by Uncle 'Rasmus who, unable to ascend by the rude ladder, was calling us by name softly from below.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's {{where we}} would have stopped {{if we had not}} been obliged to give up all our money," [...] said Bob, as they drove past the hotel. [...] "But now that we are nothing more nor less than three-dollar paupers, we shall be obliged to do as the thieves are {{probably}} doing--make up <b>our</b> <b>bed</b> under the greenwood, or some other kind of a tree." ...|$|E
60|$|We hid our {{new weapons}} beneath the skins which formed <b>our</b> <b>beds,</b> and then Perry {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} making bows and arrows--weapons apparently unknown within Pellucidar. Next came shields; but these I found it easier to steal from the walls of the outer guardroom of the building.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{wonderful}} house for echoes, and at night we would steal from <b>our</b> <b>beds</b> and creep {{to the top of}} the grand staircase, and listen, with hushed breath, to the almost preternaturally loud tick of the old clock in the hall, which seemed to us to get louder and louder, till at last the terrors of the place would be almost too much for us, and, at the sound of some mouse running behind the wainscoting, we would scamper off to <b>our</b> <b>beds,</b> and bury <b>our</b> heads beneath the clothes, falling into a troubled sleep, from which we woke, with terrified starts, until the welcome approach of day, when, as the sun shone brightly in, we would pluck up courage and laugh at our night's fright.|$|R
6000|$|MAGGIE [not so {{much out}} of the {{goodness}} of her heart as to patronise the Shands]. It seems to me it's a case for us all to go to <b>our</b> <b>beds</b> and leave the young man to study; but not on that chair. [And she wheels the chair away from him.] ...|$|R
