500|$|... "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the classic episodes of South Park. Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News described Mr. Hankey himself as [...] "the most outrageous character yet on TV's most outrageous show". Charlie Patton of The Florida Times-Union said the episode was [...] "crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensive—also extremely funny". He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, [...] "If you're {{the sort of person who}} didn't care for that scene in Trainspotting where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said, [...] "Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> have some serious psychological problems?" [...] Diane Werts of Newsday said of the episode, [...] "It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year." [...] Werts particularly praised the song [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, author of Taking South Park Seriously, said, [...] "This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, both for Christmas specials and television in general, farther than any previous one." [...] Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode's fake live-action commercial.|$|E

He's hurt and truly torn – does he stay and bat {{to help his}} team win and lose Emma, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> leave {{and try to get}} her back? In the end, sportsmanship prevails: Donald cannot let his team down. But he has been hit a few times during the song, and is {{suddenly}} levelled. As he lies dazed on the ground, lines from various people and various moments of the game bombard him – Winston, Emma, Vincent, his team. ("All I Ask of Life") ...|$|E
2500|$|The play makes several {{references}} to both Catholicism and Protestantism, {{the two most}} powerful theological forces {{of the time in}} Europe. The Ghost describes himself as being in purgatory, and as having died without receiving his last rites. This, along with Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is uniquely Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have pointed that revenge tragedies were traditionally Catholic, possibly because of their sources: Spain and Italy, both Catholic nations. Scholars have pointed out that knowledge of the play's Catholicism can reveal important paradoxes in Hamlet's decision process. According to Catholic doctrine, the strongest duty is to God and family. Hamlet's father being killed and calling for revenge thus offers a contradiction: does he avenge his father and kill Claudius, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires? ...|$|E

2500|$|In the West, some {{elements}} of determinism {{seem to have been}} expressed by the Presocratics Heraclitus and Leucippus. The first full-fledged notion of determinism appears to originate with the Stoics, as part of their theory of universal causal determinism. The resulting philosophical debates, which involved the confluence of elements of Aristotelian Ethics with Stoic psychology, led in the 1st-3rd centuries CE in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias to the first recorded Western debate over determinism and freedom, an issue that is known in theology as the paradox of free will. The writings of Epictetus as well as Middle Platonist and early Christian thought were instrumental in this development. The Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides said of the deterministic implications of an omniscient god: [...] "Does God know <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>He</b> not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that [...] man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…" ...|$|E
