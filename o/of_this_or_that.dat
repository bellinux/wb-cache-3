In exploring possible substrata for settlement, the cyprid leaves behind ‘footprints’ of a proteinaceous secretion that reportedly functions as a temporary adhesive, and also acts as a secondary cue in larval–larval interactions at settlement. Here, we show that two polyclonal antibodies raised against peptides localized at the N- and C-terminal regions of the adult settlement cue—the settlement-inducing protein complex (SIPC) —could both detect ‘temporary adhesive’ indicating that the SIPC is either a component <b>of</b> <b>this</b> secretion <b>or</b> <b>that</b> they are the same protein...|$|R

It is a comprehensive paradigmatic way of taking social structure seriously by studying directly how patterns of ties allocate resources in a social system ” (Wellman 1988, p. 20).

40|$|ABSTRACT. Different {{aspects of}} {{synthesis}} and excretion of biogenic isoprene {{into the environment}} have been already studied well. Excretion of isoprene out of cell in essence is excretion of surplus energy which constantly arises {{in the process of}} metabolism, and it should be considered {{as a result of its}} excretory activity. Excretory activity of a cell is one of the most important functions of a living system. It completes the stable flow of a stationary condition of metabolism. A question arises as to the degree of the fundamental nature of constant loss of some part of free energy in the processes taking place in the cell. In the given paper, these questions are considered from the standpoint of modern thermodynamics. The conclusion is made that the basis of excretory capacity of living cell is thermodynamic dissipation of entropy, excreting during irreversible processes, providing for the stability and ontogenetic steadiness of the living organism. © 2009 Bull.
