50|$|There {{were several}} {{incremental}} concept learning systems {{that did not}} build decision trees, but which predated and influenced {{the development of the}} earliest incremental decision tree learners, notably ID4. Notable among these was Schlimmer and Granger's STAGGER (1986), which learned disjunctive concepts incrementally. STAGGER was developed to examine concepts that changed over time (concept drift). Prior to STAGGER, Michalski and Larson (1978) investigated an incremental variant of AQ (Michalski, 1973), a supervised system for learning concepts in disjunctive normal form (DNF). Experience with these earlier systems and others, to include incremental tree-structured unsupervised learning, contributed to a conceptual framework for evaluating incremental decision tree learners specifically, and incremental concept learning generally, along four dimensions that reflect the inherent tradeoffs between learning cost and quality: (1) cost <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> update, (2) the number of observations that are required to converge on a knowledge base with given characteristics, (3) the total effort (as a function of the first two dimensions) that a system exerts, and the (4) quality (often consistency) of the final knowledge base. Some of the historical context in which incremental decision tree learners emerged is given in Fisher and Schlimmer (1988), and which also expands on the four factor framework that was used to evaluate and design incremental learning systems.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that conceptual modelling is an important activity in the development <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> systems. The availability of an adequate conceptual model is of vital interest notonly for the design and implementation <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> systems, but also for their validation, modification, maintenance and enhancement. In {{order to be able}} to develop adequate conceptualmodels a theory about the nature <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> is required and, in line with this theory, a methodology to reconstruct the meaning of concepts. Additionally, techniques have to be selected which enable the modelling, representation, validation and simulation of reconstructed concepts. In the development <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> systems often techniques are used which are not very wellsuited to the reconstruction and representation of the concepts of an application area. The selection of a technique is not motivated by an explicitly formulated theory, but by the representation formalisms applied within the software used for the implementation <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> systems. This often leads to inadequate conceptual models and consequently poorly functional and hardly maintainable systems, mainly because the representation of concepts is adapted to the limitations of the applied representation formalism.

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} how {{technological}} regime affects {{the performance of}} technology development projects (i. e., project quality, sales, and profit). Technological regime {{is defined as the}} set of attributes of a technological environment where the innovative activities of firms take place. Technological opportunity, appropriability of innovations, cumulativeness of knowledge and capabilities, and closeness <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> to basic sciences (versus applied sciences) are attributes of technological regime. Using data from 381 firms across five industries, we show that high levels of technological opportunity, appropriability, and closeness <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> to basic sciences are associated with higher project performance. Cumulativeness is associated with higher project quality, but not higher sales and profit. We also show that the effect of technological opportunity on project performance is moderated by two other determinants of technological regime: cumulativeness and nature <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base.</b> We find that cumulativeness has a negative moderating effect on the positive relationship between technological opportunity and project performance, while closeness <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>base</b> to basic sciences positively moderates the effect of technological opportunity on project performance.
