5|$|Assembly â€“ Following the structure-mediated {{self-assembly}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> particles, some {{modification of}} the proteins often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs after the virus has been released from the host cell.|$|E
5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E
