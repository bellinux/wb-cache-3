5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine,</b> such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E

25|$|Biogenic amines {{have been}} implicated as a {{potential}} cause <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> headaches. In wine, histamine, cadaverine, phenylethylamine, putrescine, and tyramine have all been detected. These amines are created by the degradation of amino acids found in grape must and {{left over from the}} breakdown of dead yeast cells after fermentation. Most LAB have the potential to create biogenic amines, even some strains of O. oeni, but high levels of biogenic amines are most often associated with species from the Lactobacillus and Pediococcus genera. In the European Union, the concentration of biogenic amines in wine is beginning to be monitored, while the United States currently does not have any regulations.|$|E
25|$|Hastings grew rapidly {{throughout}} the 1960s and 1970s (Hastings {{at this time}} was the fastest growing city in New Zealand), {{and there was a}} major issue dealing with encroachment of suburban expansion on highly productive land. Flaxmere was established as a satellite suburb to absorb rapid growth and was built upon the stony arid soils of the abandoned course of the Ngaruroro River. Although the land seemed worthless back then, it has subsequently proved highly valued for grape growing, and now is a prized region <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> varietals in the world-famous Gimblett Gravels wine-growing region. Starting with economic decline nationally in the late 1970s, coupled with agricultural subsidy reforms in the early 1980s, Hastings went into recession with more unemployment and low economic growth. It was not until the mid 1990s that the economy of Hastings began to turn around.|$|E
25|$|Post-operative gastric bypass {{patients}} {{develop a}} lowered tolerance {{for alcoholic beverages}} because their altered digestive tract absorbs alcohol {{at a faster rate}} than people who have not undergone the surgery. It also takes a post-operative patient longer to reach sober levels after consuming alcohol. In a study conducted on 36 post-operative patients and a control group of 36 subjects (who had not undergone surgery), each subject drank a 5 oz. glass <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> and had the alcohol in their breath measured to evaluate alcohol metabolism. The gastric bypass group had an average peak alcohol breath level at 0.08%, whereas the control group had an average peak alcohol breath level of 0.05%. It took on average 108 minutes for the gastric bypass patients group to return to an alcohol breath of zero, while it took the control group an average of 72 minutes.|$|E
40|$|Highly {{reactive}} radicals, ROO•, {{were generated}} from 2, 2 ‘-azobis[2 -(2 -imidazolin- 2 -yl) propane] and linoleic acid. The ROO• scavenging capacity <b>of</b> some Italian <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> was evaluated following {{the changes in}} oxygen consumption. Under the experimental conditions {{the time course of}} oxygen consumption shows two typical behaviors:[*] trolox-like (class I) and gallic acid-like (class II). Usually the time course of wine was similar to that of gallic acid. The rate of oxygen consumption was found to decrease exponentially with the amount of wine or gallic acid added to the test solution. On this basis the capacity <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> to scavenge peroxy radicals was expressed as content of gallic acid (SGA). The SGA values were found to be correlated to the amount of total proanthocyanidins and total polyphenols <b>of</b> some Italian <b>red</b> <b>wines</b> (p < 0. 01). The proanthocyanidins extracted from seeds were shown to make a major contribution to the peroxy radical scavenging capacity <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wines,</b> whereas, interestingly, the chemical class of the low molecular weight tannins reactive to vanillin did not correlate with the SGA values...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{receiving}} a red {{card in the}} previous game, Ljungberg was ineligible to play the next Seattle Sounders game. As a result, All-Star coach Dominic Kinnear played Ljungberg for a full 90 minutes. At {{the end of the}} game, Ljungberg started to have impaired vision. When the game went to penalty kicks, he chose to sit it out due to his loss of vision after an on-set migraine. Unfortunately for Ljungberg, the initial five kicks ended in a draw. Kinnear, not fully understanding Ljungberg's condition, sent him out as the sixth kicker. Ljungberg, unable to see, took a chance and just tapped the ball in the center of net. However, Tim Howard caught it, resulting in Everton's win. Immediately following the game, Ljungberg was removed from the field on a stretcher. Later, Ljungberg told reporters that he ingested trace amount <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> while in Utah, resulting in his second migraine within months.|$|E
25|$|Anthocyanins are {{phenolic}} compounds {{found throughout the}} plant kingdom, being frequently responsible for the blue to red colors found in flowers, fruits and leaves. In wine grapes, they develop during the stage of veraison when the skin <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> grapes changes color from green to red to black. As the sugars in the grape increase during ripening so does the concentration of anthocyanins. In most grapes anthocyanins are found only in the outer cell layers of the skin, leaving the grape juice inside virtually colorless. Therefore, to get color pigmentation in the wine, the fermenting must {{needs to be in}} contact with the grape skins in order for the anthocyanins to be extracted. Hence, white wine can be made from red wine grapes {{in the same way that}} many white sparkling wines are made from the red wine grapes of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. The exception to this is the small class of grapes known as teinturiers, such as Alicante Bouschet, which have a small amount of anthocyanins in the pulp that produces pigmented juice.|$|E
25|$|Brut Rose Champagnes {{came along}} in the 1990s, a version as dry as regular Brut Champagne. They are {{produced}} either by leaving the clear juice of black grapes to macerate on its skins {{for a brief time}} (known as the saignée method) or, more commonly, by adding a small amount of still Pinot Noir red wine to the sparkling wine cuvée. Champagne is typically light in colour even if it is produced with red grapes, because the juice is extracted from the grapes using a gentle process that minimizes the amount of time the juice spends in contact with the skins, which is what gives red wine its colour. Rosé Champagne {{is one of the few}} wines that allow the production of Rosé by the addition of a small amount <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> during blending. This ensures a predictable and reproducible colour, allowing a constant Rosé colour from year-to-year. Popular in many countries and especially well-welcomed in Estonia where it was first introduced by an Estonian entrepreneur Henry-Jörgen Rautits, pink Champagne is very popular amongst high-end restaurants due to its soft yet sensitive taste, which is highly appreciated by wealthier customers.|$|E

25|$|A much milder acid than tartaric and malic, {{lactic acid}} is often {{associated}} with “milky” flavors in wine and is the primary acid of yogurt and sauerkraut. It is produced during winemaking by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which includes three genera: Oenococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus. These bacteria convert both sugar and malic acid into lactic acid, the latter through MLF. This process can be beneficial for some wines, adding complexity and softening the harshness of malic acidity, but it can generate off flavors and turbidity in others. Some strains of LAB can produce biogenic amines, such as histamine, tyramine and putrescine, which may be a cause <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> headaches in some wine drinkers. Winemakers wishing to control or prevent MLF can use sulfur dioxide to stun the bacteria. Racking the wine quickly off its lees will also help control the bacteria, since lees are a vital food source for them. The winemakers must also be very careful of what wine barrels and winemaking equipment to which the wine is exposed, because of the bacteria's ability to deeply embed themselves within wood fibers. A wine barrel that has completed one successful malolactic fermentation will almost always induce MLF in every wine stored in it from then on.|$|E
25|$|In February 1900, Grand Duke Andrei {{was invited}} by his brothers, Grand Dukes Kirill and Boris, {{to a dinner}} party {{at the house of}} Mathilde Kschessinska. Kschessinska, the Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the Mariinsky Theatre, was the eldest among the three most {{prominent}} dancers of her generation at the Imperial Russian Ballet, along with Anna Pavlova and Tamara Karsavina. Grand Duke Andrei sat next to his hostess during the dinner, but accidentally spilt a glass <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>wine</b> on her. Mathilde, attracted to the young grand duke, seven years her junior, took the incident as good omen. Age 28, Mathilde had been the mistress of Tsar Nicholas II when he was heir to the throne. Their two-year relationship ended with Nicholas' engagement to his future wife, Alexandra. Mathilde was ambitious and eager to maintain her close relationship with the Romanovs. She subsequently began a long time affair with Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich of Russia, Nicholas and Andrei's first cousin once removed. As she was not in love with Sergei, but enjoyed his company and protection, Mathilde pursued a relationship with Grand Duke Andrei, the third Romanov to become involved with her. By July 1900, they became lovers, traveling together that summer to Biarritz and Paris. In the autumn 1901, they visited several Italian cities, including Venice, Padua, Florence and Rome. Grand Duke Sergei tolerated their affair, remaining a close and loyal friend to the famous ballerina, but {{the relationship between the two}} grand dukes grew tense. They tried to avoid each other and maintain civility while sharing the same woman for almost two decades.|$|E
