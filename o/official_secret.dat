Furthermore, ASIO has undergone a period of rapid growth with some 70% of its officers having joined since 2002, leading to what Paul O'Sullivan, Director-General of Security from 2005 to 2009, called 'an experience gap'.|$|E

The courts have taken a broad approach to this exception, and have shown a considerable amount of deference to the Government. For instance, in Public Prosecutor v. Phua Keng Tong (1986), a case involving the Official Secrets Act, the High Court held that security in Article 14(2) does not merely mean protection from danger but includes the [...] "protection of information which the Government considers vital or essential for its administration". However, not everything that the Government regards as an <b>official</b> <b>secret</b> will be necessarily be deemed to be so by the court, especially if the information is [...] "innocuous in nature". The burden of proving that official information is secret lies on the Prosecution.|$|E

He told the media: [...] "I wanted to, and I still intend to, tell the commission about the laxity and non-chalant attitude of secret service agents handling the President." [...] Bolden charged that agents drank heavily before and after tours of guarding Kennedy in Washington and at his summer home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, that they missed their work shifts or reported to their shifts [...] "half drunk", and that they used <b>official</b> <b>Secret</b> Service cars to transport women companions or to visit bars.
