5|$|In November 2008, SMRT Corporation and Land Transport Authority (LTA) {{announced}} that the last ten refurbished trainsets would have one-third <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> replaced with metal rails to create extra standing space. The move was justified on grounds of allowing more standing space onboard during peak-hour services. The reduction of seats per row from nine to seven after refurbishment was already unpopular among commuters; the decision to further reduce seating capacity drew sharp criticism against the operator and LTA. As of December 2015, all 66 C151s from one-third <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> {{have been replaced by}} metal bars to create extra standing space.|$|E
5|$|The Haunting was {{released}} on 18 September 1963. Audiences were frightened by it. Film critic Dora Jane Hamblin related how four of her female friends, expecting a ho-hum film, took out make-up during the film's first few minutes {{with the intention of}} fixing their faces. The film proved so frightening, she said, that the women were jumping out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> and losing their items. In Houston, Texas, a local cinema promoted the film as so chilling that it held a contest to see which of four patrons could sit all the way through a midnight screening; the prize was $100. Despite these stunts, The Haunting was only an average success at the box office.|$|E
5|$|The Székelys were a {{community}} of privileged border guards. They fought in the royal army, {{for which they were}} exempted from taxation. A royal official, the count of the Székelys, was their supreme leader, but the Székely seats were administered by elected officials. The Saxons also had the right to elect the magistrates <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats.</b> They enjoyed personal freedom and paid a lump sum tax to the monarchs. The wealthiest Saxon towns – Bistritz, Hermannstadt and Kronstadt (Bistrița, Sibiu and Brașov) – owned large estates which were cultivated by hundreds of peasants. Dozens of Saxons and Székely families held landed property in the counties, for which they also enjoyed the status of noblemen. Saxon and Székely leaders were occasionally invited to Torda to attend the general assemblies, which enabled the leaders of the three nations to coordinate their actions.|$|E

25|$|The Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party, {{which won}} {{seats in the}} 2003 election, lost all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats.</b> Former MSP Tommy Sheridan's new party, Solidarity, also failed to win any seats. Campbell Martin and Dr Jean Turner both lost their seats, and Dennis Canavan and Brian Monteith retired.|$|E
25|$|After early {{speculation}} that the Greens might retain only two seats, they retained all four <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats.</b> The Greens came close to losing Kim Booth's seat in Bass, {{largely as a result}} of the strong victory of Labor's Michelle O'Byrne. Booth won the seat by the slim margin of 136 votes. Had the Tasmanian Greens lost one of their four seats, they would have lost their status as a major party and would lose financial resources, offices and support staff. The Greens failed to win a hoped-for second seat in Denison or to win a seat in Braddon. The Greens primary vote fell by 1.5% to 16.6%.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, Delta Air Lines (who {{merged with}} Northwest in 2009) told the United States Department of Transportation that a weak economy and lower seat demand {{would force the}} company to reduce flights to several smaller {{communities}} including Sioux City unless it received assistance from the federal government. Delta said planes left Sioux Gateway {{with an average of}} only 51.4% <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> full, so given that the company planned to remove turboprop planes and some of its 50-seat jets from service by the end of 2011 it wasn't economically viable for Delta to continue service. Of the average 75 passengers who flew the route each day, only nine flew directly to the Twin Cities or to Sioux City, according to the Metropolitan Airports Commission. The majority of passengers were connecting through MSP to destinations such as Chicago, Phoenix or Orlando. Delta made its final flights into Sioux Gateway in April 2012.|$|E

25|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} the Netherlands on 22 November 2006 following {{the fall of the}} Second Balkenende cabinet. The elections proved relatively successful for the governing Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) which remained the largest party with 41 seats, a loss of only three seats. The largest increase in seats was for the Socialist Party (SP), which went from nine to 25 seats. The main opposition party, the social-democratic Labour Party (PvdA) lost nine of its 42 seats, while the right-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the progressive liberal Democrats 66 lost a considerable portion <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats,</b> six of 28 and three of six, respectively. New parties, such as the right-wing Party for Freedom (PVV) of former VVD MP Geert Wilders and the animal rights party Party for the Animals (PvdD) were also successful, with the PVV winning nine seats and the PvdD winning two, thereby becoming the first animal rights group to enter a European parliament.|$|E
500|$|On {{the second}} {{national}} legislative front, reformers worked toward a constitutional amendment, which was strongly supported in the House of Representatives but initially {{opposed by the}} Senate. Bybee notes that the state legislatures, which would lose power if the reforms went through, were supportive of the campaign. By 1910, 31 state legislatures had passed resolutions calling {{for a constitutional amendment}} allowing direct election, and in the same year ten Republican senators who were opposed to reform were forced out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats,</b> acting as a [...] "wake-up call to the Senate".|$|E

Trevor Linden, who had played with Bure for seven seasons, said {{following}} Bure's retirement, [...] "I don't know if I've ever seen or played with a player that's brought people out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> like that." [...] During the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, Rangers coach Mike Keenan, who later coached Bure for one-and-a-half seasons in Vancouver, called him [...] "perhaps the most electrifying forward in the league". The Canucks renamed the award the Pavel Bure Most Exciting Player Award in his honour in 2013.|$|E

500|$|Under the Canada Elections Act, {{a general}} {{election}} had to take place no later than October 19, 2015. On August 2, at Harper's request, Governor General David Johnson dropped the writs of election for October 19. [...] In that election, Harper's Conservative Party was defeated by Justin Trudeau's Liberals, and became the Official Opposition, dropping to only 99 seats out of 308. This was mainly because of a collapse of Conservative support in southern Ontario, a region that swung heavily to them in 2011. [...] They lost all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> in Toronto, and won only three seats in the Greater Toronto Area. [...] They were also shut out of Atlantic Canada—the {{first time in decades}} {{that there will be no}} centre-right MPs from that region. [...] Harper was reelected in Calgary Heritage, essentially a reconfigured version of his former riding.|$|E
500|$|Author Brandon Friedman, also {{a combat}} veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, shared a similar view at VetVoice: [...] "The Hurt Locker is a high-tension, well-made, action movie that will {{certainly}} keep most viewers {{on the edges}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats.</b> But if {{you know anything about}} the Army, or about operations or life in Iraq, you'll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you. It certainly did for me." [...] Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film's representation of combat, saying [...] "in real life, EOD techs don't conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three-man teams without communications gear ... Another thing you'll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E-7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying: 'C'mon, let's split up.

Simonon explained in a 2011 interview with Fender that he smashed the bass out of frustration when he learned the bouncers at the concert would not let the audience members stand up out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>seats.</b> [...] Pennie Smith, who photographed the band for the album, originally {{did not want the}} photograph to be used.

The train turns right into a 270-degree turn, reaching about 5G's (nearly 6G's before modifications) before ascending the [...] airtime hill. The train then descends into a high-speed bunny hop before entering another high-speed turn. The train then maneuvers 3 sharp twists before entering the final high-speed turn.

We hope viewers understand that our aim is to deliver the best drama. That doesn't always lead to a happy ending.
