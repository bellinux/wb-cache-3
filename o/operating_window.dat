25|$|Massa at {{this point}} was twelve seconds in arrears and Hamilton was granted {{permission}} by Bonnington to attack earlier than planned. Rosberg's front brake temperatures went beyond their optimum <b>operating</b> <b>window</b> and {{in his attempt to}} conserve his rear tyre life by moving his brake bias towards the front of his car, he compromised his brakes as a result. Hamilton used DRS and as Rosberg applied his brakes, he drove straight into the Rettifilo chicane's run-off area, slalomed his way through the obstacles, enabling Hamilton to gain the lead. Alonso's energy recovery system failed which triggered a complete electrical shutdown half a minute later and pulled {{over to the side of}} the track, and into Rettifilo's run-off area to retire for the first time in the season. Button feigned an overtaking attempt at Pérez driving into the Rettifilo chicane but was unable to get ahead and both drivers narrowly avoided contact. Bottas made an passing attempt on Magnussen entering the same turn but Magnussen drove defensively, forcing Bottas to cut the chicane on lap 32. On the 33rd lap, Ricciardo overtook Räikkönen for ninth by going around the inside of the latter entering the Rettifilo chicane and braked later than he did.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1970s, oil {{companies}} began {{drilling in the}} Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea. In order to overcome the relatively short <b>operating</b> <b>window</b> of drillships during the ice-free season (100 to 110 days a year) and the water depth limitations of artificial dredged islands, Gulf Canada Resources began developing an Arctic drilling system consisting of two mobile drilling units: a Mobile Arctic Caisson (MAC) that could be submerged and filled with gravel to form an artificial drilling island in waters up to [...] in depth and a floating Conical Drilling Unit (CDU) designed for drilling in water depths between [...] while afloat. These units, each capable of completing one exploration well per year, would be supported by four Arctic Class 4 vessels: two large icebreakers providing 24-hour ice management and standby services on the drilling site and two smaller icebreaking vessels responsible for anchor handling and supply runs between the drilling rigs and coastal bases. By 1982, both drilling units and all four icebreaking vessels were under construction in Canada and Japan for BeauDril, Gulf Canada's drilling subsidiary, and the company had committed itself to a billion-dollar exploration program between 1983 and 1988.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to document technical information that has been provided to Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) and Closure Business Unit (CBU) personnel {{as part of the}} frit development support for Sludge Batch 4 (SB 4). The information presented in this report includes projected <b>operating</b> <b>windows</b> (expressed in terms of waste loading) for various sludge blending and/or washing options coupled with candidate frits of interest. Although the Nominal Stage assessment serves as the primary tool for these evaluations, select systems were also evaluated using a Variation Stage assessment in which compositional variations were introduced. In addition, assessments of the impacts of nepheline formation potential and the SO{sub 4 }{sup -} solubility limit on the projected <b>operating</b> <b>windows</b> are also provided. Although this information was used as part of the technical basis leading to CBU's development of the preferred SB 4 preparation plan, none of the options presented in this report was selected as the preferred plan. Therefore, the information is presented without significant interpretation of the resulting <b>operating</b> <b>windows,</b> but the projected windows are provided so additional insight can be explored if desired. Detailed assessments of the projected <b>operating</b> <b>windows</b> (using both Nominal and Variation Stage assessments) of the preferred sludge preparation plan with candidate frits are to be documented elsewhere. The information provided in this report is focused solely on model-based projections of the <b>operating</b> <b>windows</b> for various SB 4 blending strategies of interest. Although nepheline formation potential is monitored via model predictions as a part of this assessment, experimental work investigating the impact of nepheline on glass quality is also being addressed in a parallel study. The results of this paper study and the experimental assessments of melt rate, SO{sub 4 } solubility, and/or nepheline formation potential are all critical components of the inputs into the frit selection process for SB 4...|$|R

50|$|Another {{experimental}} method {{that was used}} for robustification is the <b>Operating</b> <b>Window.</b> It {{was developed in the}} United States before the wave of quality methods from Japan came to the West, but still remains unknown to many. In this approach, the noise of the inputs is continually increased as the system is modified to reduce sensitivity to that noise. This increases robustness, but also provides a clearer measure of the variability that is flowing through the system. After optimisation, the random variability of the inputs is controlled and reduced, and the system exhibits improved quality.|$|E

50|$|The Hanna Turbine http://www.wetgen.com U.S. patent 8,358,026, {{was invented}} by {{environmental}} activist John Clark Hanna in 2009. The Hanna Turbine was developed to improve upon the pioneering Wells Turbine. As with the Wells, the Hanna device has no moving parts that come {{in direct contact with}} the ocean. The turbine has two rotors with back-to-back asymmetrical airfoils. Both rotors are mirror images with low angles of attack. The airfoils have higher lift coefficients and less drag than the Wells Turbine. This makes the Hanna design less prone to stalling and offers more torque with a larger <b>operating</b> <b>window.</b> The Hanna design also drives two generators that operate outside of the enclosed air duct in a relatively dry environment. This allows for easy maintenance of the generators.|$|E
50|$|Mercedes brought {{its first}} major {{aerodynamic}} upgrade at the , changing the {{car from the}} front to the rear. The most obvious change was {{the introduction of a}} new nose which included a never seen before under-nose turning vane to help create a type of skirt underneath the car. Furthermore Mercedes redesigned the area of the bargeboards which subsequently sported three R-shaped upstands. They also revised the winglet on the wishbone extension and introduced new camera mounts, a revised floor ahead of the rear tyre, a revised rear wing, and a new two-tier monkey seat. According to Michael Schmidt from German magazine auto motor und sport, the upgrade wasn't supposed to have major time gains (apparently only 0.1 s). Mercedes' main targets were to make the car more consistent and to bring its tyres more easily into the <b>operating</b> <b>window,</b> as previously these had been their main deficits in comparison to Ferrari.|$|E

40|$|The {{lifecycle}} of {{a system}} {{is dependent on the}} system design. However, the concern with quality has been stressed mostly during its production and use. The understanding of the system variability generated by noise variables shifted the quality focus to the design phase. The development of robustness early on the system lifecycle increases the system reliability through its entire life cycle. Although the robust design approach developed by the Taguchi methods application had a great contribution to this philosophy, there is much criticism of this methodology. One alternative to the Taguchi method is the <b>Operating</b> <b>Window</b> methodology. Its application has successfully been demonstrated as a substitute for the Taguchi methods, especially when the response is not quantitative. However, most of the examples were used repeatedly and the steps on the application of the methodology have not been well detailed. Therefore, this project had the objective of developing a unique application of the methodology with a simple approach. Moreover, with the implementation of the methodology, the project aims to identify the difference between a design with a wide output data distribution and a design with a narrow distribution. The methodology followed the <b>Operating</b> <b>Window</b> methodology steps, applying it to a circuit board printing process. The results have shown {{that it is possible to}} have a relationship between the <b>Operating</b> <b>Window</b> range and the distribution variation from the system output...|$|E

40|$|The {{self-sustained}} {{catalytic combustion}} of propane is experimentally studied in a two-pass, quartz heat-recirculation reactor (HRR) and {{compared to that}} in a no (heat) recirculation reactor (NRR). Structured monolithic reactors with Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3, LaMnO 3 /γ-Al 2 O 3, and Pt doped perovskite catalysts have been compared in the HRR and NRR configurations. Heat recirculation enhances combustion stability, by widening the <b>operating</b> <b>window</b> of self-sustained operation, and changes the mode of stability loss from blowout to extinction. It is found that thermal shields (upstream and downstream of the monolith) play no role in the stability of a HRR but increase the stability of a NRR. The stability of a HRR follows this trend: Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 > doped perovskite > LaMnO 3 /γ-Al 2 O 3.

40|$|Secondary {{nucleation}} is suppressed in an air-lift crystallizer {{at levels}} of supersaturation where in a stirred crystallizer a clear contribution of secondary nucleation is visible. A comparison of batch crystallization of ascorbic acid in an air-lift crystallizer {{and in a}} stirred crystallizer is presented. The results demonstrate that at low supersaturation, secondary nucleation can be suppressed in both the air-lift crystallizer and the stirred crystallizer. At higher supersaturation, nucleation starts to dominate in the air-lift crystallizer. At an intermediate level of supersaturation, a clear contribution of secondary nucleation in the final product obtained from the stirred crystallizer is visible. However, experiments with similar conditions in the air-lift crystallizer show a significantly smaller contribution of secondary nucleation. The observed enlargement of the <b>operating</b> <b>window</b> in terms of supersaturation where secondary nucleation is suppressed in an air-lift crystallizer may have important practical consequences.
