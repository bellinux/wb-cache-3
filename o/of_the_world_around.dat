5|$|Renaissance humanism {{recognised}} no {{mutually exclusive}} polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies {{in science and}} engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work. These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Ucu {{was born}} in Sukabumi, West Java, on 19 August 1976 to a strict Muslim family. As a child, she studied in the Darunnajah Islamic {{boarding}} school in Jakarta for six years; removed from the outside world, she felt shocked when she learned {{that many of the}} women in her hometown worked as prostitutes. This discovery led her to become more critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> her and made her interested in journalism. Ucu later attended the Jakarta Islamic State University.|$|E
5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} before the Joker died, his infected blood was used in blood transfusions, infecting five people including Batman; Batman, concealing his infection from others, imprisoned the four other recipients who were physically and mentally transforming into the Joker. The Joker, now existing as a mental projection produced by the infected blood and fear toxin, frequently appears to taunt Batman, and manipulate his perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> him. After Batman escapes the exploding Ace Chemicals, he alerts Gordon to Oracle's kidnapping, who angrily leaves to find Scarecrow.|$|E

5|$|Bashō was {{introduced}} to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the intellectual scene of Edo (modern Tokyo) he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made {{a living as a}} teacher; but then renounced the social, urban life of the literary circles and was inclined to wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements.|$|E

25|$|A few sociologists {{studying}} TCKs, however, {{argue that}} the commonality found in international TCKs is {{not the result of}} true commonality, but rather the researcher's bias projecting expectations upon the studied subculture.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the binding problem and multisensory perception {{can be thought of}} as a question – the binding problem, and potential solution – multisensory perception. The binding problem stemmed from unanswered questions about how mammals (particularly higher primates) generate a unified, coherent perception of their surroundings from the cacophony of electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations that forms the physical basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> us. It was investigated initially in the visual domain (colour, motion, depth, and form), then in the auditory domain, and recently in the multisensory areas. It can be said therefore, that the binding problem is central to multisensory perception.|$|E

He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.|$|E
25|$|Lysaker & Lysaker {{explained}} that Bakhtin theorized {{of human beings}} as entities composed of a multiplicity of voices (self-as-father, self-as-son, self-as-student, self-as-teacher, self-as-sad, self-as-happy, self-as-pro-life) that are in constant flux within him as he dialogues with and relates to the world around him. These voices constantly arrange and re-arrange themselves in hierarchies that are not governed by an overarching ego. Each hierarchy of voices (roles and dispositions) constitutes a dialogical position. Lysaker & Lysaker use the term dialogical positions because they are exactly the positions (roles and dispositions) Dasein takes {{up in the world}} when interacting with and relating to others—-and are constituted by his polyphonic nature. The flux, or re-arrangement, occurs from situational contexts that tells Dasein which dialogical position, or set of voices, must come to the foreground. The flux is also based on increased understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> human beings and their respective roles in it. Hermeneuts {{say that this is a}} stark contrast to mainstream paradigms in psychotherapy. Instead of a single ego, or voice, that makes up a person's identity and stands above and against the world, a constantly-rearranging hierarchy of multiple voices dialogues with others and co-constitutes a person's identity, and that this is the reason that Taylor writes that we should abandon paradigms such as the self as a highly autonomous individual and re-conceptualize that self as a dialogical self that is always-already a relational being constantly engaged in multiple ongoing conversations.|$|E

40|$|Since its {{invention}} in 1826, photography {{has provided}} us with widely different views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>around</b> (and within) us. Scientific and medical photographs give us a window onto a previously invisible world; news and documentary photographs describe <b>the</b> <b>world</b> as others experience it; advertising photographs tempt us with <b>the</b> sugar-plumb <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sponsor's Product; family snapshots record <b>the</b> <b>world</b> as we will subsequently remember it and, in art galleries, photographs of ‘moments-of-the-world-as-art’ confront us with scenes and events made special by the photographer's attention. The camera describes <b>the</b> 3 -dimensional <b>world</b> we know through binocular vision as a flat surface because, with its monocular ‘eye’, this Cyclops sees it as one. As a result, these photographs are both the record [...] and <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> [...] <b>the</b> camera’s unique ‘way <b>of</b> seeing’ <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> us. Put another way, these photographs are <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> an active (or ‘act of’) collaboration with <b>the</b> medium <b>of</b> photography in <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> scenes, events and ‘moments’ {{that did not exist}} until they were brought into being by <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> photographing them. <b>The</b> photographs in this series are therefore made (rather than 'taken') photographs...|$|R

500|$|Early {{ideas that}} later became {{incorporated}} into the modern science of chemistry come from two main sources.

500|$|The {{other side}} of creativity/freedom as the {{absolute}} principle is that every entity is constrained by the social structure of existence (i.e., its relations) – each actual entity must conform to the settled conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> it. [...] Freedom always exists within limits. [...] But an entity's uniqueness and individuality arise from its own self-determination as to just how it will {{take account of the}} world within the limits that have been set for it.|$|E

500|$|Craig Delancey, an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the State University of New York, {{cited the}} {{conclusion}} of [...] "Acrobat" [...] {{as an example of}} how rock music can be [...] "profoundly successful at evoking the mixture of anger and contempt that can keep you going in the face of seemingly overwhelming opposition." [...] He noted that [...] "the powerful closing sentiments of Achtung Babys 'Acrobat' can help us feel motivated and empowered in the face of powers that want us to feel powerless." [...] Timothy Cleveland, the Head of the Philosophy Department at New Mexico State University, wrote that the opening lyric was an introspection of the self. He noted [...] "here feeling is contrasted with perceptual states that make one aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> them. The 'enemy' that one can feel is oneself. 'To feel' in this case refers to a kind of awareness one has of oneself independent of the sensations of the outside world... Like perceptual feeling it is a kind of direct awareness and so a kind of knowledge by acquaintance." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine, Late Registration {{serves as}} an {{exhibition}} of [...] "the stealthy power of West's storytelling." [...] West stated that his goal for the album was to touch on topics that {{people from all walks}} of life could find relatable, while remaining true to himself: [...] " [...] raps that were just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith." [...] The opening track [...] "Heard 'Em Say" [...] is a [...] "mournfully contemplative" [...] song that [...] "talks about being honest with yourself in a world that is not." [...] The song is written from the perspective of an afflicted, impoverished American quietly lamenting the fallacies of society and questioning the ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> him. West delivers a tongue-in-cheek lyrical narrative within [...] "Gold Digger" [...] in which he critically depicts the disastrous life of a man married to a woman who manipulates him for financial gain. However, another story arises within the third verse, which illustrates a once destitute black male who earns a fortune and decides to leave a loyal, unselfish girlfriend for a white woman.|$|E
