The Double Chooz far detector will be situated in the same cavern as CHOOZ but will detect ~ 50000 electron antineutrinos in three years of operation.

40|$|In-situ {{monitoring}} of the environmental impact {{is essential for the}} verification of clean operation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. We conducted an empirical study based on remotely sensed data and field observations from an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) site in China. Geostatistical analysis and general linear model regression were performed to detect the impact of fugitive CO 2 emission from <b>oil</b> <b>buffer</b> tanks. Results show that the emitted CO 2 resulted in CO 2 enrichment about 25 - 100 m away from the buffer tanks. The spatial pattern and semivariogram parameters of normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) in the CCS core operating area had not been altered significantly. The CO 2 concentration is not a statistically significant explanatory factor for the variation of wheat growth in the present CCS-EOR site that located in Gaoqing County in the east of China. The impact of fugitive CO 2 emission on wheat growth appears limited because of the instability and rapid diffusion of emitted CO 2. However, we emphasize that these results were extracted from the in-situ monitoring that characterized by macro-level and short term. Long-term biology-based study at a micro-level is imperative for further understanding and determining the environmental impact of fugitive CO 2 emission. Moreover, considering the incidental CO 2 breakthrough and the unknown impact of emitted gas, including CO 2 and hydrocarbons, on the quality of wheat plant and grain, long-time field monitoring, and improvement of production equipment and technique are essential to ensure the clean production of CCS-EOR...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Prototype {{fast breeder}} reactorâ€™s (PFBR) {{secondary}} pumps have sealing between {{the rotating shaft}} and the stationary parts to prevent cover gas leakage into ambient air. This is achieved by means of triple mechanical seals with <b>oil</b> as <b>buffer</b> fluid. The <b>oil</b> for cooling the mechanical seals and bearing is supplied from an external source and is re-circulated after cooling and cleaning. During testing of secondary pumps several issues related to mechanical seal arrangement, material, oil temperature and oil leakage into process side were confronted.

40|$|Case StudyA dry screw {{compressor}} skid was fabricated for offshore service that included <b>oil</b> <b>buffered</b> mechanical seals on the compressor. During shop testing, excessive seal oil piping vibration was observed {{that resulted in}} pipe component failures. The oil system was designed to include a common lube and seal oil system with a pump design pressure of 590 psi. There were six oil control valves on the system, including a lube oil pressure control valve, one flow control valve on the inlet end of the compressor, another flow control valve on the discharge end, two differential pressure controllers to maintain differential pressure on the seals for {{each end of the}} compressor, as well as a back pressure control valve for the oil system. Vibration and pressure pulsation measurements indicated that the response was at the pocket pass frequency of 206 Hz. The source was determined to be at the compressor. Arrangement of the control valves and control sensing lines were likely contributors to the severity of the response. Modification to the seal oil system included addition of several volumes at strategic locations to change the acoustical characteristics of the oil system to reduce the shaking forces in the pipe system. These changes along with pipe support modifications and changes to the control valve sensing lines were successful at reducing the pipe pulsations and vibration response to acceptable levels...|$|R

40|$|Monospecific {{antibodies}} to the calcium transport enzyme (alpha-Ca pump) inhibit mitosis when microinjected into sand dollar embryos. Immunoglobulins were raised against the calcium transport enzyme (Ca pump) of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) from rat skeletal muscle and guinea pig ileum smooth muscle. Specific antibodies were further isolated from IgG fractions by using electrophoretically purified SR Ca-pump protein as the immobilized ligand for immunoaffinity chromatography. ELISA demonstrated that common antigenic determinants {{are shared by}} SR, SR Ca pump (of rat skeletal and guinea pig ileum smooth muscle), and isolated membrane containing "native" mitotic apparatus (MA). Preimmune sera gave negative results in identical control assays. Triton X- 100 extraction of MA removes the Ca-pump antigen. SR Ca pump and the MA Ca pump have nearly identical molecular masses as determined by NaDodSO 4 /PAGE. These alpha-SR Ca-pump IgGs inhibit ATP-dependent Ca 2 + sequestration by purified SR and MA membranes. Indirect immunofluorescence of isolated native MA demonstrated coincident localization of the MA Ca pump, sequestered calcium, and membrane vesicles. Fluorescent foci were regionally concentrated within the volumes of the asters and spindle. Microinjection of the anti-Ca-pump IgGs into one of two sister blastomeres at second metaphase resulted in mitotic arrest of the injected cell accompanied by a rapid loss of spindle birefringence. Karyomeres formed and fused to form nuclei either {{at the site of}} the metaphase plate or at the position the chromosomes occupied during anaphase A. The cleavage furrow did not develop in the injected cell, while the sister and neighbor cells continued normal mitotic cycling. Injection later in mitosis yielded cells with two nuclei whose cleavage furrow relaxed completely. Routine control injections of boiled immune IgG, preimmune IgG, Wesson <b>oil,</b> <b>buffer,</b> or goat anti-rabbit IgG did not affect mitosis, birefringence of the MA, or cleavage furrow activity...|$|E

40|$|Two anaesthetics, {{clove oil}} and MS- 222, were {{examined}} for {{their effects on}} the olfactory nerve response of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) and rainbow trout (O. mykiss). Exposing fish to clove oil for 3 minutes at concentrations of 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L, or for 10 minutes at 50 mg/L, did not significantly reduce their olfactory response. Directly applying clove oil anaesthesia to the olfactory epithelium significantly reduced olfactory response, though olfactory response recovered to 70 % and 52 % of pre-treatment levels in masu salmon and rainbow trout, respectively, after 20 minutes. After a three minute exposure to unbuffered MS- 222 (100 mg/ml), olfactory responsiveness continued to decline over time but no such long-term effects were observed after exposure to clove <b>oil</b> or <b>buffered</b> MS- 222.

40|$|Essential {{fatty acids}} (EFAs) from non-edible oil {{resources}} {{have been in}} light for last two decades due to their propitious effects {{in the prevention of}} diseases and human nutrition. Omega- 6 fatty acids like linoleic acid, in the leaves, seeds and flowers of tobacco and in the seeds of pumpkin seed oil have been produced by chemical methods for their use in various purposes. Now-a-days enzymatic methods have been emphasised in industries and R & D sectors for oil hydrolysis to produce fatty acids to fulfil day-by-day increasing demands and to promote environment friendly methods. Lipases, an enzyme that are popularly being used for catalysing oil hydrolysis have replaced chemical methods. Enzymes like lipase from Candida rugosa, because of its structural individuality, inhabit non-specificity towards a wide range of fatty acids of different chain length are being utilized for this purpose. These useful fatty acids can fulfil the increasing demands as well as can be utilized in oleochemical industries and other industries like cosmetics, as food supplements in nutrition, in manufacture of paints and varnishes etc. In this work, focus has been made on existing method of hydrolysis of some nonedible oil resources like pumpkin and tobacco seed oil and possibility of enzymatic hydrolysis of the same to produce linoleic acid. Optimization of process variables for the production of fatty acids from lipase catalysed hydrolysis of pumpkin and tobacco seed oil has been explored in this study. In lipase catalysed hydrolysis of pumpkin seed <b>oil,</b> temperature, <b>buffer</b> and enzyme concentration {{has been found to be}} significant by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) while temperature causes considerable effect in linoleic acid production with speed of agitation having no significant effect.

NEs {{were prepared to}} deliver diallyl trisulfide (DT) for systemic therapy of bacterial and fungal infection, egg phospholipid {{was chosen as the}} main emulsifier, and two co-emulsifiers were also incorporated, including Poloxamer 188 (P 188) and Solutol HS 15 (S 15). Soybean oil was used as the dispersed phases, forming stable DT NEs with small particle sizes. The venous irritation of DT NEs was evaluated by in vitro human umbilical cord endothelial cells (CRL 1730) compatibility model with the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) concentrations as the indices. The intracellular ATP and GTP reduction changed with the incorporation of a variety of co-emulsifiers, which varied in a free DT concentration-dependent manner. It was deduced that the free DT concentrations of NEs containing co-emulsifiers were determined by the partition coefficient of DT between <b>oil</b> and surfactant <b>buffer</b> solution. In conclusion, NE was an appropriate delivery system for lipophilic and venous irritant drug, and optimization of the composition of emulsifiers was an effective method to alleviate the venous irritation of DT NEs...|$|R
40|$|The {{controllable}} {{extraction of}} the contents from an individual droplet {{is very important for}} the analysis and further processing of droplets. Most of the available methods lack the control and flexibility over the extraction of droplet contents. Here, we present a novel electrical-based method that can selectively break a droplet and extract its contents into aqueous buffer in a controllable manner on a microfluidic device. The device consisted of two layers, in which the top layer was modified to be hydrophobic for droplet generation and the bottom layer modified to be hydrophilic for maintaining aqueous buffer. A stable oil/water interface was formed at the intersection of the two layers where the <b>oil</b> and aqueous <b>buffer</b> met. When a droplet flew through the oil/water interface, a voltage was applied in the aqueous buffer. The generated electro-osmotic flow in the aqueous buffer and the electric field facilitated the breaking of the water/oil interface between the droplet and aqueous buffer, promoting the breaking of the droplet and a transient coalescence of the droplet with aqueous buffer. During the transient coalescence, droplet contents could be extracted into aqueous buffer. The amount of the droplet contents extracted into the aqueous buffer could be controlled by varying the strength of the electric field, and the droplet still existed and could be further processed after complete extraction of the droplet contents. This method could be used for droplet analysis and may provide a way to perform complex fluid handling in a droplet...|$|R

The specificity of the dif-fusion assay allows the differentiation {{of patients with}} pancreatic disease, even when the lipase activity of the serum is within the normal limits of the titrimetric assay. Pancreatic lipase is not detectable by the diffusion assay in the serum of individuals who are free from pancreatic disease. Additional Keyphrases: pancreatic disease #{ 149 } titrimetry compared #{ 149 }tissue lipases #{ 149 } urinary lipase #{ 149 } enzyme-binding inhibitor Determination of lipase activity in serum is useful {{in the evaluation of}} diseases of the pancreas (1). Several procedures in routine use for measurement of lipase activity are based on the Cherry and Crandall method (2, 3) in which olive oil is hydrolyzed and the fatty acids formed are measured titrimetrically. Alternatively, the fatty acids liberated have been determined by the for-mation of their copper soaps (4). Other tests of lipase activity are based on the clearing of very dilute emul-sions of olive oil (5, 6). The assay we describe here depends on measurement of the zones of clearing of a turbid emulsion of olive <b>oil</b> immobilized in <b>buffered</b> agarose by radial enzyme dif-fusion of lipase in the gel. The zone of clearing is shown to be proportional to the enzyme activity in the serum. The method is rapid, requires only a small sample, is easily performed, and is adequately sensitive.

The primary objective was to show that novel essential oil loaded microspheres are promising {{in the treatment of}} H. pylori infection as an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy. In this context, firstly, the minimum inhibitory concentration of clarithromycin and five essential oils namely lemongrass oil, thyme oil, clove leaf oil, lemon oil and cinnamon bark oil on H. pylori was investigated. Among five essential oils, cinnamon bark oil showed the strongest anti-H. pylori activity. After choosing the most effective essential oil on H. pylori, we focused on the preparation of clarithromycin and cinnamon bark oil loaded microspheres by spray drying technique. Spray drying conditions were optimized by reponse surface methodology. Genipin, a natural crosslinker, was used as a crosslinking agent to achieve controlled drug release. Finally, it was aimed to investigate the clarithromycin and essential <b>oil</b> release in <b>buffer</b> solution and their antibacterial activity on H. pylori when released from microspheres. Higuchi equation well described the release characteristics. Drug release from microspheres was diffusion controlled. Cinnamon bark oil and clarithromycin released from the microspheres inhibited the growth of H. pylori resulting that the antibacterial activity of cinnamon bark oil and clarithromycin was maintained during the microsphere manufacturing. In conclusion, clarithromycin and cinnamon bark oil loaded chitosan microspheres have a great potential {{to be used as a}} control release system in treatment of H. pylori infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{harvest of}} the first {{commercial}} crop of a genetically engineered oilseed plant took place last summer, in the south-east of America. The rapeseed plant had been altered by the biotechnology company Calgene of Davis, California, to produce tropical oils similar to those more usually extracted from coconuts and palm kernels. One of the critics of this development is the Rural Advancement Foundation International (RAFI), a group that campaigns on behalf of farmers in poor countries. Hope Shand, research director at RAFI, fears that such developments would {{have a major impact}} tin the countries that depend on sales of 'naturally, produced' coconut and palm oil which, in many cases, comes from small farmers who grow coconut or oil palm alongside other crops. Hope Shand believes that this genetically engineered oilseed rape {{is a perfect example of}} how genetic engineering may impoverish the Third World rather than helping it to develop. In reply, Roger Salameh, a market analyst with Calgene, says that the altered rapeseed poses no threat to the countries which produce tropical oils because their aim is to produce a reliable <b>oil</b> source to <b>buffer</b> the US market from the wildly fluctuating crops of tropical countries. In 1993 the US imported 600, 000 tonnes of lauric oil, while Calgene's goal for the new rapeseed plant is to produce only about 10 % of the lauric oils used in the US.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the security of}} energy supply, lessen dependence on crude <b>oil</b> import and <b>buffer</b> against the impacts of large change in crude oil prices, the Thai government initiated and officially announced the national ethanol fuel program in year 2000. Since then, domestic ethanol demand has grown rapidly. Presently, all commercial ethanol in Thailand is produced from molasses as Thai law prohibits producing it from sugar cane directly. This is likely to limit ethanol supply in the near future. One possible solution is to supply more ethanol from cassava which is widely cultivated in this country. However, its production cost {{has not yet been}} known for certain. The objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the life cycle cost of ethanol production from cassava and to assess its economic competitiveness with gasoline in the Thai fuel market. Based on the record of cassava prices during the years 2002 - 2005, it was found that using it as feedstock would share more than 50 % of the ethanol from cassava total production cost. It was also found that a bio-ethanol plant, with a capacity of 150, 000 Ã‚Â l/day, can produce ethanol from cassava in a range of ex-factory costs from 16. 42 to 20. 83 Ã‚Â baht/l of gasoline equivalent (excluding all taxes), with an average cost of 18. 15 Ã‚Â baht/l of gasoline equivalent (41, 52 and 45 Ã‚Â USÃ‚Â cents/l gasoline equivalent respectively, based on 2005 exchange rate). In the same years, the range of 95 -octane gasoline prices in Thailand varied from 6. 18 Ã‚Â baht to 20. 86 Ã‚Â baht/l, with an average price of 11. 50 Ã‚Â baht/l (15, 52 and 29 Ã‚Â USÃ‚Â cents/l respectively, based on 2005 exchange rate) which were much cheaper than the costs of ethanol made from cassava. Thus, we conclude that under the scenario of low to normal crude oil price, ethanol from cassava is not competitive with gasoline. The gasoline price has to rise consistently above 18. 15 Ã‚Â baht (45 Ã‚Â USÃ‚Â cents) /l before ethanol made from cassava can be commercially competitive with gasoline.
