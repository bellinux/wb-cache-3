60|$|Fabian {{socialism}} was {{the first}} systematic attempt to meet the fatal absence of administrative schemes in the earlier socialisms. It can scarcely be regarded now as anything but an interesting failure, but a failure that has all the educational value of a first reconnaissance into unexplored territory. Starting from that attack on aggregating property, which is the common starting-point of all socialist projects, the Fabians, appalled at the obvious difficulties of honest confiscation and an <b>open</b> <b>transfer</b> from private to public hands, conceived the extraordinary idea of filching property for the state. A small body of people of extreme astuteness were {{to bring about the}} municipalisation and nationalisation first of this great system of property and then of that, in a manner so artful that the millionaires were to wake up one morning at last, and behold, they would find themselves poor men! For a decade or more Mr. Pease, Mr. Bernard Shaw, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb, Mrs. Besant, Dr. Lawson Dodd, and their associates of the London Fabian Society, did pit their wits and ability, or at any rate the wits and ability of their leisure moments, against the embattled capitalists of England and the world, in this complicated and delicate enterprise, without any apparent diminution of the larger accumulations of wealth. But in addition they developed another side of Fabianism, still more subtle, which professed {{to be a kind of}} restoration in kind of property to the proletariat and in this direction they were more successful. A dexterous use, they decided, was to be made of the Poor Law, the public health authority, the education authority, and building regulations and so forth, to create, so to speak, a communism of the lower levels. The mass of people whom the forces of change had expropriated were to be given a certain minimum of food, shelter, education, and sanitation, and this, the socialists were assured, could be used as the thin end of the wedge towards a complete communism. The minimum, once established, could obviously be raised continually until either everybody had what they needed, or the resources of society gave out and set a limit to the process.|$|E

In addition it is shown that the boundary quantum algebra is the centralizer of the B type Hecke algebra. We then focus on the asymmetric twin representation of the boundary Temperley-Lieb algebra. More precisely, by exploiting exchange relations dictated by the reflection equation we show that the transfer matrix with trivial boundary conditions enjoys the recognized Uq(sl 2) ⊗ Ui(sl 2) symmetry. When a non–diagonal boundary is implemented the symmetry as expected is reduced, however again certain familiar boundary non-local charges turn out to commute with the corresponding transfer matrix...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 81 - 84. Fuel transportation {{constitutes a}} significant portion of hazardous materials transportation for decades. Fuel companies generally prefer highway transportation whereas railway transportation is also a potential alternative due to its advantages both from cost- and risk perspectives. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the potential benefits of using railways in conjunction to highways for fuel transportation in Turkey. In this thesis, we first investigate a quantitative risk model {{that could be used to}} assess the risk of railway transportation. Then, a mathematical model is developed which aims to answer the following three questions: What should be the routes of fuel products transported from suppliers to demand points and which transportation mode(s) should be used on these routes?, Where to <b>open</b> <b>transfer</b> units?, and Which suppliers should satisfy which demand points with what capacity?. The model has two possibly conflicting objectives of minimizing the total transportation risk and minimizing the total transportation cost. The proposed models are tested over Turkish network for which all required realistic data are collected. Elaldı, PelinM. S...|$|E

40|$|Transfer {{functions}} {{which are}} a composite of delay terms cause problems for computer packages, such as MATLAB, in calculating the frequency response <b>open</b> loop <b>transfer</b> function, as {{the form of the}} <b>open</b> loop <b>transfer</b> function is irrational. So, the delay terms have to be approximated. There are several ways to evaluate a delay term. A calculator such as MATHEMATICA uses the exact representation of the delay called the Euler form. A computer package such as MATLAB uses a rational approximation for the delay. Using the MATLAB built-in function pade(n,tau), the <b>open</b> loop <b>transfer</b> function of a system with delay can be calculated and the Bode plot may be obtained using another MATLAB built-in function bode(transfer function).

40|$|A novel, simple, and {{inexpensive}} calibration scheme for a continuous-wave difference frequency spectrometer is presented, {{based on the}} stabilization of an <b>open</b> <b>transfer</b> cavity by locking onto the output of a polarization stabilized HeNe laser. High frequency, acoustic fluctuations of the transfer cavity length are compensated with a piezoelectric transducer mounted mirror, while long term drift in cavity length is controlled by thermal feedback. A single mode Ar+ laser, used with a single mode ring dye laser in the difference frequency generation of 2 – 4 µm light, is then locked onto a suitable fringe of this stable cavity, achieving a very small long term drift and furthermore reducing the free running Ar+ linewidth to about 1 MHz. The dye laser scan provides tunability in the difference frequency mixing process, and is calibrated by marker fringes with the same stable cavity. Due to the absolute stability of the marker cavity, precise frequency determination of near infrared molecular transitions is achieved via interpolation between these marker fringes. It is shown theoretically that the residual error of this scheme due to the dispersion of air in the transfer cavity is quite small, and experimentally that a frequency precision {{on the order of}} 1 MHz per hour is routinely obtained with respect to molecular transitions.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 6 th EuCheMS Chemistry Congress, celebrado en Sevilla (España) del 11 al 15 de septiembre de 2016. The {{study of}} {{fundamental}} processes involving organogold complexes {{is a topic}} of much current interest. In this context, the properties of trimethylgold, (CH 3) 3 Au, and its derivatives have been widely studied as the most basic representatives of triorganogold compounds —with especial attention being focused on their decomposition mechanisms. Little is known, however, on the chemistry of the perfluorinated homologue (CF 3) 3 Au, which is {{probably due to the}} lack of suitable experimental procedures to arrive at this kind of compounds. Given the sharply different properties of the CH 3 and CF 3 groups, we undertook a theoretical study of the perfluorinated (CF 3) 3 Au fragment in order to establish its analogies and especially its differences with the well-known (CH 3) 3 Au moiety. At the experimental level, convenient synthetic methods have been devised to prepare the series of anionic [PPh 4][(CF 3) 3 AuX] derivatives with all non-radioactive halide ligands: X = F, Cl, Br, I. Additionally, the cyano complex [PPh 4][(CF 3) 3 AuCN] was also synthesized. All these anionic compounds exhibit remarkable thermal stability -the latter decomposing at 351 °C. The decomposition of these anionic compounds has been studied both in the gas phase and in the solid state. In the gas phase, where only unimolecular processes occur, the primary decomposition pathways given in the Scheme are operative. Aside from the organogold fluoride derivative [(CF 3) 3 AuF]− for which CF 2 extrusion is preferred, CF 3 –CF 3 elimination is the most favored path in all cases. Interestingly, this high-energy decomposition pathway is completely absent in the condensed phase, where lower-energy intermolecular avenues are <b>open.</b> <b>Transfer</b> of CF 3 groups between gold centers as well as trifluoromethylation of the phenyl rings in the cation are observed.
