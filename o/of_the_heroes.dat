40|$|This paper explores <b>the</b> {{representation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> in <b>the</b> 1935 Hitchcock classic "The 39 Steps. " The film, while {{drawing on}} the original adventure story of "The Thirty Nine Steps," adopts a modernist sensibility in its cinematic depiction of technology and its representation of a bantering heterosexual couple. However, this does not displace the gendered, classed and racialised role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hero.</b> I examine <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> via discourses <b>of</b> masculinity, linked to <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flâneur, that is, <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male <b>hero</b> to wander, gaze and appropriate different space and place for his own use. Hannay, as <b>the</b> <b>hero,</b> also has <b>the</b> correct credentials <b>of</b> class and "race. " This permits him a particular imperialist position which allows him <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> disguise and dissimulation. This freedom assures him a final bourgeois romantic union, consolidating his position as <b>the</b> <b>hero.</b> <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hero</b> {{is one that is}} not available to women, who are either punished or only permitted to take up <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> heroine, <b>the</b> complementary and lesser partner to <b>the</b> <b>hero...</b>|$|R
