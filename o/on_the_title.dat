5|$|Following Azzarello's run, writer Mike Carey {{took over}} the title, {{following}} his Eisner award-winning title Lucifer, set in the Sandman universe. Carey's run attempted to return John Constantine to his roots, with the title largely set back in London, and featuring many characters from former runs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title.</b> Mike Carey also has the honour {{of being the first}} Liverpudlian to write the Liverpudlian character. His was the second longest run by any single author <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title,</b> second only to Garth Ennis.|$|E

5|$|Irish writer Garth Ennis {{then took}} over the title in 1991, again from 2000 AD, {{where he had been}} working on Judge Dredd. He {{proceeded}} to write the longest run for any writer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title.</b> His take <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> was more personal than Jamie Delano's, with John's relationships coming to the fore. It also had a strong religious theme, with John's dealings with the First of the Fallen, and some storylines, such as the relationship between an angel, Tali, and a succubus demon, Ellie, would go on to be used again as a major plot device in Preacher, one of his most popular works. He also references the music of The Pogues and the poetry of Brendan Behan, both of these being relevant to Ennis' Irish heritage.|$|E
5|$|Mike Carey {{returned}} to the title for a single issue between Denise Mina and Andy Diggle's runs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title,</b> and also wrote the well-received Hellblazer graphic novel All His Engines about a strange illness sweeping the globe.|$|E
5|$|After George Lazenby {{left the}} series, {{producers}} Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli tested other actors, but studio United Artists wanted Sean Connery back, paying a then-record $1.25 million salary {{for him to}} return. The producers were inspired by Goldfinger; as with that film, Guy Hamilton was hired to direct, and Shirley Bassey performs vocals <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> theme song. Locations included Las Vegas, California, Amsterdam and Lufthansa's hangar in Germany. Diamonds Are Forever was a commercial success, but received criticism for its humorous camp tone. The film marked the final appearance of the SPECTRE organization (though not by name) in Eon's Bond films until the 2015 film of the same name.|$|E

5|$|After their 1908–12 trip, {{the couple}} stopped {{exploring}} {{and turned to}} writing and lecturing, {{primarily because of the}} onset of World War I in 1914. Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris. She {{was also one of the}} first women admitted as a member of the Royal Geographical Society, a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena. She also earned medals of honor from 10 European geographical societies and was eventually elected a member of the American Alpine Club, Royal Asiatic Society, Club Alpino Italiano, Deutscher und Österreichischer Alpenverein, and Club alpin français. She was very proud of these achievements, listing them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> pages of her books.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is complicated {{and not at}} all stages certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt suggest that the cantata began with the later movements 2–6 and 9, most of them on biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, the wife of a former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in Weimar on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, shows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> page the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.|$|E
5|$|Benfica started October on {{the road}} against former manager José Mourinho with União de Leiria. A final score of 1–1 made the fifth draw in just eight games for Benfica, but the team still gained a point <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> race, as Boavista and Porto were tied for first. Their second match of October was played in Da Luz against Gil Vicente on the 20th, and {{resulted}} in a 2–0 win for Benfica, after João Mawete opened the score in the second half. They played Farense away on the 26th, where a 2–0 win carried Benfica to second place and ended their eight-month streak without winning an away game.|$|E

5|$|By {{length of}} story, Planetarian is the {{shortest}} of Key's games. Excluding the opening and ending sequences, there are 16 parts to the story; the first half is set within the planetarium while the latter half is set outside in the ruined city where the planetarium resides. The novel takes four hours and forty minutes to complete on auto play. After the game has been completed at least once, two new options appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> screen. The first is a feature that allows the player to view twenty images of CG artwork observed in the game. The second option allows the player to listen to eight of the nine music tracks featured in the game.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Robert Wakefield (Douglas), a {{conservative}} Ohio judge, is appointed {{to head the}} President's Office of National Drug Control Policy, taking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> drug czar. Robert is warned by his predecessor (Brolin) and several influential politicians that the War on Drugs is unwinnable. Robert's daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin which quickly develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital. As Robert and his wife Barbara (Irving) struggle {{to deal with the}} problem, Robert discovers that Barbara has known about their daughter's involvement with drugs for over six months.|$|E
5|$|On January 22, 1836, {{the island}} was ceded to France by the village leader of Kagnout at an annual cost of 196 francs.

5|$|Original Stories {{was first}} {{published}} anonymously in 1788, {{the same year as}} Wollstonecraft's first novel , and cost two shillings. When the second edition came out in 1791, Wollstonecraft’s name was printed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> page; after the publication in 1790 of her Vindication of the Rights of Men, she had become well known and her name would have boosted sales. Joseph Johnson, the publisher of Original Stories and all of Wollstonecraft's other works, commissioned William Blake to design six illustrations for the second edition, which cost two shillings and six pence. It is not entirely clear how long the book remained continuously in print. According to Gary Kelly, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, the last edition of Original Stories was published in 1820, but without Wollstonecraft’s name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> page; by that time she had become a reviled figure in Britain because her husband, William Godwin, had revealed her unorthodox lifestyle in his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798). According to Alan Richardson and the editors of the Masterworks of Children's Literature series, Original Stories was published until 1835. It was also printed in Dublin in 1791 and 1799 and translated into German in 1795.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} {{a scene where}} the grandfather {{as a young man}} is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used the image <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E

5|$|The game {{is split}} into 20 sub-parts each given a title in English written mostly in white where {{a portion of}} the title is {{displayed}} in red, and each covers a single day. There are seven endings to the game: a single true end, two normal ends, and four bad ends. In the original game, a bonus role-playing game became available <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> screen after the game was completed at least once. This was later removed from the full-voice DVD edition of the game. There are scenes in Moon with sexual CGs depicting a given heroine having sex.|$|E
5|$|The {{group had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to call}} the album Abracadabra, until they discovered that another band had already used it. When discussing possible alternatives, during their German tour, Lennon opted for Four Sides to the Circle in response to McCartney's Magic Circle, and Starr jokingly suggested After Geography, a play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> of the Rolling Stones' recently released Aftermath LP. Other suggestions included Bubble and Squeak, Beatles on Safari and Pendulum before the band settled on Revolver. They confirmed their choice in a telegram to EMI, sent from the Tokyo Hilton on 2 July.|$|E

In this period Bolton equalled their record finish of third twice, in 1920–21 and 1924–25, on the latter occasion missing out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> by just 3 points (in an era of 2 points for a win).|$|E
