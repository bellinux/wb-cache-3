5|$|Many {{places and}} {{entities}} {{have been named}} in honor of Washington. His name became that of the nation's capital Washington, D.C. The state of Washington is the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> to be named after a United States president. Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest mountain in the Northeast, was named soon after the American Revolution by Colonel John Whipple.|$|E
5|$|William Justus Goebel (January 4, 1856 – February 3, 1900) was an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 34th Governor of Kentucky for four days in 1900 after having been mortally wounded by an assassin the day before he was sworn in. Goebel remains the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> governor in the United States to be assassinated while in office.|$|E
5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did {{not call}} another general {{convention}} in the twentieth century. Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s {{that might have been}} passed by the General Assembly and sent to the voters for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E

5|$|Despite his meager {{political}} experience—having previously {{served only}} {{three years in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives—Johnson labored vehemently to ensure the success of the shadow government. Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, but the shadow government's influence in the Commonwealth extended only as far as the Confederate Army advanced. When Albert Sidney Johnston abandoned the Confederate capital of Bowling Green, Governor Johnson and the other government officials accompanied him. Despite his advanced age and a crippled arm, Johnson volunteered for military service in General Johnston's army. Johnson was killed at the Battle of Shiloh, making him the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> governor, Union or Confederate, to fall in battle during the Civil War. He was succeeded by Richard Hawes, the second and last governor of Confederate Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the delay}} in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh {{parliament}} was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A small scale treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011. This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats were not removed until the 2014 election.|$|E
5|$|Hawaii did {{not allow}} {{same-sex}} marriages or civil unions, but two unmarried people can register for a reciprocal beneficiary relationship, which {{provides some of the}} rights and benefits that come with marriage. The bill was written to become law on January 1, 2010, would allow all couples to obtain rights equal to those of married couples, and make Hawaii the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> in the Western United States to allow civil unions instead of domestic partnerships.|$|E

5|$|Hubert Humphrey brought {{national}} {{attention to the}} state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota {{has gone to the}} Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Richard Nixon and the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Kerala's {{sex ratio}} of 1.084 {{is higher than}} that of the rest of India and is the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> where women outnumber men. While having the {{opportunities}} that education affords them, such as political participation, keeping up to date with current events, reading religious texts etc., these tools have still not translated into full, equal rights for the women of Kerala. There is a general attitude that women must be restricted for their own benefit. In the state, despite the social progress, gender still influences social mobility.|$|E
5|$|New York was {{key to the}} election; a Lincoln loss {{there would}} {{deadlock}} the Electoral College. Soon after his return from his Midwest tour, Seward embarked on another, speaking to large crowds across the state of New York. At Weed's urging he went to New York City and gave a patriotic speech before a large crowd on November 3, only {{three days before the}} election. On Election Day, Lincoln carried most Northern states, while Breckinridge took the Deep South, Bell three border states, and Douglas won Missouri—the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> Seward campaigned in that Lincoln did not win. Lincoln was elected.|$|E

5|$|On 17 November 1986, DMK members protested {{against the}} new {{education}} policy by burning Part XVII of the Constitution. 20,000 DMK members, including Karunanidhi, were arrested. 21 persons committed suicide by self-immolation. Karunanidhi was sentenced to ten weeks of rigorous imprisonment. Ten DMK MLAs including K. Anbazhagan were expelled from the Legislative Assembly by the speaker P. H. Pandian. Rajiv Gandhi assured Members of Parliament from Tamil Nadu that Hindi would not be imposed. As part of the compromise, Navodhaya schools were not started in Tamil Nadu. Currently, Tamil Nadu is the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> in India without Navodaya schools.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{broadcasts}} {{remain the}} principal {{means by which}} the Malagasy population access international, national and local news. <b>Only</b> <b>state</b> radio broadcasts are transmitted across the entire island. Hundreds of public and private stations with local or regional range provide alternatives to state broadcasting. In addition to the state television channel, a variety of privately owned television stations broadcast local and international programming throughout Madagascar. Several media outlets are owned by political partisans or politicians themselves, including the media groups MBS (owned by Ravalomanana) and Viva (owned by Rajoelina), contributing to political polarization in reporting.|$|E
5|$|Sarawak is the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> in Malaysia where Christians outnumber Muslims. The {{earliest}} Christian missionaries in Sarawak were Church of England (Anglicans) in 1848, {{followed by}} Roman Catholics {{a few years}} later, and Methodists in 1903. Evangelizing first took place among the Chinese immigrants before spreading to indigenous animists. Other Christian denominations in Sarawak are Borneo Evangelical Mission (or Sidang Injil Borneo), and Baptists. Indigenous people such as the Iban, Bidayuh, and Orang Ulu have adopted Christianity although they do retain some of their traditional religious rites. Many Muslims come from the Malay, Melanau, and Kayan ethnic groups. Buddhism, Taoism, and Chinese folk religion are predominantly practised by Chinese Malaysians. Other minor religions in Sarawak are Baha'i, Hinduism, Sikhism, and animism.|$|E

5|$|Since the 2006 state election, the Democractic Action Party (DAP) has derived the {{majority}} of its support from urban centres and became the largest opposition party in Sarawak. In 2010, it formed the Pakatan Rakyat coalition with Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS); the latter two parties had become active in Sarawak between 1996 and 2001. Sarawak is the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> in Malaysia where West Malaysia-based component parties in the BN coalition, especially the UMNO, have not been active in state politics.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{legislation}} is observed {{with high levels of}} compliance, but not uniformly throughout the country. There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and <b>only</b> <b>state</b> that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag of Singapore was adopted in 1959, the year Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire. It was reconfirmed as the {{national flag}} when the republic gained independence on 9 August 1965. Prior to its independence, it was the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> flag in Malaysia {{not to have a}} 1:2 ratio. The design is a horizontal bicolour of red above white, overlaid in the canton (upper-left quadrant) by a white crescent moon facing a pentagon of five small white five-pointed stars. The elements of the flag denote a young nation on the ascendant, universal brotherhood and equality, and national ideals.|$|E

Maine and Vermont would ultimately be the <b>only</b> <b>states</b> to reject FDR in all four of his presidential campaigns.|$|R
5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{state flag}} of Washington {{consists}} of the state seal, displaying an image of state namesake George Washington, on a field of dark green with gold fringe being optional. It is the only U.S. state flag with a field of green {{as well as the}} <b>only</b> <b>state</b> flag with the image of an American president. The Secretary of State regulates flag protocol related to the state flag, as well approving replica flags for commercial sale and other standards related to the flag.|$|E
5|$|West Bengal is {{bordered by}} three countries: Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh; and five Indian states: Sikkim, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Assam. Sikkim and Bhutan are located {{to the north}} of the state, Nepal to the northwest, Bihar and Jharkhand in the west, Odisha in the southwest, the Bay of Bengal to the south, and Bangladesh and Assam are in the east. West Bengal is the <b>only</b> <b>state</b> of India that has both the Himalayas in the north and the Bay of Bengal at the south. In between them, the river Ganga enters the state from west, before it {{branches}} off into its main distributaries: the Hooghly River, which flows southwards to reach the Bay of Bengal, and the Padma River, which flows eastwards into Bangladesh.|$|E
