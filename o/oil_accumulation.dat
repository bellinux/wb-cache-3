The oil consists of mainly unsaturated fatty acids and is similar in both species, although the proportion of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids appears to be slightly higher in M. integrifolia (6.2:1 compared with 4.8:1).

30|$|The {{biodegradation}} {{and water}} washing {{of crude oil}} are common in reservoirs located in areas invaded by surfaced derived meteoric formation waters, {{such as in the}} Niger Delta of Nigeria. Wherever meteoric waters penetrate deeply into a basin, any petroleum accumulations that they contact are altered. Paraffins, naphthenes and aromatics, including gases, liquids and solids, are all susceptible to microbial decomposition. The order in which the hydrocarbon compounds are oxidized depends on a variety of factors, but in general small molecules up to C 20 are consumed before large ones, and within the same molecular weight range the order is usually n-paraffins first, followed by iso-paraffins, naphthenes and aromatics; single-ring naphthenes and aromatics are attacked before iso-prenoids, steranes and triterpenes. Preferential consumption of the low molecular weight components causes the high density (low API gravity) of the unconsumed residue (Wenger et al. 2002). Empirically, it has been noted that biodegraded <b>oil</b> <b>accumulations</b> occur in reservoirs that are at temperatures less than 80  °C (Connan 1984; Barnard and Bastow 1991). At higher temperatures, it appears that many of the microorganisms involved in subsurface oil biodegradation cannot exist.

40|$|Canola (Brassica napus) is one {{of several}} {{important}} oil-producing crops, and the physiological processes, enzymes, and genes involved in oil synthesis in canola seeds have been well characterized. However, relatively {{little is known about the}} dynamic metabolic changes that occur during <b>oil</b> <b>accumulation</b> in seeds, as well as the mechanistic origins of metabolic changes. To explore the metabolic changes that occur during <b>oil</b> <b>accumulation,</b> we isolated metabolites from both seed and silique wall and identified and characterized them by using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that a total of 443 metabolites were identified from four developmental stages. Dozens of these metabolites were differentially expressed during seed ripening, including 20 known to be involved in seed development. To investigate the contribution of tissue-specific carbon sources to the biosynthesis of these metabolites, we examined the metabolic changes of silique walls and seeds under three treatments: leaf-detachment (Ld), phloem-peeling (Pe), and selective silique darkening (Sd). Our study demonstrated that the oil content was independent of leaf photosynthesis and phloem transport during <b>oil</b> <b>accumulation,</b> but required the metabolic influx from the silique wall. Notably, Sd treatment resulted in seed senescence, which eventually led to a severe reduction of the oil content. Sd treatment also caused a significant accumulation of fatty acids (FA), organic acids and amino acids. Furthermore, an unexpected accumulation of sugar derivatives and organic acid was observed in the Pe- and Sd-treated seeds. Consistent with this, the expression of a subset of genes involved in FA metabolism, sugar and oil storage was significantly altered in Pe and Sd treated seeds. Taken together, our studies suggest the metabolite profiles of canola seeds dynamically varied during the course of <b>oil</b> <b>accumulation,</b> which may provide a new insight into the mechanisms of the <b>oil</b> <b>accumulation</b> at the metabolite level...|$|E

40|$|Seed {{oil content}} is an {{important}} agronomic trait in oilseed rape. However, the molecular mechanism of <b>oil</b> <b>accumulation</b> in rapeseeds is unclear so far. In this report, RNA sequencing technique (RNA-Seq) was performed to explore differentially expressed genes in siliques of two Brassica napus lines (HFA and LFA which contain high and low oil contents in seeds, respectively) at 15 and 25 days after pollination (DAP). The RNA-Seq results showed that 65746 and 66033 genes were detected in siliques of low oil content line at 15 and 25 DAP, and 65236 and 65211 genes were detected in siliques of high oil content line at 15 and 25 DAP, respectively. By comparative analysis, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in siliques of these lines. The DEGs were involved in multiple pathways, including metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolic, photosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, fatty metabolism, glycophospholipid metabolism, and DNA binding. Also, DEGs were related to photosynthesis, starch and sugar metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, and lipid metabolism at different developmental stage, resulting in the differential <b>oil</b> <b>accumulation</b> in seeds. Furthermore, RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR data revealed that some transcription factors positively regulate seed oil content.

PetroMod 2013 petroleum system modeling software has been used for 1 D and 2 D petroleum system modeling by integrating geophysical. geochemical and geological data {{in order to understand the}} petroleum system of the study area. The results indicate that the source rocks in the basin are at different levels of maturity ranging from immature, mature to completely overmature for hydrocarbon generation.
