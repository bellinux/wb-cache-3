40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the relationship between OST, tear film stability as assessed by NIBUT and subjective evaluation of the lipid layer thickness in a young, asymptomatic, sample group (N = 29). Non-invasive tear break-up time (NIBUT) and tear lipid layer structure were evaluated through a slit-lamp mounted Tearscope Plus. A self-calibrating infrared thermography camera was used to record two OST values (one immediately post-blink and one immediately pre the subsequent blink). The most common lipid layer pattern observed was the amorphous pattern (48. 3 %). Differences between post- and pre-blink OST values were observed (paired t-test; p < 0. 001). Significant differences of pre-blink OST values were observed between the closed marmoreal group with that from the amorphous and flow groups (Tukey post hoc test, p < 0. 05). There were no differences of NIBUT values between each lipid layer thickness (Kruskal-Wallis test; p = 0. 152). A no significant tendency for <b>higher</b> <b>OST</b> in eyes with increased NIBUT was observed. This study suggests that <b>higher</b> <b>OST</b> values could be associated with thicker tear lipid layer in normal subjects. The lack of significant results in relation with tear film stability may be due to only normal subjects were included...|$|R
40|$|Aims  To {{investigate}} whether opiate substitution therapy (OST) and needle and syringe programmes (NSP) can reduce hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission among injecting drug users (IDUs). Design  Meta-analysis and pooled analysis, with logistic regression allowing adjustment for gender, injecting duration, crack injecting and homelessness. Setting  Six UK sites (Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, London and Wales), community recruitment. Participants  A total of 2986 IDUs surveyed during 2001 - 09. Measurement  Questionnaire responses {{were used to}} define intervention categories for OST (on OST or not) and high NSP coverage (≥ 100 % versus < 100 % needles per injection). The primary outcome was new HCV infection, measured as antibody seroconversion at follow-up or HCV antibody-negative/RNA-positive result in cross-sectional surveys. Findings  Preliminary meta-analysis showed little evidence of heterogeneity between the studies {{on the effects of}} OST (I(2)  =  48 %, P =  0. 09) and NSP (I(2)  =  0 %, P =  0. 75), allowing data pooling. The analysis of both interventions included 919 subjects with 40 new HCV infections. Both receiving <b>OST</b> and <b>high</b> NSP coverage were associated with a reduction in new HCV infection [adjusted odds ratios (AORs)  =  0. 41, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 21 - 0. 82 and 0. 48, 95 % CI: 0. 25 - 0. 93, respectively]. Full harm reduction (on <b>OST</b> plus <b>high</b> NSP coverage) reduced the odds of new HCV infection by nearly 80 % (AOR =  0. 21, 95 % CI: 0. 08 - 0. 52). Full harm reduction was associated with a reduction in self-reported needle sharing by 48 % (AOR 0. 52, 95 % CI: 0. 32 - 0. 83) and mean injecting frequency by 20. 8 injections per month (95 % CI: - 27. 3 to - 14. 4). Conclusions  There is good evidence that uptake of opiate substitution therapy and high coverage of needle and syringe programmes can substantially reduce the risk of hepatitis C virus transmission among injecting drug users. Research is now required on whether the scaling-up of intervention exposure can reduce and limit hepatitis C virus prevalence in this population...|$|R
30|$|One key {{challenge}} in guided tissue formation is {{to design and}} fabricate substrates with desirable surface properties, convenient for cell adhesion and proliferation that can regulate the process of tissue engineering. In this study, HDFs behavior was studied on modified and unmodified of PCL-based nano-fibrous mat spinning at three different collecting times. It was observed that HDFs showed higher cell adhesion strength on O 2 plasma modified PCL substrates than on unmodified and positive control, while OSTs on unmodified PCL nano-fibers showed special cellular attachment on the first day. After that the comparison of growth and proliferation between OSTs and HDFs showed <b>OSTs</b> of <b>higher</b> rate than HDFs. In summary, based on the results obtained in this study it can be suggested that a substrate can be designed more or less similar structure of ECM of human body. It is noteworthy that the substrate with high collecting time (70  min) was suitable and desirable topography for OSTs. At the end, plasma PCL nano-fibrous electrospun mats with 70  min collecting time {{can be used as a}} substrate for bone tissue engineering.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOur {{research}} {{focuses on}} reducing complexity of hyperspectral image codecs based on transform and/or subband coding, {{so they can be}} on-board a satellite. It is well-known that the Karhunen Loeve transform (KLT) can be sub-optimal for non Gaussian data. However, it is generally recommended as the best calculable coding transform in practice. Now, for a compression scheme compatible with both the JPEG 2000 Part 2 standard and the CCSDS recommendations for onboard satellite image compression, the concept and computation of optimal spectral transforms (<b>OST),</b> at <b>high</b> bit-rates, were carried out, under low restrictive hypotheses. These linear transforms are optimal for reducing spectral redundancies of multi- or hyper-spectral images, when the spatial redundancies are reduced with a fixed 2 -D discrete wavelet transform. The problem of OST is their heavy computational cost. In this paper we present the performances in coding of a quasi-optimal spectral transform, called exogenous OrthOST, obtained by learning an orthogonal OST on a sample of hyperspectral images from the spectrometer MERIS. Moreover, we compute an integer variant of OrthOST for lossless compression. The performances are compared to the ones of the KLT in both lossy and lossless compressions. We observe good performances of the exogenous OrthOST...|$|R
40|$|As an {{extremely}} complex group of {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs) candidates in the Stockholm Convention, short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) have been of extensive concern in recent years. In this study, nine bivalve and two gastropod species were collected in 2009 to evaluate the spatial distributions and potential factors influencing the bioaccumulation of SCCPs in mollusks in the Chinese Bohai Sea. The concentrations of Sigma SCCPs in the mollusks were in the range 64. 9 - 5510 ng/g (dry weight) with an average chlorine content of 61. 1 %. C- 10 and C- 11 were the predominant homologue groups of SCCPs, which accounted for about 29. 7 % and 34. 9 % of Sigma SCCPs, respectively. Six and seven chlorinated substituents were the main congener groups. Mya arenaria (Mya), Mactra veneriformis (Mac), and Crassostrea talienwhanensis (Oyster, <b>Ost)</b> had <b>higher</b> average concentrations of SCCPs than other species, implying that these bivalves {{could be used as}} sentinels to indicate SCCPs contamination in this coastal region. A significant positive linear relationship was found between SCCP concentrations and lipid content of the mollusks, whereas the lipid-normalized SCCP concentrations were negatively linear-related to the trophic levels (TL), which implied that SCCPs did not show biomagnification in mollusks in this region...|$|R

Most studies that attempted to replicate this finding produced data showing statistically non-significant trends in the predicted direction. The present study explored the possibility that significant group differences have been obscured because parents of schizophrenics may make fewer responses on the OST, thereby lowering their total OST scores. Total OST scores of 23 parent-pairs of schizophrenic patients were {{compared with those of}} 19 parent-pairs of healthy controls. As in most earlier studies, parents of schizophrenics showed a non-significant trend to have raised OST scores. They also responded to significantly fewer items on the OST, i. e. showed high response threshold, compared with the parents of healthy controls. The parents of schizophrenics had significantly <b>higher</b> <b>OST</b> scores than healthy controls when the number of OST items not responded to was partialled out.

40|$|Transfection of NIH 3 T 3 {{cells with}} an {{osteosarcoma}} expression cDNA library {{led to the}} appearance of foci of morphologically transformed cells which were found to harbor a novel oncogene, ost. The ost product was activated by truncation of the N-terminal domain of the ost proto-oncogene and was highly tumorigenic in nude mouse assays. The proto-ost cDNA, isolated subsequently, encodes a predicted protein of 100 kDa containing DH (Db 1 homology) and PH (pleckstrin homology) domains. Ost is mainly phosphorylated on serine and localized in the cytoplasm. Purified Ost protein catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange on RhoA and Cdc 42 among the Rho and Ras family members tested, indicating that Ost can activate these small GTP-binding proteins. Ost did not detectably associate with RhoA or Cdc 42, but interacted specifically with the GTP-bound form of Rac 1, suggesting that Ost can function as an effector of Rac 1. These results suggest that Ost is a critical regulatory component which links pathways that signal through Rac 1, RhoA and Cdc 42. Of the tissues examined, expression of <b>ost</b> was the <b>highest</b> in brain and could be localized to neurons and alpha-tanycytes, suggesting that Ost may participate in axonal transport in these specialized cells...|$|R

During the Lodz offensive in Poland (11-25 November), Falkenhayn hoped that the Russians would be made amenable to peace overtures. In his discussions with Bethmann-Hollweg, Falkenhayn viewed Germany and Russia as having no insoluble conflict and that the real enemies of Germany were France and Britain. A peace with only a few annexations of territory also seemed possible with France and that with Russia and France out of the war by negotiated settlements, Germany could concentrate on Britain and fight a long war with the resources of Europe at its disposal. Hindenburg and Ludendorff continued to believe that Russia could be defeated by a series of battles which cumulatively would have a decisive effect, after which Germany could finish off France and Britain.|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{seasonal}} variation (spring, early summer, {{last summer and}} autumn) of inversion polymorphisms of the O chromosome of Drosophila subobscura in a natural population over 15 years. The length of the study allowed us to investigate the temporal behavior (short-term seasonal changes and long-term directional trends) of the O arrangements by the powerful statistical method of time series analysis. It is shown that the O inversion polymorphisms varied on two different time scales: short-term seasonal changes repeated over the years superimposed on long-term directional trends. All the common arrangements (O(3 + 4 + 7), O(ST), O(3 + 4) and O(3 + 4 + 8)) showed significant cyclic seasonal changes, and {{all but one of}} these arrangements (O(3 + 4 + 7)) showed significant long-term trends. Moreover, the degree of seasonality was different for different arrangements. Thus, O(3 + 4 + 7) and <b>O(ST)</b> showed the <b>highest</b> seasonality, which accounted for ~ 61 and 47 % of their total variances, respectively. The seasonal changes in the frequencies of chromosome arrangements were significantly associated with the seasonal variation of the climate (temperature, rainfall, humidity and insolation).

We {{evaluated}} the frequency and patterns of hand radiographic osteoarthritis (rOA) in adults with and without KBD. Methods Han Chinese (N = 438) from Yongshou County of central China underwent right hand radiography for determining case status. Presence of KBD was based on characteristic radiographic deformities of articular ends of bones including articular surface depression, carpal crowding, any subchondral bone deformities in the proximal end of phalanges or first metacarpal bone, or the distal ends of metacarpal bones 2 – 5, and any bony enlargement with deformity of the distal ends of phalanges. Hand rOA severity was determined by osteophyte (OST), joint space narrowing (JSN), and Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grades. Results This study included 127 KBD and 311 non-KBD adults of similar mean age (39 years) and body mass index (BMI) (21 kg/m 2). Inter- and intra-rater reliability for radiographic determination of case status and rOA features was high (kappa 0. 72 – 0. 96).

40|$|Background: Patients with osteoporosis, {{defined by}} low bone mineral density (BMD; T-scores≤- 2. 5) are at {{increased}} risk of hip and other fractures. Currently, most women with osteoporosis remain undiagnosed. The Osteoporosis Self-assessment Tool (OST), an index based on age and weight, was developed to identify women {{at increased risk}} of osteoporosis to undergo further evaluation with definitive bone mineral density (BMD) testing. The method was originally developed in postmenopausal Asian women (1), and was subsequently modified and validated in Caucasian women. Objectives: To review and summarize the performance of the OST in identifying postmenopausal Caucasian women at increased risk of osteoporosis across various populations. Methods: Publications that reported results for OST were identified and summarized. Age and weight are the two most influential determinants of BMD; OST is calculated as: [(weight in kg – age) X 0. 2, truncated to an integer]. The resulting value is used to classify women as low (OST> 1), moderate (OST- 3 to 1), and <b>high</b> (<b>OST</b> <- 3) risk for osteoporosis. Results: Four publications reported results for OST in seven populations. Using OST to stratify risk levels, the prevalence of osteoporosis increased progressively from the low risk group to the high risk group (Table). In the high risk groups, approximately one in every two women has osteoporosis, and the proportion is about one in every four or five women in the moderate risk groups. Thus, in the women classified as moderate or <b>high</b> risk by <b>OST,</b> the yield is sufficient to justify measuring BMD. The low risk group had a very low proportion of women with osteoporosis; BMD measurements would not be recommended unless prior fracture, corticosteroid use, or other major risk factors were present.

Bisher fehlte der strukturelle Nachweis, dass die OST als mit dem Ribosom assoziierten Membranprotein (RAMP) Bestandteil des auf dem proteinleitenden Kanal, dem Sec 61 -Komplex, basierenden Translokons ist. In dieser Arbeit berichten wir von der kryoelektronenmikroskopischen 3 D-Struktur eines definierten OST-Sec 61 -Ribosom-Komplexes aus Saccharomyces cerevisiae bei 15, 4 Å Auflösung. Dazu wurden die Komponenten (OST, Sec 61 und Ribosomen mit naszierender Proteinkette) affinitätschromatographisch gereinigt und das Bindungsverhalten mit 80 S-Ribosomen {{in vitro}} untersucht. Die OST band mit einer KD von 12, 8 nM hochaffin und spezifisch an den bekannten Sec 61 -Ribosomen-Komplex. Dieser in vitro rekonstituierte trimere Komplex zeigte eine neuartige eng an das Ribosom anschließende Translokonstruktur mit zwei bisher unbekannten ribosomalen Verbindungen, einer einzigen dezentralen porenförmigen Vertiefung und zusätzlichen luminalen Bereichen. Durch das Docken eines Sec 61 -Homologs in einer alternativen Bindeposition sowie das Docken eines Stt 3 p-Homologs (der katalytischen Untereinheit der OST) und mit Hilfe der mittels (Kryo-) Negativkontrastierung gewonnenen 3 D-Struktur der OST konnten Hybridmodelle erstellt werden. Daraus wurde unter Einbeziehung von bekannten molekularbiologisch gewonnenen Interaktionsdaten das 3 D-Modell eines aktiven Ribosomen-gebundenen OST-Sec 61 -Translokons entwickelt. Like a label, N-glycosylation by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) of newly {{synthesized}} proteins {{emerging from the}} ribosome while being cotranslationally translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) provides {{a starting point for}} a multitude of processes. Hitherto no structural proof has been presented, that the OST as a ribosome associated membrane protein (RAMP) is a constituent of the translocon, based at its core on the protein conducting channel (Sec 61 -complex). In this work we report on the 3 D-structure of a defined OST-Sec 61 -ribosome complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by cryo-electron microscopy at 15. 4 Å resolution. Thereto, the components (OST, Sec 61, ribosome nascent chain complexes) have been purified by affinity chromatography and the binding of 80 S-ribosomes has been checked in vitro.

By docking of a Sec 61 homologue at an alternative binding position plus the docking of a Stt 3 p homologue (the catalytic subunit of the OST) and by means of the 3 D-structure of the OST using the (cryo-) negative staining technique, hybrid models could be created.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Needle syringe {{programmes}} and opioid {{substitution therapy}} for preventing hepatitis C transmission {{in people who}} inject drugsNeedle syringe programmes (NSP) and opioid substitution therapy (OST) are the primary interventions to reduce hepatitis C (HCV) transmission in people who inject drugs. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of NSP and OST in reducing injecting risk behaviour and increasing evidence for the effectiveness of OST and NSP in reducing HIV acquisition risk, but the evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} NSP and OST for preventing HCV acquisition is weak. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of needle syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy, alone or in combination, for preventing acquisition of HCV in people who inject drugs. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Register, CENTRAL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), the Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA), the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Global Health, CINAHL, and the Web of Science up to 16 November 2015. We updated this search in March 2017, but we have not incorporated these results into the review yet. Where observational studies did not report any outcome measure, we asked authors to provide unpublished data. We searched publications of key international agencies and conference abstracts. We reviewed reference lists of all included articles and topic-related systematic reviews for eligible papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, cross-sectional surveys, case-control studies and randomised controlled trials that measured exposure to NSP and/or OST against no intervention or a reduced exposure and reported HCV incidence as an outcome in people who inject drugs. We defined interventions as current OST (within previous 6 months), lifetime use of <b>OST</b> and <b>high</b> NSP coverage (regular attendance at an NSP or all injections covered by a new needle/syringe) or low NSP coverage (irregular attendance at an NSP or less than 100 % of injections covered by a new needle/syringe) compared with no intervention or reduced exposure. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed the standard Cochrane methodological procedures incorporating new methods for classifying risk of bias for observational studies. We described study methods against the following 'Risk of bias' domains: confounding, selection bias, measurement of interventions, departures from intervention, missing data, measurement of outcomes, selection of reported results; and we assigned a judgment (low, moderate, serious, critical, unclear) for each criterion. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 28 studies (21 published, 7 unpublished) : 13 from North America, 5 from the UK, 4 from continental Europe, 5 from Australia and 1 from China, comprising 1817 incident HCV infections and 8806. 95 person-years of follow-up. HCV incidence ranged from 0. 09 cases to 42 cases per 100 person-years across the studies. We judged only two studies to be at moderate overall risk of bias, while 17 were at serious risk and 7 were at critical risk; for two unpublished datasets there was insufficient information to assess bias. As none of the intervention effects were generated from RCT evidence, we typically categorised quality as low. We found evidence that current OST reduces the risk of HCV acquisition by 50 % (risk ratio (RR) 0. 50, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 40 to 0. 63, I(2) = 0 %, 12 studies across all regions, N = 6361), but the quality of the evidence was low. The intervention effect remained significant in sensitivity analyses that excluded unpublished datasets and papers judged to be at critical risk of bias. We found evidence of differential impact by proportion of female participants in the sample, but not geographical region of study, the main drug used, or history of homelessness or imprisonment among study samples. Overall, we found very low-quality evidence that high NSP coverage did not reduce risk of HCV acquisition (RR 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 39 to 1. 61) with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 77 %) based on five studies from North America and Europe involving 3530 participants. After stratification by region, high NSP coverage in Europe was associated with a 76 % reduction in HCV acquisition risk (RR 0. 24, 95 % CI 0. 09 to 0. 62) with less heterogeneity (I(2) = 0 %). We found low-quality evidence of the impact of combined high coverage of NSP and OST, from three studies involving 3241 participants, resulting in a 74 % reduction in the risk of HCV acquisition (RR 0. 26 95 % CI 0. 07 to 0. 89). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: OST is associated with a reduction in the risk of HCV acquisition, which is strengthened in studies that assess the combination of OST and NSP. There was greater heterogeneity between studies and weaker evidence for the impact of NSP on HCV acquisition. High NSP coverage was associated with a reduction in the risk of HCV acquisition in studies in Europe...|$|R
