25|$|In {{studies of}} {{prepared}} learning, conditioned fear responses to images of outgroup males {{were far more}} difficult to extinguish than conditioned fear responses to outgroup females or ingroup members of either sex, as measured by conductivity tests <b>of</b> <b>perspiration</b> on the skin. These results held true whether the participant was male or female. Because the neural circuitry for fear responses are more developed towards stimuli that have posed a larger threat for most of human history (snakes and spiders, for example, which were dangers frequently encountered by foragers), {{these findings suggest that}} outgroup males may have been more of a threat to physical safety than outgroup women or ingroup members, supporting the male warrior hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The Tenifer process {{produces}} a matte gray-colored, nonglare {{surface with a}} 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications), making the Glock particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects <b>of</b> <b>perspiration.</b> Glock steel parts using the Tenifer treatment are more corrosion resistant than analogous gun parts having other finishes or treatments, including Teflon, bluing, hard chrome plating, or phosphates. During 2010 Glock switched from the salt bath nitriding Tenifer process to a not exactly disclosed gas nitriding process. After applying the nitriding process, a black Parkerized decorative surface finish is applied. The underlying nitriding treatment will remain, protecting these parts even if the decorative surface finish were to wear off.|$|E

Chris Richards of The Washington Post {{referred to the}} track a [...] "club-hungry come-ons" [...] with a [...] "dexterous melody". He further stated that the [...] "skeletal" [...] track [...] "keeps Beyoncé tethered to the ground". Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "a piddly home hi-fi can hardly capture the thunderous grandeur of 'Get Me Bodied,' which sets Beyoncé's harmonies above a pummeling track overseen by rap producer Swiss Beatz". Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media called the track a [...] "percussive, Diwali-esque jam". Us Weekly described [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] a [...] "snappy dance number." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker noted that the song sounds [...] "anxious."

As in girls, another androgen effect is increased secretion of oil (sebum) from the skin and the resultant variable amounts of acne.

However, {{it is not unusual for}} a fully grown adult to suffer the occasional bout of acne, though it is normally less severe than in adolescents. Some may desire using prescription topical creams or ointments to keep acne from getting worse, or even oral medication, due to the fact that acne is emotionally difficult and can cause scarring.|$|E
2500|$|Leadbeater {{played for}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club as a middle-order batsman from 1966 to 1979, {{although}} {{he preferred to}} open the innings. His promise went largely unfulfilled; his average of 25.34 in 147 first-class matches (the norm for a county cricketer of the period was around 30.00), scoring just one century. The highlight of his playing career was a man-of-the-match winning 76 in the 1969 Gillette Cup Final, a match {{in which he was}} not expected to play. Leadbeater broke a finger in the County Championship game the day before, and would have been omitted had Geoffrey Boycott not suffered a worse injury. Leadbeater said: [...] "I almost forgot about the fact that I had a broken finger. Then when it came to lunchtime, I was changing my clothing because <b>of</b> <b>perspiration,</b> and ate my lunch in a jockstrap and left batting glove! I couldn’t get the glove off because my finger had swollen. I can't get m' breath!" [...] Leadbeater posted a top score of 90 in 106 one day games. Leadbeater was touted by Colin Cowdrey (amongst others) as a future Test match cricketer. However, batting lower down the order and a shin injury in 1970 meant that Leadbeater failed to score enough runs to impress the selectors.|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] “Your clothes {{have not}} grown old on you,” Rabbi Jose bar Hanina taught that the clothes that the Israelites wore did not wear out, but those that they packed away in their trunks did. Alternatively, Rabbi Eleazar, {{the son of}} Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai, asked his {{father-in-law}} Rabbi Simeon ben Jose whether the Israelites had not taken with them leather garments into the wilderness (which would wear out). Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied that the clothes that they wore were those with which the ministering angels had invested them at Mount Sinai, and therefore they did not grow old. Rabbi Eleazar asked whether the Israelites did not grow so that the clothes became too small for them. Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied that one should not wonder at this, for when a snail grows, its shell grows with it. Rabbi Eleazar asked whether the clothes did not need washing. Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied that the pillar of cloud rubbed against them and whitened them. Rabbi Eleazar asked whether they were not scorched, as the cloud consisted of fire. Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied that one should not wonder at this, as amianthus (a kind of asbestos) is cleansed only by fire, and as their clothes were made in heaven, the cloud rubbed against them without damaging them. Rabbi Eleazar asked whether vermin did not breed in the clothes. Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied that if in their death no worm could touch the Israelites, how much less could vermin in their lifetime. Rabbi Eleazar asked whether they did not smell because <b>of</b> <b>perspiration.</b> Rabbi Simeon ben Jose replied {{that they used to}} play with the sweet-scented grass around the well, as [...] says, “And the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.” ...|$|E
