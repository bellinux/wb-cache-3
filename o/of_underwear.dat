5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type <b>of</b> <b>underwear</b> used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E

5|$|Certain types <b>of</b> <b>underwear</b> are {{described}} as bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E
5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the waistline of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion depends on the style of trousers, the style <b>of</b> <b>underwear,</b> {{and the way they}} are worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E

5000|$|Sokgot (...) is a {{collective}} noun for {{various types of}} traditional Korean undergarments. They were worn {{as part of a}} hanbok before the import <b>of</b> Western-style <b>underwear.</b> Women usually wore several layers of undergarments, the more layers they had the richer they were. Undergarments were considered very important, thus it happened that the quality and material <b>of</b> the <b>underwear</b> was better than that of the visible outer layers.|$|R

25|$|In cold climates, {{underwear}} may {{constitute an}} additional layer of clothing helping {{to keep the}} wearer warm. Underwear may {{also be used to}} preserve the wearer's modesty – for instance, some women wear camisoles and slips (petticoats) under clothes that are sheer. Conversely, some types <b>of</b> <b>underwear</b> can be worn for sexual titillation, such as edible underwear, crotchless panties and thongs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{items of}} {{clothing}} are designed exclusively as underwear, while others such as T-shirts and {{certain types of}} shorts are suitable both as underwear and as outer clothing. The suitability <b>of</b> <b>underwear</b> as outer clothing is, apart from the indoor or outdoor climate, largely dependent on societal norms, fashion and {{the requirements of the}} law. If made of suitable material, some underwear can serve as nightwear or swimsuits.|$|E

25|$|For {{applications}} where {{passive heating}} is insufficient, active heating can be used. One {{of the earliest}} systems was the tube suit, a set <b>of</b> <b>underwear</b> with a complicated labyrinth of tubes which carried heated water supplied from the surface or the lockout submersible through an additional hose in the diver's umbilical. Other active heating systems use electrical heating elements in an undersuit layer, or internal pockets containing hot-packs, sealed plastic bags containing materials which emit latent heat during a phase change.|$|E
25|$|A diaper (American English) or a nappy (British English) {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>underwear</b> {{that allows}} the wearer to defecate or urinate {{without the use of}} a toilet, by {{absorbing}} or containing waste products to prevent soiling of outer clothing or the external environment. When diapers become soiled, they require changing, generally by a second person such as a parent or caregiver. Failure to change a diaper on a sufficiently regular basis can result in skin problems around the area covered by the diaper.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of layering {{can be used}} to provide a wider range of insulation possibilities from a relatively small range <b>of</b> <b>underwear</b> items, however this can only be done before entering the water. Most dry suit underwear insulates by a trapped layer of air in the garment, and this is largely lost if the air is replaced by water in a flooded suit, so as a general rule, insulation is proportional to the combined thickness of the undergarments. The layering principle shows that the option of two layers of undergarment in two thicknesses allows three levels of insulation to be selected. Thin only, thick only, and both layers.|$|E
