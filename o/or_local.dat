Under this law, Nickell's crime was prosecutable as a federal product tampering case {{as well as a}} state murder case, and she was convicted not of murder, but of product tampering that caused death.

5|$|Like {{all other}} {{non-human}} primates, strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction due to human activity, particularly deforestation in tropical regions.

Although hunting is often prohibited, the laws protecting them are rarely enforced. In Madagascar, local taboos known as fady sometimes help protect lemur species, although some are still hunted for traditional medicine.|$|E
