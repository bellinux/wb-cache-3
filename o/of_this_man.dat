25|$|The first Portuguese {{encounter}} with the subcontinent was on 20 May 1498 when Vasco da Gama reached Calicut on Malabar Coast. Anchored {{off the coast of}} Calicut, the Portuguese invited native fishermen on board and immediately bought some Indian items. One Portuguese accompanied the fishermen to the port and met with a Tunisian Muslim. On the advice <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man,</b> Gama sent a couple of his men to Ponnani to meet with ruler of Calicut, the Zamorin. Over the objections of Arab merchants, Gama managed to secure a letter of concession for trading rights from the Zamorin, Calicut's Hindu ruler. But, the Portuguese were unable to pay the prescribed customs duties and price of his goods in gold.|$|E
25|$|This is what McDonald thinks, {{but other}} historians such as Seán Duffy {{have taken it}} to refer to Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the {{progenitor}} of Clan Donald. Alex Woolf argued that Donnchadh was probably too old at this stage to have been fighting in Ireland, and suggests that the probable identity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> was Ruaídhrí mac Raghnaill. Sellar also believes that Donnchadh {{would have been too}} old, and also suggests identifying this man with Ruaidhrí mac Raghnaill. Donnchadh appeared in Scottish sources in 1237, and again, for the last time, in 1244, as one of the magnates whose names were attached to a letter from Alexander II to the Pope. His son Eóghan appears to have been fully in charge of the lordship by 1249, probably indicating that Donnchadh was dead by this point.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1974, Harper {{had formed}} the United Conservative Party, which called for {{separate}} black and white legislatures. He subsequently reacted with revulsion each time Smith moved towards settlement with black nationalist factions. In December that year he described Smith's announcement of a ceasefire {{in the run-up to}} the Victoria Falls Conference as a [...] "ghastly capitulation". In 1976, when Smith announced his acceptance of unconditional majority rule by 1978, Harper accused the Prime Minister of [...] "selling us out". [...] "The mind boggles at the enormous impertinence and audacity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> Smith," [...] he said.|$|E

He died in an Adelaide hospital on 12 March 1928 of injuries received the previous day, when he crashed the club's Moth trainer while giving an aerobatics display at Parafield. Goble said of him, [...] "That he did sterling work with our air force is well known, but it is doubtful whether {{the majority of the}} people in Australia have a true appreciation of the greatness <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> and the magnitude and difficulties of many of the tasks he performed." ...|$|E
500|$|Baelfire {{is worried}} about his father's plan to wield the dagger's power but Rumpelstiltskin just sends him home. Rumpelstiltskin summons Zoso and {{declares}} he is The Dark One's master. Zoso is not impressed and wonders aloud what the timid little man would have him do. Rumpelstiltskin's answer is [...] "Die!" [...] He kills The Dark One who reveals himself to be the beggar from before. Zoso laughs and tells Rumpelstiltskin that [...] "All magic comes with a price." [...] Rumpelstiltskin becomes the new Dark One and his name is now inscribed on the dagger. He returns home and uses his power to save his son from the Duke's men. Baelfire is terrified <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> who no longer seems like his father at all.|$|E
500|$|Less is {{recorded}} of Low than of other equally prolific pirates such as Teach and Stede Bonnet. Howard Pyle, in an 1880 children's book on pirates, said: [...] "No one stood {{higher in the}} trade than , and no one mounted to more lofty altitudes of bloodthirsty and unscrupulous wickedness. 'Tis strange that so little has been written and sung <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> of might, for he was as worthy of story and of song as was Blackbeard." [...] Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his work The Green Flag, described Low as [...] "savage and desperate", and a man of [...] "amazing and grotesque brutality". The New York Times said [...] "Low and his crew became the terror of the Atlantic, and his depredations were committed on {{every part of the}} ocean, from the coast of Brazil to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland".|$|E

500|$|In 1896, Major Deare led {{one such}} {{expedition}} north {{from the main}} seat of Company administration, Fort Salisbury, {{to meet with the}} Ngoni chief Mpezeni, who ruled to the east of Harrison Clark. One day, to Deare's surprise, a small group of warriors approached his party from the west, carrying a letter. This message, written in English and signed [...] "Changa-Changa, Chief of the Mashukulumbwe"—the name John Harrison Clark was given {{in the body of the}} letter—said that its author had heard of a white man being entertained recently by Mpezeni, and wished to provide the same hospitality at Algoa. [...] "Really, wonders never cease!" [...] Deare recalled. [...] "I had heard <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> on the Zambezi and had known him well many years ago in the Cape Colony... We had both lived in the same town for years. I learnt his story later." [...] It is unclear whether Deare took up Clark's invitation to Algoa.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carter {{described}} the opening scene—in which Scully discovers {{the truth about}} death, sadness, and sorrow—as [...] "a way he would never imagined an X-Files episode to begin with", and that the related scene with Scully's tombstone was [...] "a soft but beautiful opening" [...] that [...] "sets up the episode in a frightening way". The image of Scully in the boat was meant to symbolize [...] "being tethered to something very tenuously, {{and that there was}} a chance for you to be cut adrift and slip into the unknown". Skinner facing the Smoking Man placed the character as [...] "both an antagonistic and institutional figure" [...] that tries to be both an FBI agent and an ally of Mulder and Scully—his refusal to allow the Smoking Man to smoke in his office [...] "speaks of [...] alliances and allegiances to Agent Scully and his hatred <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> he cannot vanquish, he cannot get rid of, but he has to tolerate".|$|E
500|$|At the far right, a {{black man}} fondles the breasts of a woman, distracting her from her work, her {{pie-dish}} [...] "tottering like her virtue". Confusion over whether the law permitted slavery in England, and pressure from abolitionists, meant that by the mid-eighteenth century there was a sizeable population of free black Londoners; but the status <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> is not clear. The black man, the girl and bawling boy fill the roles of Mars, Venus and Cupid which would {{have appeared in the}} pastoral scenes that Hogarth is aping. In front of the couple, a boy has set down his pie to rest, but the plate has broken, spilling the pie onto the ground where it is being rapidly consumed by an urchin. The boy's features are modelled on those of a child in the foreground of Poussin's first version of the Rape of the Sabine Women (now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art), but the boy crying over his lost pie was apparently sketched by Hogarth after he witnessed the scene one day while he was being shaved.|$|E

500|$|The first {{shipping}} line to begin regular transatlantic steamer services was the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, {{better known as}} the Cunard Line in recognition of its founder, the Canadian Samuel Cunard. It began its operations on July 4, 1840, when [...] left Liverpool for Boston, via Halifax, Nova Scotia. As the principal transatlantic mail carrier, the Cunard Line received subsidies from the British government and from the United States Post Office Department, the latter a point that rankled with some Americans, who felt that a home-owned line should be the beneficiary. [...] Senator James A. Bayard of Delaware was among those urging Congress to subsidize a US steamship line: [...] "America will soon become tired of being informed of British maritime supremacy... I suggest that Congress grant a carefully selected American shipping expert a completely free hand to proceed with the absolute conquest <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> Cunard". In 1845 the postmaster general invited tenders for a transatlantic mail contract. The successful bidder, announced on March 3, 1847, was New York shipowner Edward Knight Collins.|$|E

"My other colleague, the {{ambassador}} Philippus Faxecura, after {{he reached his}} aforementioned king (Date Masamune), was greatly honored by him, and sent to his own estate, to rest after such a long and tiring journey, where he made his wife, children, servants, and many other vassals into Christians, and advised other nobles who were his kith and kin to accept the faith, which they indeed did. While he was engaged in these and other pious works, a full year after his return, having provided much instruction and a great example, with much preparation, he piously passed on, leaving for his children by a special inheritance the propagation of the faith in his estate, {{and the protection of}} the religious (i.e. [...] "members of religious orders") in that kingdom. The King and all the nobles were greatly saddened by his passing, but especially the Christians and Religious, who knew very well the virtue and religious zeal <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man.</b> This is what I heard by letters from the very Religious who administered the sacraments to him, and who had been present at his death, as well as from others."

500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E

At the public memorial service, eulogies were given by Theodore Dwight Weld and Wendell Phillips. Eight abolitionist friends, both white and black, served as his pallbearers.
