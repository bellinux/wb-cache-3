McCain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released. Such early release was prohibited by the POWs' interpretation of the military Code of Conduct which states in Article III: “I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy”.

5|$|Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge is an action-platformer that shares many {{similarities}} {{with its}} NES counterparts. The player, as Mega Man, {{is able to}} choose among four stages to complete in whatever order desired. Each stage contains various enemies to blast through and obstacles to overcome, such as leaping between disappearing blocks over deadly spikes and bottomless pits. Mega Man's primary weapon is an arm cannon that has unlimited ammunition. Destroyed enemies typically leave items that replenish Mega Man's health or extra lives. At {{the end of every}} stage is a boss battle with a robot master, and defeating it earns the player its special weapon.

5|$|The game {{progresses}} linearly {{from one}} story event to the next, usually {{presented as a}} cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide benefits to the characters. Players may also choose the <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> tackle some areas. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. Combat in Kingdom Hearts occurs in real time and involves pressing buttons to initiate attacks by the on-screen character. An action menu, {{similar to those found}} in Final Fantasy games, found at the bottom left of the screen provides other combat options such as using magic and items, although players can also assign selected magic spells that can be instantly used whilst holding the shoulder button. As players progress through the game, they can receive certain Disney characters as summons, such as Dumbo and Tinker Bell, each with their own unique abilities. There is also a context-sensitive option {{at the bottom of the}} menu, usually used for interacting with the environment or performing special attacks. This menu is manipulated by using the right analog stick or digital pad, while movement is controlled by the left analog stick, allowing the player to navigate the menu while avoiding or approaching enemies.|$|E

5|$|With demos completed, Green Day {{relocated}} to Los Angeles to continue {{work on the}} album. The group first recorded at Ocean Way Recording, then moved to Capitol Studios to complete the album. Cool brought multiple drum kits to the studio, including over seventy-five snares. Drum tracks were recorded on two-inch tape to produce a compressed sound and were transferred to Pro Tools to be digitally mixed with the other instruments. All drum tracks were produced at Ocean Way Studio B, picked for its high ceiling and acoustic tiling, which produced better sound. The songs were recorded in order as they appear on the track listing, which was a first for the trio. Each song would be recorded in its entirety before proceeding to the next. They reversed the <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> recorded guitars and bass (recording the guitars first), as they heard that was how the Beatles recorded songs.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{development}} processes of Ultimate Play the Game, which was known for its avoidance of media spotlight. Its founders, brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, were infamously taciturn both to preserve their time and to let their games speak for themselves. Though as the Sabreman series became popular, their silence contributed to the series' mystique. The main criticism of Underwurlde predecessor and the first game in the Sabreman series, Sabre Wulf, was its similarity to an earlier game by the Stamper brothers, as both were depicted in a top-down view as action-adventure games. While Retro Gamer wrote that the sequel, Underwurlde, resolved this criticism by instead using a side view as a platform game, Ultimate Play the Game also had a reputation for releasing games outside the <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were developed. Indeed, the Stamper brothers claimed to have finished their third Sabreman title, the epochal Knight Lore, in advance of both of its predecessors. The Stampers primarily developed for the ZX Spectrum home computer and outsourced the work of converting their games to work on other types of computers to external developers more familiar with the hardware architecture of other platforms. For instance, Firebird created the Commodore 64 releases of Sabre Wulf and Underwurlde. The game released alongside Knight Lore for the ZX Spectrum near the 1984 holiday season, and the Commodore 64 version released a year later.|$|E
5|$|Team Staal won {{the first}} pick in the draft, and Eric Staal chose {{longtime}} teammate Cam Ward with his first pick. With the fifth pick in the draft, Team Staal selected Daniel Sedin. His twin brother Henrik was taken with the next pick by Team Lidstrom. The All-Star Game {{marked the first time}} the two have ever played against each other in an organized game. Throughout the draft, Eric Staal selected players that had a personal connection with him. He selected his brother, Rangers defenceman Marc Staal, in the seventh round, fellow Thunder Bay native Patrick Sharp in the eighth round, and teammate Jeff Skinner in the 11th round. The last player selected was Toronto's Phil Kessel. As a reward for being the last selection, he was given a new car and $20,000 was given to the charity of his choice. Kessel stated he would put the money toward a cancer charity he became involved with in 2006 when he was battling testicular cancer. When the time came for the rookies to decide which team they would participate in the skills competition, Taylor Hall, who won the right via a puck flip, chose Team Lidstrom for his group. All players were allowed to wear the numbers they use in their respective teams. For Team Lidstrom, Henrik Sedin and Dustin Byfuglien both wore number 33, while Brad Richards and Steven Stamkos wore number 91. Team Staal had three pairs having same number: Patrick Sharp and Corey Perry with number 10, Daniel Sedin and Dan Boyle with number 22 and Paul Stastny and Patrik Elias with number 26. The complete team rosters are listed below with players appearing in the <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were chosen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Planning as satisfiability is a {{powerful}} approach to solving domain independent planning problems. In this paper, we consider a relaxed semantics for plans with parallel operator application based on ∃-step semantics. Operators can be applied in parallel if {{there is at least}} one <b>ordering</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> can be sequentially executed. Under certain conditions, we allow them to be executed simultaneously in a state s even if not all of them are applicable in s. In this case, we guarantee that they are enabled by other operators that are applied at the same time point. We formalize the semantics of parallel plans in this setting, and propose an effective translation for STRIPS problems into the propositional logic. We finally show that this relaxed semantics yields an approach to classical planning that is sometimes much more efficient than the existing SAT-based planners. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) 				 California State University, Los Angeles, 2011 Committee members: Anna Carastathis, Michael Shim, Jay Conway, Kayley VernallisFoucault, Gender, Genealogy, Normalization, Raunch Culture, The History of SexualitySome {{critics charge}} Foucault's genealogical {{critique}} with being "cryptonormative" or that genealogy has no criterion of truth and, therefore, cannot be critical. I argue that Foucault's genealogy of "sexuality" {{is a critical}} enterprise that shows how the normative practices of modern sexuality and the socio-political <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> function can have a basis, but without conceiving of that basis as necessary or natural. Foucault mounts a critique against de facto cultural practices that, despite an absence of necessary reason, operate and function under the presupposition of some such reason. My second aim is to assert that because Foucault's genealogy has the unique ability to be social critique without advancing a prescriptive normative commitment, it is not self-defeating, but a potentially more enlightening critique...|$|R

40|$|Many {{young women}} in the Catholic Church are discerning whether they are called to live <b>in</b> a {{religious}} <b>order</b> of nuns or sisters. To make this decision, these Catholic women, normally {{between the ages of}} 18 and 25, are likely to use Internet resources to learn more about <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are interested and decide if they would like to learn more about them (either in person or through other resources). The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the effectiveness of different religious orders' websites in terms of how well they present their vocational resources to young women doing this kind of research. The effectiveness of the websites has been determined by performing content analyses on what information is found in the websites and how effectively the information is presented. Through a series of operationalized questions, this study finds that, while some orders have effective online resources, many orders do not because they have failed to streamline the information presented and the way the website is formatted.
