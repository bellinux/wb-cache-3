5|$|Malaysia {{rejected}} Singapore's {{argument that}} the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory. It stated that authority in states throughout the world {{is based on a}} combination <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> people and territory, and that this applies to the Malay States as it does to any other state. Since the Johor Sultanate was established in the 16th century, it always had rulers who were recognised as such and who thus commanded people's allegiance and therefore controlled the territory where those people lived.|$|E

5|$|The palazzo {{remained}} the principal Medici residence {{until the last}} male Medici heir died in 1737.

5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun, a Turkish soldier, {{had managed}} to become {{governor}} of Egypt in 868. By using the country's immense wealth to raise an army of his own, and exploiting the instability of the central Abbasid government, over the next years he became de facto autonomous, although he continued to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Abbasid caliph—for most of his reign the powerless al-Mu'tamid—and to forward some tax revenue to the central government. Ibn Tulun's power made him a major rival to the real power behind the Abbasid throne, al-Mu'tamid's brother and regent al-Muwaffaq. The latter tried in 877 to wrest Egypt from Ibn Tulun, but the attempt failed spectacularly, and {{in the following year}} Ibn Tulun extended his area <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> Syria up to the border zone with the Byzantine Empire in the north and up to Raqqa in the western Jazira in the east, immediately adjacent to the Abbasid metropolitan province of Iraq.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{are proposing}} interpretive {{guidance}} for management regarding its evaluation <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>over</b> financial reporting. The interpretive guidance sets forth an approach by which management can conduct a top-down, risk-based evaluation <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>over</b> financial reporting. The proposed guidance {{is intended to}} assist companies of all sizes to complete their annual evaluation in an effective and efficient manner and it provides guidance {{on a number of}} areas commonly cited as concerns over the past two years. In addition, we are proposing an amendment to our rules requiring management’s annual evaluation <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>over</b> financial reporting {{to make it clear that}} an evaluation that complies with the interpretive guidance is one way to satisfy those rules. Further, we are proposing an amendment to our rules to revise the requirements regarding the auditor’s attestation report on the assessment <b>of</b> internal <b>control</b> <b>over</b> financial reporting...|$|R

5|$|Although the reaction, which {{included}} punishment, new regulations, SRM institutional reform, fewer Vietnamese serving in France, increased specialisation – were considerable, {{military and civilian}} authorities in both Vietnam and France did not believe them sufficient for the reassertion <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> their colonised troops. A further four decisions were implemented, aimed at striking the a stable racial balance among the troops in French Indochina. The number of ethnic Vietnamese soldiers was perceived to be too great and thus threatening {{in the wake of}} the mutiny. A safer proportion aimed at reducing the overall ratio among Indochina's colonial troops of 1:1 ethnic Vietnamese to European and indigenous ethnic minorities (Montagnards) was implemented. This demonstrated French distrust of Vietnamese troops and the apparent belief that the fidelity of Vietnamese soldiers was maximised by creating a racial balance within the army that was tilted towards showing all Vietnamese soldiers – and thereby the Vietnamese population at large – the futility of attempting insurrection and mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Assaf's other {{son from}} a {{different}} wife, Qa'itbay, sought to usurp power from his brothers. In the ensuing power struggle, Qa'itbay was forced to flee and received refuge in Choueifat, before relocating to Beirut; there, he accrued funds to bribe the governor of Damascus, Janbirdi al-Ghazali, to replace Hasan as the tax farmer of Keserwan. Hasan and Husayn sought to reconcile with their half-brother, but as they entered Beirut, they were killed in an ambush ordered by Qa'itbay. In his subsequent assertion <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> Keserwan, Jbeil and Beirut, Qa'itbay was backed by Janbirdi al-Ghazali, the ex-Mamluk Ottoman governor of Damascus Eyalet. Despite al-Ghazali's revolt against the Ottomans and its subsequent suppression in 1521, the authorities did not punish Qa'itbay for his alliance with al-Ghazali. However, the death of al-Ghazali represented {{the loss of a}} major political patron of the emir.|$|E
5|$|Author Edward Macan views British symphonic pop as a {{splinter}} of {{the progressive}} rock genre that relied on straightforward songwriting, rich vocal arrangements and quasi-orchestral fullness, citing Supertramp, ELO, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project, and Al Stewart as examples. By the late 1970s, the era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing had ended. Corporate artists and repertoire staff began exerting an increasing amount <b>of</b> <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the creative process that had previously belonged to the artists. Some of the major progressive bands transitioned to a more commercial sound and deemphasized the evocation of art music. By the early 1980s, the prevailing view was that the progressive rock style had ceased to exist.|$|E
