Bald eagles, <b>ospreys,</b> Canada geese, herons, and mallard ducks have visited Kettle Creek Lake. Various birds of prey have also temporarily visited the watershed. Ring-necked pheasants and ruffed grouse live in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|O'Gara {{crossed the}} 2,000-point mark for Munster against <b>Ospreys</b> in a Celtic League game on 18 September 2010. In November 2010, he {{extended}} his contract with Munster and the IRFU until 2013. He became the fourth Munster player to win 200 caps in a Celtic League game against <b>Ospreys</b> on 23 April 2011.

5|$|Altogether, Hawkins called 215 witnesses, {{including}} {{numbers from}} France, Melipilla, Australia and Wapping, who testified either that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne {{or that he}} was Arthur Orton. A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant's writing resembled Orton's but not Roger Tichborne's. The entire story of rescue by the Osprey was, Hawkins asserted, a fraud. A ship of that name had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did not correspond to the Claimant's description. Furthermore, the Claimant had provided the wrong name for <b>Ospreys</b> captain, and the names he gave for two of <b>Ospreys</b> crew were found to belong {{to members of the}} crew of the Middleton, the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart. No mention of a rescue had been found in <b>Ospreys</b> log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster's records. Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet, Gosford revealed that it contained information regarding the disposition of certain properties, but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty's seduction or pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The University of North Florida has six {{areas of}} on-campus housing, {{three of which}} offer similar, suite/efficiency-like rooms: The <b>Osprey</b> Crossings, <b>Osprey</b> Landing, and <b>Osprey</b> Cove; each of these are {{designed}} for triple occupancy and currently house two to three residents, with some accommodating individual rooms for disabled students. Additionally, <b>Osprey</b> Hall offers more of a traditional, dorm-like environment with double occupancy along with communal bathrooms and showers. <b>Osprey</b> Village offers an apartment-like feel with either double or quadruple occupancy. <b>Osprey</b> Hall, The Crossings, <b>Osprey</b> Landing, and <b>Osprey</b> Cove are designated for freshmen although upperclassmen live there as well, while <b>Osprey</b> Village is an upperclassmen residence.|$|R
50|$|<b>Osprey's</b> {{current status}} is uncertain. While Quebecor's main website {{continues}} to identify <b>Osprey</b> {{as a separate}} subsidiary from Sun Media, most of the former <b>Osprey</b> newspapers' individual websites now indicate ownership by Sun Media, containing no references to <b>Osprey</b> at all, while Sun Media's website indicates direct ownership of <b>Osprey's</b> daily newspapers but {{makes no mention of}} the community weeklies.|$|R

5|$|Many {{populations of}} moorland birds, {{including}} {{the black and}} red grouse live here, and the country has internationally significant nesting grounds for seabirds such as the northern gannet. The golden eagle has become a national icon, and white-tailed eagles and <b>ospreys</b> have recently re-colonised the land. The Scottish crossbill is the only endemic vertebrate species in the UK.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to bald eagles, which {{live in the}} IBA year round and have successfully established a breeding population there, the IBA is home to belted kingfishers, scarlet tanagers, black-throated blue warblers, common mergansers, blue and green heron, hermit thrushes, and wood ducks. Large numbers of <b>ospreys</b> use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods. The woodlands are inhabited by the ruffed grouse, Pennsylvania's state bird, and wild turkeys. Swainson's thrush breeds in the IBA and the northern harrier breeds and overwinters in Pine Creek Gorge.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 2013, the U.S. DoD {{awarded a}} $4.9 billion {{contract}} to Bell and Boeing for 99 V-22s in production Lots 17 and 18, including 92 MV-22s for the Marine Corps. Work {{is expected to}} be completed in September 2019. A provision gives NAVAIR the option to order 23 more <b>Ospreys.</b> The combined cost of the June 2013 contract and other associated contracts for the order totaled $6.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Osprey</b> <b>Osprey</b> 2, {{also known}} as the Pereira <b>Osprey</b> 2 after its designer, is an amphibious sport {{aircraft}} designed for homebuilding. Plans have been sold since the mid-1970s. George Pereira designed the <b>Osprey</b> 2 to address the two most frequent criticisms of his <b>Osprey</b> I aircraft: its lack of a passenger seat and its inability to operate from dry land. An exercise that began as a series of modifications to the original design in January 1972 eventually turned into a complete redesign of the aircraft, with the resulting <b>Osprey</b> 2 flying in April 1973.|$|R

5|$|The Indian Aviation Research Centre (ARC) is {{interested}} in acquiring four V-22 <b>Ospreys</b> for personnel evacuation in hostile conditions, logistic supplies, and deployment of the Special Frontier Force (SFF) in border areas. India had seen the Osprey perform in relief operations of the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Elements of the Indian Navy have also looked at the V-22 rather than the E-2D for Airborne early warning and control to replace the short-range Kamov Ka-31. India {{is interested}} in purchasing six attack version V-22s for rapid troop insertion in border areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} birds to {{navigate}} during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, {{even with the}} help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as <b>ospreys</b> and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} old-growth forests with tree species and genera such as black oak, hickory, beech, cherry birch, sweetgum, red maple, and tuliptree. The forests also contain owls, bats, chipmunks, groundhogs, gypsy moths, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, coyotes. In addition, over 130 species of {{butterflies}} {{can be found}} in the park. In 1937, it was noted that the marshlands had fauna such as red-winged blackbirds, yellowthroats, green bottle flies, beetles, dragonflies, tadpoles, herons, kingfishers, and <b>ospreys.</b> Its flora included cattail, skunk cabbage, and moss.|$|E

5|$|Although {{football}} {{has traditionally}} been the more popular sport in north Wales, rugby union {{is seen as a}} symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup, hosting the tournament in 1999. The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues, Dragons, <b>Ospreys</b> and Scarlets. The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14, the Anglo-Welsh Cup, the European Rugby Champions Cup and the European Rugby Challenge Cup.|$|E
5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so that there are now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as <b>ospreys,</b> hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|Despite never {{playing the}} sport professionally, Hunt made his rugby union debut for the French Barbarians in Brussels, Belgium on 14 November 2009. He would be {{selected}} {{at the outside}} center position in the Barbarians' 39-26 victory. Hunt made his debut for Biarritz on 21 November 2009 against Clermont. While competing in the Top 14 for Biarritz the team also competed in the 2009–10 Heineken Cup. After topping their group Biarritz would record victories over Welsh team <b>Ospreys</b> and Irish team Munster to reach the 2010 Heineken Cup Final. Hunt would score the only try in the final held at Stade de France in front of 78,962 fans. This {{would be his last}} game for Biarritz on 22 May 2010 in the team's 21-19 loss.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as boobies, {{particularly}} the red-footed booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls and even <b>ospreys</b> of their catch, using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents. They may either assail their targets {{after they have}} caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food. Although frigatebirds are renowned for their kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour, kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of}} the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, three MV-22Bs {{were placed}} on alert at Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait to be ready within 30 minutes to recover downed pilots during the Military {{intervention}} against ISIL. On 29 occasions between 1 November and 24 April 2015, two <b>Ospreys</b> and a KC-130J aerial tanker assigned to this Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP) mission spent 145 flight hours loitering, ready to perform rescue missions if required. The only pilot that was downed was a Jordanian, {{but he did not}} have a radio on him when he ejected and landed too close to ISIL forces.|$|E
5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as <b>ospreys,</b> hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E

5|$|Normally, Furious {{could carry}} only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this {{commonly}} meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of spotters (Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison), one spotter reconnaissance (Fairey IIID) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart). In 1935 {{there was one}} squadron of fighters with Hawker Nimrods and Hawker <b>Ospreys,</b> one squadron of Blackburn Baffin torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.|$|E
5|$|Painted turtles {{are most}} {{vulnerable}} to predators when young. Nests are frequently ransacked and the eggs eaten by garter snakes, crows, chipmunks, thirteen-lined ground and gray squirrels, skunks, groundhogs, raccoons, badgers, gray and red fox, and humans. The small and sometimes bite-size, numerous hatchlings fall prey to water bugs, bass, catfish, bullfrogs, snapping turtles, three types of snakes (copperheads, racers and water snakes), herons, rice rats, weasels, muskrats, minks, and raccoons. As adults, the turtles' armored shells protect them from many potential predators, but they still occasionally fall prey to alligators, <b>ospreys,</b> crows, red-shouldered hawks, bald eagles, and especially raccoons.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. <b>Ospreys</b> build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
