40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a project}} in which the possibility of receiving signals from another civilization in our galaxy is being studied. The main question is in what electromagnetic frequency band should the search for such signals be conducted. Possible bands are {{discussed in terms of}} quantum costs and attainable signal-to-noise ratios. Of particular interest is the 'water hole', the range of frequencies from 1. 420 to 1. 662 GHz, with fundamental frequency in the Galaxy being the hydrogen line at 1. 420 GHz. A plan for searching this band is described, in which the contemplated system would have a capability of detecting a 1000 -Megawatt <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>beacon</b> at a distance of 10, 000 light years...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} {{design for a}} distributed system of very simple robots capable of performing a useful real-world mission such as mapping {{the interior of a}} building overnight with a swarm of possibly hundreds of cockroach-sized robots. Presentation of this system concept follows an initial discussion of strategies for developing distributed robotic systems. Success is dependent on making good decisions in selecting appropriate applications, in system design, and in executing the system development process. Each robot includes basic mobility, crude odometry, contact or near-contact object/obstacle detection sensors, an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>beacon</b> (probably IR), and a beacon detection sensor that can simultaneously detect multiple beacons on other robots and measure the bearing of each to less than one degree. Beacon triangulation (combined with knowledge of some baseline distance) allows the determination of the position of any robot (and any object next to it) relative to the others. Occlusion of a robot's beacon indicates the presence of an intervening object, while lack of occlusion identifies a “ray ” of free space. Clever deployment of large numbers of robots will permit mapping of walls and objects, and can also support the detection and localization of intruders moving within the space. The object sensor can be very short range and, therefore, hopefully very simple and cheap, perhaps implemented as an array of whiskers. The beacon sensor is more complex, but it can be completely tuned to the detection of the cooperating beacon. Thus, the robots need tackle no perception task...|$|E
50|$|While many single beacons use {{rotating}} lamps or mirrors, {{others use}} strobe lights under a translucent dome {{to provide an}} omnidirectional flash. Some smaller and low-cost beacons of the latter type, however, are simply a blinking incandescent bulb. LEDs are also used to light some <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{lack of a}} VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> range (VOR) <b>beacon</b> at {{the airport}} poses an issue, as few {{aircraft}} have appropriate GPS systems to enable non-precision instrument approaches in bad weather.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} planar homing guidance for a vehicle traveling to a beacon with unknown location and using a measurement of binary range-rate. The funda-mental nature of binary range-rate is studied, and a guidance law requiring only this measurement is presented. Another guidance law utilizing both binary range-rate and heading angle is also presented, and stability is addressed. This guidance law consists of separated control and observation, {{and it does not}} require finding the closest points of approach for multiple headings. This guidance law’s response to measurement corrup-tion and observer gain is studied. Characteristics of good initial estimates are given, and an exploration method is presented that provides good initial estimates and leads to improved response. This approach provides a method of low-cost, autonomous homing guidance that utilizes a single, omnidirectional receiver to guide a vehicle to a single, <b>omnidirectional</b> transmitting <b>beacon.</b> [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4028527]...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{homing guidance}} for a vehicle {{with a single}} omnidirectional receiver traveling to a stationary, <b>omnidirectional</b> transmitting <b>beacon</b> by using spatially quantized signal strength measurements. Two homing strategies are presented, and simulations are performed for cases with signal noise and vehicle turn rate limits. The first strategy is the Oyler strategy, which adapts a sliding mode controller and observer from the previous work. The second strategy is based on constant heading changes (CHCs) each time a range increment is detected, and this strategy is shown to be sufficient for homing. This study also discusses a signal filter designed to improve the homing controllers' performance. Performance metrics are developed for strategy evaluation and parameter optimization. The performance of each guidance strategy is shown through simulations {{for a variety of}} conditions. The Oyler strategy guides the vehicle to the beacon more efficiently than the constant heading change strategy, but it comes with a slight penalty in success rate...|$|R
50|$|A VORTAC is a {{navigational aid}} for {{aircraft}} pilots {{consisting of a}} co-located VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> range (VOR) <b>beacon</b> and a tactical air navigation system (TACAN) beacon. Both types of beacons provide pilots azimuth information, but the VOR system is generally used by civil aircraft and the TACAN system by military aircraft. However, the TACAN distance measuring equipment is also used for civil purposes because civil DME equipment is built to match the military DME specifications. Most VOR installations in the United States are VORTACs. The system was designed and developed by Cardion Corp. (RDT&E contract was awarded 28 December 1981).|$|R
