25|$|The {{regulatory}} mechanism in the United States, a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), prescribes {{the maximum amount}} of a pollutant (including nutrients) that a body of water can receive while still meeting U.S. Clean Water Act water quality standards.

TMDL reports identify pollutant levels and strategies to accomplish pollutant reduction goals.
