40|$|SummaryOperating rule curves {{have been}} widely applied to {{reservoir}} operation, due to their ease of implementation. However, these curves excluding ecological requirement are generally derived from observed or synthetic flows and have rarely been determined by future flows under climate change. This paper develops an integrated adaptive optimization model (IAOM) for derivation of multipurpose reservoir operating rule curves including ecological <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> <b>curve</b> under future climate change. Steps in the proposed IAOM include: (1) weather generator module to generate feasible future climate conditions, (2) VIC model as the hydrological simulation module to generate streamflows from those future weather conditions, and (3) multipurpose reservoir optimization module to determine the optimal reservoir operations to deal with climate change. China’s Danjiangkou reservoir in Han River basin is selected for a case study. The results demonstrate that the IAOM provides optimal multipurpose reservoir operating rule curves that reflect the hydrologic characteristics of future climate change. Ecological supply water operation will alleviate negative effect of dam on river ecosystem without reducing conservation benefits and flood control standard. Therefore, they can consult with reservoir administrators if it is useful results for operations...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} multi-objective {{differential}} evolution (MODE) approach is {{proposed for the}} simultaneous evolution of optimal cropping pattern and operation policies for a multi-crop irrigation reservoir system. In general, farming community wants to maximize total net benefits by irrigating high economic value crops over larger area, which may also include water-intensive crops and longer duration crops. This poses a serious problem under water-scarce conditions and often results in crop failure. Under varying hydrological conditions, the fixed cropping pattern with conventional <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> <b>curve</b> policies may not yield economically good results. To provide flexible policies, a nonlinear multi-objective optimization model is formulated. To achieve robust performance by handling interdependent relationships among the decision variables of the model, the recent MODE technique is adopted to solve the multi-objective problem. The developed model is applied for ten-daily reservoir operation to {{a case study in}} India. The model results suggest that changes in the hydrologic conditions over a season have considerable impact on the cropping pattern and net benefits from the irrigation system. Towards this purpose, the proposed MODE model can be used to evolve different strategies for irrigation planning and reservoir operation policies, and to select the best possible solution appropriate to the forecasted hydrologic condition...|$|E

40|$|Riverine {{ecosystem}} protection {{requires the}} maintenance of natural flow and sediment regimes downstream from dams. In reservoir management schedules this requirement should be integrated with sedimentation control and human water supply. However, traditional eco-friendly reservoir operating methods have usually only considered the natural flow regime. This paper seeks to develop a reservoir operating method that accounts for both the natural flow and sediment regimes as well as optimizing the water supply allocations. Herein, reservoir water level (RWL), sediment-occupied ratio of reservoir volume (SOR) and rate of change of SOR (RCSOR) are adopted as three triggers of a drawdown-flushing-based sediment management policy. Two different groups of reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> (RORCs) are designed for sediment-flushing and non-sediment-flushing years, and the three triggers, RWL, SOR and RCSOR, are used to change the “static” RORCs to “dynamic” ones.

40|$|Sustainable water {{resource}} developments require reservoir operations that provide environmental flows (e-flows) {{to support the}} downstream riverine ecosystem by minimizing the degree of hydrologic alteration under given water supply constraints. The effective management of e-flows below dams was explored by combining three e-flow management strategies for “normal,” wet, and dry year situations, delivering a range of e-flow regimes for different reservoir storage levels and different natural flow (reservoir inflow) conditions. We combined these into a single combined e-flow strategy and coupled this with reservoir <b>operating</b> <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> to form a reservoir operating approach that optimized e-flow provision under given water supply constraints. We also explored constraints imposed by the dam's valve release capacity. To investigate the capability of the approach to minimize the degree of hydrologic alteration downstream from a reservoir, we presented {{a case study of}} the Tanghe Reservoir in China's Tang river basin. The approach triggered a preferred e-flow strategy when the reservoir water level was high to better maintain the ecological functions within downstream riverine ecosystems, a basic e-flow strategy when the water level was low to reduce the water supply risk, and an acceptable strategy under intermediate conditions. The approach effectively balanced human and ecosystem needs and demonstrated the minimum levels of flow regime alteration achievable within the regulated river...|$|R

Accurately modeling the human component and its interaction with the natural environment is key to characterize the real system dynamics and anticipate future potential changes to the hydrological regimes. Modern distributed, physically-based hydrological models are able to describe hydrological processes with high level of detail and high spatiotemporal resolution. Yet, they lack in sophistication for the behavior component and human decisions are usually described by very simplistic rules, which might underperform in reproducing the catchment dynamics. In the case of water reservoir operators, these simplistic rules usually consist of target-level <b>rule</b> <b>curves,</b> which represent the average historical level trajectory. Whilst these rules can reasonably reproduce the average seasonal water volume shifts due to the reservoirs’ operation, they cannot properly represent peculiar conditions, which influence the actual reservoirs’ operation, e. g., variations in energy price or water demand, dry or wet meteorological conditions. Moreover, target-level <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> are not suitable to explore the water system response to climate and socio economic changing contexts, because they assume a business-as-usual operation. In this work, we quantitatively assess how the inclusion of adaptive reservoirs’ <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> into physicallybased hydrological models contribute to the proper representation of the hydrological regime at the catchment scale. In particular, we contrast target-level <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> and detailed optimization-based behavioral models.

A general approach was used to produce the 'optimum' <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> for an urban water supply system. Melbourne water supply system is considered as the case study. An objective methodology and computer software (namely Restrictions and Targets) were developed to derive the <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> in terms of restriction rules and target storage <b>curves.</b> The restriction <b>rules</b> were derived using a direct search method known as the Hookes and Jeeves method. The objective function used was the maximisation of releases to demand zones. The constraints of current security criteria were considered. A lumped single reservoir and single demand centre approach was used in the study, however, the effects of multi-reservoir interactions such as reservoir evaporation losses, spills from the system, effect of carrier capacity on releases and demand shortfalls were considered implicitly in the approach. The target storage curves were derived using Discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDDP), with the objective function of maximisation of releases to demand zones. REALM system data of the Melbourne system was used and therefore all system details incorporated in a planning study of the system were included in DDDP. Water allocation among various parts of the water supply system was done through network linear programming (NLP). REALM is used by Melbourne Water in their planning studies. The Restrictions and Targets software were developed for the Melbourne water system in this study. Both Restrictions and Targets software were used for the Melbourne system using system, streamflow and demand data provided by Melbourne Water (MW) in early 1994. The restriction rules and target storage curves were derived for both static and dynamic demands. The behaviour of the Melbourne system was analysed under the derived and current MW rules using a REALM simulation model of system for the planning period of 1994 to 2026, and a comparison study was performed. The restriction rules derived under both static and dynamic demand analysis performed better than the current MW restriction rules. It was also found that the restriction rules derived from the static demand analysis were consistently better than those of the dynamic demand analysis while the target storage curves derived from DDDP slightly under-performed the MW current target storage curves. Finally, the target curves derived were fine-tuned using simulation results and expert knowledge, and the system behaviour improved significantly. It is recommended that the <b>operating</b> <b>rules</b> (both restriction <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> and target storage curves) derived from the static demand analysis be used for the Melbourne system for long term operation as Melbourne system cannot be augmented by constructing reservoirs in the MW catchments due to lack of suitable hydrologic sites...|$|R

The {{demand for}} {{electricity}} in Java and Bali, Indonesia increases {{an average of}} 14 % per year. This condition forces the electrical authority in Indonesia to consider various generation alternatives, including hydroelectric power, to meet the growing demand. One alternative is improving reservoir operations of existing hydro power systems so that improved production can be achieved. [...] One such hydropower system considered in this thesis is the series of three hydroelectric stations, Saguling, Cirata and Jatiluhur, on the Citarum river, West Java. At present these three hydropower plants are operated by different authorities. They developed the current reservoir operation guideline (CROG) based on consensus. An average of assumed "normal” years of historical flows are used to obtain the current <b>rule</b> <b>curve.</b> The estimation of annual energy generated is then obtained based on the series of twelve monthly flows of {{the average of the}} assumed "normal" year flows. [...] In this study a simulation of reservoir operations was performed using synthetic inflows into the reservoirs. The synthetic flows were generated by a stochastic model that on average preserved the statistical characteristics of both historical annual and monthly flows. An auto-regressive moving average model was used to model the annual flows, and the Method of Fragments and the Two-Tier method were examined to model the monthly flows. [...] Two <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> were applied in the simulation of reservoir operations. These were the CROG <b>rule</b> <b>curve</b> and the water resources development guideline (WRDG) <b>rule</b> <b>curve</b> proposed by the Water Resources Development project. Two other limiting <b>rule</b> <b>curves</b> were also examined, one assuming that the reservoirs are kept empty, and the other assuming that the reservoirs are kept full. The operation of the system was simulated using both historical and synthetic inflow sequences, as well as the different <b>rule</b> <b>curves,</b> to evaluate the performance of the system. [...] The results showed that the preferred stochastic model for the annual flows was an ARMA (2, 0) model, and for the monthly flows, the Two-Tier model. The CROG <b>rule</b> <b>curve</b> was more suitable for the system than that based on the WRDG <b>rule</b> <b>curve.</b> From the reservoir operation simulation it was found that on average the available water in the Citarum River was smaller than the installed capacity of the Saguling, Cirata and Jatiluhur plants. The results of the simulation using synthetic flows could give more comprehensive analysis than using only historical flows...|$|R
