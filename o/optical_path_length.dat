25|$|In {{order to}} change the output wave frequencies, one can change the pump {{frequency}} or the phasematching properties of the nonlinear optical crystal. This latter is accomplished by changing its temperature or orientation or quasi-phasematching period (see below). For fine-tuning one can also change the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> of the resonator. In addition, the resonator may contain elements to suppress mode-hops of the resonating wave. This often requires active control of some element of the OPO system.|$|E

Optical elements such as lenses placed in the cavity alter the stability and mode size. In addition, for most gain media, thermal and other inhomogeneities create a variable lensing effect in the medium, which {{must be considered in}} the design of the laser resonator.|$|E

40|$|A Monte Carlo {{model of}} the {{ultrasonic}} modulation of multiply scattered coherent light in scattering media is provided. The model is based on two mechanisms: the ultrasonic modulation of the index of refraction, which causes a modulation of the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> between consecutive scattering events, and the ultrasonic modulation of the displacements of scatterers, which causes a modulation of <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> with each scattering event. Multiply scattered light accumulates modulated <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> along its <b>path.</b> Consequently, {{the intensity of the}} speckles that are formed by the multiply scattered light is modulated. The contribution from the index of refraction is comparable with the contribution from displacement when the acoustic-wave vector is less than a critical fraction of the transport mean free path and becomes increasingly greater than the contribution from displacement beyond this critical point. This Monte Carlo model agrees well with an independent analytical model for isotropically scattering media. Both mechanisms are coherent phenomena, requiring the use of a coherent light source...|$|R
40|$|Volume {{scattering}} is {{an important}} effect in different fields, ranging from biology to lighting. Models for volume scattering usually rely on parameters that are estimated with inverse methods that iteratively fit simulations to experimental data. To obtain accurate estimates for these parameters, the scattered intensity distribution {{can be used in}} such fitting methods. However, {{it has been shown that}} for samples with long <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> this type of data may result in poor parameter estimates. In this work, an inverse procedure is proposed that fits to scattered radiance distributions. By taking advantage of current generation graphics processing units, the method implemented is sufficiently efficient to allow performing an in-depth simulation study on the difference between using radiance or intensity distributions to estimate the volume scattering parameters of samples. This work shows that for samples with moderate <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths,</b> the intensity distribution contains sufficient information to accurately estimate the volume scattering properties. However, for longer <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths,</b> the descriptive power of the intensity distribution is not enough and radiance distribution based methods, such as the inverse method proposed, are better suited. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|OCT {{delivers}} {{high resolution}} {{because it is}} based on light, rather than sound or radio frequency. An optical beam is directed at the tissue, and a small portion of this light that reflects from sub-surface features is collected. Note that most light is not reflected but, rather, scatters off at large angles. In conventional imaging, this diffusely scattered light contributes background that obscures an image. However, in OCT, a technique called interferometry is used to record the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> of received photons allowing rejection of most photons that scatter multiple times before detection. Thus OCT can build up clear 3D images of thick samples by rejecting background signal while collecting light directly reflected from surfaces of interest.|$|E
25|$|Snell's law can {{be derived}} from Fermat's principle, which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time. By taking the {{derivative}} of the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length,</b> the stationary point is found giving the path taken by the light (though {{it should be noted that}} the result does not show light taking the least time path, but rather one that is stationary with respect to small variations as there are cases where light actually takes the greatest time path, as in a spherical mirror). In a classic analogy, the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach, the area of higher refractive index by the sea, and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach to get to a drowning person in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell's law.|$|E
500|$|Interferometers {{are widely}} used in science and {{industry}} for the measurement of small displacements, refractive index changes and surface irregularities. [...] In an interferometer, light from a single source is split into two beams that travel different optical paths, then combined again to produce interference. [...] The resulting interference fringes give information about the difference in <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length.</b> [...] In analytical science, interferometers are used to measure lengths and the shape of optical components with nanometer precision; they are the highest precision length measuring instruments existing. [...] In Fourier transform spectroscopy {{they are used to}} analyze light containing features of absorption or emission associated with a substance or mixture. [...] An astronomical interferometer consists of two or more separate telescopes that combine their signals, offering a resolution equivalent to that of a telescope of diameter equal to the largest separation between its individual elements.|$|E
30|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> of {{the rays}} through are {{different}} {{depending on the}} angles between the rays and surface of PiGs; therefore, blue rays that pass through {{the edge of an}} LED device have longer <b>path</b> <b>length</b> and experience higher absorption that leads to higher intensity of yellow light than do rays that pass through in the perpendicular direction. As a result, white light rays from one LED chip are close to white at the center, but increasingly yellowish toward the periphery; the result is the ‘yellow-ring effect’ [8, 9]. This can be reduced with adjusted shape of color converting elements and LED package structure [10 – 13]. Diffuser layers were used to diffuse blue rays so that <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> in all direction become similar. This adverse effect was alleviated in polymer-based white LEDs by using light diffuser layer coating [14 – 16].|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE To {{estimate}} refractive indices {{used by the}} Lenstar biometer {{to translate}} measured <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> into geometrical <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> within the eye. METHODS Axial lengths of model eyes were determined using the IOLMaster and Lenstar biometers; comparing those lengths gave an overall eye refractive index estimate for the Lenstar. Using the Lenstar Graphical User Interface, we noticed that boundaries between media could be manipulated and opposite changes in <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths</b> {{on either side of}} the boundary could be introduced. Those ratios were combined with the overall eye refractive index to estimate separate refractive indices. Furthermore, Haag-Streit provided us with a template to obtain 'air thicknesses' to compare with geometrical distances. RESULTS The axial length estimates obtained using the IOLMaster and the Lenstar agreed to within 0. 01 mm. Estimates of group refractive indices used in the Lenstar were 1. 340, 1. 341, 1. 415, and 1. 354 for cornea, aqueous, lens, and overall eye, respectively. Those refractive indices did not match those of schematic eyes, but were close in the cases of aqueous and lens. Linear equations relating air thicknesses to geometrical thicknesses were consistent with our findings. CONCLUSION The Lenstar uses different refractive indices for different ocular media. Some of the refractive indices, such as that for the cornea, are not physiological; therefore, it is likely that the calibrations in the instrument correspond to instrument-specific corrections and are not the real <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>lengths...</b>|$|R

500|$|The Mach–Zehnder {{interferometer}} is a {{more versatile}} instrument than the Michelson interferometer. Each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once, and the fringes can be adjusted {{so that they are}} localized in any desired plane. Typically, the fringes would be adjusted to lie in the same plane as the test object, so that fringes and test object can be photographed together. If it is decided to produce fringes in white light, then, since white light has a limited coherence length, on the order of micrometers, great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible. [...] As illustrated in Fig.6, a compensating cell would be placed {{in the path of the}} reference beam to match the test cell. Note also the precise orientation of the beam splitters. The reflecting surfaces of the beam splitters would be oriented so that the test and reference beams pass through an equal amount of glass. In this orientation, the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections, resulting in the same number of phase inversions. The result is that light traveling an equal <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference.|$|E
