5|$|To {{record the}} album, Jackson {{suggested}} a small studio located <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. in Silver Spring, Maryland. The sessions {{took place in}} September and October 1973 at Silver Spring's D Sound Studios. According to Scott-Heron, the studio's main room was so small that when the two musicians recorded, Jackson was forced out next to the cooler, playing flute in the studio's hallway while Scott-Heron sang in the main room. However, Scott-Heron felt comfortable in the small studio. Jose Williams was enlisted as the recording engineer for the album. Williams assisted Scott-Heron and Jackson, who were credited for production under the title Perpis-Fall Music, Inc., with production, and he engineered the album's recordings entirely himself.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, President Madison and Secretary Jones {{returned}} to Washington, but by August 27 British naval forces {{under the command}} of Captain James Gordon advanced on the capital a second time, making their approach by way of the Potomac River with two frigates and a number of smaller vessels reaching Fort Washington, twelve miles down river from the capital. The fort was abandoned when fired upon; the American forces retreated to Alexandria, five miles up river, just seven miles <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington.</b> On August 29, Gordon advanced on and captured this town and port, seizing supplies which were then loaded aboard the invading vessels. Upon receiving orders to join Admiral Cockburn's squadron to the south, Gordon's flotilla sailed down river but was delayed due to adverse winds near Fort Washington. Fearing the British had further designs on the capital, Secretary Jones again began preparing defensive forces. On August 29, he sent Rodgers orders to proceed to Bladensburg from Baltimore with 650 seamen and marines. The day before, Rodgers had ordered Porter to Washington; Porter's 100 sailors and a handful of officers arrived on August 30 with the purpose of guarding the capital. The next day Rodgers and Porter together arrived at Bladensburg where Rodgers met with Secretary Jones. As the American forces were regrouped and in strong defensive positions, the British decided to withdraw. The American forces commanded by Porter and Perry began harassing the retreating British while Rodgers was attacking the British fleet with fireships. Rodgers had previously improvised his fireships at the Washington Navy Yard. On September 3, he proceeded down the Potomac in a Gig closely followed by his fireships and barges, the latter being manned with 60 marines armed with muskets and swords. When they reached Alexandria, Rodgers entered the abandoned town and ordered the American flag hoisted.|$|E
25|$|After the leporids, {{the next}} most {{significant}} group in the diet of golden eagles is the ground squirrels. They comprise about 11.2% of the prey taken by this species across the range. In areas where leporids are scarce, this group of rodents seems to become more prominent. In {{many parts of the}} golden eagle's range, ground squirrels are rare or absent, such as the British Isles, the Iberian Peninsula and some portions of central Eurasia. Nonetheless, all of the large Spermophilus group, all species of prairie dog, all four species of antelope squirrel and all the species of marmot has been found as golden eagle prey. Nests in Denali National Park in Alaska included, among a sampling of 690 remains, contained 84.2% Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii). Studies in Alaska have shown that the other major prey species in Alaska, the willow ptarmigan and the snowshoe hare, follow an 8 to 11 year population cycle. The locally abundant ground squirrels have less dramatic population variations and come out of hibernation in mid to late May (shortly after the eagles return from migration). The Alaskan Arctic ground squirrel appears to be eaten supplementally in peak years but then fill the primary niche when the ptarmigan and hare populations crash. In Alberta, Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus) (occasionally supplemented by other species like yellow-bellied marmots) were the primary prey species, making up 84% of the diet of eagles nesting there. In the French Alps, the most significant prey species is the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) at 68.9% out of a sampling of 198 from 6 nests. This is also the main prey species in the Italian Alps above the tree line, comprising 49.7% of a sample size of 79 from 12 nests. In the Caspian Sea area of Kazakhstan, yellow ground squirrels (Spermophilus fulvus) are the most important mammalian prey at 23.4% of a sampling of 468 from 36 nests. Along Coastal California, California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) replace black-tailed jackrabbits (which are scarce there) as the primary prey species. In Washington state, where the golden eagle inhabits mainly forest openings made by humans, the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) is the main prey species, making up 41.8% of a sampling of 47 from 2 nests and 40.3% of a sampling of 315 from 74 nests. In many other areas, ground squirrels are secondary prey, usually ranking after lagomorphs in dietary significance. This is especially true in the contiguous Western United States <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> state and coastal California where they often register as second, third or even fourth most represented family by remains. Prairie dogs feature only as supplemental prey for breeding golden eagles but wintering eagles reportedly prey heavily on colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Although rare, tree squirrels have turned up as prey in some eagle nests in both North America and Eurasia.|$|E

500|$|Winds {{across the}} rest of the state were moderate, gusting to around [...] at Slidell on the northeastern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, so damage <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> Parish was sporadic. Throughout the state, at least 40,000 {{electric}} customers lost power. Located southwest of the storm's core, New Orleans escaped with little damage and relatively benign weather conditions; still, the hurricane triggered minor flooding and brought down tree limbs around the city. Levees along the shores of Lake Pontchartrain were able to contain the lake's large waves, despite initial fears to the contrary. Still, the adverse conditions forced the temporary closure of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. The storm led to the deaths of two individuals in the state: one due to a drowning in St. Tammany Parish and another in a traffic accident attributed to the weather. Insured and uninsured damages were worth near $17 million combined, with an additional $500,000 in agricultural losses.|$|E
