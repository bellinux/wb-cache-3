5|$|Anne Wales Abbot was {{believed}} to be the designer of the Ives' game, The Mansion of Happines for over 145 years, from 1843 to 1989. She, however, did not design Ives The Mansion <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> but did design two other Ives' games: Dr. Busby and Master Rodbury and His Pupils.|$|E
5|$|W. & S. B. Ives {{published}} {{the game in}} the United States in Salem, Massachusetts on November 24, 1843. It was republished by Parker Brothers in 1894 after George S. Parker & Co. bought the rights to the Ives games. The republication claimed The Mansion <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> was the first board game published in the United States of America; today, however, the distinction is awarded to Lockwood's Traveller's Tour games of 1822. The popularity of The Mansion <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> and similar moralistic board games was challenged in the last decades of the 19th century when the focus of games became materialistic and competitive capitalistic behavior.|$|E

5|$|William and Stephen Bradshaw Ives {{dissolved}} their partnership on April 24, 1854. William {{then put}} {{most of his}} time managing his newspaper, The Salem Observer. Stephen Bradshaw held the copyrights for the games and started a fancy goods importing business in Boston while overseeing the Salem business owned by a partnership of his youngest son, Henry P. Ives, and Henry's partner, Augustus Smith at the same business location. A new Mansion <b>Of</b> <b>Happiness</b> print run was needed but Chandler was no longer in business, With control of the copyright, the Ives family chose lithographer F.F. Oakleys. Consequently, Ives and Smith could sell The Mansion <b>Of</b> <b>Happiness</b> in Salem but had no right to the copyright. F. F. Oakleys needed to two new litho stones so the eighth edition was created. One stone was used to print black and the other to print green. The circle endspace was retained.

5|$|In 1895, the New York game firm of McLoughlin Brothers {{printed and}} {{published}} {{another version of}} The Mansion <b>of</b> <b>Happiness.</b> The McLoughlin version used even better artwork than the Parker Brothers version which makes it more valuable to collectors.

5|$|In 1926, Parker Brothers Inc. republished The Mansion <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> in its {{original}} form, with minor modification to game spaces. The game included the circular end space introduced by J. Bufford in the third edition. This sixth edition used a folding game board with a fabric and cardboard pocket on the back edge of the game board. The teetotum was made using a wood dowel and cardboard hexagon.|$|E
5|$|In a {{twist on}} The Mansion <b>of</b> <b>Happiness,</b> McLoughlin Brothers and Parker Brothers {{released}} several {{games in the}} late 1880s based on the then-popular Algeresque rags to riches theme. Games such as Game of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded, Messenger Boy, Game of the Telegraph Boy, and The Office Boy allowed players to emulate the successful capitalist. Players began these games as company underlings, newbies, or gofers, and, with luck, won {{the game with a}} seat in the President's Office (rather than a seat in Heaven, as in The Mansion <b>of</b> <b>Happiness)</b> or as Head of the Firm. In Parker Brothers' The Office Boy, spaces designating carelessness, inattentiveness, and dishonesty sent the player back on the track while spaces designating capability, earnestness, and honesty advanced him toward the goal. Such games reflected the belief that the enterprising American– regardless of his background, humble or privileged– would be rewarded under the American capitalist system, and insinuated that success was equated with increased social status via the accumulation of wealth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The primary aim of {{the current}} study was to {{replicate}} and extend previous findings by examining the relationship between trait meta-mood and levels <b>of</b> subjective <b>happiness</b> in a 7 -week follow-up study. Participants were 192 undergraduate students (155 females) who completed self-report measures of trait meta-mood and subjective happiness. After 7 weeks, 155 students completed the subjective happiness scale again. Focusing first on cross-sectional analysis, meta-mood dimensions were found to be moderately related to levels <b>of</b> subjective <b>happiness.</b> Next, along with initial levels <b>of</b> subjective <b>happiness,</b> we found that meta-mood dimensions independently predicted prospective levels <b>of</b> subjective <b>happiness</b> over a 7 -week follow-up. These findings provide some preliminary evidence on the prospective value of meta-mood dimensions as relevant individual differences involved in the maintenance of emotional well-being indicators...|$|R
5|$|The Mansion <b>of</b> <b>Happiness</b> was {{considered}} the first mass-produced board game in the United States for almost 100 years. In 1886, George S.
