5|$|Abdomen: Cerci are unsegmented and {{resemble}} forceps. The <b>ovipositor</b> {{in females}} is reduced or absent.|$|E
5|$|Among insects, the stinger of {{the female}} honey bee is a {{modified}} <b>ovipositor,</b> homologous with ovipositors in other insects such as the Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and those Hymenoptera without stingers.|$|E
5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with the tip of her abdomen and then inserts her <b>ovipositor</b> into the substrate and lays an egg.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species have}} vestigial <b>ovipositors,</b> whereas others have <b>ovipositors</b> {{similar to those}} of the Acrididae, suited to {{depositing}} the eggs in sandy soil.|$|R
5000|$|Females {{often have}} long <b>ovipositors,</b> an organ that largely varies interspecifically. This {{variation}} {{is closely related}} to the host species upon which the wasp deposits its egg. Species that parasitize microlepidopterans, for instance, have longer <b>ovipositors,</b> presumably to reach the caterpillar through layers of plant tissue. Some wasps also have long <b>ovipositors</b> to bypass caterpillar defense mechanisms such as spines or hairs, or to reach deeply-burrowed Coleoptera larvae in tree trunks.|$|R

5|$|The abdomen has ten segments, {{each with}} a pair of spiracles for respiration. Segment ten bears a pair of cerci, a pair of anal styles, the anus and the {{external}} genitalia. Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for storing sperm and an <b>ovipositor</b> through which the ootheca is laid.|$|E
5|$|Thrips lay {{extremely}} small eggs, about 0.2mm long. Females of the suborder Terebrantia cut slits in plant tissue with their <b>ovipositor,</b> and insert their eggs, one per slit. Females of the suborder Tubulifera {{lay their eggs}} singly or in small groups on the outside surfaces of plants.|$|E
5|$|At {{the tip of}} {{the abdomen}} is a pair of long cerci (paired {{appendages}} on rearmost segment), and in females, the <b>ovipositor</b> is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and shiny. The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E
5000|$|Dictyoptera (from Greek δίκτυον diktyon [...] "net" [...] and πτερόν pteron [...] "wing") is {{an insect}} {{superorder}} that includes two orders of polyneopterous insects: the termites and cockroaches (both order Blattodea) {{along with the}} mantids (order Mantodea). While all modern Dictyoptera have short <b>ovipositors,</b> the oldest fossils of Dictyoptera have long <b>ovipositors,</b> much like members of the Orthoptera.|$|R

50|$|The name Cordulegastridae {{comes from}} the Greek kordylinus, 'club-shaped' and gaster, belly. The common name spiketails refers to the females' {{prominent}} <b>ovipositors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the <b>ovipositor,</b> as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E
5|$|Many solitary wasps are parasitoids. As adults, {{those that}} do feed {{typically}} only take nectar from flowers. Parasitoid wasps are extremely diverse in habits, many laying their eggs in inert stages of their host (egg or pupa), sometimes paralysing their prey by injecting it with venom through their <b>ovipositor.</b> They then insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon {{the outside of the}} host. The host remains alive until the parasitoid larvae pupate or emerge as adults.|$|E
5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an <b>ovipositor.</b> Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Ensifera, {{like this}} great green {{bush-cricket}} Tettigonia viridissima, somewhat resemble grasshoppers but have over 20 segments in their antennae and different <b>ovipositors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Diplolepis females lay up to 60 eggs {{within each}} leaf bud using their <b>ovipositors.</b> The asexual wasp emerges in spring; less than 1% are males.|$|R
50|$|Similar, co-occurring {{species are}} found {{both in the}} same genus (e.g., Conocephalus fasciatus), and within the genus Orchelimum (e.g., Orchelimum vulgare). All of these species have shorter <b>ovipositors</b> and cerci.|$|R
5|$|The abdomen is {{long and}} slender and {{consists}} of 10 segments and a terminal appendage-bearing segment. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, a cleft {{on the underside of}} the second segment contains a pair of claspers and the penis. The spermaries open on the 9th segment. In females, the genital opening is {{on the underside of the}} eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an <b>ovipositor,</b> depending on species and the method of egg-laying.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen shows {{considerable}} variability {{among members}} of the order. It consists of eleven segments in primitive groups and ten segments in more derived groups, the tenth and eleventh segments having fused. The last two or three segments are adapted for reproduction. Each segment is made up of a dorsal and a ventral sclerite, connected by an elastic membrane. In some females, the sclerites are rolled into a flexible, telescopic <b>ovipositor.</b>|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{has three}} {{segments}} and houses the powerful wing muscles. They have {{two pairs of}} membranous wings that may be hyaline, cloudy or pigmented. The wing venation varies between species and may help in identification. The middle thoracic segment has an operculum on the underside, which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of the abdomen. The abdomen is segmented, with the hindermost segments housing the reproductive organs, and terminates in females with a large, saw-edged <b>ovipositor.</b> In males, the abdomen is largely hollow and used as a resonating chamber.|$|E
5|$|Since the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{believed that}} cockroaches were an ancient group of insects {{that had a}} Devonian origin, according to one hypothesis. Fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern cockroaches in having long external <b>ovipositors</b> and are the ancestors of mantises, as well as modern blattodeans. As the body, hind wings and mouthparts are not preserved in fossils frequently, the relationship of these roachoids and modern cockroaches remains disputed. The first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal <b>ovipositors</b> appeared in the early Cretaceous. A recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that cockroaches originated {{at least in the}} Jurassic.|$|R
50|$|Ichneumon wasp {{species are}} highly diverse, ranging from 3 to 130 mm long. Most are slender, with the females of many species (particularly in the genus Megarhyssa) having {{extremely}} long <b>ovipositors</b> for laying eggs.|$|R
50|$|Anurogryllus (from the Greek an ("without") -uro ("tail") and the Latin gryllus ("cricket"), {{commonly}} known as short-tailed crickets, is a genus of crickets in family Gryllidae. The common and scientific names derive from the vestigial, poorly developed <b>ovipositors</b> of females.|$|R
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged <b>ovipositor</b> with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the water}} repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{in a series}} of slits usually cut by the mother's <b>ovipositor</b> in live {{branches}} or twigs of their food plants. On average about sixteen eggs, among a total batch of a few hundred, are laid in each slit. The batch all hatch around 70 days later – usually within a day or two of one another – but take longer in cold or dry conditions. Oviposition has been observed {{on a wide range of}} native and introduced plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot sustain the load of their fruit.|$|E
5|$|Like all insects, wasps {{have a hard}} {{exoskeleton}} {{which protects}} their three main body parts, the head, the mesosoma (including the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen) and the metasoma. There is a narrow waist, the petiole, joining {{the first and second}} segments of the abdomen. The two pairs of membranous wings are held together by small hooks and the forewings are larger than the hind ones; in some species, the females have no wings. In females there is usually a rigid <b>ovipositor</b> which may be modified for injecting venom, piercing or sawing. It either extends freely or can be retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defence and for paralysing prey.|$|E
50|$|Leptobasis {{is a small}} genus of damselflies in {{the family}} Coenagrionidae. They are {{commonly}} known as Swampdamsels.The genus is neotropical and one species, L. melinogaster, has been recorded in Texas. They are slender and the females have very long <b>ovipositors.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{species of}} fish was once used for human {{pregnancy}} tests. Female specimens were injected with the urine of the woman to be tested. If the woman was pregnant, the hormones in the urine would cause the fish's <b>ovipositors</b> to protrude.|$|R
50|$|These {{insects are}} no more than 3.5 mm long. They have {{elongated}} heads, long antennae, and large eyes, with the exception of Cryptovelia species, which have vestigial eyes. Females are larger than the males of their species and have well-developed <b>ovipositors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Termites have a ten-segmented abdomen {{with two}} plates, the tergites and the sternites. The tenth {{abdominal}} segment has {{a pair of}} short cerci. There are ten tergites, of which nine are wide and one is elongated. The reproductive organs {{are similar to those}} in cockroaches but are more simplified. For example, the intromittent organ is not present in male alates, and the sperm is either immotile or aflagellate. However, Mastotermitidae termites have multiflagellate sperm with limited motility. The genitals in females are also simplified. Unlike in other termites, Mastotermitidae females have an <b>ovipositor,</b> a feature strikingly similar to that in female cockroaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{females are}} iron blue, and have orange legs and black antennae. This is a notable {{distinction}} from Sirex juvencus, which has red antennae. The females also have yellowish wings. The <b>ovipositor</b> {{is below the}} tapering tip of the abdomen. The sting is connected with the mycetangia, which are special organs on the abdomen, where the female stores the oidiae (asexual fungus spores), from broken segments of hyphae. These spores are deposited, together with the eggs, in the host tree wood to germinate. Both larvae and adults have strong mandibles and can drill through lead plates.|$|E
5|$|When {{copulation}} takes place, {{the male}} butterfly or moth places a capsule of sperm (spermatophore) in a receptacle {{of the female}} (called the corpus bursae). The sperm, when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube into a special seminal receptacle (spermatheca), where the sperm is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during egg laying, which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the ovipore. The ovipore {{may be at the}} end of a modified <b>ovipositor</b> or surrounded by a pair of broad setose anal papillae.|$|E
50|$|Deinacrida mahoenui is a {{very large}} flightless insect: females weigh up to 19 g and can be 75 mm long, while males reach 12 g and 50 mm. Females can be {{distinguished}} by their size and their long egg-laying spikes or <b>ovipositors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adult E. solidaginis {{emerge from}} their galls in the spring, with the males {{emerging}} {{prior to the}} females. The flies proceed to mate on goldenrod plants, and the females use their <b>ovipositors</b> to insert fertilized eggs into the buds of the goldenrod.|$|R
25|$|Xeris {{spectrum}} {{are found}} in open pine forests. Males often begin to fly {{a few days earlier}} than females. The females drill their <b>ovipositors</b> into the tree, just under the bark, and deposit their eggs. Females lay eggs in coniferous trees, usually spruce, pine and larch.|$|R
