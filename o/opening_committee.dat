50|$|Instead of {{the usual}} {{practice}} of envelope <b>opening,</b> the award <b>committee</b> prints {{the names of the}} winners {{on the back of the}} invitation cards that are sent to all invitees.

The Nigar Awards are also known for their impartial assessment and unbiased attitude as compared with other high-level awards in Pakistan for the public entertainment media.

50|$|For the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, a {{total of}} eight sports venues were used. The games were {{originally}} awarded to Denver, Colorado in the United States in 1970, but they withdrew {{in the wake of}} Colorado residents voting against it for environmental and cost reasons in November 1972. This led to the International Olympic <b>Committee</b> <b>opening</b> up the bids for the games again, eventually awarding them to Innsbruck in February 1973. The Austrian city, having hosted the Winter Olympics in 1964, {{was in the process of}} having the venues used for those Games before Denver's with clear cutting of the alpine skiing venues, lessening of the amount of cross-country skiing routes, upgrading the ski jumps, adding lighting in the indoor sports arena to accommodate color television, and the construction of a combination bobsleigh and luge track. After the 1976 Games, the venues have remained in use, hosting events in Nordic skiing and the sliding sports. They hosted some of the events for the Winter Universiade in 2005 and seven of the eight venues served as host for the first Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Town {{were now}} {{a force to}} be {{reckoned}} with in the Northern League and they won the League Challenge Cup in 1993-94, when they beat Blyth Spartans 2-0 in the final at Brandon. But this was to be the last game that Northallerton Town Football Club was to play. Disaster struck during the summer of 1994 when they were declared financially insolvent in the High Court and were ordered to close down. Had this happened during the playing season then there is not much doubt that the club would have folded. Fortunately there was still time before the new season started for a local businessman to come forward and rescue the club, this despite vandals breaking into the ground and daubing slogans on the stand walls and breaking all the windows in the clubhouse. [...] A new committee was formed and the club was able to kick off the 1994-95 season under the new name of Northallerton F.C. 1994. Still in the First Division of the Northern League, the opening game was Northallerton, League Cup winners, against Durham City, League Champions, in the annual Cleator Cup. After playing a 1-1 draw after extra time, Durham won the cup on penalties.With no money available to reimburse players there was a mass exodus, and many players from local football leagues were brought in. Although these players gave their all it was no surprise when they were relegated at the end of season 1994-95. [...] During season 1995-96, the Club gradually got back on its feet, but after a poor <b>opening</b> the <b>Committee</b> decided that players could once again be reimbursed and many of the club’s former players returned resulting in the Club finishing in a respectable 5th place in the league. During the summer of 1996 the Club was allowed to reinstate the name “Town” to once again become Northallerton Town Football Club (1994), and under the joint guidance of the management duo of Mickey Sell and John Woods, they won promotion back to the First Division when they won the Second Division Championship. For personal reasons both Sell and Woods resigned as joint managers at the end of 1996-97, although both remained at the club, Woods as assistant manager and Sell as an occasional player. [...] After making a disastrous start to life back in the First Division (winning just three points from the first twelve games) the Club appointed former Bristol Rovers, Middlesbrough, Carlisle United and Darlington star Archie Stephens as their manager. But they fared no better, and, after finishing second bottom, they were relegated back to the Second Division. Stephens, and his assistant Woods, left the club by mutual consent at the end of the season. [...] Peter Mulcaster was appointed manager at the start of the 1998-99 season, and he guided the club to a commendable fourth place in the league. But in the February of his second season (1999-00), with the club lying in third place and one of the favourites for promotion, he surprised the club with his shock resignation in order to take the vacant manager’s job at Spennymoor United. [...] He was replaced as manager by the experienced ex-Guisborough Town boss Micky Hodgson, but after failing to win promotion at the first attempt, Hodgson and his assistant Peter Bell left the club at the end of season 2000-01. [...] Peter Mulcaster returned to take over for his second spell as team manager at the start of the 2001-02 season, but after two seasons in charge and failing to get the team promoted, it was mutually agreed that he should leave the club at the end of season 2002-03. The very experienced former Whitby Town captain Paul Burton was appointed manager at the start of the 2003-04 season. Under Burton, Town regained First Division status when they finished runners-up in Division Two at the end of the 2005-06 season, where they also reached the final of the North Riding Senior Cup for the first time in their history - losing 3-1 to York City at Bootham Crescent. [...] The following season (2006-07) they again reached the Senior Cup final - losing 5-0 to a strong Middlesbrough side at Billingham Synthonia. Burton surprised the club at the end of the season by handing in his resignation for what he claims were personal reasons. [...] He was replaced by the vastly experienced Andy Toman, who lives in the Town, but he resigned after just the one season. Toman was replaced by Alan Robinson, but on the eve of the season Robinson shocked the club with his resignation as he was going to start a new life in Thailand. [...] Ex-Doncaster Rovers player Martin Speight and former Norton & Stockton Ancients manager Stuart Dawson - who were to have been Robinson’s assistants - were appointed as joint managers, but following a run of poor results, Dawson left the club in early January. [...] Speight was then appointed sole manager but results failed to improve and, following the heavy 5-1 home defeat by Ashington at the end of March, he also resigned. [...] Mark Fanning, who had been part of the coaching staff at Darlington FC, took over and was at the Club for 4 season as manager. In 2012-13 Fanning guided the club to their first silverware in 18 years when they came from behind to beat Second Division champions Team Northumbria 3-2 in the final of the Ernest Armstrong Cup. Fanning and his assistant Martin Collins resigned in March 2013 so Peter Mulcaster returned to take over for a third time, initially until the end of the season. But following a good run of results which saw the club reach the final of the Ernest Armstrong Cup again, Mulcaster was offered the job on a permanent basis. Unfortunately Northallerton were beaten 3-1 in the final by West Allotment Celtic.|$|R
