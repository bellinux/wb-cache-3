It involves absorbing {{the souls of}} enemies {{in order to gain}} additional abilities. Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, all souls can be absorbed by the player. The rate at which enemies' souls are obtained varies between enemies. Players can trade souls between two Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow</b> cartridges using two Game Boy Advance consoles and a link cable.|$|E
5|$|Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow</b> {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series. The series' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Thirty-six years before the start of Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow,</b> Dracula was defeated once and for all by the Belmont clan, and his powers sealed into a solar eclipse. Shortly after Dracula's death, a prophecy was made that Dracula's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula's powers. This prophecy acts as {{the driving force behind the}} plot of Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow,</b> and is the primary motivation of the supporting characters to be present. The game {{takes place in}} Dracula's castle, the most common setting for the series, with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses over the course of the game.|$|E
5|$|Dawn <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow</b> {{continues}} {{the story of}} Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow,</b> in which Dracula has been completely defeated, and his powers assumed by his reincarnation, Soma Cruz. With {{the help of his}} allies, Soma avoids becoming the new dark lord. A cult forms to bring forth a new dark lord by killing Soma. Soma and his allies move to ensure that a new dark lord is not created.|$|E

5|$|Several {{video game}} {{publications}} have provided praise and criticism on Alucard's character. In Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow</b> and Dawn <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow,</b> where Alucard was present as Genya Arikado, reviewers noted {{that although he}} fell into a stereotypical character mold, the greater concentration on supporting characters was a welcomed change from previous Castlevania games.|$|E
5|$|Because of Nintendo's solid {{infrastructure}} for the DS, Igarashi {{wanted to try}} the online components, and test for possible online game play, in future Castlevania titles. Igarashi commented the two player game play was homage to , his favorite Castlevania game. The anime style of artwork was retained from Dawn <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow,</b> which Igarashi had switched to in the previous title to appeal more to the younger demographics of the Nintendo handheld systems. Portrait of Ruins development cycle took roughly {{the same amount of}} time as Dawn <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow</b> did. Koji Igarashi stated that the schedule became tight due to Nintendo Wi-Fi difficulties, considering it was their first online enabled game.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of Dawn <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow</b> was announced on January 6, 2005 {{as the first}} Castlevania game to be released on the Nintendo DS. Longtime Castlevania producer Koji Igarashi {{was in charge of}} the production. The choice to use the Nintendo DS in favor of the Sony PlayStation Portable was due to Aria of Sorrows success on Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, and Igarashi's observations during the 2005 E3 Media and Business Summit of both consoles. Igarashi felt that the storyline with Soma Cruz and the Tactical Soul system were a waste to only use in one game, contributing to his desire to make a sequel. The original design team from Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow,</b> as well as numerous new additions from Konami Tokyo, was involved in the {{production of}} Dawn <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow.</b> Igarashi intended to include a white collar Japanese worker in the game. This worker would be a manager in a Japanese firm and have a family as well. However, the development team's opposition to this idea forced him to drop this prospect.|$|E

Established in 1942 out of Etobicoke's oldest parish, Our Lady <b>of</b> <b>Sorrows</b> Roman Catholic Church, Kingsway. Our Lady <b>of</b> <b>Sorrows</b> once served much of the then largely rural, Etobicoke until post war urbanisation {{led to the creation}} of many new parishes to the north.

5|$|Castlevania: Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow</b> has {{received}} critical acclaim from several video game publications, with many {{comparing it to}} , widely considered the best game in the Castlevania series. Famitsu, considered {{to be one of}} the most respected video game news magazines in Japan, gave Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow</b> a 36/40, the highest score any game in the Castlevania series {{has received}} from Famitsu. It was rated by Nintendo Power as the 22nd best game made on a Nintendo System in their Top 200 Games list. In Japan, the game sold only 27,000 units one month after its release, considered to be a poor showing for a major video game franchise. Conversely, the game was significantly more successful in the United States, with more than 158,000 units in sales three months after its release.|$|E
5|$|Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance was re-released in North America in January 2006, {{along with}} Castlevania: Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow,</b> {{as part of}} Castlevania Double Pack. Both games are {{contained}} on a single GBA Game Pak. This pack also appeared in Europe later that year. It was picked as the IGN Game Boy Game of the Month for January 2006.|$|E
5|$|One of Igarashi's {{prominent}} concerns during {{development was}} addressing the criticism expressed concerning Harmony of Dissonance. Igarashi {{noted that the}} music in Harmony of Dissonance had not been well received and Michiru Yamane, who had previously worked on the acclaimed music for Symphony of the Night, was hired in order to compose for Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow.</b> The development team worked on the game's audio cycles, as well as delegating more cartridge space and processor cycles for the sound. Maintaining the visual quality of Harmony of Dissonance was a chief objective during development, as many reviewers had felt that Harmony of Dissonance had excelled in graphics {{at the cost of}} the audio. Furthermore, the staff tried to improve the series' gameplay system while retaining fan-favorite elements. Certain aspects that were missing in Harmony of Dissonance, such as hidden rooms, were incorporated into Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow.</b> Igarashi added Soul trading via a link cable to assist players with collecting every soul in the game, which he believed would be cumbersome to accomplish alone.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{previous}} {{games in the}} series, Aria <b>of</b> <b>Sorrow</b> is set within Dracula's castle, which is further subdivided into several areas that the player traverses. These areas feature different components, such as different enemies, varying terrain characteristics, and a unique piece of theme music. Similar to most platform games, progression between areas {{is limited by the}} abilities the player currently has. While the method in which the player progresses through the game is initially linear, the player's options become more diverse as the number of character abilities increases.|$|E
