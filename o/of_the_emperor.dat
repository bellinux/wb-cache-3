5|$|Prior to the Meiji Restoration, Japan {{was ruled}} by {{successive}} military shoguns.

5|$|Tiberius Julius Alexander was {{probably}} born {{early in the}} reign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Emperor</b> Tiberius (1437). His father was Alexander, an Alexandrian Jew who held the office of Alabarch; the exact meaning of this term is debated, but it may have denoted a senior customs official. The older Alexander enjoyed Roman citizenship, a rare privilege among the Jews of Alexandria, and therefore passed it to his sons. He also had business connections both with Agrippa, grandson of Herod the Great, and with Antonia, mother <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>emperor</b> Claudius. Another prominent member of Tiberius Alexander's family was his uncle, the philosopher Philo.|$|E
