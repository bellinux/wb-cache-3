5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>molecules</b> {{exist in}} {{interstellar}} space, as can tiny 0.1μm dust particles. The tally <b>of</b> <b>molecules</b> discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing {{at the rate}} of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was once}} thought to be a simple {{solution}} <b>of</b> <b>molecules,</b> the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include concentration gradients of small molecules such as calcium, large complexes of enzymes that act together to carry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as proteasomes and carboxysomes that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.|$|E

Glycolysis also uses two <b>molecules</b> <b>of</b> ATP in its initial stages as a committed and irreversible step.

5|$|In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel {{independently}} {{proposed that}} the phenomenon of optical activity {{could be explained by}} assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron.

The glycosphingolipids are a diverse family <b>of</b> <b>molecules</b> {{composed}} {{of one or}} more sugar residues linked via a glycosidic bond to the sphingoid base.

It was found that the outgassing from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to the rotation of its nucleus.

Many of the classical molecules of {{the adaptive}} immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals possess a large array <b>of</b> <b>molecules</b> called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from {{only a small number}} (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine has two solid forms, α- and β-fluorine. The latter {{crystallizes}} at −220°C (−364°F) and is {{transparent and}} soft, {{with the same}} disordered cubic structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen, unlike the orthorhombic systems of other solid halogens. Further cooling to −228°C (−378°F) induces a phase transition into opaque and hard α-fluorine, which has a monoclinic structure with dense, angled layers <b>of</b> <b>molecules.</b> The transition from β- to α-fluorine is more exothermic than the condensation of fluorine, and can be violent.|$|E
5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single molecule, but instead as a pair <b>of</b> <b>molecules</b> that are held tightly together.

The {{nucleotide}} contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.|$|E

Smalley, {{a chemist}} at Rice University, {{was best known}} as a co-discoverer of the C60 form of carbon known as buckminsterfullerine in 1985, along with Harry Kroto, Robert Curl, James Heath, and Sean O'Brien. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be {{discovered}} of the class <b>of</b> <b>molecules</b> known as fullerenes, which also includes carbon nanotubes.

5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} is a phospholipid bilayer membrane {{that separates the}} cell from its environment and regulates the transport <b>of</b> <b>molecules</b> and signals {{into and out of}} the cell. Embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform the functions of the {{plasma membrane}}. The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the nuclear}} {{membrane}} is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear pores {{are required to}} regulate nuclear transport <b>of</b> <b>molecules</b> across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression {{and the maintenance of}} chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound sub compartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of sub-nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.|$|E

5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and <b>of</b> <b>molecules,</b> each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{primarily}} composed of hydrogen with {{a quarter of}} its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number <b>of</b> <b>molecules.</b> It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and—with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916—he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion <b>of</b> <b>molecules.</b> He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe.|$|E
