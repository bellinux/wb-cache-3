5|$|In {{the year}} 1890, Edwin B. Young, a {{descendant}} of United Empire Royalists and a colonel in the King's Royal, was made superintendent of the grounds. A particular wealthy family, the Gardners, had large granite vaults built very visibly to pedestrians along then Bergenwood Road. It was reported by the New York Sun that grave robbers had broken into various vaults at Grove Church. The Gardner vault had been found opened, which required the vandal to smash locks as well as break the iron railing, which {{was believed to be}} achieved by the use of hammers and chisels stolen from on adjoined marble yard. Robert Gardner's metallic coffin was found opened, removed from the shelf upon which it sat. The investigation, led by Superintendent Young, left those involved unsure of why the perpetrators would have broken in, and with no apparent objective <b>or</b> <b>reason,</b> they concluded that it may have been done simply to desecrate the resting place of the dead. Young held that position of superintendent until 1899, for the pursuit of real estate.|$|E

25|$|René Descartes {{contrarily}} {{believed that}} non-humans are automata, complex machines with no soul, mind, <b>or</b> <b>reason.</b> In Cartesian dualism, consciousness was unique to human among all other animals and linked to physical matter by divine grace.

25|$|An {{examination}} {{of the rest of}} experience, especially such phenomena as instinct, voluntary motion, sexual love, artistic production and the like, makes it evident that Will and Idea, unconscious but teleological, are everywhere operative, and that the underlying force is one and not many.

Even people who try to help <b>or</b> <b>reason</b> with him are just as likely to be killed by the inhuman fiend.|$|E
25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{unhappiness}} of aimless desire, the Will realizes the ideas already potentially {{present and the}} Unconscious becomes actual. The existence {{of the universe is}} the result, then, of the illogical Will, but its characteristics and laws are all due to the Idea <b>or</b> <b>Reason</b> and are, therefore, logical. It is {{the best of all possible}} worlds, which contains the promise of the redemption of the Unconscious from actual existence by the exercise of Reason in partnership with the Will in the consciousness of the enlightened pessimist.|$|E
25|$|Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and Descartes were, with {{going too}} much into details in efforts to explain the metaphysics of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him {{to admit that they}} are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a {{composite}} of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence <b>or</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some {{philosophers}} {{embrace the}} existence of both kinds of reason, while others deny {{the existence of}} one or the other. For example, Bernard Williams (1981) argues that there are really only internal reasons for action. Such a view is called internalism about <b>reasons</b> (<b>or</b> <b>reasons</b> internalism). Externalism about <b>reasons</b> (<b>or</b> <b>reasons</b> externalism) is the denial of reasons internalism. It is the view that there are external reasons for action; that is, there are reasons for action that one can have even if the action {{is not part of}} one's subjective motivational set.|$|R

The structure of the state is Panopticon-like, and life is scientifically managed F. W. Taylor-style. People march in step with each other and are uniformed. There is no way of referring to people except by their given numbers.

The individual's behaviour is based on logic by way of formulas and equations outlined by the One State.|$|E
25|$|The second limb {{of section}} 6(2) was {{examined}} by District Judge Neighbour in Ong Kian Cheong. The {{issue in the}} case was whether the accused persons had knowledge <b>or</b> <b>reason</b> {{to believe that the}} publications possessed seditious tendencies. The first accused claimed he did not read the tracts and thus did not know that they had seditious tendencies. He alleged that all he did was to post the tracts after the second accused had prepared them. The second accused claimed that she had purchased and distributed the tracts without reading them and had no reason to believe the publications were seditious or objectionable because they were freely available on sale in local bookstores.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{development}} of modern scientific method, Catholic theology had allowed for biblical text to be read as allegorical, rather than literal, where it appeared to contradict that which could be established by science <b>or</b> <b>reason.</b> Thus Catholicism {{has been able to}} refine its understanding of scripture in light of scientific discovery. Among the early Church Fathers there was debate over whether God created the world in six days, as Clement of Alexandria taught, or in a single moment as held by Augustine, and a literal interpretation of Genesis was normally taken for granted in the Middle Ages and later, until it was rejected in favour of uniformitarianism (entailing far greater timeframes) by a majority of geologists in the 19th century. However modern literal creationism has had little support among the higher levels of the Church.|$|E

25|$|Although cheek kissing is not {{as widely}} practiced in the United Kingdom or Ireland as {{in other parts of}} Europe, it is still commonplace. Generally, a kiss on one cheek is commonplace, however a kiss on each cheek is also practiced by some {{dependant}} on relation <b>or</b> <b>reason.</b> It is mostly used as a greeting and/or a farewell, but can also be offered as a congratulation or as a general declaration of friendship or love. Cheek kissing is acceptable between parents and children, family members (though not often two adult males), couples, two female friends or a male friend and a female friend. Cheek kissing between two men who are not a couple is unusual but socially acceptable if both men are happy to take part. Cheek kissing is associated with the middle and upper classes, as they are more influenced by French culture. This behaviour was traditionally seen as a French practice.|$|E
25|$|The Standard Model {{leaves the}} mass of the Higgs boson as a {{parameter}} to be measured, rather than a value to be calculated. This is seen as theoretically unsatisfactory, particularly as quantum corrections (related to interactions with virtual particles) should apparently cause the Higgs particle to have a mass immensely higher than that observed, {{but at the same time}} the Standard Model requires a mass of the order of 100 to 1000 GeV to ensure unitarity (in this case, to unitarise longitudinal vector boson scattering). Reconciling these points appears to require explaining why there is an almost-perfect cancellation resulting in the visible mass of ~ 125 GeV, and it is not clear how to do this. Because the weak force is about 1032 times stronger than gravity, and (linked to this) the Higgs boson's mass is so much less than the Planck mass or the grand unification energy, it appears that either there is some underlying connection <b>or</b> <b>reason</b> for these observations which is unknown and not described by the Standard Model, or some unexplained and extremely precise fine-tuning of parameters – however at present neither of these explanations is proven. This is known as a hierarchy problem. More broadly, the hierarchy problem amounts to the worry that a future theory of fundamental particles and interactions should not have excessive fine-tunings or unduly delicate cancellations, and should allow masses of particles such as the Higgs boson to be calculable. The problem is in some ways unique to spin-0 particles (such as the Higgs boson), which can give rise to issues related to quantum corrections that do not affect particles with spin. A number of solutions have been proposed, including supersymmetry, conformal solutions and solutions via extra dimensions such as braneworld models.|$|E
25|$|Despite this estrangement, {{the couple}} again met foxhunting and resumed a {{discreet}} relationship. Marshall Field {{was at first}} unimpressed by the impecunious Beatty as a future son-in-law, but was persuaded by his heroic reputation, impressive record of promotion and future prospects. There was the possibility that Field might revoke the settlement he had made on his daughter {{at the time of}} her first marriage and the new couple would have no means of support. Beatty's father was also unhappy about the match, fearing a repeat of the difficulties he had faced with his own relationship with a married woman, but with the added risk of publicity because both Beatty and Ethel were famous and the risk that Beatty's illegitimacy might be exposed. Beatty went so far as to consult a fortune teller, Mrs. Roberts, who predicted a fine outcome to the match. Ethel wrote to Arthur, telling him that it was her firm intention never to live with him again as his wife, though not naming any particular person <b>or</b> <b>reason.</b> Arthur agreed to co-operate, and filed for divorce in America on the grounds of desertion, which was granted 9 May 1901. Beatty and Ethel married on 22 May 1901 at the registry office, St. George's, Hanover Square, London with no family attending. Although Arthur Tree was himself from a wealthy American family, he now had to adjust to reduced circumstances without Ethel's support. He elected to remain in Britain and their son Ronald remained with him. Ronald and his mother were never reconciled from his perception that she had deserted his father, but he visited in later life and became friendly with Beatty. Ronald later became a member of parliament and, during the Second World War became a link between the British and United States governments, lending his country house, Ditchley Park near Oxford, to Winston Churchill for weekend visits when the official residences were considered unsafe. Beatty and Ethel set up home at Hanover Lodge in Regent's Park, London.|$|E
