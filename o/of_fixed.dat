5|$|In {{addition}} to the air and naval forces assigned to protect shipping in Australian waters, fixed defences were constructed to protect the major Australian ports. The Australian Army was responsible for developing and manning coastal defences to protect ports from attacks by enemy surface raiders. These defences commonly consisted of a number <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> guns defended by anti-aircraft guns and infantry. The Army's coastal defences were considerably expanded as the threat to Australia increased between 1940 and 1942, and reached their peak strength in 1944. The Royal Australian Navy was responsible for developing and manning harbour defences in Australia's main ports. These defences consisted <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> anti-submarine booms and mines supported by small patrol craft, and were also greatly expanded as the threat to Australia increased. The RAN also laid defensive minefields in Australian waters from August 1941.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we deduce some {{properties}} of f-sets of connected graphs. We introduce the concept <b>of</b> <b>fixing</b> share <b>of</b> each vertex <b>of</b> a <b>fixing</b> set D {{to see the}} participation of each vertex in fixing a connected graph G. We also define a parameter, called the fixing percentage, by using the concept <b>of</b> <b>fixing</b> share, which is helpful in determining {{the measure of the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>fixing</b> done by the elements <b>of</b> a <b>fixing</b> set D in G. It is shown that for every positive integer N, there exists a graph G with dtr(G) -Det(G) >= N, where dtr(G) is the determined number and Det(G) is the determining number of G.

40|$|Direct {{intramuscular}} injection (IM) of adeno-associated virus (AAV) {{has been proven}} a safe and potentially efficient procedure for gene therapy of many genetic diseases including hemophilia B. It is, however, contentious whether high antigen level induces tolerance or immunity to coagulation factor IX (<b>FIX)</b> following IM <b>of</b> AAV. We recently reported induction of FIX-specific immune tolerance by IM of AAV serotype one (AAV 1) vector in mice. We hypothesize that the expression of high levels <b>of</b> <b>FIX</b> is critical to induction <b>of</b> <b>FIX</b> tolerance. In this study, we investigated the correlation among AAV dose, FIX expression, and tolerance induction. We observed that induction of immune tolerance or immunity to FIX was dependent on the dose of AAV 1 –human FIX (hFIX) given and the level <b>of</b> <b>FIX</b> antigen expressed in both normal and hemophilia mice. We then defined the minimum AAV 1 –hFIX dose and the lowest level <b>of</b> <b>FIX</b> needed for FIX tolerance. Different from hepatic AAV–hFIX gene transfer, we found that FIX tolerance induced by IM of AAV 1 was not driven by regulatory T cells. These results provided further insight into the mechanism(s) <b>of</b> <b>FIX</b> tolerance, contributing to development of hemophilia gene therapy, and optimization <b>of</b> <b>FIX</b> tolerance induction protocols...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{selection}} strategy <b>of</b> <b>fixing</b> nodes in the FETI-DP method. The FETI-DP method {{is one of}} non-overlapping domain decomposition methods. The method was published by Farhat and co-workers in 2001. Selection <b>of</b> the <b>fixing</b> unknowns in the FETI-DP, TFETI or BDDC domain decomposition method has strong influence on the method behavior. The selection itself is not straightforward {{in the case of}} irregular domains and subdomains. Three-step algorithm for the selection <b>of</b> the <b>fixing</b> unknowns is presented and some numerical examples are shown. The algorithm is based on nodal multiplicity, which is the number of subdomains sharing the node. If the three-step algorithm selects unsatisfactory number <b>of</b> <b>fixing</b> nodes, additional geometrical conditions are applied. These conditions lead to selection <b>of</b> additional <b>fixing</b> nodes. Moreover, higher number <b>of</b> the <b>fixing</b> nodes usually results in better convergence of the coarse problems...|$|R

Although the system <b>of</b> <b>fixed,</b> artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused further economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 (just before Christmas), the regime suddenly announced massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, the government's main source of hard currency when exported. The new measures were incomprehensible to many urban workers, and their provocative timing (the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomułka's fall from power.|$|E
