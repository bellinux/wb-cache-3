5|$|In 1956, Mikan was the Republican {{candidate}} for the United States Congress in Minnesota's 3rd congressional district. He challenged incumbent Representative Roy Wier in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout. Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning to the legal profession, Mikan was frustrated, after hoping for an influx <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> <b>For</b> six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him {{to cash in on}} his life insurance.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{scholarships}} {{are available}} at both 11+ and 13+ for music, academic achievement, and one for art at thirteen. Music and academic scholarships range in value between 5%–20% with one Kings Scholarship available for a 20% reduction in fees. These scholarships are awarded based on performance in subject specific exams or performances, and {{an interview with the}} headmaster for academic or music scholarships, or the presentation of a portfolio <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the art scholarship. Until the start of the 2009/2010 academic year, the value of scholarships was substantially higher with the King's Scholarships worth 50% of the fees and a range of lower scholarships between 10–30%.|$|E

During this (her second) trip to Ireland (the first was with John before they married), she visited the crypt of Irish leader Daniel O'Connell at Glasnevin Cemetery and Dún Laoghaire, from where Irish departed for England {{to escape the}} famine.

5|$|Soon, Manne {{began to}} {{contribute}} to film music in a broader way, often combining jazz, pop, and classical music. Henry Mancini in particular found plenty <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> him; the two shared an interest in experimenting with tone colors, and Mancini came to rely on Manne to shape the percussive effects in his music. Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Hatari! (1962) and The Pink Panther (1963) {{are only a few}} of Mancini's films where Manne's drums and special percussive effects could be heard.|$|E
5|$|The {{interval}} between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime {{body of work}} rather than a single achievement. The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> <b>For</b> example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts. However, {{they can also be}} awarded for specific recent events. For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords.|$|E

5|$|By 1823 Cofresí was {{probably}} on {{the crew of the}} corsair barquentine El Scipión, captained by José Ramón Torres and managed by his cousin (the first mayor of Mayagüez, José María Ramírez de Arellano). Historians agree, since several of his friends and family members benefited from the sale of stolen goods. Cofresí may have joined to evade the authorities, honing skills he would use later in life. El Scipión employed questionable tactics later associated with the pirate, such as flying the flag of Gran Colombia so other ships would lower their guard (as she did in capturing the British frigate Aurora and the American brigantine Otter). The capture of Otter led to a court order requiring restitution, affecting the crew. At this time, Cofresí turned to piracy. Although the reasons behind his decision are unclear, several theories have been proposed by researchers. In Orígenes portorriqueños Ramírez Brau speculates that Cofresí's time aboard El Scipión, or seeing a family member become a privateer, may have influenced his decision to become a pirate after the crew's pay was threatened by the lawsuit. According to Ursula Acosta, a lack <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> privateers ultimately pushed Cofresí into piracy.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was only}} out <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> nine weeks before being {{appointed}} manager of Bristol City on 9 March 1992. He succeeded Jimmy Lumsden, {{who left the}} club second-from-bottom in the Second Division. Smith felt the team lacked pace, so signed 20-year-old striker Andy Cole on loan from Arsenal. Dariusz Dziekanowski scored both goals against Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves) in Smith's second match in charge to provide City with their first win in three months. They then won 3–1 against Smith's former club Sunderland, with Cole scoring {{the first of his}} 8 goals in 12 appearances during his loan spell. Smith successfully steered the club out of the relegation zone at the end of 1992–93 with a run of eight matches unbeaten, and paid a club record £500,000 to secure Cole's services on a permanent basis. He further paid £250,000 for Everton midfielder Raymond Atteveld and signed West Ham United striker Leroy Rosenior.|$|E
