[...] That this is what Gregory believed and taught is affirmed by most scholars. A minority of scholars have argued that Gregory only affirmed the universal resurrection.|$|E
500|$|In October 1939 The Rules of the Game {{was officially}} banned in France for being [...] "depressing, morbid, immoral [...] having an {{undesirable}} {{influence over the}} young." [...] Other films that were similarly banned included Marcel Carné's Le Quai des brumes and Le Jour Se Lève. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated [...] "we are especially anxious to avoid representations of our country, our traditions, and <b>our</b> <b>race</b> that changes its character, lie about it, and deform it {{through the prism of}} an artistic individual who is often original but not always sound." [...] The Marriage of Figaro, one of the inspirations for the film, had also been banned for similar reasons. After the end of World War II the 85-minute version of the film was re-released in Paris on September 26, 1945, and it was again banned.|$|E

500|$|Morris {{first came}} across {{the story of the}} Volsungs, [...] "the grandest tale that ever was told" [...] as he later called it, as a young man, when he read a summary of it in Benjamin Thorpe's Northern Mythology, which became a {{favourite}} book of his. In his The Earthly Paradise (1868–70) he included a versification of the story of Sigurd's daughter Aslaug, which he may have taken from Thorpe. In 1868 he began to learn Old Norse from the Icelandic scholar Eiríkr Magnússon, and embarked with him on a series of collaborative translations from the Icelandic classics. In 1870 they published Völsunga Saga: The Story of the Volsungs and Niblungs, with Certain Songs from the Elder Edda, claiming uncompromisingly in the preface that [...] "This is the Great Story of the North, which should be to all <b>our</b> <b>race</b> what the Tale of Troy was to the Greeks".|$|E

Barrichello said that he blamed his poor qualifying performance for his fourth-place finish. Ralf Schumacher and Frentzen were pleased to finish in fifth and sixth places respectively. Fisichella, who retired from the race from an brake problem, said that the reoccurring problem caused damage to his car and forced his later retirement. Gené placed blame upon faulty radio communication to his team {{as the reason for}} his stop-go penalty and said that he did not receive the blue flag until the last moment. Jaguar's technical director Gary Anderson was angry with Gené after the race as he believed the Spaniard's driving cost Irvine the chance to take a points-scoring position.

She also read Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West, however she rejected Spengler's pessimistic view that this decline was terminal, instead opining that the Aryan civilization could be rejuvenated through its adoption of a new religion - Odinism. She deemed Odinism to be a religion that had a natural and intrinsic relationship with what she perceived to be a Northern European race, stating that the [...] "primary source" [...] of the faith was [...] "biological: its genesis is in <b>our</b> <b>race,</b> its principles encoded in our genes." [...] She also believed that this Odinism should use Norse names for the deities rather than Anglo-Saxon or Teutonic ones {{in order to avoid the}} post-war animosity between England and Germany.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the values}} of the Squamish culture, respect for each other and {{generosity}} of both the wealth of wisdom and material wealth was key.

2500|$|In Italy, the {{influence}} of Nordicism had a divisive effect in which {{the influence}} resulted in Northern Italians who regarded themselves to have Nordic racial heritage considered themselves a civilised people while negatively regarding Southern Italians as non-Nordic and therefore biologically inferior. Nordicism was controversial in Italy because of common Nordicist perceptions of Mediterranean people, and especially southern Italians, being racially degenerate. The distinction between a superior northern Italy and a degenerate and an inferior southern Italy was promoted by the Neapolitan Carlo Formichi, the Vice-President of the Italian Academy, who in 1921 said that Italy needed [...] "a great revolution ..., {{a return to the}} genius of the noble Aryan race, which is after all <b>our</b> <b>race,</b> but that has been overcome by the Semitic civilisation and mentality". At least some of the stereotypes about Southern Italians were created by Cesare Lombroso, an Italian Jewish criminologist and anthropologist of Sephardic descent. For his controversial theories, Lombroso was expelled from the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology in 1882. The Lombrosian doctrine is currently considered pseudoscientific.|$|E
