40|$|Quantifying {{the impacts}} <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> and human {{activities}} on runoff has received extensive attention, {{especially for the}} regions with significant elevation difference. The contributions <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> and human activities to runoff were analyzed using rainfall-runoff relationship, double mass curve, slope variation, and water balance method during 1961 – 2010 at the Jinsha River basin, China. Results indicate that runoff at upstream and runoff at midstream are both dominated by <b>climate</b> <b>changes,</b> and the contributions <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> to runoff are 63 %~ 72 % and 53 %~ 68 %, respectively. At downstream, <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> account for only 13 %~ 18 %, and runoff is mainly controlled by human activities, contributing 82 %~ 87 %. The availability and stability of results were compared and analyzed in the four methods. Results in slope variation, double mass curve, and water balance method except rainfall-runoff relationship method are of good agreement. And the rainfall-runoff relationship, double mass curve, and slope variation method are all of great stability. The four methods and availability evaluation of them could provide a reference to quantification in the contributions <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> and human activities to runoff at similar basins in the future...|$|R

5|$|Cook's {{education}} {{includes a}} background in physics. Prior to {{his work on the}} book, Cook founded the website Skeptical Science, which compiles peer-reviewed evidence <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change.</b> He placed on the site the most common assertions made by individuals arguing against the scientific consensus for climate change, with evidence to refute each point they made. After the publication <b>of</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Change</b> Denial: Heads in the Sand, Cook coauthored another book on the subject, Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1– The Physical Climate (2013). In 2015, Cook served as the climate communication fellow at the University of Queensland.|$|E
5|$|The book {{presents}} an in-depth analysis and refutation <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed {{evidence from the}} scientific consensus for climate change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of climate scientists. They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.|$|E
40|$|Developed {{countries}} {{are more likely}} to be high emitters of green-house gases, and it is important that these {{countries are}} aware of the issue <b>of</b> global <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and possible human contributions to that problem. Given their status as developed countries, one would think that public opinion on the sources <b>of</b> global <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> would be similar across nations, but this is not true. There is a lack of consensus among countries about the effects of human activity on global temperature variation, as opposed to natural fluctuation in global climate. Using case studies of the United States, France, Canada, Japan, and Australia, public opinion on the sources <b>of</b> global <b>climate</b> <b>change,</b> and why these sources differ from country to country, is measured. Each country is examined on the criteria of wealth per capita, average education level, density of the population, awareness <b>of</b> global <b>climate</b> <b>change,</b> and perceived sources <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>changes.</b> These five countries, although possessing similar levels of wealth and development, differ greatly in their public opinion about the causes and the seriousness <b>of</b> global <b>climate</b> <b>change...</b>|$|R

5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change.|$|E

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought.

Recently, a more thorough assessment of the potential impact <b>of</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E
