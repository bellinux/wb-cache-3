5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} elevated levels <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in wax and pollen, but the amounts <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{were similar in}} both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E
5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} a plant that attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, without the use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|As her {{research}} progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> She also {{took advantage of}} her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps {{when it came to}} pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.|$|E
30|$|Although {{studies have}} {{assessed}} factors influencing farmers’ choice <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> or use <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> (Adejumo et al. 2014; Anang and Amikuzuno 2015), little information {{is known in}} the case of Ghana, particularly, on cocoa farmers. Also, studies which sort to assess frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application (Avicor et al. 2011; Oesterlund et al. 2014; Antwi-Agyakwa et al. 2015), only described the frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application and did not estimate the factors which influence frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application.|$|R
30|$|Access to {{extension}} service {{was statistically significant}} at 1  % and negatively influenced frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application. This conformed to the a-priori expectation which indicates that access to {{extension service}} negatively influenced frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application. This means that as a farmer gains access to extension service, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application decreases. Hashemi et al. (2009) revealed that extension service is an effective method to promote rational use <b>of</b> <b>pesticide.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bacteria {{can also}} be used in the place <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in the {{biological}} pest control. This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators and most other beneficial insects.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found that a combination <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected pollen from hives on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified {{to be associated with}} increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae.|$|E

5|$|Morgan was {{sometimes}} {{sought to investigate}} public problems on behalf of federal or state governments. She examined the food quality at San Quentin Prison in 1939, and in the 1940s she was the founding chair of the California Nutrition War Committee and served on the Office of Scientific Research and Development. In 1960, Morgan {{was a member of}} a committee that looked at the toxicity <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> used in agriculture. She co-authored a textbook, Experimental Food Study, with Irene Sanborn Hall, and she wrote detailed histories of the Alpha Nu and Iota Sigma Pi honor societies.|$|E
5|$|Organic {{apples are}} {{commonly}} {{produced in the}} United States. Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe. The use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has {{been approved by the}} EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.|$|E
5|$|Today, poison is {{used for}} {{a wider variety of}} {{purposes}} than it used to be. For example, poison can be used to rid an unwanted infestation by pests or to kill weeds. Such chemicals, known as pesticides, have been known to be used in some form since about 2500 BC. However, the use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> has increased staggeringly from 1950, and presently approximately 2.5 million tons of industrial pesticides are used each year. Other poisons {{can also be used to}} preserve foods and building material.|$|E

40|$|Demands {{towards the}} {{increase}} of high profits {{and the safety of}} the agricultural product have made the use <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> unavoidable. Regulation and government effort to prevent farmers from the dangerous use <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> has long been implemented {{but the fact is that}} until nowadays the use <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide</b> by farmers is far from safety standard. Both the effect of acute and chronic pesticide intoxication can create nervous system disorder and even death. Most users do not have enough knowledge about the danger <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide</b> and safety work procedure. In order to increase the quality of the farmers’ health and to prevent them from the effect of acute intoxication and long term use <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> effect, it is necessary to develop strategies to anticipate the effect <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> through Total Ergonomic Approach.

5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Evaluating {{pesticide}} {{contributions to}} CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, the variety <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{in use in}} the different areas reporting CCD {{makes it difficult to}} test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances {{over the course of a}} season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} types of {{coloured}} insect, and three types <b>of</b> <b>pesticide,</b> which will either kill, stun, or {{have no effect on}} the insects. The player can only carry one type <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> at a time; during {{the early stages of the}} game the lethal pesticide can be carried at all times, but later stages have more than one type of insect on screen at once, making the choice <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> more tactical.|$|R

5|$|Human {{attitudes toward}} insects are often negative, {{reinforced}} by sensationalism in the media. This {{has produced a}} society that attempts to eliminate insects from daily life. For example, nearly 75 million pounds of broad-spectrum insecticides are manufactured and sold each year for use in American homes and gardens. Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 {{can be regarded as}} serious pests, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests. Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including pollinators such as bees.|$|E
5|$|Locust plagues {{can have}} devastating effects on human {{population}}s, causing famines and population upheavals. They are mentioned {{in both the}} Koran and the Bible and have also been held responsible for cholera epidemics, resulting from the corpses of locusts drowned in the Mediterranean Sea and decomposing on beaches. The FAO and other organisations monitor locust activity around the world. Timely application <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> can prevent nomadic bands of hoppers from forming before dense swarms of adults can build up. Besides conventional control using contact insecticides, biological pest control using the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum, which specifically infects grasshoppers, has been used with some success.|$|E
5|$|More recently, habitat {{destruction}} and degradation {{have become the}} principal dangers, and a further reduction of 50% is expected in giant otter numbers within the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of three generations of giant otters). Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, giant otter home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging {{in parts of the}} giant otter range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the giant otter.|$|E
30|$|Cocoa income had a {{negative}} influence on frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application and was statistically significant at 1  %. This means that as a farmer’s income from sale of cocoa increases, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application reduces. The result is surprising, since {{it was expected that}} cocoa income would increase frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application. This contradicts the findings of Khan et al. (2015). The result indicates that cocoa farmers do not increase pesticide application as a result of higher income from sale of cocoa.|$|R
30|$|Educational {{level of}} a farmer was {{statistically}} significant at 1  % and had a positive relationship with frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application. This did not follow the a-priori expectation which indicates that educational level of farmers would negatively influence frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application. The result is surprising but could be {{as a result of}} proliferation of insect pest and diseases on their cocoa farms. Ntow et al. (2006) revealed that farmers increased frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> application because <b>of</b> proliferation of insect pests and diseases.|$|R
30|$|In addition, farming {{experience}} and age significantly influenced (at 5 and 1  % respectively) farmers’ choice to reuse pesticide containers. Farm experience {{had a negative}} relationship with ‘reuse’ <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> containers while the age of farmer had a positive relationship with reuse <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> containers.|$|R
5|$|Pesticides {{are applied}} to crops by {{agricultural}} aircraft, tractor-mounted crop sprayers or as seed dressings to control pests. However, successful control by pesticides is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the timing is often critical, the method of application is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimised. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed. Where progressive farmers are using fertilisers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate application <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> may be detrimental in the longer term.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} has {{an extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million square miles), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 79 to 160 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern. In the western Palaearctic, populations are generally stable or increasing, {{but there have been}} local declines, especially on farmland, which may be due to agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows (which provide nesting places), and to drain damp grassland and increase the use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> both of which could have reduced the availability of invertebrate food.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause of death}} in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, deep-lying snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with road vehicles is another cause of mortality, and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> and this may still be the case {{in some parts of the}} world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.|$|E
30|$|The {{absorption}} coefficient ratio (the ratio of {{absorption coefficient}} of 400 and 532 [*]nm peaks, Ex 400 / 532), which measures {{the changes in}} absorption peaks due to the addition of various concentrations <b>of</b> <b>pesticide,</b> has been investigated thoroughly. The ratio increases {{with the increase of}} concentration <b>of</b> the <b>pesticide.</b> This phenomenon suggests that more the phosphorothioate group more is the functionalization of GNP up to a certain concentration <b>of</b> <b>pesticide.</b> A calibration curve between the absorption coefficient ratios versus concentration <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> can help one to estimate quantitatively the presence of methyl parathion in a sample at ppm level (Figure[*] 2 (B) & 2 (D)).|$|R
