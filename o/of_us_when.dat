500|$|Other {{friends and}} {{household}} members joined (including Gee Vaucher, Pete Wright, N. A. Palmer and Steve Herman), and Crass played their first live gig at a squatted street festival in Huntley Street, North London. They planned to play five songs, but a neighbour [...] "pulled the plug" [...] after three. Guitarist Steve Herman left the band soon afterwards, {{and was replaced}} by Phil Clancey, aka Phil Free. Joy De Vivre and Eve Libertine also joined around this time. Other early Crass performances included a four-date tour of New York City, a festival gig in Covent Garden and regular appearances with the U.K. Subs at The White Lion, Putney and Action Space in central London. The latter performances were often poorly attended: [...] "The audience consisted mostly <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> the Subs played and the Subs when we played".|$|E
500|$|The {{institution}} of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti-administration Democrat Clement Vallandigham further incensed Pierce, who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln. [...] "Who, I ask, has clothed the President with power to dictate to any one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> we must or when we may speak, or be silent upon any subject, and especially {{in relation to the}} conduct of any public servant?", he demanded. Pierce's comments were ill-received in much of the North, especially as his criticism of Lincoln's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Pierce's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was seized by Union soldiers. Pierce's correspondence with Davis, all pre-war, revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North, was sent to the press. Pierce's words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him.|$|E

[...] We began as always, playing around and fooling about for two days, playing anything we want, like standards, our own material or anything that comes to us, and slowly but surely we develop a feel that takes us on to the new material." ...|$|E
5000|$|By 1930, NC 305 was {{extended}} north {{to its current}} terminus in Seaboard. By 1940, NC 305 {{was extended}} south to NC 97 north <b>of</b> Windsor. <b>When</b> <b>US</b> 13 was extended south, NC 97 was renumbered as part <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 13. <b>When</b> NC 561 was extended, NC 305 was built to run concurrently with NC 561 for 6 mi. NC 305 has had the same routing since then.|$|R

2500|$|Writers {{fear that}} their works {{will end up}} prohibited, and {{therefore}} some things are not worth writing, lest they damn the whole book. Journalists were always the ones that suffered the most from this self-imposed censorship, as there would bear responsibility for any delays in the newspaper, for some ill-pondered or reckless phase. Ferreira de Castro wrote in 1945 [...] "Each <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>when</b> writing, places an imagiary censor on the desk".|$|E
2500|$|This is {{referred}} to as [...] "obligation". [...] "There are moments for all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> we care quite naturally. We just do care; no ethical effort is required. 'Want' and 'ought' are indistinguishable in such cases." [...] I have the ability to [...] "abstain from action if I [...] believe that anything I might do would tend to work against {{the best interests of the}} cared-for." [...] According to Noddings we are obligated to pursue the [...] "musts".|$|E
2500|$|Arneil was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} 1st dan in Kyokushin karate on 15 May 1962, and attained 2nd dan on 16 April 1963. He was later 'adopted' by Oyama, to allow him to marry a Japanese woman in 1964. Of his wife, Tsuyuko Arneil, he has said, [...] "She worked in a bank, and she supported both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> I was training. I didn't have time for work." [...] Arneil estimated that he trained an average of six hours each day during his time in Japan, with training normally commencing at 10:00 AM and concluding between 10:30 PM to 1:00 AM the next morning.|$|E

50|$|Before 1988, {{the route}} of WIS 253 was part <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 53. <b>When</b> the bypass was {{completed}} that year, the US 53 designation was shifted to it and the old routing was given the WIS 253 moniker.|$|R

2500|$|Bacteria use two {{different}} strategies for transcription termination – Rho-independent termination and Rho-dependent termination. In Rho-independent transcription termination, RNA transcription stops when the newly synthesized RNA molecule forms a G-C-rich hairpin loop {{followed by a}} run <b>of</b> <b>Us.</b> <b>When</b> the hairpin forms, the mechanical stress breaks the weak rU-dA bonds, now filling the DNA–RNA hybrid. [...] This pulls the poly-U transcript out of the active site of the RNA polymerase, terminating transcription. In the [...] "Rho-dependent" [...] type of termination, a protein factor called [...] "Rho" [...] destabilizes {{the interaction between the}} template and the mRNA, thus releasing the newly synthesized mRNA from the elongation complex.|$|E
2500|$|On November 11, 2009, Seattle Children's Hospital {{became the}} first major children's {{hospital}} to host a pediatrician-authored blog. Swanson, {{now known as the}} [...] "Seattle Mama Doc," [...] wanted the blog to be an online science-based resource for parents. In her blog posts, Swanson offers general health and safety tips, discusses issues in the media like HPV, vaccinations, sudden infant death syndrome, car seats, and trends in breast-feeding, and shares her own experiences as a parent. [...] "The abundance of online noise invokes fear in all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> making decisions for our children," [...] said Swanson. [...] "At the end of the day, we as parents just want to do what is right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Handel has {{generally}} been accorded high esteem by fellow composers, both {{in his own time}} and since. Bach attempted, unsuccessfully, to meet Handel while he was visiting Halle. Mozart is reputed to have said of him, [...] "Handel understands affect better than any <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> <b>When</b> he chooses, he strikes like a thunder bolt." [...] To Beethoven he was [...] "the master of us all... the greatest composer that ever lived. I would uncover my head and kneel before his tomb." [...] Beethoven emphasised above all the simplicity and popular appeal of Handel's music when he said, [...] "Go to him to learn how to achieve great effects, by such simple means." ...|$|E
