50|$|Butler {{spent the}} winter of 1980-81 {{rebuilding}} the crashed and worn-out car in his mom’s garage, using only hand tools and a gas-welding rig. The lack of sophisticated tools made this work very labor-intensive. Butler relied on a dedicated group of friends who volunteered to provide the labor and skills necessary to get the <b>fabrication</b> <b>work</b> done. Steve planned the overall design, performed the engine building, and participated in the <b>fabrication</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
50|$|The USIC has {{executed}} design, {{development and}} <b>fabrication</b> <b>works</b> ranging from custom designed sample holders/cells to electronic {{instrumentation and control}} modules.|$|R

50|$|Contract {{design was}} {{completed}} in February 1986 and steel <b>fabrication</b> <b>work</b> for Rainier began on August 16, 1986 at National Steel and Shipbuilding (NASSCO) in San Diego, California. The official keel laying was conducted on May 31, 1990.|$|R
50|$|Simultaneously {{with the}} {{construction}} of the building, an interactive science exhibits were designed by local and foreign experts. <b>Fabrication</b> <b>works</b> for Level 1 exhibits began in August 1994 and was completed in May 1995. Next, <b>fabrication</b> <b>work</b> exhibits Level 2 is starting in October 1995 and was completed in September 1996. To ensure that the exhibits are always in line with the advancement of Science and Technology, the Centre is planning to upgrade the existing exhibits a continuous basis to get the traffic going. After a decade in operation, while the Science Center was officially closed on 15 April 1996. Now, National Science Center has many additional exhibition houses a wide variety of materials for visitors viewing.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} cleared of {{craneage}} although {{some evidence of}} the building berths remained visible until ca 2004. Part of the yard's covered facilities are utilised by steel stockholders GKN whilst the riverside berth has been utilised by Motherwell Bridge Engineering for heavy <b>fabrication</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jeffries {{worked on}} the design and initial {{fabrication}} for the Batmobile (for the 1966 Batman TV series), but when the studio wanted the car sooner than he could deliver, he turned the project over to George Barris who hired Bill Cushenbery to perform the <b>fabrication</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1981, Shetty set up Naveen Structurals and Engineering Co Pvt Ltd, which specialises in skilled <b>fabrication</b> <b>works,</b> {{specific}} to construction industry. Their workshop in Hubli is highly sophisticated, and contains state-of-the-art equipment and machinery. It manufactures shuttering silos, crest gates {{and many other}} specialised structures in the past.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 4.5 {{kilometres}} {{away from}} the dry-dock, and located on 95 hectares of land in a Special Economic Zone approved by the Government of India, a block-making facility {{has been set up}} for fabrication of hull blocks. By having located the workshops and fabrication facilities in a SEZ {{away from the}} dockyard site, it is able to reserve the maximum area of water frontage available at the shipyard site for ship assembly, <b>offshore</b> <b>fabrication</b> and ship repair activities whilst carrying out its fabrication and other similar activities through a SEZ unit. The blocks manufactured at this site are pre-outfitted to the maximum extent. This is done in the ideal working conditions offered by covered fabrication shops. When ready, the blocks are moved to the dock-side for pre-erection of mega/giga-blocks followed by lowering them on the dock floor for final assembly and vessel launching.|$|R
50|$|Yantai Raffles {{specializes in}} <b>offshore</b> and marine <b>fabrication,</b> and {{shares in the}} company have been traded on the Oslo OTC system in Norway since May 2006.|$|R

The company has also done design and <b>fabrication</b> <b>work</b> for Aerojet, Hercules Inc., Motorola, Lockheed Corporation, Martin Marietta, Stanley Aviation, Texas Instruments and Thiokol.|$|R
50|$|The Connell {{shipyard}} {{was closed}} in 1980 after 119 years of shipbuilding. The site was cleared of cranes although {{some evidence of}} the building berths remained visible until about 2004. Part of the yard's covered facilities are used by steel stockholders GKN whilst the riverside berth {{has been used by}} Motherwell Bridge Engineering for heavy <b>fabrication</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
50|$|GSP {{provides}} steel assemblies fabricated in GSP Shipyard, the <b>offshore</b> construction dedicated <b>fabrication</b> facility. The Company’s {{structural steel}} fabrication offering includes jackets, decks, accommodation modules and modular platforms.|$|R
40|$|Current {{offshore}} {{structural design}} guidance, knowhow and standards {{are based on}} Oil & Gas industry research conducted mainly in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Since that time, European Steel Fabricators have made significant advances in volume manufacturing processes and these along with improvements in steel performance, Quality Assurance and advanced structural analysis techniques promise lower cost, reliable steel structures for use in Wind, Wave and Tidal power. In addition, there are several fundamental differences between conventional offshore Oil & Gas structures and those used in the emerging offshore renewable energy sector, not least; the very large volume of similar structures, the unmanned nature of installations and the cost margins involved. These combined with improved capabilities of modern <b>offshore</b> <b>fabrication</b> and design demand a fresh perspective on the Guidance and Standards available to developers. This paper reviews the guidance available and identifies in particular fabrication, material improvement techniques and modelling approaches that {{may be useful in}} the design, operation and maintenance of Offshore Structures for Renewable Energy...|$|R
50|$|Forty-seven vessels were {{constructed}} at the dockyard, including a 15,000-ton floating dock. The engineering works fabricated bolts, castings and steel <b>fabrication</b> <b>work.</b> It assembled electric carriages for the New South Wales Government Railways {{as well as}} trams. The dockyard was eventually abandoned in 1933 after {{the great depression and}} was dismantled and relocated to the new State Dockyard at Dyke End, Carrington.|$|R
50|$|Major {{design and}} <b>fabrication</b> <b>work</b> {{on the first}} car was {{completed}} in 1990. The car utilized a Ninja 600 engine and 10 inch wheels. Wheelbase was 61 inches and the track was 60 inches front 58 inches rear. The car was not ready for the 1990 competition; however, the rolling chassis {{was brought to the}} event which was held at Lawrence Tech.|$|R
5000|$|The early {{magazines}} contained three project vehicles per issue, {{and generally}} featured the step-by-step installation of bolt-on parts and other general upgrades. [...] However, as deadlines became harder {{to meet and}} the magazine's base of readers requested more in-depth information and custom <b>fabrication</b> <b>work,</b> later issues shifted to primarily focusing on one vehicle, with another vehicle being briefly featured later in the issue.|$|R
40|$|Simulation is a {{sophisticated}} concept that has influenced {{the construction industry}} {{for more than three}} decades. Sectors within the construction industry utilize new innovative theories, methods and applications such as simulation modeling. Research in productivity analysis of oilrig and <b>offshore</b> steel structure <b>fabrication</b> has not been adequately studied in comparison to other sectors of the construction industry. Therefore, current research addresses the shortcomings of productivity analysis for <b>offshore</b> <b>fabrications</b> using a combination of concepts from three major areas: <b>offshore</b> engineering, steel <b>fabrication</b> and process modeling. The primary objective of this research consists of modeling fixed steel jacket platform fabrication. In accordance with this objective, a detailed analysis of results for the simulation model will be performed for three different jacket platforms. This thesis presents a new approach that assesses the influence of configuration complexity on total fabrication productivity; as a result, it introduces the Factor of Fabrication Complexity (FFC) in offshore industry. The secondary objective of this research is the assessment of inspection impact on total productivity based on the simulation technique. This research begins with the classification of the oil development process and the application of different platforms in the oil field. Secondly, the full fabrication and installation of steel jacket platforms are described. In this dissertation, three different cases of steel jacket modeling, using MicroCYCLONE as the simulation program, are exercised. Data used in these simulations are based on real conditions from three case studies. In conclusion, results are interpreted to produce insightful graphs and tables based on the industries' requirements and needs to assess the fabrication productivity. Sensitivity analyses are performed to provide engineers and managers with different alternatives for the assessment of inspection on total productivity. Finally, the system output is evaluated where the fabrication model's results closely depict real world practical dat...|$|R

The use of reactive diluents in resin mixture studies with heat resin screening, prepreg process scaleup, and selection of final candidate are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Sawyer's {{introduced}} the View-Master Personal Stereo Camera in 1952. [...] The camera allowed amateurs {{to create their}} own View-Master reels. [...] Most <b>fabrication</b> <b>work</b> on the new camera was carried out by Stereocraft Engineering, the established Sawyer's contractor that had followed Sawyer's in its move to a larger work site in the suburbs. [...] Within two years, the Personal camera had spawned the introduction of a 3-D projector, the Stereomatic 500.|$|R
50|$|Micro lathes {{are well}} suited for use in {{restricted}} spaces where heavy machining or high accuracy are not requirements. Micro lathes {{find a place in}} homes, basements, and garages. As they are a popular tool for hobbyists, they are commonly sold through hobby catalogs and hobby websites. Micro lathes are preferred over larger lathes by some professionals, commonly locksmiths, jewelers, designers, and engineers for prototyping or <b>fabrication</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Porto Amboim is a port town in Angola with a {{population}} of 65,000; it comprises an area of 4,638 km². In the past Porto Amboim was connected by an isolated 123 km [...] narrow gauge railway to Gabela, albeit closed in 1987 due to the civil war and to the abandonment of most coffee plantations, the biggest source of revenue from Gabela. Originally Porto Amboim was known as Kissonde, a small village later colonized in 1587 by the Portuguese naming it Benguela and later Benguela Velha (Old Benguela) due to the creation of another village today known as Benguela located 350 km south of Benguela Velho. In 1923, the name was changed to Porto Amboim.Today (2014) Porto Amboim is one of the growing areas for the offshore industry. The pre-salt in front of the coast of Angola, with Porto Amboim in the centre is a planned development area. With companies as Paenal, a joint venture between Sonangol, SBM and DSME and Heerema Porto Amboim, the two major <b>offshore</b> <b>fabrication</b> yards, Porto Amboim is developing.|$|R
50|$|Despite this rework all M19s {{are very}} prone to damage. The trailer body will bend noticeably when loaded {{away from the}} axle line and {{normally}} stays out of flat. The tow frame is a <b>fabrication</b> <b>work</b> of art, being split, angled, and welded, but {{this results in a}} lot of work and since they appear not to have been coated internally when new, most are now quite weak as a result of internal rusting.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Israel Military Industries (IMI) Jericho 941 (CZ 75 copy) semi-automatic pistols {{were built}} using parts {{supplied by the}} Italian arms house Tanfoglio. Using a well-tested design allowed IMI to avoid the teething problems most new pistol designs experience, and subcontracting much of the basic <b>fabrication</b> <b>work</b> to Tanfoglio allowed IMI to quickly and economically put into production a pistol that would have enough Israeli content to satisfy government contract requirements.|$|R
50|$|The city of Castellane alone {{paid more}} tax than Digne; {{it was an}} {{important}} rural town, both for its judiciary functions (with eight lawyers and five prosecutors) and for its production, with twelve factories: among which were six hat shops, two wax factories, one faïence works, one tile factory, one silk <b>fabrication</b> <b>works,</b> and the leather industry was also represented. A royal post office was also installed in Castellane {{near the end of the}} Ancien Régime.|$|R
