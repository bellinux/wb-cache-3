40|$|Leanthy Medium Voltage {{lines are}} typical in Rural Electrification implementations. The voltae of ends of such lines varies {{drastically}} {{from the time}} of peak loading to mid-night owing to drastic difference i line loaing in Sri Lanka. Therefore consumers at end of long feeders experience very low voltage during peak loading times. Although distribution transformers come with <b>off-load</b> <b>tap</b> adjustments to buck/boost LV voltage, effective use of the full range of this tap setting is restricted due to high variation of voltage drop during the day day night. Hence these <b>off-load</b> <b>tap</b> adjustment may not fully resolve the low voltage problem of some consumers. However, if voltage at the Grid Substained Medium Voltage bus is dynamically adjusted such that voltage at some mid location of the line is maintained constant irrespective of the line load, deviation of voltage along the line can be minimized, The 'Line Drop Compensation' feature available in MK 20 Voltage Regulator provides this feature. Voltage of MV lines of polonnaruwa and suburbs are badly affected due to long distance from Habarana Grid Substation. As a remedy, implementation of LDC in Habarana GSS has been studied. The MV network was modeled and load flow study was carried out with and without LDC for peak and -peak times. The voltage profiles so obtained were used for selection of optimum <b>off-load</b> <b>tap</b> of distribution transformers. The study indicates that the line end voltage is greatly improved, particularly in Polonnaruwa and suburbs, with the implementation of LDC. Hence LV terminal voltage of distribution transformers can be improved to provide customers with better voltage. Therefore, the study recommends suitable parameters of LDC for implementation at Habarana GSS.

50|$|If {{only one}} tap changer is required, {{manually}} operated tap points are usually {{made on the}} high voltage (primary) or lower current winding of the transformer to minimize the current handling requirements of the contacts. However, a transformer may include a tap changer on each winding if there are advantages to do so. For example, in power distribution networks, a large step-down transformer may have an <b>off-load</b> <b>tap</b> changer on the primary winding and an on load automatic tap changer on the secondary winding or windings. The high voltage tap is set to match long term system profile on the high voltage network (typically supply voltage averages) and is rarely changed. The low voltage tap may be requested to change positions multiple times each day, without interrupting the power delivery, to follow loading conditions on the low-voltage (secondary winding) network.|$|R

40|$|A {{distribution}} system {{was designed and}} operated by considering unidirectional power flow from a utility source to end-use loads. The large penetrations of distributed generation (DG) into the existing {{distribution system}} causes a variety of technical problems, such as frequent <b>tap</b> <b>changing</b> problems of the on-load tap changer (OLTC) transformer, local voltage rise, protection coordination, exceeding short-circuit capacity, and harmonic distortion. In view of voltage regulation, the intermittent fluctuation of the DG output power results in frequent <b>tap</b> <b>changing</b> operations of the OLTC transformer. Thus, many utilities limit the penetration level of DG and are eager to find the reasonable penetration limits of DG in the distribution system. To overcome this technical problem, utilities have developed a new voltage regulation method in the distribution system with a large DG penetration level. In this paper, the impact of DG on the OLTC operations controlled by the line drop compensation (LDC) method is analyzed. In addition, a generalized determination methodology for the DG penetration limits in a distribution substation transformer is proposed.

40|$|In a {{distribution}} system, {{it is essential}} to maintain the voltage variation within a specified limit for satisfactory operation of connected customers' equipment. Normally, this goal is achieved by controlling the operation of compensating devices, such as load <b>tap</b> <b>changing</b> transformers, shunt capacitors, series capacitors, shunt reactors, and static VAr compensators. However, technical and regulatory developments are encouraging a greater number of small generator units, known as Distributed Generation (DG), and this has the potential to significantly affect voltage control systems.

The control scheme uses On-load <b>Tap</b> <b>Changing</b> Transformer (OLTC) and DG for voltage corrections, both are driven by advanced Line Drop Compensators (LDC). At the substation, the LDC is employed to control step up or step down decisions of the OLTC, while another LDC will be used at DG connection point to set DG parameters.
