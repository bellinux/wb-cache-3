5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack <b>of</b> <b>object</b> permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept <b>of</b> <b>object</b> permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color <b>of</b> <b>object),</b> and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind <b>of</b> <b>object).</b> Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking and attention between different tasks or operations typically {{in response to a}} change in rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they are able to successfully switch from sorting cards based on the color of the object to sorting based on the type <b>of</b> <b>object</b> on the card.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, the {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially {{believed to be}} a comet. Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting it was a different type <b>of</b> <b>object.</b> This was lost from sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Object {{permanence}} is {{the understanding}} that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be observed (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way).

There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding <b>of</b> <b>object</b> permanence emerges in human development.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development <b>of</b> <b>object</b> permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea <b>of</b> <b>object</b> {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development <b>of</b> <b>object</b> permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{the star}} will {{increase}} its gravitational force, {{which increases the}} number of planets the solar system can have. They will {{also be able to}} attract solar systems composed of stars with lower mass than that of the player, or being attracted to stars with bigger mass. If both stars collide, they will be reduced to a lesser size within the same type <b>of</b> <b>object.</b> For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI-controlled star will be reduced to a small star. Being reduced from small star to life planet is not possible, as well as being reduced from small planet to asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided.|$|E

5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability <b>of</b> <b>object</b> code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E
5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery <b>of</b> <b>object</b> permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E

This can lead to confusion for the infants as {{they may not be able}} to distinguish which words should be extended to label objects being referenced to.

For instance, an infant who hears a word in the presence <b>of</b> <b>object</b> A and object B will be unsure of whether the word is the referent <b>of</b> <b>object</b> A or object B. However, if the infant then hears the label again in the presence <b>of</b> <b>object</b> B and object C, the infant can conclude that object B is the referent of the label because object B consistently pairs with the label across different situations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} joint scaling and {{clustering}} method for dissimilarity (or similarity) data. Dissimilarity (or similarity) data is obtained as showing dissimilarity (or similarity) relationship among {{objects that are}} target data. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a typical method of scaling from the dissimilarity (or similarity) data in order to summarize the relationship <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> in lower dimensional space and obtain a classification structure <b>of</b> the <b>objects</b> in the lower dimensional space. However, the classification structure is obtained by the distance <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> in the lower dimensional space, and the classification {{is not based on}} the original dissimilarity that is given as the data. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a multidimensional scaling that includes the classification structure <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> based on the original dissimilarity data <b>of</b> the <b>objects.</b> We obtain a result of MDS for clusters as the result <b>of</b> clustering <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> based on the original dissimilarity data. This is beneficial if the number <b>of</b> <b>objects</b> is large such as a big data since the number of clusters is much smaller than the number <b>of</b> <b>objects...</b>|$|R
