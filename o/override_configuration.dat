50|$|In SOP, customizations {{are managed}} through an inventive feature called Service Overrides. Through this feature, a service {{implementation}} can be statically or dynamically overridden {{by one of}} many possible implementations at runtime. This feature is analogous to polymorphism in object-oriented programming. Each possible override implementation can be associated {{to one or more}} <b>override</b> <b>configuration</b> portfolios in order to manage activation of groups of related overrides throughout different SOP application installations at the time of deployment.|$|E

40|$|What is OpenSSH {{and where}} to get it OpenSSH is a {{protocol}} suite of network connectivity tools that replace telnet, ftp, rsh, and rcp. It encrypts all traffic (including passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other network-level attacks. OpenSSH comes with most Linux distributions. Use command “ssh-V ” to check the SSH version installed. The latest version can be found from: www. openssh. org Server Configuration sshd is the OpenSSH server (daemon). It is controlled by a configuration file sshd_config which normally resides in /etc/ssh directory. You can specify command-line options to <b>override</b> their <b>configuration</b> file equivalents. Here are some useful options. For the complete list o...|$|R

This is independent of the Window Manager in use and may be <b>overridden</b> by a <b>configuration</b> file. The setxkbmap utility {{can be used to}} temporary enable mouse keys under Xorg: ...|$|R
5000|$|RSTP {{calls the}} {{connection}} between two or more switches as a [...] "link-type" [...] connection. A port that operates in full-duplex mode {{is assumed to be}} point-to-point link, whereas a half-duplex port (through a hub) is considered a shared port by default. This automatic link type setting can be <b>overridden</b> by explicit <b>configuration.</b> RSTP improves convergence on point-to-point links by reducing the Max-Age time to 3 times Hello interval, removing the STP listening state, and exchanging a handshake between two switches to quickly transition the port to forwarding state. RSTP does not do anything differently from STP on shared links.|$|R
40|$|Quantification {{of stress}} {{accumulation}} and release during subduction zone seismic cycles {{requires an understanding}} of the distribution of fault slip during earthquakes. Reconstructions of slip are typically constrained to a single, known fault plane. Yet, slip has been shown to occur on multiple faults within the subducting plate 1 owing to stress triggering 2, resulting in phenomena such as earthquake doublets 3. However, rapid stress triggering from the plate interface to faults in the overriding plate has not been documented. Here we analyse seismic data from the magnitude 7. 1 Araucania earthquake that occurred in the Chilean subduction zone in 2011. We find that the earthquake, which was reported as a single event in global moment tensor solutions 4, 5, was instead composed of two ruptures on two separate faults. Within 12 ?s a thrust earthquake on the plate interface triggered a second large rupture on a normal fault 30 ?km away in the <b>overriding</b> plate. This <b>configuration</b> of partitioned rupture is consistent with normal-faulting mechanisms in the ensuing aftershock sequence. We conclude that plate interface rupture can trigger almost instantaneous slip in the overriding plate of a subduction zone. This shallow upper-plate rupture may be masked from teleseismic data, posing a challenge for real-time tsunami warning systems...|$|R
50|$|Support for {{wireless}} networks {{is built}} into the network stack itself as a new set of APIs called Native Wifi, and does not emulate wired connections, {{as was the case with}} previous versions of Windows. This allows implementation of wireless-specific features such as larger frame sizes and optimized error recovery procedures. Native Wifi is exposed by Auto Configuration Module (ACM) which replaces Windows XP's Wireless Zero Configuration. The ACM is extensible, so developers can incorporate additional wireless functionality (such as automatic wireless roaming) and <b>override</b> the automatic <b>configuration</b> and connection logic without affecting the built-in framework. It is easier to find wireless networks in range and tell which networks are open and which are closed. Hidden wireless networks, which do not advertise their name (SSID) are better supported. Security for wireless networks is improved with improved support for newer wireless standards like 802.11i. EAP-TLS is the default authentication mode. Connections are made at the most secure connection level supported by the wireless access point. WPA2 can be used even in ad-hoc mode. Windows Vista also provides a Fast Roaming service that will allow users to move from one access point to another without loss of connectivity. Preauthentication with the new wireless access point can be used to retain the connectivity. Wireless networks are managed from either the Connect to a network dialog box within the GUI or the netsh wlan command from the shell. Settings for wireless networks can also be configured using Group policy.|$|R
