40|$|A STUDY OF OZONE AT RAILROAD VALLEY, NV and TRINIDAD HEAD, CA Ozone (Oᴣ) {{is a form}} {{of oxygen}} that protects the planet Earth from deadly {{ultraviolet}} rays emitted by the sun; without this triatomic molecule high in the atmosphere, life processes on the planet would be impossible. Ozone is an air pollutant and toxic in the lowest part of the atmosphere, and inhaling it could cause permanent damage to animals’ respiratory system. Long term exposure to high concentration of ozone has been linked with the development of asthma in children. Because of its complicated role in our atmosphere, scientists are studying its depletion and recovery in the stratosphere, and the minimization of ozone formation in the atmospheric boundary layer (the lowest part of the atmosphere). Here at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), the Atmospheric Branch of Earth Science Division is conducting a study to examine and compare ozone concentrations in the atmospheric boundary layer (0 to ~ 2 km above the surface of the Earth) to those of the free troposphere (~ 2 km to ~ 10 km, where regional transport occurs), and to validate the accuracy of the <b>ozone</b> <b>instrument</b> used in the experiment. Using a 2 BTechnology, Inc., Dual Beam Ozone Monitor installed inside the wing pod of an Alpha jet aircraft based at Moffett Field vertical profiles of ozone concentrations have been collected at Trinidad Head, California, and Railroad Valley (RRV), Nevada.

The archived data are available at:[URL] //croc. gsfc. nasa. gov/shadoz. In Thompson et al., accuracies and imprecisions in the SHADOZ 1998 - 2000 dataset were examined using ground-based instruments and the TOMS total ozone measurement (version 7) as references.

Ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate all increased with plume aging. The observed ammonium increase was a factor of 3. 9 ± 2. 6 in about 4 h, but accounted for just ~ 36 % of the gaseous ammonia lost on a molar basis. Some of the gas phase NH 3 loss {{may have been due}} to condensation on, or formation of, particles below the AMS detection range. NOx was converted to PAN and particle nitrate with PAN production being about two times greater than production of observable nitrate over a 4 h aging period. The excess aerosol light scattering in the plume (normalized to excess CO 2 ) increased by a factor of 2. 3 ± 0. 7 over 4 h. The increase in light scattering was similar to that observed in an earlier study of a biomass burning plume in Mexico where significant secondary formation of OA closely tracked the increase in scattering. In the California plume, however, ΔOA/ΔCO 2 decreased sharply for the first hour and then increased slowly with a net decrease of ~ 24 % over 4 h. The fraction of thickly coated rBC particles increased almost twofold over the 4 h aging period. Decreasing OA accompanied by increased scattering/coating in the initial aging may be due to a combination of particle coagulation and evaporation processes. Recondensation of species initially evaporated from the particles {{may have contributed to the}} subsequent slow rise in OA.
