40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the consequences of}} assuming <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> between the principal and each of his agents in an otherwise standard mechanism design setting. Doing so simplifies optimal mechanisms and institutions. It restores both {{the continuity of the}} principal’s and the agents’ payoffs and that of the optimal mechanism with respect to the information structure. Nevertheless, it still maintains the useful role of correlation to better extract the agents’ information rent. We first prove a Revelation Principle with <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> that characterizes the set of allocations implementable under <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> by means of simple non-manipulability constraints. We also demonstrate a Taxation Principle which helps drawing some links between <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> and limited commitment on the principal’s side. Equipped with those tools, we derive optimal non-manipulable mechanisms in various environments (separable projects, multi-unit auctions, team productions) ...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) is {{the study}} of how to reason about knowledge, belief, and communication. This paper studies the {{relative}} expressivity of certain fragments of the DEL language for public and <b>private</b> <b>communication.</b> It is shown that the language of public communication with common knowledge and the language of <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> with common knowledge are expressively incomparable for the class of all pointed Kripke models, which provides a formal proof that public and <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> are fundamentally different in the presence of common knowledge. It is also shown that single-recipient <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> does not add expressive power to the language of modal logic with common knowledge for any class of transitive pointed Kripke models. The latter result provides a sense in which positive introspection—believing our own beliefs—induces a kind of self-dialog. 1 The Paradigmatic Approach in Formal Epistemology Since Hintikka [8], the paradigmatic approach in formal epistemology has been to use modal logic to reason about the doxastic attitudes (that is, things like propositional knowledge an...|$|R

As an extension of our recent work, this paper proposes a new analogue <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> scheme based on hybrid chaotic systems with delays.

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} several converse bounds on {{the private}} transmission capabilities of a quantum channel. The main conceptual development builds firmly {{on the notion of}} a private state, which is a powerful, uniquely quantum method for simplifying the tripartite picture of privacy involving local operations and public classical communication to a bipartite picture of quantum privacy involving local operations and classical communication. This approach has previously led to some of the strongest upper bounds on secret key rates, including the squashed entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement. Here we use this approach along with a "privacy test" to establish a general meta-converse bound for <b>private</b> <b>communication,</b> which has a number of applications. The meta-converse allows for proving that any quantum channel's relative entropy of entanglement is a strong converse rate for <b>private</b> <b>communication.</b> For covariant channels, the meta-converse also leads to second-order expansions of relative entropy of entanglement bounds for <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> rates. For such channels, the bounds also apply to the <b>private</b> <b>communication</b> setting in which the sender and receiver are assisted by unlimited public classical communication, and as such, they are relevant for establishing various converse bounds for quantum key distribution protocols conducted over these channels. We find precise characterizations for several channels of interest and apply the methods to establish several converse bounds {{on the private}} transmission capabilities of all phase-insensitive bosonic channels.
