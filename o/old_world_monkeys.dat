5|$|The primary {{determinant}} of infection for any virus {{is its ability}} to enter a cell and produce additional infectious particles. The presence of CD155 is thought to define the animals and tissues that can be infected by poliovirus. CD155 is found (outside of laboratories) only on the cells of humans, higher primates, and <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Poliovirus is, however, strictly a human pathogen, and does not naturally infect any other species (although chimpanzees and <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> can be experimentally infected).|$|E

5|$|Saadanius had {{a longer}} face than living catarrhines and lacked the {{advanced}} frontal sinus (airspaces in the facial bones) found in living catarrhines.

The discovery of Saadanius may help answer questions about the evolution and appearance of the last common ancestors of <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> and apes.|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon (Papio anubis), {{also called}} the Anubis baboon, {{is a member of}} the family Cercopithecidae (<b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys).</b> The species is the most wide-ranging of all baboons, being found in 25 {{countries}} throughout Africa, extending from Mali eastward to Ethiopia and Tanzania. Isolated populations are also present in some mountainous regions of the Sahara. It inhabits savannahs, steppes, and forests. The common name is derived from its coat color, which is a shade of green-grey at a distance. A variety of communications, vocal and non-vocal, facilitate a complex social structure.|$|E
5|$|Saadanius had {{a longer}} face than living catarrhines, more closely {{resembling}} New World monkeys in appearance, {{although it was}} larger—possibly {{the size of a}} gibbon. Its enlarged, deep-rooted canine teeth, the diastema (space) between its canine teeth and second incisors, and its sagittal crest (ridge of bone running lengthwise down the top of the skull) suggest that the specimen was a male. These features are shared among male <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Saadanius lacks the advanced frontal sinus found in living catarrhines, but it does possess an ectotympanic, or bony ear tube, found in living catarrhines. Propliopithecoids, the oldest stem group of catarrhines, which date back 35 to 30mya, lacked a fully developed ectotympanic.|$|E
5|$|Some lemurs exhibit female philopatry, where females {{stay within}} their natal range and the males migrate upon {{reaching}} maturity, {{and in other}} species both sexes will migrate. In some cases, female philopatry may help explain the evolution of female-bonded multi-male groups, {{such as those of}} the ring-tailed lemur, Milne-Edwards' sifaka (Propithecus edwardsi), and the Verreaux's sifaka. Their ancestors may have been more solitary, with females that lived in mother-daughter pairs (or dyads). Over time, these dyads may have allied themselves with other neighboring mother-daughter dyads in order to defend more distributed resources in a wide home range. If this is true, then multi-male groups in lemurs may differ fundamentally in their internal structure from those in catarrhine primates (<b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> and apes).|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Saadanius provides new evidence for competing hypotheses about the facial {{appearance of the}} ancestral crown catarrhines, or common ancestor. One reconstruction is based on living catarrhine traits and predicts a short face and a rounded braincase, {{similar to that of}} a gibbon. Another reconstruction, based on the morphology of early Miocene apes and the basal cercopithecoid Victoriapithecus, predicts that the last common ancestor had a projecting snout and tall face, like that of living baboons and the oldest fossil apes and <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys.</b> The conservative features of Saadanius, {{similar to those of the}} older stem catarrhines, support the latter hypothesis, according to Zalmout et al. However, one palaeontologist, Eric Delson, has cautioned that geological pressure may have distorted the shape of the skull.|$|E
25|$|The ID {{between humans}} and gorillas was {{determined}} to be 1.09, that {{between humans and}} chimpanzees was determined as 1.14. However the distance to six different <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> was on average 2.46, indicating that the African apes are more closely related to humans than to monkeys. The authors consider the divergence time between <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> and hominoids to be 30 million years ago (MYA), based on fossil data, and the immunological distance was considered to grow at a constant rate. They concluded that divergence time of humans and the African apes to be roughly ~5 MYA. That was a surprising result. Most scientists at that time thought that humans and great apes diverged much earlier (>15 MYA).|$|E
25|$|Current {{methods to}} {{determine}} divergence times use DNA sequence alignments and molecular clocks. Usually the molecular clock is calibrated {{assuming that the}} orangutan split from the African apes (including humans) 12-16 MYA. Some studies also include some <b>old</b> <b>world</b> <b>monkeys</b> and set the divergence time of them from hominoids to 25-30 MYA. Both calibration points are based on very little fossil data and have been criticized.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, the Mecca area {{became an}} {{important}} site for paleontology with respect to primate evolution, {{with the discovery of}} a Saadanius fossil.

The fossil habitat, near what is now the Red Sea in western Saudi Arabia, was a damp forest area between 28 million and 29 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Apes, in turn, {{belong to}} the primate order (>400 species), along with the <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys,</b> the New World monkeys, and others. Data from both {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) indicate that primates {{belong to the}} group of Euarchontoglires, together with Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Dermoptera, and Scandentia. This is further supported by Alu-like short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) which have been found only in members of the Euarchontoglires.|$|E
25|$|The {{thumb is}} not opposable in all primates— some primates, {{such as the}} spider monkey and colobus, are {{virtually}} thumbless.

25|$|The {{rhesus macaque}} (Macaca mulatta) {{is one of}} the best-known species of <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys.</b> It is listed as Least Concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and its {{tolerance}} of a broad range of habitats. Native to South, Central, and Southeast Asia, rhesus macaque troops inhabit a great variety of habitats, from grasslands to arid and forested areas, but also close to human settlements.|$|E
25|$|In most Catarrhini (<b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> and apes—primates {{closely related}} to humans) there are three types of color receptors (known as cone cells), {{resulting}} in trichromatic color vision. These primates, like humans, are known as trichromats. Many other primates (including New World monkeys) and other mammals are dichromats, which is the general color vision state for mammals that are active during the day (i.e., felines, canines, ungulates). Nocturnal mammals may {{have little or no}} color vision. Trichromat non-primate mammals are rare.|$|E
25|$|The {{divergence}} time {{of humans}} from other apes {{is of great}} interest. One of the first molecular studies, published in 1967 measured immunological distances (IDs) between different primates. Basically the study measured the strength of immunological response that an antigen from one species (human albumin) induces in the immune system of another species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla and <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys).</b> Closely related species should have similar antigens and therefore weaker immunological response to each other's antigens. The immunological response of a species to its own antigens (e.g. human to human) was set to be 1.|$|E

25|$|Gray langurs or Hanuman langurs, {{the most}} {{widespread}} langurs of the Indian Subcontinent, are a group of <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> constituting {{the entirety of the}} genus Semnopithecus (from Ancient Greek σεμνός semnós, “revered, august, holy”, and πίθηκος píthēkos, “ape, monkey”). All taxa have traditionally been placed in the single species Semnopithecus entellus. In 2001, it was recommended that several distinctive former subspecies should be given species status, so that seven species are recognized. A taxonomic classification with fewer species has also been proposed. Genetic evidence suggests that the Nilgiri langur and purple-faced langur, which usually are placed in the genus Trachypithecus, actually belong in Semnopithecus.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even among}} primates, full color vision differs between New World and <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Old World primates, {{including}} monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. New World monkeys {{may or may}} not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats. Visual sensitivity differences between males and females in a single species is due to the gene for yellow-green sensitive opsin protein (which confers ability to differentiate red from green) residing on the X sex chromosome.|$|E
50|$|New <b>World</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Many New <b>World</b> <b>monkeys</b> in {{the family}} Atelidae, which {{includes}} howler monkeys, spider monkeys and woolly monkeys, have grasping tails often with a bare tactile pad.
