5|$|Nest mate {{recognition}} is widespread in many eusocial insects. However, {{when there are}} no physical differences in either diet or nesting materials, many can no longer discriminate nest mate from other conspecifics. Recently, however, it has been indicated that many insects have the ability to discriminate relatives even having lived in identical environments with their non-relative counterpart. Studies have indicated that in Polistes fuscatus, former nestmates would nest in areas located close together near their natal nests the following spring. Social halictid bees also are able to recognize their relatives. In Polistes exclamans, it has been indicated that discrimination <b>of</b> <b>relatives</b> from non-relatives, even having lived in identical environments, is possible. This was found by Allen, Schulze Kellman, and Gamboa through an experiment in which hibernating wasps from different nests were put in a box together after being raised in identical environments. As the number of unrelated groups of wasps increased, the more clumps were formed in the box. This indicates that the wasps were capable of differentiating relative from nonrelative, an adaptive ability in the defense of their nest.|$|E

Seventh in line were the grandsons of maternal uncles of the father and then grandsons of maternal aunts of the father.

5|$|The {{difference}} between {{the male and female}} of a species apart from their sex organs is called sexual dimorphism, and in this regard little variance exists among the canids. A study of dire wolf remains dated 15,360–14,310YBP and taken from one pit that focused on skull length, canine tooth size, and lower molar length showed little dimorphism, {{similar to that of the}} gray wolf, indicating that dire wolves lived in monogamous pairs. Their large size and highly carnivorous dentition supports the proposal that the dire wolf was a predator that fed on large prey. To kill ungulates larger than themselves, the African wild dog, the dhole, and the gray wolf depend on their jaws as they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with prey, and they work together as a pack consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring from the current and previous years. It can be assumed that dire wolves lived in packs <b>of</b> <b>relatives</b> that were led by an alpha pair. Large and social carnivores would have been successful at defending carcasses of prey trapped in the tar pits from smaller solitary predators, and thus the most likely to become trapped themselves. The many C.d.guildayi and Smilodon remains found in the tar pits suggests that both were social predators.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{makes clear}} an {{important}} distinction in relative clauses in Germanic and Romance languages based on morphological forms <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> pronouns and structural positions <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> clauses within DP. I claim {{that there are two}} types <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> clauses : (i) a relative clause which allows an overt relative pronoun only when it is accompanied by a pied-piped preposition; and (ii) a relative clause with an overt relative pronoun, allowing larger constituents to be pied-piped. In the second type <b>of</b> the <b>relative</b> clause only a d-pronoun or a complex pronoun with the form of a determiner and a wh-word is used. Under this typology <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> clauses, two points are shown. The first is that English infinitival relatives, which do not allow an occurrence <b>of</b> an overt <b>relative</b> pronoun without a pied-piped preposition, constitute the first type <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> clauses. The second is that English finite relatives are peculiar from a cross-linguistic perspective. Only a d-pronoun or a complex pronoun can be bare in Germanic and Romance languages whereas in English, a wh-pronoun can be "bare" (i. e. without pied-piped constituents). Concerning the peculiarity of English wh-pronouns, investigation of a historical change <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> clauses in English suggests the reason why they have such a property...|$|R
