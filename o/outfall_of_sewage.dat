Four different stations situated around the course of the river at considerable distances have been selected from the <b>outfall</b> <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> canals at Kulti-Ghushighata (S 1), where metropolitan sewages discharged and mixed up into water of Bidyadhari river, which ultimately carried through this river via stations Malancha (S 2), Kanmari (S 3) to Dhamakhali (S 4), just before the river confluences with the larger Raimangal river at northern Sundarban delta. This study was conducted to estimate total mercury (Hg) concentration in waters (during high tides and ebb tides) and sediments of Bidyadhari river in pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons during the period from March, 2012 to February, 2013 at those stations. It is revealed from the estimated data that agricultural runoff, sewage, effluents from various industries and Kolkata metropolitan, Salt Lake City and adjacent areas of North 24 Parganas district carried and discharged in Bidyadhari river through sewage canals are not so high in mercury content for sediment contamination but alarming in respect of water quality, which crosses the permissible limit of Hg for consumption (0. 001 ppm) in wide range of areas at Kanmari and Dhamakhali around the estuary. Enhancement of Hg level in this river water and transportation of the metal through tidal effects to and fro mangrove land of Sundarban may be dangerous for aquatic lives and supposed to be grave concern for the ecology of the Sundarban delta including human...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} design <b>of</b> marine <b>sewage</b> disposal systems {{in accordance with the}} criteria of the EU Bathing Water Directive is developed and applied to the design <b>of</b> the <b>outfall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sewage</b> from Athens, Greece. The model calculates the reduction of fecal coliforms due to initial and subsequent dilutions and die-off due to the effect of solar radiation and predicts the concentrations of fecal coliforms at the bathing area for specific hours and current velocities. A combination of these results with the probability distribution of the velocity of the sea currents results in a frequency distribution of fecal coliform concentrations at the bathing area thus enabling evaluations with respect to conformity to the statistical criteria of the EU Directive. The application of the model to the disposal system for the <b>sewage</b> <b>of</b> Athens shows that conformity, without the use of effluent disinfection, can be achieved for the nearest bathing area, located at a distance of 3. 4 km from the <b>outfall,</b> irrespective <b>of</b> the definition of the bathing hours (8 am- 8 pm or 24 hrs) and for a sufficiently conservative mortality rate. These results indicate that under Mediterranean or similar conditions, with typical wind induced currents, a sewage field travel distance of a few kilometres is sufficient to ensure bathing areas against infection, without the need for sewage disinfection.

Moreover, there is also a waste disposal of the fluorescent lamps wasters and other dangerous waste located about two kilometers far from the former factory. Soil samples from the waste disposal area as well as river sediment, samples taken in the Tichá Orlice river and the Králický brook have been analyzed Mercury, cadmium, lead, chromium, nickel, copper and arsenic levels in the samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry.

To achieve a good status of a river water by the end of 2015, as provided in the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000 / 60 /EC, is necessary to know the quality starting point. To this end, several endpoints are expected by the WFD, including Daphnia toxicity test and macroinvertebrate community analysis. River water sampling was conducted in the four seasons, from upstream to downstream a sewage treatment plant. I endpoint. At the <b>outfall</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sewage</b> treatment plant, river water showed very high acute toxicity to Daphnia only in summer; some toxic effect can be found also upstream in spring. Results at the outfall were consistent with the hypothesis that disinfectants, mainly used in summer to treat discharging waters, are responsible of river water acute toxicity: Daphnia tests with each disinfectant (NaClO, PAA, ClO 2) showed high toxicity. River waters were also utilized in Daphnia reproduction tests. Samples at the outfall (excluding the summer one, undoubtedly toxic) caused slight reduction in survival and fecundity. Disinfectants were also checked in reproduction tests. Still at NOEC 24 h, they caused a significant toxicity on both death rate and reproduction. II endpoint.

40|$|Much {{research}} has been done on the stability of stones in breaking waves, but up to now, most of these studies were based on experiments with slopes varying from 1 : 1 to 1 : 7. The stability of stones on mild slopes, slopes not steeper than 1 : 10, has not yet been researched very extensively. Applications of mild slopes in practice are for example landfalls of oil pipelines and <b>outfalls</b> <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> systems. The objective {{of this study is to}} improve the theoretical knowledge of the stability of stones on mild slopes in the surf zone by researching the flow in breaking waves. The stability relations for stones on mild slopes established so far, followed the trend of experimental results quite well in a qualitative way, but the difference in stability for spilling breakers and plunging breakers was predicted too small by the relations. Probably the main reason of this imperfection is the influence of the plunging jet in a plunging breaker. Therefore, the processes which take place in plunging breakers are studied. From a study by Basco (1985) it was concluded that processes in spilling and plunging breakers are similar, albeit that the vortex systems in plunging breakers are of a much larger scale. Experiments were carried out in the large wave flume of the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics for a better understanding of the stability of stones on a slope subjected to wave attack. The model structure consisted of a 1 : 10 impermeable slope, on which a layer of stones (Dnso = 1. 21 cm) was laid. Only regular waves were used, because these wave are more suitable for researching the flow in a particular wave. For three waves with different wave steepnesses, incipient motion of the stones was determined. SUbsequently, in the breaking regions of these waves, velocity measurements were carried out by means of LDV and video recordings. From the damage experiments it was concluded that maximum damage was located at about h/Ho = 0. 6 and that the direction of displacement of the stones depends on the breaker parameter. Furthermore, the stone displacement in upslope direction seemed to be caused by the plunging jets of the breaking waves. The velocities in the plunging jet were equivalent for the three different waves, which is in line with the fact that these waves cause incipient motion. The plunging jets of the breaking waves cause incipient motion of the stones. Up to now no theories were available for the stone stability in plunging jets. Therefore, an attempt was made to model the stone stability in a plunging jet. Two different models were considered, which both schematize the plunging jet on a stone as static forces on a single cubical stone. From the modelling it was concluded that the results deviate from experimental results. The missing of the turbulent fluctuations of the jet and to a less extent the dynamic characteristics of the stone stability were probably the main reasons of this deviation. Nevertheless, the modelling can improve the theoretical understanding of the stone stability in plunging jets. The numerical results of the stability relation by Izbash for uniform flow are close to the experimental results. Therefore, it seems that stone stability in a plunging jet is not as unfavourable as expected, compared to stone stability in uniform flow. The resulting stability equations for the stone stability in plunging breakers is in conformance with existing relations. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

The contents of Cu, Zn and Pb in the mixed soil did not exceed the Environmental quality standards for soils in China for Grade II (GB- 1518 - 1995). Wheat obtained good growth activities after the application <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> sludge, however, high land application <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> sludge (the ratio of sludge in the mixed soil of dry weight was 20 % and 25 %) inhibited seed emergence and root length.
