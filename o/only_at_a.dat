According to Hareide, the actions were in line with the parliamentary stance on the issue.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} proposal {{would keep the}} existing station open but with many services calling <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, who said that having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away.|$|E

5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E
5|$|Fourier {{series are}} used to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A discrete version of the Fourier series {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT {{is one of the key}} tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.|$|E
5|$|In January 1141 William {{was elected}} Archbishop of York. Originally, the cathedral chapter of York had elected Waltheof in 1140, but that {{election}} was set aside {{because one of}} Waltheof's supporters had made an uncanonical gift to secure Waltheof's election. Then Henry of Blois tried to secure the see for Henry de Sully, another nephew of Stephen and Henry's. Sully's election was opposed by Pope Innocent II, who refused to confirm him as archbishop while he retained his post as Abbot of Fécamp. It was <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> third election, held in January 1141, that William was selected. Whether {{he had been a}} candidate in the previous two elections is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the United States posed a grain embargo upon the Soviet Union. This {{was an attempt}} by the U.S. utilize food power, however, it was not confirmed. The Soviets thus {{imported}} grain from different suppliers, leading to an increase in grain imports during that time period, <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher cost.

5|$|On {{the same}} day as Wedel arrived, 20 July, Saltykov {{established}} himself astride the Prussian communication line at the Oder, strengthening his already formidable position. This effectively cut any Prussian advance or reinforcement from Crossen (Krosno) or Frankfurt on the Oder. At this point, the Russians occupied the heights by Kay and additional high ground by Mosau (Mozów). A stream, the Eichmühlen Fliess, flowed in a swampy depression just to the east of the town. It could be crossed <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> single narrow point on the road east of Kay, directly opposite the Russian center; a second crossing could be made immediately south of Kay, which would permit an assault on the Russian right flank. This seemed reasonable to Wedel, but only if the Russians were not fully deployed.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Artillery had {{available}} a {{total of}} 676 howitzers and field guns: 310 Krupp 75mm field guns, partly produced in licence; 52 105mm Bofors howitzers, the only really modern pieces; 144 obsolete Krupp 125mm guns; 40 150mm sFH13's; 72 Krupp 150mm L/24 howitzers and 28 Vickers 152mm L/15 howitzers.
