5|$|In {{the eighth}} inning, Myles Thomas {{came in to}} relieve Shocker, who had given up three hits and two unearned runs {{in less than an}} inning of work. Meanwhile, Alexander shut down the Yankees offense {{for the rest of the}} game. In the top of the ninth inning, the Cardinals {{increased}} their lead back to eight runs after Hornsby had an RBI groundout, scoring Southworth. Alexander finished with his second complete game of the series and gave up only two runs on eight hits, while striking <b>out</b> <b>six</b> batters. The three Yankee pitchers combined to give up thirteen hits, seven earned runs, three unearned runs, and one home run.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2014, Beckett {{pitched a}} no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park, the 21st no-hitter in Dodgers history, {{and the first}} since Hideo Nomo did so in the 1996 season. He threw 128 pitches, struck <b>out</b> <b>six,</b> and walked three {{en route to the}} victory. Beckett also became the oldest pitcher (34) to throw a no hitter since Randy Johnson (40) threw a perfect game in 2004. He was honored as the National League Player of the Week {{as a result of that}} game.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the mid-1990s, the Daddies toured constantly, {{carrying}} <b>out</b> <b>six</b> cross-country {{tours in}} 1996 alone following {{the release of}} their third independent album, Kids on the Street. A remarkable musical departure from their previous work, Kids on the Street was primarily a showcase of the ska influences which had gradually become {{a major part of}} the Daddies' live sound, forgoing their usual brassy funk and swing-based eclecticism in favor of guitar-driven ska, rock and punk. Distributed by noted indie label Caroline Records, Kids on the Street wound up becoming the Daddies' then-most successful release, remaining on The Rockets Retail Sales Top Twenty for over seven months and eventually working its way onto Rolling Stones Alternative Charts.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} flank, {{north of the}} road, the North Koreans overran the {{battalion}} observation post and B Company's outpost line. This high ground changed hands three times during the day. While the infantry fight was in progress, and shortly after the first tank penetration, five more T-34s came around the road bend toward the US 71st Tank Battalion. Check had called for an air strike when the first tanks appeared. Three F-80 Shooting Stars arrived and immediately dived on the approaching group of tanks, destroying three of them with 5-inch rockets. Altogether, bazooka, artillery, and air strikes knocked <b>out</b> <b>six</b> North Korean tanks during the morning, either within or {{on the edge of}} the 1st Battalion position. In its first engagement with American troops, the NK 2nd Division lost all but two of the eight tanks that had been attached to it a few days earlier at Chongju.|$|E
5|$|Richard started {{eight games}} with the Bears in 1973 and posted minor league career-worsts in ERA and hits allowed per nine innings. Despite his poor {{performance}} with the Bears, Richard was again called up by the Astros. Richard entered in the fourth inning of a June 16 game against the St. Louis Cardinals and his idol Bob Gibson. He pitched four innings of one-run ball and three innings of a two-hit game in his next relief outing. Afterwards, the Astros placed Richard in the starting rotation, and {{he made his first}} major league start since July 30 of the previous year. He pitched six solid innings of a one-run ballgame and struck <b>out</b> <b>six</b> while walking three batters. Richard would make his next start four days later. Richard again pitched more than six innings but earned no decision after the Astros' bullpen gave up nine runs during the top of the ninth inning.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 season {{seemed to}} mark a rebound in Zito's {{pitching}} performance. Though starting the season 0–2 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended {{the season with}} an ERA of 4.03. His ERA would have been 3.74 {{had it not been}} for his first two starts. Though going only 10–13 in the season, Zito's record was much more the fault of his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his performance on the mound. On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in the seventh inning. He won the game, his fourth win of the season. On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. He pitched 8⅓ innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on four hits, striking <b>out</b> <b>six,</b> and walking one. He won the game, his fifth win of the season.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{promoted}} deGrom to {{the major}} leagues on May 12, 2014, after Gonzalez Germen {{was placed on the}} disabled list. The Mets planned to use deGrom in relief, but an injury to Dillon Gee required the Mets to insert him into their starting rotation. DeGrom made his major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New York Yankees in Citi Field. He faced fellow rookie Chase Whitley, also making his MLB debut. He pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking <b>out</b> <b>six,</b> but the Yankees shut out the Mets and won 1–0. DeGrom also collected his first MLB hit in the game in his first career at bat. It was the first hit by a Mets pitcher in the 2014 season ending an 0-for-64 hitless streak, the worst collective mark by a pitching staff to begin a season in MLB history.|$|E
5|$|Alexandre Villaplane captained France in {{its first}} FIFA World Cup match in 1930 {{and went on to}} captain the team in the entire tournament. Maurice Cottenet was the first goalkeeper to captain the {{national}} team. Alex Thépot was the second and bore the armband at the 1934 FIFA World Cup. The team's first captain after World War II was Alfred Aston. Aston captained the team for the first time {{in its first}} match following the conclusion of the war, a 3–1 win over Belgium on Christmas Eve 1944, and subsequently led the team <b>out</b> <b>six</b> more times. Following Aston, the captaincy was rotated among striker Jean Baratte and defenders Roger Marche and Robert Jonquet. Marche and Jonquet alternated the armband at the 1954 and 1958 editions of the FIFA World Cup. Following the retirement of Baratte, Marche took primary control of the captaincy and guided the team until his international retirement in 1960. The former Stade de Reims defender held the record of captaining France the most until he was surpassed by Michel Platini in 1986. Platini is the first France captain to lead the team to victory in a major international competition. He accomplished this feat at UEFA Euro 1984. In 2000, Platini was surpassed by Didier Deschamps, who captained France to its first FIFA World Cup title in 1998. Deschamps surpassed Platini during UEFA Euro 2000 in the team's semi-final match against Portugal. France won the match, 2–1. In the final, France defeated Italy, giving Deschamps his second major honour as captain. Deschamps was succeeded by Marcel Desailly, who ranks second in captaining France the most. Desailly captained France to victory at both the 2001 and 2003 editions of the FIFA Confederations Cup.|$|E

5|$|From the Lindley Library, Stearn (see 1950 Photograph) {{moved to}} the Botany Department at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington in 1952, {{and by the time}} he retired in 1976, he was the Senior Principal Scientific Officer there. He had now {{achieved}} his aim of becoming a research scientist, despite lack of formal qualifications, enabling him to spend more of his time collecting and studying plants. During this time the Museum was undergoing steady expansion, with new staff and programmes. At the Museum he was put in charge of Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the Dicotyledons in the Bentham & Hooker system, i.e. Monochlamydae) and floristic treatment of the regions of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including work on the Museum's Flora of Jamaica and the Nepal flora he started work on during the war. Seven volumes of the Flora of Jamaica had appeared prior to the Second World War. Although the project was revived after the war, and Stearn carried <b>out</b> <b>six</b> months of field work in Jamaica, it never came to fruition; no further volumes appeared. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the footsteps of Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), whose collection had been left to the Natural History Museum. Stearn's generic work at the museum concentrated on Allium, Lilium and Paeonia. He continued to travel widely, with field work in Europe (particularly Greece), Australia, and the United States, and published 200 papers during his twenty-four years at the Museum, and although the library was not his responsibility, he spent much time there adding written notes to many of the critical texts.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was sent}} back to Buffalo for the 1946 season, now with Gabby Hartnett as his manager (Harris having moved to the team's front office), but missed most of the year with a back injury which was {{attributed}} to overwork. After the 1947 season in Buffalo, where Richards was now his manager, he returned to Detroit in 1948, spending most of the season in the bullpen but making five starts and posting a 3–0 record; he had yet added very little weight since his high school days, being still at 148 pounds. He made his first start, and earned his first major league victory, on August 8 against the Washington Senators, pitching 7⅔ innings and striking <b>out</b> <b>six</b> in a 6–5 victory in which he also drove in a run with a triple and scored. However, Pierce also issued 51 walks in 55⅓ innings that year, and concerns about his pitching control led the Tigers to trade him to the White Sox on November 10 for catcher Aaron Robinson and $10,000, in what most baseball historians consider {{to be one of the}} most one-sided trades in baseball history. Talks had initially centered on Chicago acquiring Pierce's high school teammate Ted Gray, although sources differ as to whether it was White Sox general manager Frank Lane or his Detroit counterpart Billy Evans who switched the focus to Pierce; the Tigers tried to call off the deal one day after it was completed upon fully realizing what they had given up, even offering $50,000 to get Pierce back, but Lane had no intention of giving up the steal he had accomplished in his first trade as general manager.|$|E
5|$|The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Special) {{constructed}} prototype {{atomic weapons}} (without nuclear material) and drop tested them. Little {{was known about}} the flight characteristics of the prototype atom bomb designs and how the fusing mechanism would work. In February 1945, a Flight Test Section was created within the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to carry out testing with prototype bombs {{in the shape of}} the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried <b>out</b> <b>six</b> days later.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall had no {{intentions}} to retire. He continued onto the early 1955 {{tour of the}} West Indies, the first by an Australian team to the Caribbean. Lindwall was determined to enjoy himself, having recovered from his recent illness. By day, he and Miller battled with the three W's but at night they socialised. However, Lindwall needed respite and dietary discipline in order to completely ward off his hepatitis. He {{was no longer the}} reveller that Miller once knew. After Australia had made 9/515, Lindwall took a match total of 6/124, as the hosts were forced to follow on in the First Test at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica. Australia went on to win by nine wickets. The team's travelled to Queen's Park in Trinidad for the Second Test, where the West Indies batted first and made 382. This time Lindwall bowled a long spell of 24.5 overs, and eventually prized <b>out</b> <b>six</b> of the West Indians for the cost of 95 runs. The culmination of this was a spell of 4/16. Australia replied with 9/600, with Lindwall contributing an unbeaten 37 with the bat. Lindwall's match soured in the second innings when he broke down with an achilles tendon problem as the match ended in a draw. Lindwall recovered {{for the start of the}} Third Test at Bourda in Georgetown, Guyana. Lindwall had a quiet time in a spin dominated game, taking two wickets in an eight-wicket Australian victory. Australia won the toss and batted in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados. Australia had already reached 6/439 when Lindwall came to the crease. In a highly aggressive innings, he reached his fifty in 69 minutes and was unbeaten on 80 at stumps. The next morning, he went on the make his second Test century, scoring 118 with two sixes and 16 fours. It was his second century at Test level, eight years after his first, but showed the same counter-attacking aggression. Lindwall had another quiet match with two wickets in another high scoring draw with both teams amassing more than 500 in the first innings. Lindwall finished the series with four wickets in the Fifth Test in Jamaica as Australia completed a 3–0 series win with another innings triumph. In a high scoring series, Lindwall had taken 20 wicket at 31.85 while also scoring 187 runs at 37.40, a strong all round performance.|$|E
