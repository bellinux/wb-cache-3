50|$|However, {{a bit of}} {{work with}} a pencil and paper will show that {{it is easy to}} get such a minimal switch into {{conditions}} in which no single middle switch has a connection to both the needed input switch and the needed <b>output</b> <b>switch.</b> It only takes four calls to partially block the switch. If an input switch is half-full, it has connections via two middle switches. If an <b>output</b> <b>switch</b> is also half full with connections from the other two middle switches, then there is no remaining middle switch which can provide a path between that input and output.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} middle subswitches {{depends on the}} {{algorithm}} used to allocate connection to them. The basic algorithm for managing a three-layer switch is to search the middle subswitches for a middle subswitch that has unused wires to the needed input and <b>output</b> <b>switches.</b> Once a connectible middle subswitch is found, connecting to the correct inputs and outputs in the input and <b>output</b> <b>switches</b> is trivial.|$|R
50|$|A {{self-contained}} {{photoelectric sensor}} contains the optics, {{along with the}} electronics. It requires only a power source. The sensor performs its own modulation, demodulation, amplification, and <b>output</b> <b>switching.</b> Some self-contained sensors provide such options as built-in control timers or counters. Because of technological progress, self-contained photoelectric sensors have become increasingly smaller.|$|R
5000|$|Many storage heaters {{also have}} a mechanically-controlled {{automatic}} <b>output</b> <b>switch.</b> In this case, if the manual <b>output</b> <b>switch</b> is not set to minimum overnight, the damper will automatically close (as if the <b>output</b> <b>switch</b> had been set to minimum), and then the damper will re-open after a time delay; this time delay {{is measured by the}} gradual drop in the heater's core temperature, and is therefore longer if the core temperature started higher due to more charge. The delay can also be biased by the output switch's setting. [...] Some output switches that are set up this way are marked [...] "early" [...] and [...] "late" [...] as well as [...] "closed" [...] and [...] "open"; the minimum [...] "closed" [...] setting corresponds with [...] "early" [...] and the maximum [...] "open" [...] setting corresponds with [...] "late". These output switches can be controlled manually by ensuring they are closed at night and opened when desired, or they can be left to automatic operation by not closing at night.|$|E
50|$|The <b>output</b> <b>switch</b> {{may require}} {{attention}} throughout the day. Before going to bed, the operator should switch the output to its minimum setting. This keeps as much {{heat in the}} bricks as possible. Enough will leak out into the room to make it warm in the morning. Only in exceptionally cold circumstances will the operator require output overnight. The operator may wish to slowly increase the <b>output</b> <b>switch</b> during the day to try to maintain {{the temperature in the}} house. Increasing the output will allow the heat to convect out of the heater. If the house is empty during the day, the output should be left at a minimum all day and then switched up when returning to the house in order to let more heat escape.|$|E
5000|$|Theoretically, in the example, {{only four}} central {{switches}} are needed, each with exactly one connection to each input switch and one connection to each <b>output</b> <b>switch.</b> This {{is called a}} [...] "minimal spanning switch," [...] and managing it was the holy grail of the Bell Labs' investigations.|$|E

50|$|Remote {{photoelectric}} sensors {{used for}} remote sensing contain only the optical {{components of a}} sensor.

5000|$|The Twin Reverb II was {{replaced}} by The Twin, commonly referred to, though incorrectly as, the [...] "Evil Twin" [...] (Fender has only referred to the [...] "TWIN AMP" [...] or the '95 Twin Amp as being the [...] "Evil Twin", not the red knob Twin) due to the addition of both a separate gain channel and a switchable overdrive on the clean, in 1987. It featured a dual <b>output</b> <b>switch,</b> allowing the user to select either 25 watts or 100 watts of output. The Twin was designed for maximum versatility for live or studio use with features like speaker jacks with selectable impedance, Low-z/XLR output, a [...] "Power Amp Thru" [...] feature that bypassed the preamp circuit and a buffered effects loop. Both clean and overdrive channels could be activated simultaneously and reverb could be turned on/off for each channel.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{variation}} in the switching instant of the <b>output</b> <b>switch</b> of the pulser circuit used in energizing an NEMP simulator on the voltage fed to the simulator and hence the electric field within the working volume of the simulator has been studied.

For certain switching instants, the electric field shows a sharp reduction in its amplitude after the peak which is called the notch.
