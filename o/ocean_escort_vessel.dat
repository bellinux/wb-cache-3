30|$|A more {{realistic}} {{variation of the}} base case assumes that an <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is employed for the 30 [*]days. The cost of the <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is shared between 3 platforms at a daily cost of $ 25, 000 for a total cost of $ 0.25 million per platform. We assume that 10 % of the time, the <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is able to stop a floating ice threat from moving from one threat level to the next higher level. When the <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is present, the middle circle is breached only 4 %*(0.9) 2 [*]=[*] 3.24 %[*]=[*]of the time, and the inner circle is breached just (0.9) 3 x 1 %[*]=[*] 0.729 % of the time. So the expected loss due to ice decreases to $ 5.6 million. As the <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> costs $ 250, 000, the total expected loss with <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is $ 5.85 million. This represents a savings of $ 1.55 million relative to the original base case, suggesting that with the crude assumptions employed here, an <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is well worth the money {{even in the absence}} of EP.|$|R
