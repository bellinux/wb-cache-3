He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. <b>Our</b> <b>house</b> had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E

The Painted Word mocked the excessive insularity {{of the art world}} and its dependence on what he saw as faddish critical theory. In From Bauhaus to <b>Our</b> <b>House</b> he explored what he said were the negative effects of the Bauhaus style on the evolution of modern architecture.|$|E

40|$|The main {{intention}} {{of this book}} is to instil {{a sense of responsibility}} to the developers and policymakers as well as create an important awareness to the public about the conditions of <b>our</b> <b>housing</b> estates. We are living in a time bomb or a volcano that has shown ripples of signs of eruption. From issues of children dying of accidents and falling from buildings to health hazards for adults as well as the effects air conditioning might have on community interaction and cultural violations which increase inter–racial tensions, we must re–look at our attitude towards our billion ringgit investment. Malaysia is a country that no longer has a third world infrastructure but can be considered as a modern and up–to–date first world infrastructure. But <b>our</b> <b>housing</b> is still left in the throes of this third world mindset of ‘basic shelter’. We have evolved so far as a nation ironically, <b>our</b> <b>housing</b> attitude has not gone a far. The book presents a series of criticism and thoughts on <b>our</b> <b>housing</b> and community architecture based on a series of articles and seminar papers presented. It is hoped that this book might create a rethinking of the way we live in a radically new way...|$|R

When Jyotirindranath Tagore was involved with his experiments in music, plays and writing, he was assisted by Akshay Chandra Chaudhuri and Rabindranath. In his Jyotirindrasmriti (Reminiscence) he wrote, “With Janaki going to England and arrival of my younger sister Swarnakumari in <b>our</b> <b>house,</b> we got another partner in our literary ventures.” While Gyanadanandini Devi took the lead for breaking down age-old restrictions on women in the house, Swarnakumari flourished in creativity.|$|E

MGR had a simple beginning in stage plays {{at the age of}} six. MGR was first invited by Annadurai to star in one of his movies in the 1950s. From then on MGR actively participated in the party's meetings. His films such as Nadodi Mannan (Vagabond King, 1958), Enga Vitu Pillai (Son of <b>our</b> <b>House,</b> 1965), Nam Nadu (Our Nation, 1969), Adimai Penn (Slave Girl, 1969) and Engal Thangam (Our Gold or Our Precious, 1970) displayed a stereotypical image of a philanthropic, mundane hero made out of a vagrant who becomes a king.|$|E
25|$|Marlena was {{introduced}} {{as a guest}} character in June 1976, by executive producer Betty Corday. The show decided to cast actress Deidre Hall, who was already known in the soap world {{for her role as}} Barbara on The Young and the Restless. The character was brought in as the psychiatrist of already established character – Mickey Horton. This puts her in close contact with the soap's core family, The Hortons. This also allows her to meet her first new lover in Salem, Don Craig (Mickey's assistant). Specifically, she {{played a key role in}} a storyline involving her twin sister, Samantha Evans (who was played by Hall's real life twin, Andrea Hall) at the same sanitarium Mickey was committed to. The character proved to be popular, and they decided to put her on contract. Marlena eventually started a relationship with Roman Brady, who established her to a core family on the show, the Brady family. In the 1980s, Hall had decided to explore primetime. She landed the lead role on the family oriented series, <b>Our</b> <b>House,</b> and guest starred on other prime time hits such as Wiseguy and Columbo. She left Days of Our Lives after her primetime and daytime schedule became too hard to balance. In 1991 (after the primetime series ended), Hall began to miss daytime's creative outlet, and returned to the show that same year. Her return prompted a 10% increase in the Nielsen ratings for the soap.|$|E

500|$|In June 1812, {{her father}} sent Mary {{to stay with}} the dissenting family of the radical William Baxter, near Dundee, Scotland. To Baxter, he wrote, [...] "I am anxious that she should be brought up...like a philosopher, even like a cynic." [...] Scholars have speculated that she may have been sent away for her health, to remove her from the seamy side of business, or to {{introduce}} her to radical politics. Mary Godwin revelled in the spacious surroundings of Baxter's house and in the companionship of his four daughters, and she returned north in the summer of 1813 for a further stay of 10 months. In the 1831 introduction to Frankenstein, she recalled: [...] "I wrote then—but in a most common-place style. It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to <b>our</b> <b>house,</b> or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered." ...|$|E

As Rootes recalls, [...] "I admit every time me and Bridged cleaned <b>our</b> <b>house</b> we put Elastica on". Despite this, she considers Elastica, along with the Sex Pistols and the Buzzcocks, as the only UK bands among her favorites. The band cited the Sex Pistols, the New York Dolls, and The Stooges as their musical influences. They also preferred the Sex Pistols over the Clash. According to Rootes, [...] "The Sex Pistols are political in a great teenage fuck-you way. The Clash are political in a mature way, like they've done politics in A-levels." ...|$|E
