2500|$|<b>Child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> {{became a}} public {{issue in the}} 1970s and 1980s. Prior to this point in time, sexual abuse {{remained}} rather secretive and socially unspeakable. Studies on child molestation were nonexistent until the 1920s and the first national estimate of the number <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> cases was published in 1948. By 1968 44 out of 50 U.S. states had enacted mandatory laws that required physicians to report cases <b>of</b> suspicious <b>child</b> <b>abuse.</b> Legal action began to become more prevalent in the 1970s with the enactment <b>of</b> the <b>Child</b> <b>Abuse</b> Prevention and Treatment Act in 1974 {{in conjunction with the}} creation of the National Center for <b>Child</b> <b>Abuse</b> and Neglect.

This study examined the prevalence and nature <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> in four non-Western ethnic minority groups and compared them with a native Dutch group. A sample of 3, 426 young adults (aged 18 – 25) completed a structured, online survey on experiences <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse.</b> A total of 42. 9 % (n = 1, 469) participants reported at least one form <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> victimization {{before the age of}} 18.

However, the Dutch Antillean respondents reported significantly higher rates <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> on specific forms of abuse, whereas the Moroccan respondents reported lower rates compared with their native Dutch peers.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} relationship between justice and <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> {{from the perspective of}} adult survivors. Utilising participant observation, unstructured interviews and focus groups within a feminist framework, 21 adult survivors <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> (18 women and 3 men) were consulted to identify issues that were problematic for them. In addition, 2 jurors, 1 judge and 2 counsellors were interviewed. The findings indicated that <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> has been shrouded by a conspiracy of silence, caused partly by deeply entrenched structures within society. These forces combined with the complexity of recovery, including the possible impacts of Stockholm Syndrome, and the perceived inability {{of the criminal justice system}} to meet their needs, have appeared to silence many survivors <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse.</b> A review of the economic consequences and an analysis of the subsequent costs <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> have indicated the need to implement programmes that would lessen the burden for victims, offenders, their families and the broader society. Survivors cautiously suggested that restorative justice might be sufficiently flexible to encourage victims <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> to criminally report, thereby breaking the silence. A cost benefit analysis of a restorative justice programme indicated that significant savings could be made and highlighted that the prevention <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> should be a priority. The findings of this research would have implications for policy makers and all those who provide services to victims and offenders <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse.</b> Stockholm Syndrome has highlighted the complexity of the recovery process for victims <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse.</b> This syndrome combined with the concerns of adult survivors <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> would have implications for practitioners within the traditional criminal justice system and the restorative justice movement.
