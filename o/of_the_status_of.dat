The fort was much smaller than its predecessor fort, Tughlaqabad fort, but of similar design. Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in its evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the fort for conservation has recorded that two gates, one with barbicans between two bastions on the south-east and another on the south-west. Inside, it, separated by a bailey, is a citadel consisting of walls, bastions and gates within which lay the palaces.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> Lipizzans as {{the only}} breed of horse {{developed}} in Slovenia, via the Lipica stud that is now located within its borders, Lipizzans are recognized in Slovenia as a national animal. For example, a pair of Lipizzans is featured on the 20-cent Slovenian euro coins. Mounted regiments of Carabinieri police in Italy also employ the Lipizzan {{as one of their}} mounts. In October 2008, during a visit to Slovenia, a Lipizzan at Lipica, named 085 Favory Canissa XXII, was given to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. She decided to leave the animal in the care of the stud farm.|$|E
5|$|As a bishop, Reginald {{was kept}} busy {{attending}} the king's councils and the royal court, but also {{took part in}} the 1178 mission to Toulouse, led by Cardinal Pierre of San Crisogono, which attempted to deal with the Cathar heretics there. He attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. During the 1180s, he was more active in the affairs of his diocese, and appears less often in the secular affairs of the kingdom, but in 1189 he {{took part in the}} coronation of King Richard I of England. In April 1191 {{he was one of the}} persons selected to arbitrate between the chancellor William Longchamp and Prince John of England. He also attended the trial of William Longchamp on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge between Reading and Windsor that dismissed Longchamp from his offices. He may have been an unsuccessful candidate for the chancellorship of England. He was active as a bishop: some 122 acta from his time as bishop survive. He built the hospital of St. John in Bath, as well as building extensively at Wells Cathedral and starting the construction of the Bishop's Palace. He also issued a confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the town of Wells.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus, a {{widespread}} genus of bats in Africa, southern Eurasia, and Australia, was first recorded from Madagascar by George Edward Dobson, who mentioned the larger Miniopterus schreibersii {{and the smaller}} M.scotinus (currently M.natalensis) in his 1878 catalog of the bats in the British Museum. In 1906, Oldfield Thomas named the larger species M.majori and the smaller M.manavi. He regarded M.manavi {{as close to the}} mainland African M.minor, and in 1971, R.W. Hayman and J.E. Hill placed it as a subspecies of that species. In their 1995 Faune de Madagascar review of Malagasy bats, however, Randolph Peterson and colleagues again separated M.manavi as a species, with M.manavi griveaudi (currently Miniopterus griveaudi) from Grande Comore as a subspecies. Peterson, who died before the review was completed, had originally divided M.manavi into several species occurring in different areas, but his collaborators decided conservatively to keep M.manavi as a single species, recommending reassessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> those forms as new material would become available.|$|E
5|$|P. (c.) tristis, the Siberian chiffchaff, breeds in Siberia {{east of the}} Pechora River and {{winters in}} the lower Himalayas. It is also {{regularly}} recorded in western Europe in winter, {{and it is likely}} that the numbers involved have been underestimated due to uncertainties over identification criteria, lack of good data and recording policies (Sweden and Finland only accept trapped birds). It is a dull subspecies, grey or brownish above and whitish below, with little yellow in the plumage, and the buff-white supercilium is often longer than in the western subspecies. It has a higher pitched suitsistsuisit song and a short high-pitched cheet call. It is sometimes considered to be a full species due to its distinctive plumage and vocalisations, being similar to P. s. sindianus in these respects. Nominate P. c. collybita and P. c. tristis do not recognize each other's songs. Pending resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> P. (c.) fulvescens, which is found where the ranges of P. c. abietinus and P. c. tristis connect and may or may not be a hybrid between these, tristis is maintained in P. collybita.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible. Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2000, {{with the}} {{discovery}} of at least three bodies (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) all comparable to Pluto in terms of size and orbit, it became clear that either they all had to be called planets or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly. They were also concerned about the classification of planets in other planetary systems. In 2006, the matter came to a head with the first measurement of the size of Eris. That measurement had showed Eris (as it was mistakenly believed to be until the New Horizons mission to Pluto) to appear to be slightly larger than Pluto, and so was thought to be equally deserving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> 'planet' at the time.|$|E
5|$|With the {{invasion}} of Portugal by Napoleon's imperial army in 1807, the Portuguese Royal Court fled to Brazil, establishing {{the capital of the}} Portuguese Monarchy and Empire in Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the Portuguese state of Brazil was elevated to a kingdom, thus receiving the same status as the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves. The whole of the Portuguese Monarchy became then the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. To reflect the change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the Portuguese Monarchy, the Prince Regent John (future King John VI, at that time still reigning in name of his mother, Queen Mary I) established a new Royal coat of arms, where the Portuguese shield (representing Portugal and the Algarves) charged a blue-filled yellow armillary sphere (representing Brazil) surmounted by the same beret-bearing five-arched crown. The new coat of arms replaced the previous one in the Portuguese flags.|$|E
