5|$|The {{reforms of}} the {{execution}} movement had clearly established the Sejm as the central and dominant organ <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>power.</b> But this situation in reality had not lasted very long, as various destructive decentralizing tendencies, steps taken by the szlachta and the kings, were progressively undermining and eroding the functionality and primacy of the central legislative organ. The resulting void was being filled during the late 16th and 17th centuries by the increasingly active and assertive territorial sejmiks, which provided a more accessible and direct forum for szlachta activists to promote their narrowly conceived local interests. Sejmiks established effective controls, in practice limiting the Sejm's authority; themselves they were taking on an ever-broader range of state matters and local issues.|$|E

25|$|As secretary, Ivanov was {{responsible}} for coordinating the daily work of the council, led by the president. But Ivanov's role as secretary was initially unclear to media observers. At {{the time of his}} appointment, the Security Council was a relatively new institution. (The council was set up by Yeltsin's tutelage in 1991–1992). Between 1992 and Ivanov's appointment in 1999, Yeltsin used the council as political expediency had dictated, but had not allowed it to emerge as a relatively strong and autonomous institution. Ivanov's predecessors in that post, including Putin, according to Western analysts, were either the second most powerful political figure in Russia or the just another functionary lacking close access to the center <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>power,</b> depending on their relationship with Yeltsin.|$|E

25|$|The {{revolution}} of 1933 undermined {{the institutions and}} coercive structures of the oligarchic state. The young and relatively inexperienced revolutionaries found themselves pushed into the halls <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> by worker and peasant mobilisations. Between September 1933 and January 1934 a loose coalition of radical activists, students, middle-class intellectuals, and disgruntled lower-rank soldiers formed a Provisional Revolutionary Government. This coalition was directed by a popular university professor, Dr Ramón Grau San Martín. The Grau government promised a 'new Cuba' with social justice for all classes, and the abrogation of the Platt Amendment. While the revolutionary leaders certainly wanted diplomatic recognition by Washington, they believed their legitimacy stemmed from the popular rebellion which brought them to power, and not from {{the approval of the}} United States' Department of State.|$|E
25|$|Ashokavadana– The Aśokāvadāna is a 2nd-century CE text {{related to}} the legend of Ashoka. The legend was {{translated}} into Chinese by Fa Hien in 300 CE. It is essentially a Hinayana text, and its world is that of Mathura and North-west India. The emphasis of this little known text is on exploring {{the relationship between the}} king and the community of monks (the Sangha) and setting up an ideal of religious life for the laity (the common man) by telling appealing stories about religious exploits. The most startling feature is that Ashoka’s conversion {{has nothing to do with}} the Kalinga war, which is not even mentioned, nor is there a word about his belonging to the Maurya dynasty. Equally surprising is the record of his use <b>of</b> <b>state</b> <b>power</b> to spread Buddhism in an uncompromising fashion. The legend of Veetashoka provides insights into Ashoka’s character that are not available in the widely known Pali records.|$|E

According to Human Rights In China, sources inside China said that on the evening of June 10, 2008, Huang Qi, Pu Fei, a volunteer for Tianwang, and Zuo Xiaohuan, a former teacher at Leshan Teachers College were missing after they were forced into a car by unidentified individuals. In the afternoon of June 12, 2008, Lawyer Xu, Tianwang's legal counsel, went to the Jinyang Police Station of Chengdu to file a missing persons report. The police reportedly told Xu that Huang Qi has been detained, and that the related legal procedure notice would be sent to his family but refused to disclose the grounds for Huang's detention.

40|$|Dr. Minobe {{interpreted}} {{concerning the}} Emperor's {{status in the}} previous constitution that the Emperor is the highest organ <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Japan. This interpretition is the most authoritative theory on the Emperor's status in the Meiji constitution. This doctrine derives from the theory of juridical person <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> as its premise. That is, the state is a perfect juridical person independently of and transcending the component people. It has its own will, intention, ability, activity and personality (especially international personality) It is a sovereign community. The sovereignty (maijestas in realis) resides with the state itself. But the Emperor has actual sovereignty (sovereign powar, maijestas in persona) The will of the Emperor constitutes the will <b>of</b> the <b>states.</b> In this case Dr. Minobe calls the Emperor the highest organ <b>of</b> the <b>state.</b> However, I call such status of the Emperor in the former constitution 'der Trager der Staatsgewalt' as Rehm states. For the organ <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> is not the 'Zurechnungsendepunkt' <b>of</b> the <b>state,</b> but 'Durchgangspunkt' <b>of</b> the responsibility <b>of</b> the <b>state.</b> Der Trager der Staatsgewalt is the 'Zurechnungsendepuikt' <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> as Hans Kelsen prescribes. So {{the people in the}} present constitution is not the highest organ <b>of</b> the <b>state.</b> It is rightly said to be the carrier <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> sovereign <b>power.</b> According to my opinion the highest organ <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> is distinctly distinguished from the carrier <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> sovereign <b>power.</b> The carrier <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>power</b> is superior to the highest organ <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>power.</b> In the previous constitution, the Emperor's status in the first article is the carrier <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>power</b> and that in the fourth article the highest organ <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>power.</b> But in general the Emperor's status in the first article and that in the fourth article in the previous constitution are not distinguished, and they are equally said to be the highest organ <b>of</b> the <b>state.</b> I cannot accept such interpretation. I put stress in my opinion on this very point, and {{want to make it clear}} in this treatise...|$|R
