40|$|In 1996, Government {{directives}} began {{a transition}} to conform logging in Western Australia 2 ̆ 7 s State forests to principles of ecologically sustainable forest management (ESFM). To place this in a historical context, we reviewed {{the history of the}} logging of jarrah Eucalyptus marginata forests to determine whether the volume of timber extracted and the main forest management practices employed was consistent with components of ESFM. While quantitative assessment proved difficult, usually the timber cut considerably exceeded the estimated annual increment of forested lands. <b>Overcutting</b> often distressed professionals, who strove to regulate logging despite social, political and economic pressures. Furthermore, despite recent major reductions in permissible timber cut, areas of productive State forest have declined after conversion to alternative vestings. Thus, <b>overcutting</b> may continue in the remaining production forests. Too few data exist on the health or condition of forest ecosystems before logging to document subtle impacts. However, <b>overcutting</b> has interacted with broad-scale threatening processes in their impacts on forest fauna. These changes are all associated with reluctance to invoke effective adaptive management in association with the precautionary principle. The historical survey suggests that ESFM cannot be achieved without a socio-political will to assert long-term sustainable practice in the face of short-term goals. This could be achieved in the current preparation of a new forest management plan for Western Australia...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a non-uniform layered rough cut plan for B-spline surfaces using convex hull boxes. The tool path plan generated by this method will rapidly remove most redundant material from stock material without <b>overcutting.</b> First, a B-spline surface is decomposed into piecewise Bezier surfaces, of which the convex hull boxes form an approximate model for rough cutting. Then, according to the top planes of those convex hull boxes, the stock material is divided into layers of different thickness. The cavity contour for each layer is obtained using a simplified union Boolean operation on convex hull boxes. Finally, from the top down, each layer is processed like a 2 D pocket die cavity. The algorithm is implemented on a personal computer. It is shown that the rough cut plan is very efficient since no computation for solving nonlinear equations is needed, and no <b>overcutting</b> occurs since B-spline surfaces are protected by the convex hull property of Bezier surfaces...|$|R
