Seventeen water samples and 85 swab samples (nozzles, <b>drip</b> <b>trays,</b> coin slots, buttons and doors) from 3 locations in Kelantan were collected. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing were carried out and sequences obtained were compared against the sequences available in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information database using the basic local alignment search tool programme. Coliform counts were observed in 94. 12 % of water samples, 76. 47 % of nozzles and 82. 35 % of <b>drip</b> <b>tray</b> swabs. Furthermore, results of 16 S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that two gram-negative isolates were identified as Escherichia coli U 5 / 41 (Accession no.

50|$|Indirect {{grilling}} is {{a barbecue}} cooking technique {{in which the}} food is placed {{to the side of}} or above the heat source instead of directly over the flame as is more common. This can be achieved by igniting only some burners on a gas barbecue or by piling coals to one side of a charcoal pit. A <b>drip</b> <b>tray</b> is placed below the food to prevent fat from the food igniting and generating a direct flame. Indirect grilling is designed to cook larger (e.g. pork shoulders, whole chicken) or tougher foods (e.g. brisket, ribs) that would burn if cooked using a direct flame. This method of cooking generates a more moderate temperature (about 275-350 °F) and allows for an easier introduction of wood smoke for flavoring.|$|R

40|$|Refrigeration {{systems in}} chilled rooms in 15 plants {{processing}} {{a variety of}} foods were studied. These included plants processing raw meat and salads, Chinese ready meals, dairy products, slicing and packing of cooked meats and catering establishments. An initial survey of total numbers of microbes at a total of 891 sites on evaporators, <b>drip</b> <b>trays</b> and chilled room walls was followed up with a more detailed examination of 336 sites with high counts, selecting for Listeria spp., coliforms, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Temperatures (particularly air on and air off, maximum and near defrost heaters) relative humidity, airflow, layout and cleaning regimes were surveyed. In general, no correlation could be found between any of the physical measurements and the numbers and types of bacteria detected. Maximum mean temperatures in the chilled rooms varied from - 1 to + 16. 9 °C and few chilled units were regularly cleaned. Twenty five percent of sites examined had more than 105 colony-forming units per cm 2, although, very few pathogens or faecal indicator bacteria were detected. Listeria spp. were not found and coliforms were found only once, in low numbers. Low numbers of S. aureus or B. cereus were present in 9 of the 15 plants, B. cereus was found on evaporators and associated <b>drip</b> <b>trays</b> in two catering plants and two plants processing cooked meat. Enterococci and S. aureus were found most frequently in a raw red meat slaughterhouse (always in low numbers). In general, microbial contamination was lower in rooms where wrapped rather than unwrapped products were stored. The type of product also affected the degree of contamination, with raw red meat and poultry or dry ingredients giving highest counts, and raw vegetables and cooked products lowest. The work demonstrated that bacteria were present on evaporator cooling coils in all factory cold rooms visited. Although evaporator-cleaning procedures were carried out in some factories as part of routine maintenance these were not shown to be effective at maintaining low levels of bacteria on evaporators. To maintain evaporator hygiene {{it is suggested that}} more regular cleaning procedures, possibly by means of automated cleansing systems, should be considered. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This study concludes that no single solution exists to control <b>oil</b> <b>drips</b> and clean up small oil spills at Army motor pools. Most installations require a combination of drip pans, sorption pads, and sorbing loose material. The study further found that: 1. While election of sorbents is specific to installation and application, in general, cellulose products are the best choice, followed by synthetic products. 2. Disposal of the saturated sorbents is a critical factor in selecting sorbents. Regulatory requirements and cost are key elements in deciding disposal procedures. 3.

40|$|Industry Structure Lubricants 2 ̆ 7 {{base oil}} {{production}} is virtually controlled by five, vertically integrated, multi-national companies. Their market shares are {{large enough to}} permit strong influence over the entire industry and to render competition ineffective. It {{will be difficult for}} new firms to enter the lubricant 2 ̆ 7 s industry and compete successfully with these entrenched firms. The lubricants market is large. The market is dominated by petroleum based, mineral oil products. Projected market growth is minimal, and worldwide supply is ample. Growing environmental awareness and the prospect of stringent regulations regarding petroleum products use have spurred renewed interest in the manufacture of vegetable oil based lubricants. Product performance will likely be more critical to success than competitive price. Markets that offer significant potential include those where state regulations mandate biodegradable lubricant use or in industries that seek avoid costly remedial clean ups. Environmental Threats or Opportunities There is no universally accepted definition for environmentally acceptable lubricants, but the American Society for Testing Materials has formed a subcommittee to establish standards. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that our nation 2 ̆ 7 s remaining water quality problems are largely attributable to pollution from nonpoint sources. The EPA is stepping up efforts to reclassify nonpoint sources as point sources to subject former nonpoint sources to regulation liability. Public perception of ground water contaminants has been the catalyst to stimulate reclassification. Hence, in many applications a readily biodegradable and nontoxic lubricant is preferable to current options especially where the product is introduced into nature. Lacking federal government mandated change, any firm producing an environmentally superior lubricant faces several realities. First, the product must perform as well as or better than existing lubricants. Second, success may be most easily achieved by marketing products in states that have already regulated lubricants. And finally, because the global market for environmentally friendly products is still heating up, the odds for a 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 product 2 ̆ 7 s success are very good. The <b>Drip</b> <b>Oil</b> Market If 100 percent of petroleum based <b>drip</b> <b>oil</b> was displaced by soyoil, 1. 68 to 2. 36 million bushels of soybeans would be consumed to produce <b>drip</b> <b>oil.</b> A more realistic forecast by one of the big five lubricant firms is sales of 2. 5 million gallons for all biodegradable lubricants by 1995. National introduction of biodegradable lubricants is feasible for one of the industry 2 ̆ 7 s dominant firms, but for smaller firms, niche markets and regional introduction would be more manageable and enhance the chances for success. <b>Drip</b> <b>oil</b> is marketed as both a private branded <b>drip</b> <b>oil</b> and a nationally branded lubricant used for <b>drip</b> <b>oil.</b> Consumers look for anti-wear additives, lubricity and viscosity additives and quality for the price. The <b>drip</b> <b>oil</b> market is composed of more buyers who purchase small quantities of product and fewer buyers who purchase large quantities of product. Therefore, profits will not be garnered by 2 ̆ 2 product turn 2 ̆ 2 generated by high volume, low priced sales, but by offering consumers enhanced product value through distribution, packaging and product performance. Firms who can deliver the above three criteria will find consumers willing to pay a premium price for their products...|$|R

40|$|Actuators {{used on the}} United States {{space shuttle}} fleet are {{lubricated}} with unspecified amounts of Braycote 601 (Castrol Braycote) grease consisting of a perfluoropolyalkyl ether (PFPAE) base oil thickened with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filler. Each shuttle has four body flap actuators (BFAs) (two on each wing) on a common segmented shaft and four rudder speed brake (RSB) actuators. The actuators were designed to operate for 10 years and 100 flights without periodic relubrication. Visible inspection of two partially disassembled RSB actuators in continuous use for 19 years raised concerns over possible grease degradation due to discoloration of the grease on several places on the surfaces of the gears. Inspection revealed fretting, micropitting, wear and corrosion of the bearings and gears. A small amount of <b>oil</b> <b>dripped</b> from the disassembled actuators. Whereas new grease is beige in appearance, the discolored grease consisted of both grey and reddish colors. Grease samples taken from the actuators together with representative off-the-shelf new and unused grease samples were analyzed by gravimetry for oil content; by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) for metals content; Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for base oil decomposition; and by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for determination of the molecular weight distributions of the grease oil. The Braycote 601 grease was stable after 19 years of continuous use in the sealed RSB actuators and was fit for its intended purpose. There were no significant chemical differences between the used grease samples and new and unused samples. Base oil separation was not significant within the sealed actuators. No corrosive effect {{in the form of}} iron fluoride was detected. The grey color of grease samples was due to metallic iron. The red color was due to oxidation of the metallic wear particles from the gears and the bearings comprising the actuators...|$|R
