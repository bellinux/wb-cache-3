5|$|<b>Obesity</b> <b>is</b> {{a leading}} {{preventable}} {{cause of death}} worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2015, 600 million adults (12%) and 100 million children were obese. <b>Obesity</b> <b>is</b> more common in women than men. Authorities view {{it as one of}} the most serious public health problems of the 21stcentury. <b>Obesity</b> <b>is</b> stigmatized in much of the modern world (particularly in the Western world), though it was seen as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world. In 2013, the American Medical Association classified obesity as a disease.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} between viruses and obesity {{has been found}} in humans and several different animal species. The amount that these associations {{may have contributed to the}} rising rate of <b>obesity</b> <b>is</b> yet to be determined.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, <b>obesity</b> <b>is</b> not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and <b>obesity</b> <b>is</b> higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E

5|$|The most {{effective}} treatment for <b>obesity</b> <b>is</b> bariatric surgery. The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion. Surgery for severe <b>obesity</b> <b>is</b> associated with long-term weight loss, improvement in obesity related conditions, and decreased overall mortality. One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending {{on the type}} of procedure performed) at 10years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures. Complications occur in about 17% of cases and reoperation is needed in 7% of cases. Due to its cost and risks, researchers are searching for other effective yet less invasive treatments including devices that occupy space in the stomach.|$|E

5|$|As field dogs {{they are}} prone to minor {{injuries}} such as cuts and sprains, and, if inactive, <b>obesity</b> <b>is</b> a common problem as they will eat whenever food is available and rely on their owners to regulate their weight.

5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. <b>Obesity</b> <b>is</b> seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obesity</b> <b>is</b> most {{commonly}} {{caused by a}} combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.|$|E

5|$|Many {{cultures}} {{throughout history}} have viewed obesity {{as the result}} of a character flaw. The obesus or fat character in Ancient Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery. During Christian times the food was viewed as a gateway to the sins of sloth and lust. In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and <b>obesity</b> <b>is</b> commonly associated with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obesity</b> <b>is</b> mostly {{preventable}} {{through a}} combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.|$|E
5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. <b>Obesity</b> <b>is</b> a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the impact of}} sarcopenia and obesity on pulmonary function {{and quality of life}} (QOL) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, including data from health interviews, health examinations, nutritional questionnaires, and laboratory findings. Laboratory data included pulmonary function assessment and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry results. Sarcopenia was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and <b>obesity</b> <b>was</b> defined by body mass index. Male COPD patients were then classified into 4 groups according to the presence of sarcopenia and obesity. RESULTS: In male patients with COPD, the prevalence of sarcopenia was found to be 29. 3 %, and that of sarcopenic <b>obesity</b> <b>was</b> 14. 2 %. Furthermore, 22. 5 % of the patients observed in this study had impaired QOL. Following multivariable statistical analysis, both sarcopenia and <b>obesity</b> <b>were</b> independent risk factors for worsening lung function. Adjusted values of forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were the lowest in the sarcopenic <b>obesity</b> group. Sarcopenia <b>was</b> also associated with more subjective activity limitation and poorer QOL; however <b>obesity</b> <b>was</b> related to less subjective limitation and better QOL after multivariable analysis. Adjusted value of QOL was the lowest in sarcopenic subjects without obesity, and the highest in obese subject without sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Both sarcopenia and <b>obesity</b> <b>were</b> found to be associated with worsening lung function in male COPD patients. However, <b>obesity</b> <b>was</b> positively correlated with improved QOL while sarcopenia was negatively correlated with QQL...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between obesity and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Methods: This retrospective case-control study consisted of patients with PAH (N= 207) and controls seen at a pulmonary clinic {{for reasons other than}} PAH (N= 965). All patients were evaluated between 1992 and 2006 at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. <b>Obesity</b> <b>was</b> defined as body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or higher; class II <b>obesity</b> <b>was</b> defined as a BMI between 35. 0 and 39. 9 kg/m 2, and class III <b>obesity</b> <b>was</b> defined as a BMI of 40. 0 kg/m 2 or higher. Results: <b>Obesity</b> <b>was</b> present in 63 patients with PAH (30 %) and 290 controls (30 %). Class II or III <b>obesity</b> <b>was</b> present in 34 patients with PAH (16 %) and 103 controls (11 %), while class III <b>obesity</b> <b>was</b> present in 16 patients with PAH (8 %) and 36 controls (4 %). After adjustment for age, sex, and thyroid disease in logistic regression analysis, an association between <b>obesity</b> and PAH <b>was</b> not evident (odds ratio [OR], 0. 97; P=. 87), however non-statistically significant trends were observed toward an association between PAH and class II or III obesity (OR, 1. 40; P=. 14) and class III obesity (OR, 1. 70; P=. 11). Conclusions: Our findings do not indicate an association between PAH and obesity in WHO diagnostic group 1 patients. However trends were observed toward more severe class II and III obesity in PAH patients compared to controls, and this requires further study in larger samples...|$|R
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. <b>Obesity</b> <b>is</b> a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts {{have been made to}} increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes.|$|E
