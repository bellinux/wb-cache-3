40|$|Abstract. The gas {{temperature}} in vessel will be significantly increased {{according to the}} aeration speed and pressure during the aeration or deflation for the ultrahigh pressure vessel. Due to the restriction of air tightness and structure for the ultrahigh pressure vessel, {{it is difficult to}} measure the {{gas temperature}} by adopting the traditional measurement method without change of the vessel structure.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a platinum resistance <b>temperature</b> <b>detector</b> to develop a calibration experiment and to introduce metrology principles. The Callender-Van Dusen equation is used to analyze the temperature-resistance characteristic of a detector. Linearity of this characteristic is explored using a MATLAB simulation. Resistance is measured at four different temperatures to estimate all of the parameters in Callender-Van Dusen equation. Since the uncertainty of temperature and resistance measurements during calibration determines the accuracy of the temperature measurements using platinum detector, it is necessary to assess the calibration errors. A simulation package is developed that applies different levels of errors into measurements used for parameter estimation. The goal is to study the influence of calibration uncertainty on the <b>temperature</b> <b>detector’s</b> readings. The next challenge is a practical realization of the calibration process.
