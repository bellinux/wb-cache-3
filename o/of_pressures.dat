5000|$|The center <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> [...] is {{the point}} where the total sum <b>of</b> a <b>pressure</b> field acts on a body, causing a force to act through that point.

2500|$|For unguided rockets {{the trim}} {{position}} is typically zero {{angle of attack}} and the center <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> is defined {{to be the center}} <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the resultant flow field on the entire vehicle resulting from a very small angle of attack (that is, the center <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> in the limit as angle of attack goes to zero). [...] For positive stability in missiles, the total vehicle center <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> defined as given above must be further from the nose of the vehicle than the center of gravity. [...] In missiles at lower angles of attack, the contributions to the center <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> are dominated by the nose, wings, and fins.

25|$|Vapor {{pressure}} of both pure liquids {{as well as}} mixtures is a sensitive function of temperature. As a rule, vapor {{pressure of}} a liquid increases nearly exponentially {{as a function of}} temperature. If the graph were replotted for a different fixed temperature, then the total vapor pressure at the azeotropic composition will certainly change, but {{it is also possible that}} the composition at which the azeotrope occurs will change. This implies that the composition of an azeotrope is affected by the pressure chosen at which to boil the mixture. Ordinarily distillation is done at atmospheric pressure, but with proper equipment it is possible to carry out distillation at a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>pressures,</b> both above and below atmospheric pressure.|$|E

The Soviet company that manufactured the one-time pads produced around 35,000 pages of duplicate key numbers, as a result <b>of</b> <b>pressures</b> brought about by the German advance on Moscow during World War II. The duplication—which undermines the security of a one-time system—was discovered and attempts to lessen its impact were made by sending the duplicates to widely separated users.
