40|$|Objectives: Illicit {{production}} of marijuana on residential properties creates significant {{health and safety}} problems. Health Canada grants licences to individuals to produce medicinal marijuana for personal use, conditional on their compliance with all appropriate regulations. Health Canada does not inspect licensees’ activities to monitor regulatory compliance, and privacy legislation prevents Health Canada from sharing licence holders’ details with third parties. This research examines how effective this administrative structure is at preventing medicinal marijuana from being produced in residential buildings by licence holders. Methods: The indoor {{production of}} marijuana requires substantial amounts of electricity. From 2005, addresses in Surrey, British Columbia, with exceptionally high power consumption have been provided to the municipal government {{for the purposes of}} undertaking fire safety inspections. This paper examines the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> at 1, 204 marijuana-production sites (n = 252 medicinal, n = 952 illicit) to see whether the licensing process prevents marijuana production in residential buildings. The illicit-production sites inspected by the city are used as a non-random comparison group for the medicinal sites. Findings: This inspection process has identified an increasing number of medicinal-(relative to illicit-) production sites in recent years. Medicinal-production operations were significantly less likely to be located in residential buildings. However, the medicinal residential sites that were detected were located in equivalent parts of the city to the illicit residential operations. Residential medicinal-production sites presented fewer electrical and biological safety problems relative to illicit-production sites, but all residential medicinal-production sites breached zoning and legislative requirements relating to land use, building safety, and structural integrity. Conclusions: The current administrative structure for licensing medicinal marijuana production does not prevent residential buildings from being used as marijuana-production sites. Routine activity theory is used as a platform to explain how additional situational prevention mechanisms can be used to prevent licensed medicinal marijuana production from creating building-related health and safety problems in the future...|$|E

40|$|The Open University (UK) Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) {{programme}} is {{a distance}} learning pre-service course {{in teacher education}} which integrates learning in the practice setting with university-based learning. This programme, which has flexible start and finish points and either training or assessment only routes, uses a web-based Needs Analysis process to reflect on prior experience and to determine individualized university and practice-based curriculum and assessment and {{is set in the}} context of an external regulatory framework which demands that teacher education courses in England fulfil certain national requirements and that student-teachers meet identified standards or competences.

40|$|Background: Little {{research}} {{exists on}} the effectiveness of workplace visits by labour inspectors in relation to psychosocial risks. The study aimed to produce a consistent and transferable evidence-based framework. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review using the realist synthesis approach. Searches in three electronic databases, systematic hand-searches in five specialised journals and iterative purposive searches yielded 25 publications. The initial search included any study between 2000 and 2015 containing information on labour inspectorates and psychosocial risks or stress at work. We conducted a complementary search to identify publications from French-speaking authors. Results: The synthesis yielded a conceptual model relating public intervention measures, mechanisms <b>of</b> action, <b>outcomes</b> and contexts. Publications indicate positive outcomes in 4 cases, possibly positive in 2, mixed outcomes in 4, and no or poor effects in 10. Studies from Nordic countries show some positive <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> activities based on dialogue with employers, group interviews with employees, repeated visits and combinations with other communication and information channels, in the context of highly organised labour markets. Conversely, other studies highlight the limitations of intervention strategies that rely on an “enlightenment” principle, in a context of increasingly precarious and flexible work situations. Conclusion: The synthesis suggests the possibility <b>of</b> positive <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> inspectors’ interventions on psychosocial risks in supportive contexts and with appropriate training and resources. However, strong evidence is lacking and more evaluation studies are necessary. A comprehensive conceptual framework may help to analyse the wide range of factors influencing the effectiveness of workplace visits by inspectors...|$|R
40|$|Fraud {{detection}} {{is a key}} {{activity with}} serious socioeconomical impact. Inspection activities associated with this task are usually constrained by limited available resources. Data analysis methods can provide help in the task of deciding where to allocate these limited resources in order to optimise the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> activities. This paper presents a multi-strategy learning method {{to address the question}} of which cases to inspect first. The proposed methodology is based on the utility theory and provides a ranking ordered by decreasing expected <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> inspecting the candidate cases. This outcome is a function not only of the probability of the case being fraudulent but also <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> costs and expected payoff if the case is confirmed as a fraud. The proposed methodology is general and can be useful on fraud detection activities with limited inspection resources.

3000|$|Starting in 1995, the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE), {{under the}} Secretary <b>of</b> Work <b>Inspection</b> (SIT), {{implemented}} {{a series of}} reforms aiming {{to increase the efficiency}} <b>of</b> <b>inspections.</b> 8 The reform emphasized a new way <b>of</b> monitoring <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> labor <b>inspections</b> (see Miguel 2004). The primary objective was the standardization of the results <b>of</b> labor <b>inspections</b> at the national level. The creation of the Federal System <b>of</b> Labor <b>Inspection</b> (SFIT) was an important tool for this aim. First, the system allowed the creation of a routine to plan labor inspections throughout the country. Schedules with the targeted outcomes (goals) began to be sent annually by various Regional Offices of Labor to create a system <b>of</b> <b>inspections.</b> This reform made policies less reactive to complaints about labor standards and more proactive and based on long-term planning. In addition, the reform developed financial incentives so that labor inspections played became more efficient. The system awarded bonuses linked to performance. The bonuses were granted in accordance with the enforcement goals initially established. These goals generally considered the number of inspected plants and the total financial amount collected from fines. It is worth noting that the bonus system is not the only incentive mechanism. Pires (2011) argues that the formation of regional and sector teams with common goals is an additional incentive mechanism to individual bonuses. 9 [...]...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze if the {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> procedures in the organic certification is conditioned by measurable structural and managerial factors under control of organic control bodies (CBs), and if there is scope for possible improvements. The analysis is based on data from the archives of the largest Italian organic CB, containing information on operators’ characteristics, including a qualitative discrete risk score defined by the CB, inspectors’ characteristics, type <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> and the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inspection,</b> in terms <b>of</b> noncompliance detected and sanctions imposed. The aim is to analyze factors that could make an inspection more effective. Our measure of effectiveness is the number of detected noncompliance per inspection visit. No specific literature on this issue is available, therefore on the basis of available information we develop a set of hypothesis concerning measurable factors that might have an effect on the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>inspections.</b> Discrete choice models are used to estimate the likelihood of noncompliance conditional to a set of covariates concerning risk assessment of the operators, inspectors characteristics, and modalities <b>of</b> the <b>inspections.</b> Different models and their distributional assumptions are discussed and tested.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the ENIQ 2 nd pilot study was to show how to fully exploit the potential of technical justifications (TJ) in the qualification <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> procedures and thereby {{reduce the number of}} test piece trials on full-scale components. As the subject of the study a ferritic BWR-type nozzle to shell weld was selected. A TJ was produced, partly relying on modelling, to predict whether a designated ultrasonic inspection would be successful in detecting the specified defects. In parallel, a test piece with deliberately introduced defects was fabricated and inspected with the inspection system specified in the TJ. Predictions and inspection results were compared. In addition, as a separate exercise, three different mathematical models were used to predict the responses of the defects in the test piece to provide information on model applicability and accuray of prediction. The ENIQ 2 nd pilot study has been largely successful in showing that TJs have the potential to predict the <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> specific <b>inspections</b> and to reduce or remove the need for large scale test pieces in qualifiation.

This article examines the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> different <b>inspection</b> and prosecution regimes between 1952 and 1995 in the Australian federal industrial relations system, and makes three points. The first is that employer evasion of employee entitlements has been significant, and sustained. Second, the shift from routine inspections to a complaints-based inspection strategy has reduced the probability of detection and subsequently encourages employer evasion. Third, the use of prosecution {{as a tool of}} `last resort' has provided little deterrence to employer non-compliance.

40|$|Containing the {{spreading}} of crime {{is a major}} challenge for society. Yet, since thousands of years, no effective strategy {{has been found to}} overcome crime. To the contrary, empirical evidence shows that crime is recurrent, a fact that is not captured well by rational choice theories of crime. According to these, strong enough punishment should prevent crime from happening. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the relationship between crime and punishment, we consider that the latter requires prior discovery of illicit behavior and study a spatial version <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> game. Simulations reveal the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance between "criminals", "inspectors", and "ordinary people" as a consequence of spatial interactions. Such cycles dominate the evolutionary process, in particular when the temptation to commit crime or the cost <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> are low or moderate. Yet, there are also critical parameter values beyond which cycles cease to exist and the population is dominated either by a stable mixture of criminals and inspectors or one of these two strategies alone. Both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions to different final states are possible, indicating that successful strategies to contain crime can be very much counter-intuitive and complex. Our results demonstrate that spatial interactions are crucial for the evolutionary <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> game, and they also reveal why criminal behavior is likely to be recurrent rather than evolving towards an equilibrium with monotonous parameter dependencies...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates post-development {{management}} approach of properties {{and how it}} could be improved to stem the tide of building collapse in Nigeria. Extant literatures were reviewed and primary data collected with the use of structured questionnaires administered on occupants of one hundred and fifty residential and seventy- five commercial properties across Lagos State, Nigeria. Data was analysed with basic descriptive tools such as frequency, percentage, Likert scale and weighted mean score. Findings reveal abuse of property management functions by property owners and non-professionals alike in the management of various properties. Findings also show a high level of dissatisfaction with the services provided mostly by the non-professionals and that integrity assessment is rarely carried out by the professionals and non-professionals alike. The study therefore recommends that post development property management services become an exclusive preserve of professional property managers.

A definitive version was subsequently published at: [URL] infrastructure systems are subjected to progressive deterioration resulting from multiple mechanical and environmental stressors. This deterioration process is developed under uncertainties related to load effects, structural resistance, and inspection outcomes, among others. In this context, life-cycle optimization techniques provide a rational approach to manage these systems considering uncertainties {{as well as several}} budgetary and safety constraints. This paper proposes a novel optimization procedure for life-cycle inspection and maintenance planning of aging structures. In this procedure, the structural system effects are accounted for by modeling the structure as a series, parallel, or a series-parallel system whose components are subjected to time-dependent deterioration phenomena. Different possible repair options are considered depending on the damage state and the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> each <b>inspection.</b> For each component, essential or preventive maintenance aiming at reducing the system failure rate, are performed when inspection results indicate that the prescribed threshold damage levels have been reached or violated. Otherwise, no repair is performed.

40|$|Despite {{the complex}} {{environmental}} regulation system established {{during the last}} ten years environmental situation in Russia tends to be negative. The main reason of Russian environmental regulation inefficiency is enforcement and monitoring problems. Russian enterprises have little incentives to follow regulation. Environmental regulation has been disregarded during Soviet economy. Now when economical and political situation is unstable environmental concerns are still not on the top of government agenda. Regulating environmental agencies don t get enough resources from government for sufficient monitoring and <b>inspections</b> <b>of</b> polluters. Generally low fines for violation of environmental requirement make situation worse. Then task to find an efficient way that could enforce enterprises to comply with pollution is important. A mechanism of enforcement pollution standards that could be appropriate in Russian circumstances when pollution monitoring is low and violation fines are restricted is presented in this paper. The main analysis developed here is based on models of Harrington (1988) and Raymond (1999) that consider the state-dependent enforcement mechanism when violation fines are restricted. In this mechanism fines and inspection rates differ depending on the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> last <b>inspection.</b> Such mechanism as proved gives enterprises extra incentives to comply with pollution regulation. The model of Harrington (1998) and its asymmetric information consideration by Raymond (1999) is extended and conditions when state-dependent enforcement is preferable to static (state-independent) enforcement are derived in the paper. If in a region concentration of firms with high marginal compliance costs is higher than concentration of firms with low marginal compliance costs then state-dependent enforcement is preferable. Applicability the state-dependent enforcement mechanism to pollution standards regulation in Russia is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Research on the {{perception}} of faces {{has focused on the}} size, shape, and configuration of inherited features or the biological phenotype, and largely ignored the effects of adornment, or the extended phenotype. Research on the evolution of signaling has shown that animals frequently alter visual features, including color cues, to attract, intimidate or protect themselves from conspecifics. Humans engage in conscious manipulation of visual signals using cultural tools in real time rather than genetic changes over evolutionary time. Here, we investigate one tool, the use of color cosmetics. In two studies, we asked viewers to rate the same female faces with or without color cosmetics, and we varied the style of makeup from minimal (natural), to moderate (professional), to dramatic (glamorous). Each look provided increasing luminance contrast between the facial features and surrounding skin. Faces were shown for 250 ms or for unlimited inspection time, and subjects rated them for attractiveness, competence, likeability and trustworthiness. At 250 ms, cosmetics had significant positive effects on all <b>outcomes.</b> Length <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> time did not change the effect for competence or attractiveness. However, with longer inspection time, the effect of cosmetics on likability and trust varied by specific makeup looks, indicating that cosmetics could impact automatic and deliberative judgments differently. The results suggest that cosmetics can create supernormal facial stimuli, and that one way they may do so is by exaggerating cues to sexual dimorphism.

40|$|The {{status of}} special {{measures}} {{has been an}} <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> school <b>inspection</b> {{for more than a}} decade. This study contributes to understanding the leading of primary schools through and beyond that outcome. Through self-perception, headteachers examine the relationship and interplay between their leadership and their schools' cultures. The study focuses on the agency of leadership through a process of change, so generating propositional ideas that extend the current theoretical framework. Two cultural typologies are identified that are specifically associated with this status. One is encountered {{at the outset of the}} journey of special measures and represents the root of the predicament. The other represents the cultural territory of schools that have moved beyond special measures. The study finds special measures to be an episodic journey of change. So doing it identifies three distinctive phases (the last divided into sub-phases representing an increasing complexity). In each the theme of culture and leadership is explored through the application of a conceptual model. These are configured to demonstrate the necessary dynamic for the formulation and transformation of schools' cultures. The differing and adaptive manifestations of phase-specific leadership are respectively described as: leading through cultural dissonance, leading counter-culturally, and leading through cultural congruence. The literature review identifies three conceptual orientations of leadership, each accordingly being related to special measures. These are technical-rational, transformational and critical forms of leadership. Each is seen as making a contribution at some point and to some degree through the course of the journey. The study, moreover, presents a conceptualisation of headship based on school context and circumstance - style, approach and theoretical positioning. This formulation emphasises the appropriateness of the leadership practice offered at given moments. However, the overall success of moving beyond special measures lies in each school's capacity for journeying through the phases to a position of cultural congruence. ...|$|R
40|$|Process {{assets are}} {{subjected}} to deterioration during operation. Inspection is carried out at pre-defined intervals and at prescribed locations. This monitoring strategy is needed {{to ensure that all}} assets perform their intended functions and that plant integrity is not threatened. Based on the <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inspection,</b> a maintenance decision such as repair or replacement is made. [...] This thesis developed a framework for optimal risk-based inspection and maintenance planning for process assets subjected to fatigue and corrosion. This framework includes two main parts: [...] Inspection sampling: This part aims at estimating the required size <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> sample for assets/systems subjected to general corrosion and localized corrosion such as stress corrosion cracking, hydrogen induced cracking and pitting corrosion. [...] Optimization <b>of</b> the risk-based <b>inspection</b> and maintenance (RBlM) plan: This part aims at determining the optimal inspection interval, inspection technique and maintenance activity (repair, replacement and/or alteration). [...] In {{the first part of the}} framework, the required sample size is estimated to assss general and localized corrosion of process assets/systems. In the case of general corrosion, a Bayesian approach-based method is proposed for calculating the required sample size. The proposed method ensures that the error in the posterior estimate of the mean metal loss due to general corrosion does not exceed a pre-defined acceptable margin of error at a specified confidence level. An analytical formula to estimate the sample size is introduced. The sample size obtained using the proposed method is smaller than a sample size obtained using the classical method with the same confidence level. This reduces sampling inspection cost without affecting the precision of the estimate. [...] In the case of localized corrosion, a different methodology is proposed to estimate the required sample size. The proposed methodology uses the extreme value and bootstrap methods. This methodology ensures that the predicted maximum localized corrosion using the extreme value method is within an acceptable margin of error at a specified confidence level. Two closed-form formulas are proposed for calculating the sample size in case of localized corrosion. The two formulas address the both situations when prior information is available or unavailable. A Bayesian updating approach is used to update prior information obtained from previously performed inspections and engineering judgement. [...] In the second part of the framework, a methodology for the optimal selection of an RBIM plan is proposed. This methodology is comprised of the following main steps: classification of asset's components/areas according to criticality of deterioration, asset deterioration modeling, risk assessment, cost estimation (inspection and maintenance) and finally the selection <b>of</b> optimal <b>inspection</b> intervals and a maintenance strategy. To solve the optimization problem, an objective function is formulated as a function of the present value <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> cost, repair/replacement cost, risk of failure and the remaining value of the asset after a specified period of time. The selection <b>of</b> the optimum <b>inspection</b> interval, inspection technique and maintenance activity is based on minimizing the objective function subject to a safety constraint that the risk of failure over the lifetime of the asset does not exceed an acceptable level. The proposed methodology allows for a minimization <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> and maintenance cost over the lifetime of a deteriorated asset/system without compromising the safety. [...] The developed RBIM framework will help operators to make well informed decisions, which will result in cost effective asset integrity management and a higher level of safety...|$|R
