5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution <b>of</b> <b>tensions,</b> collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E

5|$|One source <b>of</b> <b>tensions</b> in {{the western}} and southwestern states was the influx of Mexicans to the U.S. {{following}} the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields. It was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to Prohibition (which went into effect nationally in 1920). Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. Because of that, {{the passage of the}} initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet use of hashish by near eastern immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse of pharmaceutical hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).|$|E

40|$|We {{suggest a}} {{graphical}} representation <b>of</b> the musical <b>tension</b> flow in tonal music using a piecewise parametric curve, {{which is a}} function of time illustrating the changing degree of ten-sion in a corresponding chord progression. The tension curve can be edited by using conventional curve editing techniques to reharmonize the original music with reflecting the user’s demand to control the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> music. We introduce three different methods to measure the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> a chord in terms of a specific key, which can be used to represent the <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> the chord numerically. Then, by interpolating the series <b>of</b> numerical <b>tension</b> values, a tension curve is constructed. In this paper, we show the tension curve editing method can be effectively used in several interesting applications: enhanc-ing or weakening the overall feeling <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> in a whole song, the local control <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> in a specific region of music, the progressive transition <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> flow from source to tar-get chord progressions, and natural connection of two songs with maintaining the smoothness <b>of</b> the <b>tension</b> flow. ...|$|R
40|$|Tension {{leveling}} is {{a process}} used in the steel industry in order to eliminate any shape imperfections of cold-rolled thin strips. The master thesis deals with developing a computer program that generates basic parameters <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> leveling line.

This part also presents the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> leveling and describes the present-day design <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> levelers. The practical part of the thesis starts with an analytical description of stress-strain behaviour <b>of</b> strip during <b>tension</b> leveling (supposing the simplified conditions).

The program results are successfully verified by numerical model based on the finite element method (FEM) created in the program ANSYS.

30|$|At present, {{the studies}} on <b>tensioning</b> {{processes}} <b>of</b> {{circular saw blade}} mainly focus on the effect <b>of</b> <b>tensioning</b> process on dynamic stability of circular saw blade [5 – 15]. Only a few studies are about the generation process <b>of</b> <b>tensioning</b> stress during tensioning process. The theoretical model <b>of</b> roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Szymani. The tensioning stresses obtained by the model were generally in good agreement with the experimentally determined tensioning stresses [1]. The model <b>of</b> roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Nicoletti based on finite {{element method and the}} tensioning stresses were obtained, the introduction of these stresses into a modal analysis allowed us to predict the dynamic behavior of circular saw blade [16]. A finite element model for roll <b>tensioning</b> <b>of</b> circular saw blades which allowed the investigation <b>of</b> various roll <b>tensioning</b> parameters was developed by Heisel [17]. There is little theoretical research about the generation process <b>of</b> <b>tensioning</b> stress during multi-spot pressure tensioning process at present. For an in-depth research of generation process <b>of</b> <b>tensioning</b> stress during multi-spot pressure tensioning process, a numerical model which could both meet the requirement of computational efficiency and accuracy should be established first.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to measure the cutting force and the {{resultant}} machined surface quality for tension wood and normal wood of Rubberwood using a single saw tooth experimental set-up. Three different saw tooth geometries {{were used in the}} experiment, to establish the optimum saw tooth design for the sawing <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> wood. The results showed that the specific principal cutting force was lower for tension wood compared to normal wood, due to the less lignified cell walls <b>of</b> the <b>tension</b> wood. It appears that the lignin component in the cell wall provides the stiffness to the cell wall, which was lacking in the cell walls <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> wood, hence reducing the cutting forces significantly. Nevertheless, the overall power consumption during the machining <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> wood was markedly higher due to the presence of fuzzy grains on the machined surface <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> wood, which increased the frictional force acting on the cutting edges during the machining process. Further, it was found that saw tooth design No. 2 produced the optimal result, both from the economic and quality perspectives for the sawing <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> wood. Therefore, in order to optimize the sawing <b>of</b> <b>tension</b> wood, saw tooth with the highest rake and clearance angles is recommended as it required the least cutting force, while producing the best surface quality.
