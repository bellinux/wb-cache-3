40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the {{analysis}} of anaerobic fermentation in an experimental biogas plant. Technological processes and operation parameters were monitored; these processes and parameters include, for example, the optimal structure of the input material and the consideration of the prolonging of the duration of the fermentation process. The goal of prolonging the fermentation process is to obtain higher biogas (and methane) production and to decrease the fermentation residue effluvial emissions. Emphasis is also laid on the mutual co-fermentation of substrates with regard to further use of the results in solving technological problems in <b>other</b> <b>biogas</b> plants. This technological process was first monitored in 2009; that is, before the planned intensification and modernization of the experimental biogas plant. Thus, the evaluation of the process could become part of the planned intensification and modernization of the chosen biogas plant (extended by the addition of the second stage of methanogenesis). The results obtained from the experimental biogas plant, {{which is one of the}} pioneering biogas plants in the Czech Republic, may serve, to <b>other</b> <b>biogas</b> operators, as a base for the preparation of suitable input, and for improving the efficiency of anaerobic fermentation within their biogas plants.

40|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{environmental}} impacts associated with using fossil fuels are ever increasing, with a particular focus on the global climate change that is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouses gases (CO 2 among <b>others).</b> <b>Biogas</b> production is a key technology {{in the development of}} sustainable energy supply systems that aims to cover the energy demand using renewable sources and to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Biogas production can be achieved through anaerobic digestion (AD), a biological process, which uses biomass as a renewable energy source. Pre-treatment is the first stage of the AD process. The main goal of pre-treatment is to change the biomass properties in order to prepare lignocelluloses for enzymatic attack; which in turn enhances biogas production and anaerobic digestion performance. In this work beating treatment as a new mechanical treatment was applied to grass silage to improve the anaerobic digestion combined with sludge to produce biogas. One of the objectives is to investigate the effect of beating treatment on the AD process to produce biogas from grass silage. The other objective is to optimise the condition of the process and develop a mathematical model of this process. Techniques such as Design of Experiment (DOE) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) have been used to optimise the mean factors of the process (temperature and the time of beating). A Bioreactor has been designed and built to conduct the experiments that were designed by using RSM. The use of numerical and graphical optimisation methods have been presented in this thesis and a mathematical model has also been developed. It was reported in this research that the anaerobic digestion process using the beating pre-treatment method produces a higher volume of biogas. It was concluded that the beating treatment achieves 12. 65 % increase in biogas production from grass silage and the maximum biogas yield is 3410 cc, which can be achieved at the optimal condition: temperature of 37. 3 °C and beating time of 2 min 42 s...|$|R

40|$|Biogas {{reactors}} {{operating with}} protein-rich substrates have high methane potential and industrial value; however, {{they are highly}} susceptible to process failure because of the accumulation of ammonia. High ammonia levels cause a decline in acetate-utilizing methanogens and instead promote the conversion of acetate via a two-step mechanism involving syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) to H 2 and CO 2, followed by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Despite the key role of syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB), only a few culturable representatives have been characterized. Here we show that the microbiome of a commercial, ammonia-tolerant biogas reactor harbors a deeply branched, uncultured phylotype (unFirm_ 1) accounting for approximately 5 % of the 16 S rRNA gene inventory and sharing 88 % 16 S rRNA gene identity with its closest characterized relative.

In a situation where the government is finding it difficult to solve problems the private sector must intervene where possible, but for this to happen they must see an avenue for profit making. In doing this research work I intend to investigate the possibility of turning the state’s sewage waste to energy for profit making such that private entities have an incentive to solve this problem. This study includes a detailed study of the technology of a biogas plant, the process of digestion and a look at a number of <b>other</b> <b>biogas</b> plants operating around the world. The costs per cubic meter of gas produced were examined and were used to estimate a possible cost of such a plant in Lagos.

40|$|In Norway, the {{municipalities}} {{are obligated}} {{to contribute to the}} reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as to a transition towards green energy. Biogas production based on manure, sewage sludge and different types of waste holds a large potential for decreasing emissions of climate gases. Greve Biogass AS, on behalf of its owner municipalities in Vestfold and Telemark will build a biogas plant, The Magic Factory, with the purpose of ensuring local recycling. The biogas plant will utilize large amounts of manure as substitution for clean drinking water as process water. The objective of this Thesis is to study the specific choices made regarding the operation of The Magic Factory, considering potential outputs, resource efficiency and environmental impacts. Three main choices have been studied: 	benefits of establishing The Magic Factory 	benefits of the water choices 	benefits of The Magic Factory compared to <b>other</b> <b>biogas</b> plants that do not treat such large amount of manure This has been carried out by use of material flow analysis and life cycle assessment, investigating six different scenarios, each of them representing different substrate mixtures and handlings. The environmental impacts have been concentrated on four impact categories: 	climate change 	human toxicity 	water depletion 	fossil depletion The results from the material flow analysis show that the outputs and resource efficiency are dependent on substrate mixture and transportation distance. When a co-digestion benefit has not been accounted for, a higher output of biofuel is seen by processing solid manure over liquid manure, and food waste over manure. This Thesis supports the choices made by Greve Biogass AS for the operation of The Magic Factory, considering environmental benefits. The results show that there is an environmental benefit of establishing The Magic Factory, considering all four impact categories. Environmentally, it is slightly beneficial to substitute clean water with liquid manure and The Magic Factory asserts itself good environmentally when compared to other plants by including manure in the biogas production. The sensitivity analysis performed shows that out of the uncertain parameters, degradability is the one with the highest impact on the outputs, resource efficiency {{as well as on the}} environment. This means that the parameter should be evaluated and adjusted after the results of a case specific digestion test are known. The driving distance related to collection and transportation of the food waste does have an influence that should be taken into account when considering what waste fractions to be processed at the plant...|$|E

The analysis is done through a method that merges quantitative and qualitative information, as data is not always available. The conclusions from the study are that for all three of the studied materials, biogas production is the best treatment concerning energy and climate. Regarding organic household waste and slaughterhouse waste, the next best treatment is incineration and the poorest is composting. Liquid manure can only be treated with two different methods and therefore storing and spreading is the least preferable.

To evaluate the project’s viability we estimated the expected technical and financial performance of 4 types of business models, i. e. “CHP-farm”, “CHP-large”, “green gas” and “central upgrading of green gas”. Data stem from among <b>others</b> 23 <b>biogas</b> plants in the Netherlands. Anticipating that CHP-models and green gas models occur with a likelihood of 40 % and 60 % respectively, the total number of biogas plants would amount to 232 (1 % of dairy farms), including a total of 5 million tons of manure per year (14 % of all cattle manure in the Netherlands) and annual government subsidies of Euro 295 million.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} alternatives to {{fossil fuels and}} traditional waste management systems can be simultaneously addressed by the production of biogas using organic waste as input material. The biogas produced can be used directly for energy production or upgraded to increase methane purity {{for use in the}} engines of motor vehicles. Furthermore, the volume of waste sent to landfills greatly reduced in the process and, when a hygienization step is included, the nutrient-rich output digestate can be used as agricultural fertilizer. Not only does the use of digestate as fertilizer reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by avoiding landfilling, it also decreases the use of fossil fuels associated with the production of chemical fertilizer. Several hindrances to biogas production exist, however, and at different levels. Economic interests demand as high efficiency as possible which includes operating a system close to its limits regarding organic loading rate (OLR), fatty acid content, ammonia content, sulfide content and trace element content. Such operation presents challenges on a technical level. The presence of trace elements may counteract certain forms of inhibition that arise but are an expense biogas plants would gladly do without. Meanwhile political will may lie with other energy sources or waste management systems. The mass balance of trace elements on agricultural land from biogas derived fertilizer must also be considered. In this study, the effects of trace elements in thermophilic biogas production (52 °C) were investigated through the operation of two 5 -litre CSTR reactors. Surveillance parameters were tracked over the 184 day experiment period with microbiological analysis performed on 9 digester liquid samples taken during three key periods: startup, 3 hydraulic retention times after startup and 3 hydraulic retention times after an increase in OLR. Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis was used to analyze the dynamics of microbial community members carrying the functional gene, fhs, encoding the enzyme formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) active in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and present in syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria. These acetogens are especially important given their role in helping to define the balance between the two possible pathways of methanogenesis, acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic. A clone library of variants of the fhs gene was constructed to identify dominant members of this population. A phylogenetic analysis was also carried out to place gene variants found in this analysis in the greater context of variation of the fhs gene from previous sequencing of <b>other</b> <b>biogas</b> reactors. This study revealed a lack of differences between biogas production with or without trace element additions which was in contrast to previous studies.

40|$|Limited insight is {{available}} regarding {{the benefits of}} an Integrated Product Service Offering (IPSO) as a possibility to encapsulate a technology. This paper applies a framework termed the PCP (Provider – Customer – Product) Triangle to two cases. The PCP Triangle aims to identify benefits (including technology encapsulation) and risks of IPSOs in a systematic manner. In one case, a technology {{is the core of}} the offering and IPSO is an alternative as a business model. The <b>other</b> case concerns <b>biogas</b> production, where know-how to control the production {{is one of the key}} assets of the provider to add value. By doing so, it validates the PCP Triangle further with cases and explains how it can be used. The results show that the PCP Triangle is a simple but effective tool to describe and visualize the flow of information around the product by discussing strategies for keeping the firm’s intelligence in manufacturing. The paper also discusses the IPSO’s contribution to environmental performance. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, {{everyone}} {{has been talking about}} biogas plants: politicians, ecologists, technicians, economists, laymen and experts. In <b>other</b> words: <b>biogas</b> has become fashionable. The energy crisis of the next few years shall be the shortage of fuel for the daily needs of millions of people and biogas plants seem to be a promising solution to help in solving this problem. Biogas plants are complicated enough to require both a total involvement with their specific technology and an accurate risk assessment for design purposes. With particular reference to this last feature, the number of accidents involving biogas plants has been too many to ignore. Frequent accident causes are: leakage in the storage tank and/or in the biogas distribution network, formation of flammable mixtures during maintenance operations, accidental release of H 2 S, effluent discharge and developing of high pressure inside the digester. Biogas plants are often operated wrongly, deficient in technological details and incorrectly scaled-up. Moreover, all these mistakes are repeated over and over again. Therefore, there is the pressing need for a quick procedure to assess the reliability of these plants in order to operate them safely. In this work, a simple but accurate risk assessment has been carried out on a case study biogas plant using a fault tree analysis applied to the top event “fire in the digester ” (one of the main causes of accident in this plant’s typology). Results have shown that the overall risk (considering one year of mission time) is less than 10 - 8. This value is acceptable considering that, near these plants, the number of inhabitants does not exceed 100 persons...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} local and {{regional}} initiatives encouraging the production and use of regional produced energy grows. In these new developments biogas can play a role, as a producer of energy, but also in balancing the electricity grid. Collection of biogas from several digesters to a hub supports the efficient use of the biogas. Recently we reported on a biogas transport model; the model assesses transport costs and energy use in a grid with fishbone and star layout collecting biogas (DOI: 10. 1016 /j. biombioe. 2016. 01. 005). When a biogas grid {{is used for the}} transport of biogas, the grid can serve as a storage of biogas as well. A model was developed to describe line-pack storage in a transport grid for different digester scale, region size and grid lay-out. Line-pack storage does not require additional investments and variable costs consist of extra compression costs. Storage costs and maximum line-pack storage are estimated in a biogas transport grid with star lay-out and fishbone lay-out. A comparison is made with <b>other</b> types of <b>biogas</b> storage, pressurized pipes and pressureless storage; the costs structure of line-pack storage, i. e. in €ct m- 3 h- 1, differs from these other types...|$|R
