When Japan joined the OECD in 1966, it was obliged to agree to OECD principles on capital liberalization, an obligation that led Japan {{to begin the process}} of liberalizing its many tight controls on investment flows into and out of Japan. Japan is also a participant in the OECD's [...] "gentlemen's agreement" [...] on guidelines for government-supported export credits, which places a floor on interest rates and <b>other</b> <b>terms</b> for <b>loans</b> to developing countries from government-sponsored export-import banks.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} many banks have {{attempted}} to improve the measurement and management of credit risk by assigning risk ratings to business loans. Virtually all large banks now assign such ratings. However, until recently {{there has been little}} information on the use of risk ratings by smaller banks. Recent revisions to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Terms of Business Lending and telephone consultations with more than 100 banks on the survey panel provide data on the prevalence and precision of risk rating systems at banks of all sizes. We find that the use of risk rating systems is quite widespread, but that smaller banks generally have less detailed systems than do larger banks. In addition, the new survey data allow us to asses the relationships between loan risk ratings and <b>loan</b> <b>terms.</b> Not surprisingly, riskier loans generally carry higher interest rates, even after taking account of <b>other</b> <b>loan</b> <b>terms.</b> There are more complex relationships between loan risk and <b>other</b> <b>loan</b> <b>terms.</b> Regression results indicate that banks of all sizes price for risk. We do not find a relationship between reported loan risk and delinquency and charge-off rates. However, this may reflect how recently the risk rating data have become available.

40|$|Corporate {{financing}} decision of firms {{has remained a}} debatable issue in both corporate and academic discussions. The present study aims to investigate the factors responsible for the {{financing decision}} of firms in Nigeria. To achieve this, 63 nonfinancial firms listed on the Nigerian stock exchange were selected based on data availability {{for the period of}} 2001 to 2010. Financial firms were excluded because of their similar regulatory framework and in order to ease the comparability of results. While most studies focused on debt-ratio as a measure of leverage, the present study uses the ratio of total debt and total assets. The empirical findings from the static panel regression analysis confirms that Nigerian firms tends toward internal financing through retained earnings, equity and <b>other</b> short <b>term</b> funds, against long term financing majorly through debts and <b>other</b> long <b>term</b> <b>loans.</b> One factor that could be said to account for this decision is the ill developed bond market in the country as well as the accessibility of firms to long term finances from the existing sources that is marred with high interest rates and huge collaterals...|$|R
2500|$|For any {{residential}} mortgage loan, no mortgage originator {{may receive}} compensation that varies {{based on the}} <b>term</b> of the <b>loan,</b> <b>other</b> than the principal amount. In general, the mortgage originator can only receive payment from the consumer, except as provided in rules that may be established by the Board. Additionally, the mortgage originator must verify the consumer's ability to pay. A violation of the [...] "ability to repay" [...] standard, or a mortgage that has excessive fees or abusive terms, may be raised as a foreclosure defense by a borrower against a lender without regard to any statute of limitations. The Act bans the payment of yield spread premiums or other originator compensation {{that is based on}} the interest rate or <b>other</b> <b>terms</b> of the <b>loans.</b>|$|R
40|$|Exponential growth bias is the {{pervasive}} tendency to linearize exponential functions when assessing them intuitively. We show that exponential growth bias can explain two stylized facts in household finance: {{the tendency to}} underestimate an interest rate given <b>other</b> <b>loan</b> <b>terms,</b> and the tendency to underestimate a future value given <b>other</b> investment <b>terms.</b> Bias matters empirically: More-biased households borrow more, save less, favor shorter maturities, and use and benefit more from financial advice, conditional on a rich set of household characteristics. There {{is little evidence that}} our measure of exponential growth bias merely proxies for broader financial sophistication. Copyright (c) 2009 the American Finance Association. ...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{differences}} in the pricing of syndicated loans between U. S. and European loans. For credit lines, U.

S. firms pay significantly higher spreads. While European firms across the rating spectrum issue <b>terms</b> <b>loans,</b> only low quality U. S. firms rely on <b>term</b> <b>loans.</b> U. S. issuers perform worse after loan origination compared to European issuers, which explains 30 % of the spread differential. Increasing loan supply by institutional lenders in the U.
