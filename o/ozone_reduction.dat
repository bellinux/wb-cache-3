40|$|From an {{examination}} of the agreements and differences between different satellite instruments, it is difficult to believe that existing satellite instruments determine upper stratospheric ozone much better than 4 pct.; by extension, it probably would require at least a 4 pct. change to be reliably detected as a change. The best estimates of the vertical profiles of ozone change in the upper stratosphere between 1979 and 1986 are judged to be those given by the two SAGE satellite instruments. SAGE- 2 minus SAGE- 1 gives a much lower <b>ozone</b> <b>reduction</b> than that given by the archived Solar Backscatter UV data. The average SAGE profiles of ozone changes between 20 and 50 degs north and between 20 and 50 degs south are given. The SAGE- 1 and SAGE- 2 comparison gives an <b>ozone</b> <b>reduction</b> of about 4 pct. at 25 km over temperate latitudes. Five ground based Umkehr stations between 36 and 52 degs north, corrected for the effects of volcanic aerosols, report an <b>ozone</b> <b>reduction</b> between 1979 and 1987 at Umkehr layer 8 of 9 + or - 5 pct.

Yet, the consequences for terrestrial ecosystems of the increased solar W-B (280 - 320 nm) radiation resulting from total column <b>ozone</b> <b>reduction</b> are not understood. Based on studies of higher plant response to UV-B, several possible consequences for ecosystems include decreased primary production, altered plant species composition, and altered secondary chemistry with implications for herbivory, litter decomposition and biogeochemical cycles. However, like the assessment of increased atmospheric CO 2, extrapolation from studies with isolated plants to ecosystem function is very tenuous at best. Very few UV-B studies have dealt with multispecies systems. Most of the UV-B research {{in the past two decades}} (since the first suggestions of <b>ozone</b> <b>reduction)</b> has been conducted as short-term experiments in growth chambers and greenhouses where the unnatural spectral balance of radiation can lead to unrealistic conclusions.

40|$|The {{effects of}} various <b>ozone</b> density <b>reductions</b> of the zonally {{averaged}} circulation are evaluated with a numerical quasi-geostrophic model. If the ozone perturbations {{are confined to}} the polar regions and are minuscule on a global basis as was characteristic of the August 1972 solar proton event, then the calculations indicate a negligible effect on the mean circulation. For global ozone perturbations by predicted halocarbon pollution, about 10 % reduction in the zonal jet strength and less than a 5 % change in global mean stratospheric temperature are calculated. Large, uniform <b>ozone</b> <b>reductions</b> (above 50 %) produce significant effects on the mean circulation: a substantial collapse of the stratosphere due to cooler temperatures, and a weak polar night jet. The reflection and transmission of quasi-stationary planetary waves in the middle atmosphere are computed to be insensitive to solar activity as extreme as the August 1972 solar proton event.

40|$|The {{quality and}} {{quantity}} of UV measurements have increased greatly in the last few years. Variations among measurements from different instruments are diminishing toward the 5 % level. Long-term trend detection is still a problem, with little historical data available for baseline estimations. Enhanced UV levels are clearly associated with the Antarctic springtime <b>ozone</b> <b>reductions.</b> Measurements show that maximum UV levels at the South Pole are reached well before the summer solstice, and DNA-damaging radiation at Palmer Station, Antarctica (64 degrees S) during the springtime ozone depletion can exceed maximum summer values at San Diego, USA (32 degrees N). UV increases at mid-latitudes are smaller. However, increases associated with the record low ozone column of 1992 / 93 in the Northern Hemisphere are evident when examined on a wavelength-specific basis. Measurements in Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, and Australia show relatively high UV levels compared to corresponding Northern Hemispheric latitudes, with differences in both stratospheric ozone and tropospheric pollutants likely to be playing a role. Tropospheric ozone and aerosols can reduce global UV-B irradiances appreciably. At some locations, tropospheric pollution has increased since pre-industrial times, leading to decreases in surface UV radiation. However, recent trends in tropospheric pollution probably had only minor effects on UV trends relative to the effect of stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>reductions.</b> Global <b>ozone</b> measurements from satellites over the period 1979 - 1993 imply significant UV-B increases at high and mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, but only small changes in the tropics. Such estimates however assume that cloud cover and tropospheric pollution have remained constant over this time period. Under the current CFC phase-out schedules, global UV levels are predicted to peak {{around the turn of the}} century in association with peak loading of chlorine in the stratosphere and the concomitant <b>ozone</b> <b>reductions.</b> The recovery to pre-ozone depletion levels is expected to take place gradually over the next 50 years...|$|R

In addition, four qualitative reasons are suggested for thinking that significant <b>ozone</b> <b>reductions</b> by cosmic ray influxes will lead to an increased terrestrial albedo from stratospheric condensation.
