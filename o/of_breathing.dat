50|$|A {{goal for}} most {{patients}} on mechanical ventilation {{is to be}} weaned from the ventilator. The weaning process is highly dependent on the patient's pathology, but the final common pathway to ventilator independence always includes at least one trial <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>breathing.</b> Trials <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>breathing</b> {{have been shown to}} accurately predict the success <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>breathing.</b>|$|R

30|$|Peak inspiratory {{pressure}} (PIP) is {{the pressure}} which is delivered by ventilator. Dynamic distending pressure <b>of</b> T-piece <b>breathing</b> is equivalent <b>of</b> Pmus <b>of</b> T-piece <b>breathing,</b> because T-piece breathing is not under pressure support.|$|R
5|$|Once it was {{recognized}} that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that re-compression could relieve the symptoms, Paul Bert showed in 1878 that decompression sickness is caused by nitrogen bubbles released from tissues and blood during or after decompression, and showed the advantages <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> oxygen after developing decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work <b>of</b> <b>breathing,</b> increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E
5|$|People with {{infectious}} pneumonia {{often have}} a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during deep breaths, and an increased rate <b>of</b> <b>breathing.</b> In the elderly, confusion {{may be the most}} prominent sign.|$|E

5|$|The viral {{infection}} that causes croup leads to {{swelling of the}} larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor.|$|E
5|$|While {{cockroaches}} do {{not have}} lungs as do vertebrates, and can continue to respire if their heads are removed, in some very large species, the body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air {{in and out of}} the spiracles; this may be considered a form <b>of</b> <b>breathing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya dedicates {{significant}} amount of text to explain the art of mastering each stage <b>of</b> <b>breathing,</b> that is inhalation, exhalation and stoppage between the two. Each stage is {{discussed in terms of}} its nature, speed, duration, depth on its own and relative to the other stage <b>of</b> <b>breathing,</b> regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind. In order to keep time for each stage without distraction, he recommends silently reciting time-measured mantras or sound beats to help measure each stage and thus establish progress during the yoga. The mantras for internal time measurement mentioned include Pranava (Om), Gayatri with Vyahritis, or Gayatri with Siras.|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Epidemiologic {{studies on}} the {{consequences}} <b>of</b> sleep-disordered <b>breathing</b> invariably use the apnea–hypopnea index as the primary measure of disease severity. Although hypopneas constitute a majority <b>of</b> disordered <b>breathing</b> events, significant controversy remains about the best criteria used to define these events...|$|R

50|$|Ovarian {{hyperstimulation}} syndrome (OHSS) {{occurs in}} 5-10% of cases. Symptoms {{depend on whether}} the case is mild, moderate, or severe, and can range from bloating and nausea, through to shortness <b>of</b> <b>breathe,</b> pleural effusion, and excessive weight gain (more than 2 pounds per day).|$|R
5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} may lead to incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from the seizure remains.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing mouths and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at {{the bases of}} their legs; both of these features {{are part of the}} ancestral arthropod feeding system. Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation <b>of</b> <b>breathing)</b> during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Provision <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> gas at ambient {{pressure}} can greatly prolong {{the duration of}} a dive, {{but there are other}} problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.|$|E
5|$|Some {{noble gases}} have direct {{application}} in medicine. Helium is sometimes {{used to improve}} the ease <b>of</b> <b>breathing</b> of asthma sufferers. Xenon is used as an anesthetic because of its high solubility in lipids, which makes it more potent than the usual nitrous oxide, {{and because it is}} readily eliminated from the body, resulting in faster recovery. Xenon finds application in medical imaging of the lungs through hyperpolarized MRI. Radon, which is highly radioactive and is only available in minute amounts, is used in radiotherapy.|$|E
