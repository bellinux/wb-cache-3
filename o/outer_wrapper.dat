I at once directed my assistant to put up the arsenic (two ounces of it), and I made the necessary entry in my book. Mr. Macallan signed the entry, and I signed it afterward as witness.

60|$|There {{were three}} battalions of the Turkish infantry, exercising here; {{and they seemed}} to perform their {{evolutions}} in a very satisfactory manner: that is, they fired all together, and charged and halted in very straight lines, and bit off imaginary cartridge- tops with great fierceness and regularity, and made all their ramrods ring to measure, just like so many Christians. The men looked small, young, clumsy, and ill-built; uncomfortable in their shabby European clothes; and about the legs, especially, seemed exceedingly weak and ill-formed. Some score of military invalids were lolling in the sunshine, about a fountain and a marble summer- house that stand on the ground, watching their comrades' manoeuvres (as if they could never have enough of that delightful pastime); and these sick were much better cared for than their healthy companions. Each man had two dressing-gowns, one of white cotton, and an <b>outer</b> <b>wrapper</b> of warm brown woollen. Their heads were accommodated with wadded cotton nightcaps; and it seemed to me, from their condition and from the excellent character of the military hospitals, that it would be much more wholesome to be ill than to be well in the Turkish service.|$|E

5000|$|Yorkie bars were {{originally}} composed of six chunks of chocolate each marked Rowntree; they were wrapped in both foil and an <b>outer</b> paper <b>wrapper</b> and weighed 2 oz or 58 g.

5000|$|The metal {{walls of}} the firebox are {{normally}} called sheets, which are separated and supported by stays. The stays support and brace the [...] "sheets" [...] (plates) against pressure. Ideally, they should be located {{at right angles to}} the sheets, but since the <b>outer</b> sheet (<b>wrapper</b> sheet) is radial and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) is relatively flat by comparison, such a relationship to both sheets is impossible. The actual location of the stays is a compromise. Since stay breakage is hidden, the stays have longitudinal holes, called tell-tales, drilled in them which will blow water and steam, revealing if they are broken. A boiler with more than 5 broken stays, or two next to each, other must be taken out of service and the stays replaced. The fusible plugs, usually located in the highest part of the crown sheet, have a soft metal alloy core which melts out if the water level in the boiler gets too low. Steam and water blowing into the firebox both alerts the locomotive crew to the low water condition and helps put out the fire. Not all locomotives are equipped with fusible plugs. Also, fusible plugs should be replaced at regular intervals, about every three months for a locomotive in regular service, because the soft metal alloy core will slowly melt out over time even if the boiler water is carried at proper levels. The [...] "mudholes," [...] or washout plugs, allow access to the interior of the boiler for washing and scraping away boiler mud and scale.|$|R
50|$|The firm of Garrett {{also sought}} a {{reliable}} stayless firebox for their smaller boilers at {{around the same}} time in the 1920s. Their solution was more conventional: a conventional outer firebox enclosed an inner firebox, where the inner crown sheet was formed into a curved valley. For a small firebox, this acted as a girder stay between the end sheets of the firebox and was sufficient to be self-supporting. The portable engines used this pattern alone. For the slightly more powerful road tractor boilers, the inner firebox was still self-supporting but the <b>outer</b> <b>wrapper</b> now required crosswise sling stays to support it, where previously it would have been supported by the stays to the inner firebox.|$|E
50|$|A {{safety fuse}} {{consists}} of a black powder core in a textile tube, covered with asphaltum or other waterproofing agent, and having an <b>outer</b> <b>wrapper</b> of tough textile or plastic. They are made in a standard diameter designed to be crimped into blasting caps. Once ignited, safety fuses will burn underwater, and have no external flame that might ignite methane or other fuels such as might be found in mines or other industrial environments. Safety fuses are manufactured with specified burn times per 30 cm, e.g. 60 seconds, which means that a length of fuse 30 cm long will take 60 seconds to burn. Manufacturers warn that although every effort is made to ensure uniform burn times, safety fuses are subject to variation depending on conditions and should be used with adequate safety measures in place.|$|E
50|$|They are square, {{and they}} are 20 mm in length and width, and 7 mm thick, {{including}} the packaging. There are several flavours, including lemon, orange, pineapple, raspberry and cherry, indicated by the colour of the packaging (yellow, orange, blue, red, and bright red, respectively), which is characteristic of the sweet. The classic packaging (which measured 6.3 by 4.5 cm) involves the sweet respecting the rectangular shape, with white text showing the sugus name (in lowercase) and the specific flavor (in uppercase), all over the packaging. Within the packaging was a small, white light inner wrapper of 6.3 by 1.9 cm surrounding the sweet preventing adhesion to the <b>outer</b> <b>wrapper,</b> for example at times of excessive heat. The name, though only a brand, became {{the name of this}} product. It appeared on the market under other brands, with different names, but all are given the name sugus.|$|E
5000|$|Quality cigars {{are still}} handmade. An {{experienced}} cigar-roller can produce hundreds of very good, nearly identical, cigars per day. The rollers keep the tobacco moist — especially the wrapper — and use specially designed crescent-shaped knives, called chavetas, {{to form the}} filler and wrapper leaves quickly and accurately. Once rolled, the cigars are stored in wooden forms as they dry, in which their uncapped ends are cut to a uniform size. From this stage, the cigar is a complete product that can be [...] "laid down" [...] and aged for decades if kept as close to 21 °C (70 °F), and 70% relative humidity. Once purchased, proper storage is typically in a specialized wooden humidor. Some cigars, especially premium brands, use different varieties of tobacco for the filler and the wrapper. Long filler cigars are a far higher quality of cigar, using long leaves throughout. These cigars also use a third variety of tobacco leaf, called a [...] "binder", between the filler and the <b>outer</b> <b>wrapper.</b> This permits the makers to use more delicate and attractive leaves as a wrapper. These high-quality cigars almost always blend varieties of tobacco. Even Cuban long-filler cigars will combine tobaccos {{from different parts of}} the island to incorporate several different flavors.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous reprints {{throughout}} the decades have also kept EC alive on book store shelves, starting with Nostalgia Press's EC Horror Comics Of The 1950s tome (1971), followed by publisher Cochran's six EC Portfolios (1971-1977), but {{primarily because of}} his Complete EC Library, printing all of the 'New Trend' comic titles (although missing the unique stories from the three 3-D EC Classics issues), {{as well as all}} of the 'New Direction' and 'Picto-Fiction' titles, and some of the 'Pre-Trend' title issues, in a series of 18 b&w boxed-sets (19 if you include the fact that the Mad set was done as both color and b&w editions) containing a total of sixty-six hardcover books, all shot directly from the original art, mostly published from 1979 to 1996, with the Picto-Fiction box being delayed until 2006. Between 1992 and 2000, Cochran and Gemstone Publishing also produced 295 different full-color individual issue reproductions of all the [...] "New Trend' (except Mad) and 'New Direction' EC Comics, and subsequently sixty-three [...] "EC Annuals" [...] which glued together titled chronological overstock copies of those individual issues in a new <b>outer</b> <b>wrapper,</b> in a nod to the original unsold-stock content of the EC Annuals of the 50s, although back in the fifties there was no specification as to what issues may have been contained inside the covers to those various annuals, which could vary from copy to copy.|$|E
5000|$|Blunts {{originally}} {{got their}} name from their [...] "broad or rounded tip", and were named as such in the 19th century to differentiate them from other cigars with a tapered, pointed tip. Blunts are a specific size cigar {{that have been}} so popular as to have been once sold in specific vending machines. The original blunt cigar was manufactured in Philadelphia out of a single leaf outer tobacco wrapper. At the time {{this was the only}} cigar wrapped in one continuous leaf, other cigars used pieces of leaves for their <b>outer</b> <b>wrapper.</b> Tobacco leaves naturally taper at the ends. Since this cigar was rolled in one leaf the end would taper and had a round appearance (thus leading to the Blunt name). Due to the popularity of this style of cigar many other Blunts were launched into the marketplace. Brands of blunts include: Phillies, Dutch Masters, Backwoods, White Owl, Altadis marketing [...] "Antonio Y Cleopatra", [...] "El Producto", and [...] "Tampa Nugget" [...] brands, Swedish Match marketing [...] "Game" [...] and [...] "Garcia Y Vega" [...] brands, and Swisher Sweets marketing [...] "King Edward", [...] "Optimo", and Pom Pom brands. These types of cigars are commonly sold in convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, and drugstores, in contrast to premium cigars, which are sold in cigar shops. Blunts burn quickly like cigarettes, and some can be smoked in about five minutes, whereas a premium cigar takes an hour or so to burn. Unlike premium cigars, blunts are either already cut or have a hole in the mouth end for the smoke to go through, and so they {{do not need to be}} cut at the mouth end. Blunts are also significantly cheaper than premium cigars.|$|E
40|$|A cigar is {{a product}} made of tobacco leaves or parts of leaves rolled {{together}} {{and covered with a}} binder (a firm tobacco leaf which holds the filler together and gives the cigar its shape) and an <b>outer</b> <b>wrapper</b> made of natural or reconstituted tobacco. The term includes cheroots and cigarillos (small or miniature cigars). Some small cigars are similar in size to a cigarette and may include a filter. Those with a filter usually have a wrapper of processed tobacco which looks similar to brown paper, while small cigars without a filter are generally wrapped in tobacco leaf. 1, 2 Prevalence In Great Britain there has been a steady decline in pipe and cigar smoking among men since the 1970 s. In 2007, just 2 % of men smoked at least one cigar a month, compared with 34 % in 1974. Very few women have ever smoked cigars and since 1978 the numbers have been scarcely measurable.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} ways in which Sudanese women employed their everyday dress as a public platform for constructing new national and gendered identities during the nationalist and independence periods of the early twentieth century. Though formally excluded from the political system and socially restrained from speaking publicly, Sudanese women engaged in politics through the creation and negotiation of bodily practices. This work focuses on the tobe, a simple <b>outer</b> <b>wrapper</b> of cotton cloth, popular in northern Sudan. Wrapped around a woman whenever she exited her home, the tobe literally and figuratively allowed Sudanese women to enter public spaces and debates. Framed in this modest garment, a growing number of Sudanese activists boldly established a public presence for themselves. This dissertation joins scholarship on gender, post-colonialism, and dress to present new avenues through which women assert a political voice. Faced with a limited source base authored by Sudanese women, this research draws upon memoirs of British civil servants, photographs, political cartoons, novels, and vivid anecdotes to illustrate {{the ways in}} which Sudanese women manipulated the tobe to convey their understandings of place, nation, and self. Dress as an analytic lens disrupts the assumption of a male-dominated public sphere and instead rightly recognizes the potential of women’s adorned bodies to convey political messages. Thus this work moves beyond discussions of abstract private/public space to actual terrain. It posits that mobility – the physical movement of women’s bodies (as students, midwives, activists, and respectable ladies) is a critical site of identity formation and historical inquiry. In weaving the seemingly disparate threads of imperial education, the rise of Sudanese women’s activism, visualizations of public order, and new behaviors of movement, this dissertation recreates the dynamic spaces in which northern Sudanese women confronted and negotiated their gendered and national identities. In the hands of Sudanese women, the deceptively simple tobe conveyed powerful socio-political messages of discipline, respectability, beauty, and a woman 2 ̆ 7 s place in an increasingly global world. ...|$|E
