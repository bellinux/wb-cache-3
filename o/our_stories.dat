5|$|In a final {{gesture of}} love and comprehension, after a {{lifetime}} of despising his father's stories and his father as story-teller, Will finishes the story his father has begun, pulling together the themes, images and characters of his father's storied life to blend reality and fantasy in act of communion and care. By unselfishly releasing the anger he has held about his father's stories, Will gains the understanding that all we are <b>our</b> <b>stories</b> and that his father's stories gave him a reality and substance and a dimension that was as real, genuine, and deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out. Will comes to understand, then, that his father—and the rest of us—are <b>our</b> <b>stories</b> and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.|$|E
25|$|The Notre Dame review {{also noted}} that {{benefits}} from the restrictions weren’t enough to address the deep-rooted issues associated with alcohol abuse, and communities in the Valley needed continuing support. In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history that we can do nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of <b>our</b> <b>stories</b> and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E
500|$|The paper {{maintains}} a strict profanity policy. A 2007 {{review of a}} concert by punk band Fucked Up, for example, completely avoided mention of the group's name. However, the Times has on occasion published unfiltered video content that includes profanity and slurs where it has determined that such video has news value. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the Times did print the words [...] "fuck" [...] and [...] "pussy," [...] among others, when reporting on the vulgar statements made by Donald Trump in a 2005 recording. Times politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: [...] "It's a rare thing for us to use this language in <b>our</b> <b>stories,</b> even in quotes, and we discussed it at length," [...] ultimately deciding to publish it because of its news value and because [...] "o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given {{that we would be}} running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said." ...|$|E

500|$|When Mendelsohn {{was giving}} a talk, she accidentally {{mentioned}} the crossover, as a result Variety was already inquiring about the crossover episodes [...] that same day. Mendelsohn eventually revealed the crossover at the Banff event in Canada. After the episode was taped, Lorre stated: [...] "The biggest challenge for us was doing a comedy with a murder in it. Generally <b>our</b> <b>stories</b> are a little lighter. Would our audience go with a dead body in it? There was a moment where it could have gone either way. I think the results were spectacular. It {{turned out to be}} a really funny episode." [...] "Fish in a Drawer" [...] was written by Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar and directed by Jeff Melman. As an inside joke, George Eads, who plays crime scene investigator Nick Stokes on CSI made a cameo as a guest at the wedding reception. Three days after the initial airing of [...] "Fish in a Drawer", [...] "Two And a Half Deaths", the corresponding CSI episode, aired on CBS. However, in an early Zap2it interview, both Mendelsohn and Lorre stated that this might be the last time a crossover like this might occur.|$|E

[...] He added he preferred this video to the official one. The official music video was directed by Mark Pellington and released on February 17, 2012.
