50|$|The hormones {{involved}} in the reproductive system are negatively affected with an increase of weight. In humans, via white adipocytes (fat cells), production of the hormone leptin (an adipokine) acts on the hypothalamus where reproductive hormone Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is produced. Leptin is also {{a product of the}} <b>obese</b> <b>gene.</b> Leptins interaction with the hypothalamus decreases appetite, therefore a mutation in the <b>obese</b> <b>gene</b> would result in an increased appetite, leading to inevitable obesity. Leptin {{has been found to be}} linked to the HPG axis as it can induce the release of GnRH by the hypothalamus and subsequently follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and leutinising hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Pre-pubertal individuals that lack leptin fail to reach the pubertal stage. If given leptin administratively, the mutation would be reversed and puberty resumed. Leptin is further expressed in mature follicles produced by the ovary, suggesting it plays a role in oocyte maturation, hence embryo development.|$|E

A major gene that causes obesity in mice was identified on chromosome 6. The <b>obese</b> <b>gene</b> (ob/ob) was determined from one mutant mouse, discovered in 1950. Coleman and researchers further identified a gene on chromosome 4 that led to hyperphagia and obesity in mice. The gene also correlated to the severe onset of diabetes (db/db gene). The experimenters used parabiosis to conjoin a db/db mouse to a normal mouse, and the normal mouse would starve to death after one week. The db/db mouse would still have a high blood sugar and food in its system. The db/db mouse was determined to have a satiety factor so potent that the other mouse would starve to death. A db/db mouse was conjoined with an ob/ob mouse {{and the result was}} the same as the first experiment. The obese mouse starved in 20-30 days, similar to the thin counterpart in the first experiment. The db/db mutant mouse overproduced a satiety factor but could not respond to it, perhaps due to a defective receptor, whereas the ob/ob mutant recognized and responded to the factor but could not reproduce it. Further studies with db/db mice with lesions in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus suggested that the receptor for the satiety factor was found in these brain receptors.|$|E

40|$|A {{mutation}} {{within the}} <b>obese</b> <b>gene</b> was recently {{identified as the}} genetic basis for obesity in the ob/ob mouse. The <b>obese</b> <b>gene</b> product, leptin, is a 16 -kDa protein expressed predominantly in adipose tissue. Consistent with leptin's postulated role as an extracellular signaling protein, human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with the <b>obese</b> <b>gene</b> secreted leptin with minimal intracellular accumulation. Upon differentiation of 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes into adipocytes, the leptin mRNA was expressed concomitant with mRNAs encoding adipocyte marker proteins. A factor(s) present in calf serum markedly activated expression of leptin by fully differentiated 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. A 16 -hr fast decreased (by approximately 85 %) the leptin mRNA level of adipose tissue of lean (ob/+ or +/+) mice but {{had no effect on}} the approximately 4 -fold higher level in obese (ob/ob) littermates. Since the mutation at the ob locus fails to produce the functional protein, yet its cognate mRNA is overproduced, it appears that leptin is necessary for its own downregulation. Leptin mRNA was also suppressed in adipose tissue of rats during a 16 -hr fast and was rapidly induced during a 4 -hr refeeding period. Insulin deficiency provoked by streptozotocin also markedly down-regulated leptin mRNA and this suppression was rapidly reversed by insulin. These results suggest that insulin may regulate the expression of leptin...|$|E

Common cardio-metabolic risk factors and gender do not influence these findings. This study demonstrates that differences in the acute transcriptional response to insulin are primarily driven by obesity per se, challenging the notion of healthy obese adipose tissue, at least in severe obesity...|$|R
40|$|Dietary {{fatty acid}} (FA) {{composition}} and energy restriction (ER) independently affect serum leptin levels; {{however it is}} not known whether this correlates with changes in <b>obese</b> (ob) <b>gene</b> expression. Herein, we assessed whether dietary FA composition and ER influence white adipose tissue (WAT) ob mRNA by Northern analysis. Animals consumed diets containing tallow (BT), safflower oil (SO) or fish oil (FO) ad libitum or at 60 % ad libitum intakes. Serum leptin values were not different between levels of energy intake. ER decreased weight gain and WAT weights, which positively correlated with serum leptin values. WAT ob mRNA levels were in the rank order: FO > SO > BT in depots of all groups with ER showing a lower level of ob mRNA. Data show similarity in ob mRNA levels between depots with discordance in circulating leptin levels. These data suggest that energy restriction exerts greater control over leptin production than dietary fat source...|$|R
40|$|To help {{elucidate}} the physiological role of leptin during somatic and sexual maturation, circulating concentrations of leptin were measured in 36 male rhesus monkeys of ages ranging from 0 – 20 yr. The body weight {{of these animals}} showed a steady increase of � 1 kg/yr during {{the first decade of}} life and reached a plateau at approximately 13 yr. In contrast, serum leptin concentrations showed a biphasic developmental pattern, which was highlighted by a strong negative correlation with body weight (r �� 0. 74, P � 0. 001) before the onset of puberty (at � 3. 5 yr) and by a strong positive correlation afterward (r � 0. 77, P � 0. 001). Overall, the developmental changes in serum leptin concentrations closely mimicked the expected developmental changes in serum testosterone concentrations (r � 0. 62, P � 0. 001), which were highly elevated at birth, fell to basal levels during the LEPTIN, a protein product of the <b>obese</b> (ob) <b>gene,</b> i...|$|R
