5|$|Among {{the first}} major neo-noir films—the term often applied to films that {{consciously}} refer back to the classic noir tradition—was the French Tirez sur le pianiste (1960), directed by François Truffaut from a novel {{by one of the}} gloomiest of American noir fiction writers, David Goodis. Noir crime films and melodramas have been produced in many countries in the post-classic area. Some of these are quintessentially self-aware neo-noirs—for example, Il Conformista (1969; Italy), Der Amerikanische Freund (1977; Germany), The Element of Crime (1984; Denmark), As Tears Go By (1988; Hong Kong), and El Aura (2005; Argentina). <b>Others</b> <b>simply</b> share narrative elements and a version of the hardboiled sensibility associated with classic noir, such as The Castle of Sand (1974; Japan), Insomnia (1997; Norway), Croupier (1998; UK), Blind Shaft (2003; China), and The Square (2008; Australia).|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} operations that can be performed on binary trees. Some are mutator operations, while <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> return useful information about the tree.|$|E
25|$|Screening for Tamil Tigers {{took place}} without any {{transparency}} or external scrutiny. Some of those separated by the screening were summarily executed whilst women were raped. <b>Others</b> <b>simply</b> disappeared.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the line}} {{operates}} two cars, in normal service only one carries passengers, whilst the <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> {{acts as a}} counterweight.|$|R

25|$|Symbolic {{gestures}} - Consider that an apology, or any <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> act, {{may be one}} of {{the most}} effective and low cost means to reduce any negative emotions between parties.|$|R
25|$|Nilsson was {{different}} from other baby-farmer child killers of that time, in that she actively killed the children. Most <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> left the children with insufficient food and in unhealthy living conditions, which led to their death.|$|E
25|$|Some Histeridae species {{live in an}} {{integrated}} nest with ants and termites. Some species {{have been found to}} be fed by the ants, while <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> feed on leftover insect larvae that the ants do not want. In contrast, in their adult stage Psiloscelis will actually feed on adult ants.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy's {{comprehensive}} treatise {{of mathematical}} astronomy superseded most older texts of Greek astronomy. Some were more specialized and thus of less interest; <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> became outdated by the newer models. As a result, the older texts {{ceased to be}} copied and were gradually lost. Much {{of what we know}} about the work of astronomers like Hipparchus comes from references in the Syntaxis.|$|E
50|$|The Muddle-Headed Wombat books {{follow the}} Muddle-Headed Wombat and his friends, a good-natured, {{practical}} female mouse and a vain, neurotic male tabby cat. The characters call each <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> Wombat, Mouse and Tabby.|$|R
5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{example is}} the graph isomorphism problem, the graph theory problem of determining whether a graph isomorphism exists between two graphs. Two graphs are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> by renaming vertices. Consider these two problems: ...|$|R
50|$|Many levels offer {{multiple}} {{directions for}} the player. One usually contains extra powerups {{that requires the}} use of boosts and agility to successfully traverse, while the <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> requires jumping obstacles on the ground, often including loose sand and gravel that will slow down the motorcycle.|$|R
25|$|Robert Hope-Jones {{and others}} {{designed}} many {{new kinds of}} pipes {{in an effort to}} create colorful sounds for the theatre organ. Many of these new stops attempted to imitate the sounds of real orchestral instruments, while <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> contributed unique new colors to the tonal palette. Important new stops invented or refined by Hope-Jones included the Tibia Clausa, Tibia Plena, and the Diaphone.|$|E
25|$|In 1864 {{until the}} early 20th century, another mass {{expulsion}} took place of Caucasian Muslims {{as a result of}} the Russian victory in the Caucasian War. <b>Others</b> <b>simply</b> voluntarily refused to live under Christian Russian rule, and thus disembarked for Turkey or Iran. These migrations once again, towards Iran, included masses of Caucasian Azerbaijanis, other Transcaucasian Muslims, as well as many North Caucasian Muslims, such as Circassians, Shia Lezgins and Laks.|$|E
25|$|During the 13th century, many towers {{were taken}} down or demolished, and <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> collapsed. Many towers have {{subsequently}} been utilized {{in one way}} or the other: as prison, city tower, shop or residential building. The last demolitions took place during the 20th century, according to an ambitious, but retrospectively unfortunate, restructuring plan for the city. The Artenisi Tower and the Riccadonna Tower at the Mercato di mezzo were demolished in 1917.|$|E
5000|$|White {{wine was}} {{exported}} to Rome; two dolia discovered in an excavation near Rome are marked, one [...] "I am a wine from Baeterrae and I am five years old", the <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> [...] "white wine of Baeterrae". It {{was occupied by}} the Moors between 720 and 752.|$|R

5000|$|There are 34 topologically {{distinct}} convex heptahedra, excluding mirror images. (Two polyhedra are [...] "topologically distinct" [...] if {{they have}} intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such {{that it is impossible}} to distort one into the <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.) ...|$|R
25|$|Various pathway, bridge, {{pipeline}} {{and other}} infrastructure work is taking place. Projects such as paths and bridges are creating increased access to expanding portions of campus, others are for aesthetic contributions and <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> for repair. In addition, major renovations {{are being made}} to the old Dickinson Community, including transforming space into offices for the Binghamton University Foundation and the Division of Advancement. A new, state-of-the-art Admissions Center opened in 2014 in the former Dickinson Dining Hall.|$|E
25|$|Houses, {{cars and}} {{businesses}} were abandoned by those evacuating. Some locked their front doors, some did not, reasoning {{that someone would}} break the door to get in anyway. Some gave away pets, others just released them, many put them down. Some gave away furniture and belongings, some gave it to someone for safe storage, <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> walked away, leaving dirty {{dishes in the sink}} and food on the table. The withdrawal of cash from banks was limited to £20 per person. People could take just one suitcase.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 {{study in}} Ireland found that dog bite {{injuries}} greatly increased since {{the introduction of}} legislation targeting specific dog breeds. This study also suggested that targeting dog breeds may actually contribute to increases in dog-bite hospitalisations through the reinforcing of incorrect stereotypes of risk being determined by breed. The study reported {{that as a result}} of targeting dog breeds, stereotypes of the dangerousness of certain breeds and assuming the safety of <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> due to their breed may result in people incorrectly interacting with dogs from both categories.|$|E
50|$|Sky Wing II-E is a {{very little}} known {{unmanned}} helicopter developed by Xinying, but subsequently mysteriously disappeared when its information was removed, prompting some Chinese internet sources claiming it might be adopted by Chinese military, while <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> claimed {{that it has been}} superseded by more advanced models of later Sky Wing III/V series.|$|R
50|$|Return of Mr. Superman {{is one of}} two 1960 Indian movies {{based on}} the superhero, the <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> titled Superman. Despite the same actor playing Superman in each film, they were both {{completely}} separate tellings of the Superman saga put out by production companies (Mukul Pictures made Superman while Manmohan Films made Return of Mr. Superman).|$|R
5000|$|There are 1,496,225,352 topologically {{distinct}} convex tetradecahedra, excluding mirror images, {{having at}} least 9 vertices.

25|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of slaves escaped {{during the war and}} joined British lines; <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> moved off in the chaos. For instance, in South Carolina, nearly 25,000 slaves (30% of the enslaved population) fled, migrated or died during the disruption of the war. This greatly disrupted plantation production during and after the war. When they withdrew their forces from Savannah and Charleston, the British also evacuated 10,000 slaves belonging to Loyalists. Altogether, the British evacuated nearly 20,000 blacks {{at the end of the}} war. More than 3,000 of them were freedmen and most of these were resettled in Nova Scotia; other blacks were sold in the West Indies.|$|E
25|$|The {{vulnerability}} of Balaclava {{was well known}} to both sides. Undertaking the siege operations around Sevastopol whilst securing the Allies' eastern flank was stretching the resources of Raglan's dwindling forces – British casualties at the Alma had been high, and many were still suffering from the cholera epidemic; <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> fell sick from exhaustion. With the arrival of further Russian reinforcements, Menshikov's total force in theatre (including 12 Division) numbered around 65,000. The remainder of 4th Corps – 10 and 11 Divisions – were also heading towards the Crimea, but Menshikov, under pressure from Nicholas I to strike back at the Allies, decided not to wait for these troops before beginning the attack.|$|E
25|$|Although most Koreans by {{that time}} had {{surnames}} and even bongwan, {{a substantial number of}} cheonmin, which mostly consisted of serfs and slaves, and untouchables still did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters’ surnames, while <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term Inmin(people) and later, Kungmin(citizen).|$|E
5000|$|Java 1.2 in 1998 {{introduced}} {{two kinds}} of weak references, one known as a “soft reference” (intended {{to be used for}} maintaining GC-managed in-memory caches, but which doesn’t work very well in practice) and the <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> as a “weak reference”. It also added a related experimental mechanism dubbed “phantom references” {{as an alternative to the}} dangerous and inefficient finalize (...) mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|There are 6,384,634 topologically {{distinct}} convex dodecahedra, excluding mirror images—the {{number of}} vertices ranges from 8 to 20.

5000|$|There was no class {{distinction}} in the MPAJA. Each member addressed each <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> as [...] "comrade", including the Chairman of the Central Military Committee. Although the MPAJA was directly {{controlled by the}} MCP leadership, many members were not communists, contrary to popular belief. Many had {{signed up for the}} MPAJA because of their resentment towards the Japanese armys brutal treatment of civilians.|$|R
25|$|In March 1930, a {{discussion}} initiated by pilot G Vlasto {{led to the}} founding of Madras Flying Club, which became a pioneer in South India. The club had 71 founding members, of whom 14 were Indians. Flt Lt H N Hawker became the club's first flight instructor. The club's first Indian chief pilot instructor, Mohammed Ismail Khan, trained several pilots, {{some of whom were}} trained professionally or <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> for fun. When the state council of Ceylon built an aerodrome at Ratnamala near Colombo in 1935, the first flight to land there was flown by chief flying instructor of the club Tyndale Biscoe. On 26 October 1936, Captain V. Sundaram, who got the first commercial pilot licence, flew a De Havilland Dove aircraft from Karachi to Madras.|$|E
25|$|These dogs, or strains {{and crosses}} thereof, {{must be kept}} on a strong, short lead (less than 2 metres / 6'7") by a person over 16 years of age who is capable of {{controlling}} them. The dog/s must be securely muzzled too. A recent study conducted in Ireland found that dog bite injuries significantly increased since the introduction of such legislation, although data from before {{the introduction of the}} ban was not included. The study reported that dog bite hospitalisations may rise as a result of targeting dog breeds due to reinforcing incorrect stereotypes of the dangerousness of certain breeds and assuming the safety of <b>others</b> <b>simply</b> due to their breed may result in people incorrectly interacting with dogs from both categories.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than their}} {{inability}} to hear music, which is most likely due to a genetic defect, the rest of an amusic's brain remains normal. The only effect is {{on the ability to}} tell different notes apart due to the separation of two key areas in the brain. Most sufferers of amusia describe music as unpleasant. <b>Others</b> <b>simply</b> refer to it as noise and find it annoying. This can have social implications because amusics often try to avoid music, which in many social situations is not an option. In China and other countries in which identical words have different meanings based on pitch, amusia may have a much more pronounced social and emotional impact: difficulty in speaking and understanding the language.|$|E
25|$|The Hewitt, Bishop and Steiger {{approach}} concerns {{sequential processing}} and inter-process communication in digital, serial, kinematic computers. It is a parallel or pseudo-concurrent theory {{as is the}} theory of concurrency. See Concurrency. In Pask's true field concurrent theory kinetic processes can interrupt (or, indeed, interact with) each <b>other,</b> <b>simply</b> reproducing or producing a new resultant force within a coherence (of concepts) but without buffering delays or priority.|$|R
60|$|In Chigron's {{establishment}} {{the men of}} {{the three}} trades worked apart and separate from each other; and although Chigron was in fact at the head of all, he personally superintended only the embalming, {{the men of the}} other trades being directed by their own masters, {{and it was as if}} the three establishments had been placed near each <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> for the purpose of convenience.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not as}} {{the land}} of Egypt--a land which was, humanly speaking, sure to be fertile, because always {{supplied}} with water, brought out of the Nile by dykes and channels which spread in a network over every field, and where--as I believe is done now--the labourer turned the water from one land to the <b>other</b> <b>simply</b> by moving the earth with his foot.|$|R
