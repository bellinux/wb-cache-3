In this paper, a sulfided NiMo/gamma-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was treated in a batch reactor under typical hydrotreating conditions with or without water vapor. Changes of the HDO activity, composition, and texture of the various catalyst samples were further evaluated. Catalyst samples used in the HDO of <b>organic</b> <b>oxygenated</b> <b>compounds</b> were also characterized by XPS for modifications of the chemical surface composition. Water caused a decrease of the catalytic activity to one-third {{the activity of the}} fresh catalyst but did not change the hydrogenation-hydrogenolysis selectivity. Water was also the cause of a small loss of the specific surface area conjugated to some crystallization of the gamma-alumina support in a hydrated boehmite phase. On the other hand, the metal content, the dispersion, and the sulfidation state were not specifically affected by water. The deactivation would rather be related to the appearance of oxidized nickel species. The observations can be interpreted as resulting from the formation of an inactive nickel sulfate layer covering the active sulfide phases or from the formation of nickel aluminate. Otherwise, the oxidation of the molybdenum sulfide phase by water or <b>oxygenated</b> <b>compounds</b> in reaction conditions is very limited. (C) 1994 Academic Press. Inc...|$|R

The measurement site was located in a botanic garden close to the small town Wangdu, without major industry but influenced by regional transportation of air pollution. The loss rate coefficient of atmospheric hydroxyl radicals (OH) was quantified by direct measurements of the OH reactivity. Values ranged between 10 and 20  s − 1 {{for most of the}} daytime. Highest values were reached in the late night with maximum values of around 40  s − 1. OH reactants mainly originated from anthropogenic activities as indicated (1)  by a good correlation between measured OH reactivity and carbon monoxide (linear correlation coefficient R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 33) and (2)  by a high contribution of nitrogen oxide species to the OH reactivity (up to 30  % in the morning). Total OH reactivity was measured by a laser flash photolysis–laser-induced fluorescence instrument (LP-LIF). Measured values can be explained well by measured trace gas concentrations including <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> CO and nitrogen oxides. Significant, unexplained OH reactivity was only observed during nights, when biomass burning of agricultural waste occurred on surrounding fields. OH reactivity measurements also allow investigating the chemical OH budget. During this campaign, the OH destruction rate calculated from measured OH reactivity and measured OH concentration was balanced by the sum of OH production from ozone and nitrous acid photolysis and OH regeneration from hydroperoxy radicals within the uncertainty of measurements.

While the rate coefficients for the OH reactions of the relevant oxygenated VOCs are mostly well established, the knowledge of the detailed atmospheric degradation pathways for these compounds is relatively poor. The mechanistic studies are very often confined to the detection of the primary reaction products. Reaction mechanisms, which are derived from these data, are usually not proofed by comparison of the measured product concentrations and the model.

40|$|The surface {{reactivity}} of triphenyl phosphorothionate (TPPT) on air-oxidized iron surfaces {{has been studied}} by in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR/FT-IR) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The ATR/FT-IR spectra indicate that a reaction took place at 423 K on the iron-coated germanium ATR crystal {{with the formation of}} pyrophosphates, organophosphates, and sulfates. The oxidation of the base oil (poly-a-olefin, PAO) during thermal testing, leading to the production of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>compounds</b> that can adsorb onto the iron surface and react with it, resulted in the presence of carbonates and carboxylates in the film. As the heating time increased, the corrosion of the iron coating by the aggressive species formed during the thermooxidative aging of PAO provided the cations necessary for the formation of orthophosphate compounds. The subsequent ex situ XPS analysis, besides substantiating the formation of short-chain polyphosphates, organophosphates, and sulfates on the air-oxidized iron surface, indicates the presence of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in the outermost part of the reaction layer. Modeling the ATR/FT-IR system allowed the correlation of the changes observed in the experimental ATR/FT-IR spectra with the reflectivity alterations caused by the formation of reaction products on the iron-coated germanium ATR crystal.

40|$|International audienceThe {{distribution}} and budget of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> {{in the atmosphere}} {{and their impact on}} tropospheric chemistry are still poorly constrained. Near-global space-borne measurements of seasonally resolved upper tropospheric profiles of methanol (CH 3 OH) by the ACE Fourier transform spectrometer provide a unique opportunity to evaluate our understanding of this important <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> species. ACE-FTS observations from March 2004 to August 2005 period are presented. These observations reveal the pervasive imprint of surface sources on upper tropospheric methanol: mixing ratios observed in the mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere reflect the seasonal cycle of the biogenic emissions whereas the methanol cycle observed in the southern tropics is highly influenced by biomass burning emissions. The comparison with distributions simulated by the state-of-the-art global chemistry transport model, LMDz-INCA, suggests that: (i) the background methanol (high southern latitudes) is correctly represented by the model considering the measurement uncertainties; (ii) the current emissions from the continental biosphere are underestimated during spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere leading to an underestimation of modelled upper tropospheric methanol; (iii) the seasonal variation of upper tropospheric methanol is shifted to the fall in the model suggesting either an insufficient destruction of CH 3 OH (due to too weak chemistry and/or deposition) in fall and winter months or an unfaithful representation of transport; (iv) the impact of tropical biomass burning emissions on upper tropospheric methanol is rather well reproduced by the model.

Bio-oil, along with several <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> contains substantial amounts of carboxylic acids (e. g., acetic acid, 5 - 10 %). The presence of acids results in a shorter shelf life of bio-oil, as it catalyzes condensation reactions of furfural-like components leading {{to an increase in}} viscosity over a time period. Thus, we investigate the ability of multifunctional reactor for stabilization of bio-oil through esterification of acid with suitable alcohol in the presence of ion-exchange resin catalyst. Reactive distillation is performed at higher a temperature which is dictated by the bubble point of the mixture, reactive chromatography allows one to perform reaction at relatively low temperatures and with lower alcohols. It results in an improvement in the characteristic properties of bio-oil, thereby increasing the shelf life. The main limitation of this approach is that the catalyst used for esterification also catalyzes simultaneous polymerization of furfural-like components which deactivate the catalyst.

The substrates explored did not contribute significant background interference to complicate the identification of the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>compounds.</b> In addition, small volumes of the oxygenated ignitable liquids were easily recovered and identified from all burn states using the zeolite method. A dual-mode extraction with both zeolites and activated charcoal strips as adsorbents was utilized with mixtures of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>compounds</b> and petroleum products to determine if a variety of ignitable liquid classes could be detected and identified in the presence of a variety of substrate matrices within a single extraction protocol. The dual-mode extraction showed that both the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>compounds</b> and petroleum products could be detected and identified using a single extraction protocol in the presence of various substrate matrices.

The characteristic temperatures are determined for the main devolatilization steps and compared for all fuels. A bituminous coal and a paper sludge are also studied for comparison.

40|$|In {{the present}} study is {{investigated}} the process of steam reforming reaction of biofuels, such as bio-oil and bio-ethanol, for the production of a gas stream rich to hydrogen, in order to feed fuel cells. Hydrogen, in combination with fuel cells, is being considered as an environmentally friendly source of energy for automotive as well as stationary applications. Hydrogen has the significant advantage of producing no air or other pollutants in its transformation to energy, while fuel cells, which operate primarily on hydrogen, offer enhanced efficiency in power generation. However, real environmental benefits are linked to the ability to produce hydrogen from renewable sources with no net production of greenhouse gasses. A viable renewable source, gaining attention in recent years, is bio-fuels. Bio-oil and bio-ethanol are bio-fuels because they are originated from biomass treatment, and, in particular, via the fast pyrolysis and the fermentation of biomass, respectively. Their steam reforming reaction is entirely feasible from the thermodynamic point of view, while the efficiency of such process in hydrogen production is significantly high. Thermodynamically the reaction of steam reforming is favored at high temperatures and low pressures. Due to the complexity of bio-oil, which is consisted of hundreds of <b>organics</b> <b>oxygenates,</b> model <b>compounds</b> representatives of bio-oil, are initially used. Acetic acid was chosen as a model compound, because it is present in significant amounts in bio-oil (~ 10 %). A variety of supported metal catalysts were tested under conditions of steam reforming of acetic acid. The influence of several parameters on catalytic activity and selectivity were examined, including catalyst composition, i. e. nature of the metal and the carrier, reaction temperature and time on stream. The metallic phase of such catalysts was comprised of various metals, such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru and Ni, which were supported on metal oxides carriers, such as Al 2 O 3, La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3, MgO/Al 2 O 3 and CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3. It was found that Ni-based and Ru-based catalysts present high activity and selectivity toward hydrogen production. Ru catalysts supported on La 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 and MgO/Al 2 O 3 carriers, showed good long term stability as a function of time on stream. However, Ni catalysts were not as stable as Ru catalysts. The amount of carbon deposited on each catalyst was estimated, and it was found that it depends strongly {{on the nature of the}} catalyst. ...|$|R

In this study, we applied direct infusion nanoelectrospray (nanoESI) ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (UHR-MS) and liquid chromatography LC/ESI-UHR-MS {{for the analysis}} of the organic fraction of PM 1 aerosol samples Collected over a two week period at a boreal forest site (Hyytiala), southern Finland. Elemental formulas (460 - 730 in total), were identified With nanoESI-UHR-MS in the negative ionization mode and attributed to organic compounds with a molecular weight below 400. Kendrick Mass Defect, and Van Krevelen approaches were used to identify compound classes and mass distributions of the detected species. The molecular composition of the aerosols strongly varied between samples with different air mass histories. An increased number of nitrogen, sulfur, and highly <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> was observed during the days associated with continental air masses. However, the samples with Atlantic air mass history were marked by a presence of homologous series of unsaturated and saturated C- 12 -C- 20 fatty acids suggesting their marine origin. To our knowledge, we show {{for the first time that}} the highly detailed chemical composition obtained from UHR-MS analyses can be clearly linked to meteorological parameters and trace gases concentrations that are relevant to atmospheric oxidation processes. The additional LC/ESI-UHR-MS analysis revealed 29 species, which were mainly attributed to oxidation products of biogenic volatile compounds BVOCs (i. e., alpha,beta-pinene, Delta(3) -carene, limonene, and isoprene) supporting the results from the direct infusion analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) {{number and the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of the atmospheric aerosol distribution is explored for a polluted urban data set from the Study of Organic Aerosols at Riverside I (SOAR- 1) campaign conducted at Riverside, California, USA during summer 2005. The mixing state and, to a lesser degree, the average chemical composition are shown to be important parameters in determining the activation properties of those particles around the critical activation diameters for atmospherically-realistic supersaturation values. Closure between predictions and measurements of CCN number at several supersaturations is attempted by modeling a number of aerosol chemical composition and mixing state cases of increasing complexity. It is shown that a realistic treatment of the state of mixing of the urban aerosol distribution is critical in order to eliminate model bias. Fresh emissions such as elemental carbon and small organic particles must be treated as non-activating and explicitly accounted for in the model. The relative number concentration of these particles compared to inorganics and <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> of limited hygroscopicity {{plays an important role in}} determining the CCN number. Furthermore, expanding the different composition/mixing state cases to predictions of cloud droplet number concentration in a cloud parcel model highlights the dependence of cloud optical properties on the state of mixing and hygroscopic properties of the different aerosol modes, but shows that the relative differences between the different cases are reduced compared to those from the CCN model...|$|R
40|$|Production {{of direct}} reduced iron (DRI) was {{performed}} by a novel and environmentally friendly approach through a systematic experimental process development and process integration study on bio-oil reforming and iron ores reduction. The Ni-Cu-Zn-Al₂O₃ catalyst is one of most suitable candidates for bio-oil reforming because this non-noble metal catalyst can efficiently reform the bio-oil to H₂ and CO₂ at a lower operating temperature (450 - 500 °C) with a longer lifetime. The catalytic activities of the Ni-Cu-Zn-Al₂O₃ catalyst for different processes, including the reforming of the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in the bio-oil, the water-gas shift reaction and the decomposition of organic compounds, have been investigated. A hydrogen yield of 87. 4 % with a carbon conversion of 91. 8 % was obtained at T = 500 °C and S/C = 6. 1. The hydrogen content reached about 94. 6 vol% after simple purification by removing CO₂. Furthermore, direct reduction of iron oxides at different reduction temperatures was investigated using on-line rich-hydrogen reducing gases. The metallization for production of DRI from three ore powders (limonite, hematite and magnetite) and hematite pellets ranges from 93 to 97 % at 850 °C for 1 h reduction. The reduction process from the oxidized iron to metallic iron and the intermediate phases were investigated via chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence analyses. The green DRI process with high reduction efficiency and real environmental benefits would, potentially, be a useful route to produce DRI from bio-oil or biomass. 12 page(s...|$|R

In the present work, the oil was isolated by steam distillation and organic solvent extraction from dry mature flowers of Cananga odorata Hook. fil. et Thomson, forma macrophylla. Chloroform and hexane were used as solvents with different polarities. The yield of volatile oil and its grouped compounds (LOC, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and HOC) was investigated {{as a function of}} time. LOC consists of oxygenated monoterpenes and other light <b>oxygenated</b> <b>compounds</b> whereas HOC comprises oxygenated sesquiterpenes and other heavy <b>oxygenated</b> <b>compounds.</b> The oil yields of 5. 1, 3. 8 and 2. 5 % dry matter were obtained with chloroform (8 h), hexane (8 h) and steam distillation (16 h), respectively. The isolation rate was described by a first-order kinetics equation. The rate was lowest with steam distillation, intermediate with hexane extraction and best with chloroform extraction. The oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The steam-distilled oil and chloroform oil had a similar composition, with a high content of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>compounds</b> (61. 7 % and 58. 3 %), while hexane oil was rich in sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons (66. 5 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, there has been {{increasing}} awareness regarding {{the potential impact of}} indoor air pollution on health. Exposure to volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> (VOCs) or <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> formed from indoor chemistry has been suggested to contribute to adverse health effects. These studies use an in vitro monitoring system called VitroCell, to assess chemicals found in the indoor air environment. The structurally similar dicarbonyls diacetyl, 4 -oxopentanal (4 -OPA), glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, and methyl glyoxal were selected for use in this system. The VitroCell module was used to determine whether these dicarbonyls were capable of inducing inflammatory cytokine expression by exposed pulmonary epithelial cells (A 549). Increases in the relative fold change in messenger RNA expression of the inflammatory mediators, interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were identified following exposure to diacetyl, 4 -OPA, glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, and methyl glyoxal when compared to a clean air control. Consistent results were observed when the protein levels of these cytokines were analyzed. Exposure to 4 -OPA significantly elevated IL- 8, IL- 6, GM-CSF, and TNF-α while glutaraldehyde caused significant elevations in IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-α. IL- 6 and IL- 8 were also significantly elevated after exposure to diacetyl, glyoxal, and methyl glyoxal. These studies suggest that exposure to structurally similar oxygenated reaction products may be contributing to some of the health effects associated with indoor environments and may provide an in vitro method for identification and characterization of these potential hazards...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{power systems}} based on {{integrated}} gasification/combined cycles (IGCC) are often {{presented as a}} solution to the present shortcomings of biomass as fuel. Although IGCC has been technically demonstrated at full scale, it has not been adopted for commercial power generation. Part of the reason for this situation is the continuing low price for coal. However, another significant barrier to IGCC is the high level of integration of this technology: the gas output from the gasifier must be perfectly matched to the energy demand of the gas turbine cycle. We are developing an alternative to IGCC for biomass power: the integrated (fast) pyrolysis/ combined cycle (IPCC). In this system solid biomass is converted into liquid rather than gaseous fuel. This liquid fuel, called bio-oil, is a mixture of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> and water that serves as fuel for a gas turbine topping cycle. Waste heat from the gas turbine provides thermal energy to the steam turbine bottoming cycle. Advantages of the biomass-fueled IPCC system include: combined cycle efficiency exceeding 37 percent efficiency for a system as small as 7. 6 MW{sub e}; absence of high pressure thermal reactors; decoupling of fuel processing and power generation; and opportunities for recovering value-added products from the bio-oil. This report provides a technical overview of the system including pyrolyzer design, fuel clean-up strategies, pyrolysate condenser design, opportunities for recovering pyrolysis byproducts, gas turbine cycle design, and Rankine steam cycle. The report also reviews the potential biomass fuel supply in Iowa, provide and economic analysis, and present a summery of benefits from the proposed system...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{sampling}} {{for major}} <b>oxygenated</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> (dicarboxylic acids, fatty acids, and levoglucosan) was conducted from 15 March to 19 April 2001 {{on board the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration R/V Ronald H. Brown over the western North Pacific, the East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan, {{as part of the}} Asian Pacific Regional Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-Asia) campaign. During the cruise, aerosol particles were collected on quartz fiber filters using a high-volume air sampler. Diacids were also collected using an annular denuder sampling system to assess their gas-particle partitioning. Concentrations of total diacids, total fatty acids, and levoglucosan were found to be higher off the coasts of East Asia than in the remote Pacific. Contributions of these organic compounds to total organic carbon and total organic matter (OM) were calculated to be 9. 8 ± 2. 3 % and 19. 0 ± 4. 8 %, respectively, assuming OM to be organic carbon x 1. 6. Diacid concentrations were highly correlated with nss-SO 2 -/ 4 and NO- 3, which originate from anthropogenic sources over East Asia. The temporal variations and chain-length distributions of fatty acids suggest that atmospheric transport of terrestrial organic materials is important off the coast of the continent. C 2 – C 5 diacids were present predominantly in the particulate phase. The relative abundances of C 2 – C 5 diacids stayed almost unchanged throughout the cruise, suggesting that deposition is more important than chemical decomposition as a sink of diacids and that they are relatively stable end products in the atmosphere...|$|R
