It is known that, in general, neither B(G) nor T(G) determines the finite group G. That is, {{one can easily}} {{construct}} pairs of non-isomorphic finite groups such that their table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> is the same (hence, their Burnside rings are isomorphic). In this note, we show that the composition factors of G {{are determined by the}} table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> T(G) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{computing}} the table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> a direct product of finite groups. In contrast to the character table of a direct product of two finite groups, its table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> is not simply the Kronecker product of the tables <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> the two groups. Based on a decomposition of the inclusion order on the subgroup lattice of a direct product as a relation product of three smaller partial orders, we describe the table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> the direct product essentially as a matrix product of three class incidence matrices. Each of these matrices is in turn described as a sparse block diagonal matrix. As an application, we use a variant of this matrix product to construct a ghost ring and a mark homomorphism for the rational double Burnside algebra of the symmetric group S_ 3...|$|R
50|$|Mark and {{recapture}} is {{a method}} commonly used in ecology to estimate an animal population's size. A {{portion of the population}} is captured, marked, and released. Later, another portion is captured and the number <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> individuals within the sample is counted. Since the number <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> individuals within the second sample should be proportional to the number <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> individuals in the whole population, an estimate of the total population size can be obtained by dividing the number <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> individuals by the proportion <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> individuals in the second sample. The method is most useful when it is not practical to count all the individuals in the population. Other names for this method, or closely related methods, include capture-recapture, capture-mark-recapture, mark-recapture, sight-resight, mark-release-recapture, multiple systems estimation, band recovery, the Petersen method, and the Lincoln method.|$|R

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel <b>of</b> <b>Mark,</b> the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E

40|$|The table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} by William Burnside in his book "Theory of groups of finite order" in 1955. The table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> counts the number of fixed points one subgroup has in {{the action of the}} cosets of another. In doing this it also encodes a lot of useful information about the subgroup lattice of a group G, including the index of each of G 2 ̆ 7 s subgroups in both G and their normalizers, containments and what cyclic subgroups G has. Despite their usefulness they are extremely expensive to compute (the GAP table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> library extends only as far as the symmetric group on 13 letters). Thus one purpose of present research is find an efficient way to compute the table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> a direct product of finite group. This is more difficult than one might expect. We consider a direct product of two finite groups GxH, using Goursat 2 ̆ 7 s lemma we hope to use knowledge of the table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> G and H to compute the table <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> GxH.
