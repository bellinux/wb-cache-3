50|$|After {{the success}} of the festival in Brooklyn, the festival {{returned}} to Gowanus in 2013, taking over a 25,000 ft warehouse, which gave over about 15,000 sf to installation work, and 3600 sf screening room. The festival's visual theme was body parts, and a giant inflatable lung, which breathed slightly, greeted festival-goers as they entered. There were <b>other</b> <b>inflatables,</b> including Rachel Shannon's Breastival Vestibules, and other plastics that resembled veins. Jonathan Caouette returned to the festival with a new film that he finished hours before the screening at MIX NYC.|$|R

The inflatables were initially started as a humorous laugh by numerous City fans after a City player Imre Varadi was nicknamed banana hence the <b>inflatable</b> bananas. <b>Other</b> <b>inflatables</b> soon followed aimed at putting goodwill back into football during the dark days of English football hooliganism and stadium riots and the craze soon caught on with other clubs following suit and even dressing up the inflatable bananas.|$|R
50|$|The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome {{was unusual}} {{as one of}} the few air-supported dome stadiums that was {{multipurpose}} in practice, being convertible between football and baseball. Home of the Minnesota Vikings through the 2013 season, it was also home to the Minnesota Twins until 2009 and the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team (NCAA) until 2008. The Carrier Dome was another such air-supported, multipurpose stadium, although it was built to accommodate outdoor sports such as football and indoor sports such as basketball. The Carrier Dome remains in use. The Metrodome has been demolished, with U.S. Bank Stadium, built mainly for professional football but able to convert to a college baseball stadium, now sitting on its former site.

40|$|Special-purpose {{balloons}} and <b>other</b> <b>inflatable</b> structures would be constructed as flexible laminates of multiple thin polymeric films interspersed {{with layers of}} adhesive, according to a proposal. In the original intended application, the laminate would serve as the envelope of the Titan Aerobot a proposed robotic airship for exploring Titan (one of the moons of Saturn). Potential terrestrial applications for such flexible laminates could include blimps and sails. In the original application, the multi-layered laminate would contain six layers of 0. 14 -mil (0. 0036 -mm) -thick Mylar (or equivalent) polyethylene terephthalate film {{with a layer of}} adhesive between each layer of Mylar. The overall thickness and areal density of this laminate would be nearly the same as those of 1 -mil (0. 0254 -mm) -thick monolayer polyethylene terephthalate sheet. However, the laminate would offer several advantages over the monolayer sheet, especially with respect to interrelated considerations of flexing properties, formation of pinholes, and difficulty or ease of handling, as discussed next. Most of the damage during flexing of the laminate would be localized in the outermost layers, where the radii of bending in a given bend would be the largest and, hence, the bending stress would be the greatest. The adverse effects of formation of pinholes would be nearly completely mitigated in the laminate because a pinhole in a given layer would not propagate to adjacent layers. Hence, the laminate would tend to remain effective as a barrier to retain gas. Similar arguments can be made regarding cracks: While a crack could form as a result of stress or a defect in the film material, a crack would not propagate into adjacent layers, and the adjacent layer(s) would even arrest propagation of the crack. In the case of the monolayer sheet, surface damage (scratches, dents, permanent folds, pinholes, and the like) caused by handling would constitute or give rise to defects that could propagate through the thickness as cracks or pinholes that would render the sheet less effective or ineffective as a barrier. In contrast, because damage incurred during handling of the laminate would ordinarily be limited to the outermost layers, the barrier properties of the laminate {{would be less likely to}} be adversely affected. Therefore, handling of the laminate would be easier because there would be less of a need to exercise care to ensure against surface damage...|$|R
40|$|The {{writer is}} {{encouraged}} {{that more and}} more inflatable dams are being built in the world for a wider variety of purposes. Both Vietnam and Bangladesh recently saw their first inflatable dams. In addition, higher dams are also possible. The writer wishes to point out that apart from the dam 2 ̆ 7 s capability for flood mitigation there are <b>other</b> notable advantages. <b>Inflatable</b> dams may be installed in extremely cold climates. Steel gates may be "frozen" (gate jamming) under such temperatures, whereas inflatable dams are still operable. Another problem associated with "frozen" steel gates is the flooding upstream caused by ice formation at the steel gates.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the current technology available {{to design and}} develop a reliable and compact instrumentation platform for parachute system data collection and command actuation.

This will allow for more robust designs which are more optimally designed in terms of structural loading, less susceptible to adverse dynamics, and may eventually pave the way to currently unattainable advanced concepts of operations.

40|$|Current entry, descent, {{and landing}} {{technologies}} are not practical for heavy payloads due to mass and volume constraints dictated by limitations imposed by launch vehicle fairings. Therefore, new technologies {{are now being}} explored to provide a mass- and volume-efficient solution for heavy payload capabilities, including Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (IAD) [1]. Consideration of IADs for space applications has prompted the development of instrumentation systems for integration with flexible structures to characterize system response to flight-like environment testing. This development opportunity faces many challenges specific to inflatable structures in extreme environments, including {{but not limited to}} physical flexibility, packaging, temperature, structural integration and data acquisition [2]. In the spring of 2012, two large scale Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIAD) will be tested in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex s 40 by 80 wind tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center. The test series will characterize the performance of a 3. 0 m and 6. 0 m HIAD at various angles of attack and levels of inflation during flight-like loading. To analyze the performance of these <b>inflatable</b> test <b>articles</b> as they undergo aerodynamic loading, many instrumentation systems have been researched and developed. These systems will utilize new experimental sensing systems developed by the HIAD ground test campaign instrumentation team, in addition to traditional wind tunnel sensing techniques in an effort to improve test article characterization and model validation. During the 2012 test series the instrumentation systems will target inflatable aeroshell static and dynamic deformation, structural strap loading, surface pressure distribution, localized skin deflection, and torus inflation pressure. This paper will offer an overview of inflatable structure instrumentation, and provide detail into the design and implementation of the sensors systems that will be utilized during the 2012 HIAD ground test campaign...|$|R

50|$|The {{mathematician}} Archimedes discovered much of how buoyancy works {{more than}} 2000 years ago. In his research, Archimedes discovered that an object is buoyed up by a force {{equal to the}} weight of the water displaced by the object. In <b>other</b> words, an <b>inflatable</b> boat that displaces 100 pounds (45 kilograms) of water is buoyed up by that same weight of support. An object that floats in the water is known as being positively buoyant. An object that sinks to the bottom is negatively buoyant, while an object that hovers at the same level in the water is neutrally buoyant. Scientists later discovered ways to manipulate buoyancy and developed equipment such as the life jacket, which is filled with compressed air and helps to lower a person's average density, assisting in floating and swimming, as well as certain diving equipment (including submarines and submersibles) which have air chambers similar to swim bladders to regulate depth.|$|R
