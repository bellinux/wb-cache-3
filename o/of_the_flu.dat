5|$|Between April 1918 and May 1919, the Spanish Flu killed {{approximately}} 25 {{million people}} worldwide, {{far more than}} {{had been killed in}} four years of war. A rigorous quarantine policy was implemented in Australia; although this reduced the immediate impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu,</b> the nation's death toll surpassed 11,500.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, {{research}} by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin linked {{the presence of}} three specific genes (termed PA, PB1, and PB2) and a nucleoprotein derived from 1918 flu samples to the ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu</b> virus to invade the lungs and cause pneumonia. The combination triggered similar symptoms in animal testing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Jakarta, an {{epidemic}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu</b> is underway. Among those who fall ill is President Sukarno, who writes to Chairman Mao Zedong to request some doctors. Mao sends doctors, who give Sukarno poison to paralyze him and aid the 30 September Movement in overthrowing the government. The slow acting poison causes Sukarno to faint {{after he and}} his ministers have a large party with haraam events, including the consumption of pork and frog and zina (sex outside of marriage).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} 5 -year-old {{boy who had}} <b>the</b> {{complaint}} <b>of</b> swelling and pain on the right vaccine shot and right axillary areas. The right axillary area was diagnosed as reactive lymphadenitis, which we believe is a rare local side effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swine <b>flu</b> vaccine. <b>The</b> key message {{to take away from}} this case is that the patient had lymphadenitis as a local side effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swine <b>flu</b> vaccine.

5|$|Before the 2001–02 season began, Salo {{injured his}} groin in an {{exhibition}} game against the Toronto Maple Leafs in September. In addition to missing the first three games of the season, he was later sidelined {{for a total of}} 13 more contests due to separate cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu,</b> a broken finger and back spasms. He recorded 18 points in 66 games. In the proceeding off-season, Salo underwent shoulder surgery. Becoming a free agent, he accepted an $880,000 qualifying offer from the Senators on 31 July 2002.

5|$|In the off-season, Cloutier was re-signed to a one-year, $2.5 million {{contract}} on July 15, 2003. Nearly two {{months into the}} subsequent season, Cloutier recorded his 100th career NHL win, making 31 saves in a 3–1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on November 27, 2003. As the season progressed, Cloutier suffered several more injuries, {{the first of which}} was a groin injury in December 2003 that sidelined him for three games. He missed three more games before the season ended with cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu</b> and a lower-body injury. On February 14, 2004, he was fined $1,000 by the league for hitting opposing forward Ronald Petrovický in the face with his blocker during a game against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September 2008, {{the body}} of British {{politician}} and diplomat Sir Mark Sykes was exhumed to study the RNA <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu</b> virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern H5N1 bird flu. Sykes had been buried in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped had helped preserve the virus. However, the coffin {{was found to be}} split because of the weight of soil over it, and the cadaver was badly decomposed. Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split, with the coffin remaining in situ in the grave during this process.|$|E

25|$|The ministry's Contingency Office deputy director, Liang Wannian, {{said the}} optimum {{objective}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu</b> vaccine {{was for the}} protection of high-risk population, especially people with basic illness and pregnant women. The first batch of China's A (H1N1) flu vaccine is expected to be ready by July, and would undergo a two-month clinical test before it is available in the market. China's flu vaccine strategy is to stockpile enough vaccine for one per cent of her population by 1 October, as a preventive measure to encounter any vast outbreak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu.</b> Liang said China would take more severe and effective preventive measures at its many gateways and educate the people on the H1N1, also known as swine flu.|$|E

25|$|The phylogenetic origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu</b> {{virus that}} caused the 2009 pandemics can be traced before 1918. Around 1918, the ancestral virus, of avian origin, crossed the species {{boundaries}} and infected humans as human H1N1. The same phenomenon took place soon after in America, where the human virus was infecting pigs; {{it led to the}} emergence of the H1N1 swine strain, which later became the classic swine flu.|$|E
25|$|During a {{suspected}} shortage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu</b> vaccine in 2004, Blagojevich ordered 260,000 doses from overseas distributors, which the Food and Drug Administration had warned would {{be barred from}} entering the United States. Although the vaccine doses had cost the state $2.6 million, the FDA refused to allow them into the country, and a buyer could not be found; they were donated to earthquake survivors in Pakistan a year later. However, the lots had expired, and Pakistan destroyed the vaccines.|$|E

25|$|On 20 May {{the first}} case of the {{influenza}} was confirmed in Taiwan. The government had previously taken steps to prevent an outbreak, including a command center, travel alerts for infected nations, and more severe health checks at international ports. Taiwan said visitors who arrived from affected areas with fevers would be quarantined. According to The Department of Health (DOH), Taiwan had a sufficient supply of surgical masks and vaccine {{to deal with the}} flu. The DOH stated that they had 50 to 60 million masks in stock and that local manufacturers had the capability of producing 200,000 doses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flu</b> vaccine a month. The Centers for Disease Control announced on 28 April that every flight from the Americas, specifically Canada and the United States, that arrived in Taiwan would be subject to a strict on-board screening procedure.|$|E
