5000|$|The <b>Arctic</b> policy <b>of</b> Russia is the {{domestic}} and foreign policy of the Russian Federation with respect to the Russian region <b>of</b> the <b>Arctic.</b> The Russian region <b>of</b> the <b>Arctic</b> is defined in the [...] "Russian Arctic Policy" [...] as all Russian possessions located north <b>of</b> the <b>Arctic</b> Circle. (About one-fifth of Russia's landmass is north <b>of</b> the <b>Arctic</b> Circle.) Russia is one of five countries bordering the Arctic Ocean. In 2011, out of 4 million inhabitants <b>of</b> the <b>Arctic,</b> roughly 2 million lived in arctic Russia, making it the largest arctic country by population. However, in recent years Russia's Arctic population has been declining.|$|R
5|$|The {{ability of}} animals {{including}} fish, lizards and frogs {{to change their}} colours quickly is discussed.

5|$|Throughout the {{expedition}} Nansen continued {{to experiment with}} equipment and techniques, altering the designs of skis and sledges and investigating types of clothing, tents and cooking apparatus, thereby revolutionising methods <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> travel. In the era of polar exploration which followed his return, explorers routinely sought Nansen's advice as to methods and equipment—although sometimes they chose not to follow it, usually to their cost. According to Huntford, the South Pole heroes Amundsen, Scott, and Ernest Shackleton were all Nansen's acolytes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E
50|$|A {{large amount}} {{of the land in}} the north polar region is part of Earth's tundra biome.

5|$|Bruce's {{collection}} of specimens, gathered {{from more than}} a decade <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> and Antarctic travel, required a permanent home. Bruce himself needed a base from which the detailed scientific reports of the Scotia voyage could be prepared for publication. He obtained premises in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh, in which he established a laboratory and museum, naming it the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, with the ultimate ambition that it should become the Scottish National Oceanographic Institute. It was officially opened by Prince Albert of Monaco in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria's {{biodiversity}} is conserved {{in three}} national parks, 11 nature parks and 16 biosphere reserves. Nearly 35 per cent of its land area consists of forests, {{where some of}} the oldest trees in the world, such as Baikushev's pine and the Granit oak, grow. Most of the plant and animal life is central European, although representatives <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> and alpine species are present at high altitudes. Its flora encompass more than 3,800 species of which 170 are endemic and 150 are considered endangered. A checklist of larger fungi of Bulgaria reported that more than 1,500 species occur in the country. Animal species include owls, rock partridges, wallcreepers and brown bears. The Eurasian lynx and the eastern imperial eagle have small, but growing populations.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} year, Sisimiut {{is served}} twice-weekly by coastal ferries <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> Umiaq Line which link the {{communities}} of the western coast. There is also a weekly Royal Arctic Line ferry to Itilleq and Sarfannguit. The port in Sisimiut is the northernmost year-round ice-free port in Greenland, serving as the country's primary maritime base north of Nuuk. Supply ships from the port head north, serving the entire coast, from the Uummannaq Fjord region, through Upernavik Archipelago, to Qaanaaq in the far north. M/S Akamalik, {{one of the largest}} ships in the fleet of Royal Greenland, is based in Sisimiut. Home to the first shipyard of Greenland dating from 1931, the port also handles more than 50 cruise liners per year. The local kayak club operates at the bay harbor east of the port.|$|E

5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E
5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E
5|$|From time to time, BBRC has re-reviewed {{records that}} it {{previously}} accepted, {{to ensure they}} are acceptable {{in the light of}} improved knowledge of the species in question. These reviews are carried out on a species-by-species basis. Old World warblers have proved particularly in need of re-review. A review of greenish warbler records was initiated in 1983. The purpose of this review was to establish whether records, particular those in late autumn and winter, of drab grey Phylloscopus warblers, which had previously been accepted as greenish warbler, were in fact this species, or were common chiffchaffs of the Siberian race tristis. 48 records between 1958 and 1970 were examined. Of these, 20 were rejected. A review <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> warbler records was begun in 1991, with the aim of determining whether any greenish warblers had been mistakenly accepted as Arctics. The review was completed in 1994, although as of 2009, the results had not been published.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after Operation Mascot, Tirpitz {{continued}} to prepare for potential combat operations. Following trials in the sheltered waters of Altafjord, she put to sea on 31 July and 1 August to train with her protective destroyers. Additional smoke generators were also installed around Kaafjord to improve the area's already strong defences. These activities were reported by spies, and the British Admiralty interpreted them to mean that Tirpitz was being readied for a raid against Allied shipping. To defend against this threat, {{it was decided to}} conduct further attacks against the battleship at her anchorage in Kaafjord {{at the time of the}} next series <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> convoys. In reality, the German Navy was not planning to use Tirpitz offensively as she would be very vulnerable to the superior Allied naval and air forces if she put to sea. Instead, the battleship was being maintained in active service to tie down Allied warships and aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays, large {{quantities}} of goods are transported by sea, especially across the Atlantic and around the Pacific Rim. A major trade route passes through the Pillars of Hercules, across the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean and through the Straits of Malacca; much trade also passes through the English Channel. Shipping lanes are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of trade winds and currents. Over 60 percent of the world's container traffic is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. Increased melting <b>of</b> <b>Arctic</b> ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the Northwest Passage for some weeks in summer, avoiding the longer routes via the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. Shipping is supplemented by air freight, a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes. Seaborne trade carries more than US $4 trillion worth of goods each year.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{efforts were}} {{launched}} from St John's {{in the hope}} of finding more survivors. An English schooner, John Clements, spent a week searching, before returning with Arctics flagstaff but no personnel. The New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, owners of the steamer Victoria, offered their vessel to the US consul for a fee of $500 a day, an action which led to considerable local press criticism. By contrast, the Bishop of Newfoundland, the Right Revd Edward Feild, provided his private yacht Hawk free of charge. Eventually Victoria agreed to assist without payment, although an unnamed correspondent of the Public Ledger doubted whether the ship made more than a perfunctory search. None of the ships other than John Clements found any definite traces <b>of</b> <b>Arctic.</b> Some reported that they had sighted debris, but were not able to identify or recover it.|$|E
