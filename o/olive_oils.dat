25|$|Citrus fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, olive oil, and wine—Spain's {{traditional}} agricultural products—continued to {{be important}} in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and dairy products. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did sunflower seed oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the European Community.|$|E

A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company.

Animals fed oil from sardines fried in <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> displayed higher (days 5 - 12) or similar (days 21 - 28) apparent zinc absorption and retention values than rats fed 8 % <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and fresh sardine oil.
