[...] "You wouldn't really {{call it an}} action film," [...] claims Pegg, [...] "because it was pre- the evolution {{of that kind of}} film. And yet it is kind of an action film in a way." [...] "It's very much his [...] kind of urban western", adds Wright, [...] "in the way it is staging Rio Bravo set up in downtown 70s LA... And the <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> for a low-budget film particularly, it looks great." [...] In October 2011, artist Tyler Stout premiered his mondo-style poster of Assault.

2500|$|In September 2007, while {{speaking}} about issuing a draft, McCain said, [...] "One, it's the best military we've ever had, it just isn't big enough. Two, there's {{never been a}} draft that I've ever heard of since World War II that was fair. What we've done is we find rich people find a way out, and lower income people {{are the ones that}} serve. I might consider it, I don't think it's necessary, but I might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve. But it just doesn't happen. And the <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that, because you know from here in Brauman, it takes intensive training with the equipment and the technical skills that now our people are required to engage in, that it makes it not conducive to a short term. Now they enlist for 4 years. We used to draft people almost for 2 years or even 18 months so it's much more difficult." ...|$|E

"That {{ought to}} come off all right," [...] {{reflected}} Hadden {{to himself as he}} plunged and floated in the waters of the stream, [...] "but somehow I don't quite trust our friend Maputa.

But then that would be murder and murder is unpleasant; whereas the <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> only the delivery to justice of two base deserters, a laudable action in a military country. Also personal interference upon my part might turn the girl against me; while after Umgona and Nahoon have been wiped out by Maputa, she must accept my escort. Of course there is a risk, but in every walk of life the most cautious have to take risks at times." ...|$|E

Perhaps endure in patience till the dust laid itself again, as all dust does if you leave it well alone? Much obscuration would thus {{of its own accord}} fall away; and, in Mr. Hare's narrative itself, apart from his commentary, many features of Sterling's true character would become decipherable to such as sought them. Censure, blame of this Work of Mr. Hare's was naturally far from my thoughts. A work which distinguishes itself by human piety and candid intelligence; which, in all details, is careful, lucid, exact; and which offers, as we say, to the observant reader that will interpret facts, many traits of Sterling besides his heterodoxy. Censure of it, from me especially, is not the thing due; from me a far <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> due!-- ...|$|E

Its own life being all a matter of pose and gesture, it is unable to realize the power and the danger of a real movement and of words that have no sham meaning. It is all fun and sentiment. It is sufficient, for instance, to point out the attitude of the old French aristocracy towards the philosophers whose words were preparing the Great Revolution. Even in England, where you have some common-sense, a demagogue has only to shout loud enough and long enough to find some backing in the very class he is shouting at. You, too, like to see mischief being made. The demagogue carries the amateurs of emotion with him. Amateurism in this, that, and the <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a delightfully easy way of killing time, and feeding one's own vanity--the silly vanity of being abreast with the ideas of the day after to-morrow. Just as good and otherwise harmless people will join you in ecstasies over your collection without having the slightest notion in what its marvellousness really consists." ...|$|E
