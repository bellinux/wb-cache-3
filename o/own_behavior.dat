5|$|Controlling the Group helps {{individuals}} {{to learn how}} their behavior affects others. Individuals learn the difference between external control {{of the group and}} personal control of their <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b> They learn that controlling the group is something that everyone in the group contributes to. They learn about different techniques to influence group success. They gain skills in balancing the group's versus the individual's needs.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} on {{the perception of}} our <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b> Daryl Bem's (1972) self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b> Leon Festinger's 1954 social comparison theory is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions. There is also the facial feedback hypothesis: that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion.|$|E

25|$|Doable: To be {{generally}} useful, interventions {{should be available}} to a variety of individuals, who might be teachers, parents, therapists, or even those who wish to modify their <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b> With proper planning and training, many interventions can be applied by almost anyone willing to invest the effort.|$|E
50|$|Group {{phenomena}} {{concern the}} behavior of a particular group of individual entities, usually organisms and most especially people. The behavior of individuals often changes in a group setting in various ways, and a group may have its <b>own</b> <b>behaviors</b> not possible for an individual because of the herd mentality.|$|R
50|$|Self-regulation theory (SRT) is {{a system}} of {{conscious}} personal management that involves the process of guiding one's <b>own</b> thoughts, <b>behaviors,</b> and feelings to reach goals. Self-regulation consists of several stages, and individuals must function as contributors to their <b>own</b> motivation, <b>behavior,</b> and development within a network of reciprocally interacting influences.|$|R
50|$|Arguably, when {{examining}} Festinger’s and Bem’s theories, Miller (1995) addresses a few curious questions: “How closely and accurately do people actually examine their <b>own</b> <b>behaviors?</b> Are both theories comparable in the degree, accuracy or level of self-awareness they require? How necessary is self-evaluation on a conscious level for {{either or both}} theories?”(p. 8).|$|R
25|$|Other early {{theories}} of cognitive inhibition focused on its central developmental mechanisms and were founded by Luria and Vygotsky, two Russian psychologists. They proposed that children acquire control {{of behavior and}} thought through internalized speech, and that they consciously exhibit a cognitively inhibitory process in order to regulate their <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b> Cognitive inhibition was thought to develop as mental control over behavior developed.|$|E
25|$|An unusual kind {{of social}} {{influence}} is the self-fulfilling prophecy. This is a prediction that, in being made, actually causes itself to become true. For example, in the stock market, if {{it is widely believed}} that a crash is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of their stock, and thus actually cause the crash. Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hostility by their <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
25|$|Self-perception is a {{specialized}} form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b> Psychologists {{have found that}} too many extrinsic rewards (e.g. money) tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process, a phenomenon known as overjustification. People's attention is directed to the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered. This is an important exception to reinforcement theory.|$|E

25|$|Svadhyaya {{is practiced}} as a self-reflection process, where one silently meditates, in Asana, on one’s <b>own</b> <b>behaviors,</b> motivations and plans. Svadhyaya is, in a sense, for one’s spirit and mind a process {{equivalent}} to watching one’s {{body in a}} non-distorting mirror. This self-study, in Yoga, is not merely contemplation of one’s <b>own</b> motives and <b>behaviors,</b> but also of one’s circumstances and the environment one is in, assessing where one is in one’s life, what is one’s life direction, if and how desirable changes {{may lead to a}} more fulfilling Self.|$|R

25|$|Nimoy {{has said}} that the {{character}} of Spock, which he played twelve to fourteen hours a day, five days a week, influenced his personality in private life. Each weekend during the original run of the series, he would be in character throughout Saturday and into Sunday, behaving more like Spock than himself—more logical, more rational, more thoughtful, less emotional and finding a calm in every situation. It was only on Sunday in the early afternoon that Spock's influence on his behavior would fade off and he would feel more himself again—only to start the cycle over again on Monday morning. Years after the show he observed Vulcan speech patterns, social attitudes, patterns of logic, and emotional suppression in his <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
25|$|Emily Pronin {{has argued}} that the {{subjective}} experience of free will is supported by the introspection illusion. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their <b>own</b> <b>behavior,</b> but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.|$|E
25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{describes}} how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current environment. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of {{a problem in the}} current home or current parent-child relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves the caregivers of responsibility to change aspects of their <b>own</b> <b>behavior</b> and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting relationship with them. They believe this is because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's resistance to attachment and the need to break it down. In rebirthing and similar approaches, protests of distress from the child are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.|$|E

Brown writes that Octagon is now [...] "truly worried {{about the state of}} humankind, both physically and musically; in short, someone who could truly save the world". Brown also states that while the album focuses on science fiction and abstract themes, [...] "there are also as many, if not more, songs about man's <b>own</b> <b>behavior</b> toward himself and his environment." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{two months}} of {{hearings}} and deliberations, the Watkins Committee recommended that McCarthy be censured {{on two of the}} 46 counts: his contempt of the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration, which had called him to testify in 1951 and 1952, and his abuse of General Zwicker in 1954. The Zwicker count was dropped by the full Senate on the grounds that McCarthy's conduct was arguably [...] "induced" [...] by Zwicker's <b>own</b> <b>behavior.</b> In place of this count, a new one was drafted regarding McCarthy's statements about the Watkins Committee itself.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] has {{received}} scholarly attention {{as an example}} of cultural appropriation. Murali Balaji, author of the article [...] "Vixen Resistin': Redefining black womanhood in hip-hop music videos" [...] published in the Journal of Black Studies, noted that [...] "blackness and sexuality" [...] has become characteristics by which African-American women are able to self-define. Consequently, he opined that the inclusion of Lil' Kim in the clip represented an element of [...] "'primitive' sexuality", which Aguilera intended to imitate through her <b>own</b> <b>behavior</b> in the video. In their article [...] "Naughty girls and red-blooded women: Representations of female heterosexuality in music video", published in Feminist Media Studies, Diane Railton and Paul Watson made specific note of the conflicting message raised by the lyrics [...] "all my girls around the world", while [...] "blackness and whiteness are clearly inscribed on and through the bodies of Aguilera and Kim." [...] They suggested that this example detracted the message of the track by emphasizing the problem that [...] "female heterosexuality" [...] is confined to [...] "the very limited range of ways" [...] in mainstream culture, in this instance [...] "gender and race [...] sexual behaviour".|$|E

30|$|A key {{aspect of}} {{engagement}} is facilitating {{the individual to}} self-disclose; however {{this is a very}} natural process online, with the internet promoting higher levels of self disclosure [23]. Furthermore, online users are generally more uninhibited [23], making them increasingly subject to forms of power. Specifically, this allows individuals to better self monitor and regulate their <b>own</b> <b>behaviors</b> using self subjectification [4]. Here individuals can compare their own frameworks against those of the extremist or terrorist group.|$|R
