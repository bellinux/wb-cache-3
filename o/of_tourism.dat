50|$|Without travel {{there is}} no tourism, so the concept <b>of</b> {{sustainable}} <b>tourism</b> is tightly linked to a concept of sustainable mobility. Two relevant considerations are tourism's reliance on fossil fuels and tourism's effect on climate change. 72 percent <b>of</b> <b>tourism's</b> CO2 emissions come from transportation, 24 percent from accommodations, and 4 percent from local activities. Aviation accounts for 55% of those transportation CO2 emissions (or 40% <b>of</b> <b>tourism's</b> total). However, when considering the impact of all greenhouse gas emissions from tourism and that aviation emissions are made at high altitude where their effect on climate is amplified, aviation alone accounts for 75% <b>of</b> <b>tourism's</b> climate impact.|$|R
