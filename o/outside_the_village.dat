5000|$|There is a {{beautiful}} lake <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village's</b> residential area. <b>The</b> <b>village</b> gets water from this lake for agriculture and household uses.|$|R
5|$|Due to the village's {{small size}} and small {{population}} of 578, most amenities are located <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village.</b> Many {{are located in}} the slightly larger neighbouring village of Niton, such as a Pharmacy and doctor's surgery. Others {{are located in the}} nearby town of Ventnor.|$|E
5|$|The River Yar trail {{runs through}} the village with the {{milestone}} <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> Pub. In addition to this, bridleways are maintained, running to nearby villages Wroxall and Niton. Future plans could see a pedestrian link from Whitwell to Niton along the main road.|$|E
5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he could wait no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and joined up with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> of Gonneville en Auge. The reconnaissance party had cut a way through the barbed wire, and marked four routes through the minefield. Otway divided his men into four assault groups, and settled down to await {{the arrival of the}} three gliders.|$|E
50|$|Cheektowaga - A census-designated place {{corresponding}} {{to all of}} <b>the</b> town <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>villages</b> of Sloan and Depew.|$|R
50|$|The town of Cheektowaga {{contains}} <b>the</b> <b>village</b> of Sloan {{and half}} of <b>the</b> <b>village</b> of Depew. <b>The</b> remainder, <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>villages,</b> is a census-designated place also named Cheektowaga.

5|$|However {{the track}} has now closed, and the waiting rooms {{have now been}} {{converted}} into two cottages and the old up platform has been restored. The site is now a popular tourist destination and is used for holiday accommodation. An old railway tunnel just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> {{is used as a}} mushroom farm. Another tunnel is still present on Nettlecombe Lane (pictured to the left) leading to the station.|$|E
5|$|Later, when Rosier has an {{accident}} <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village,</b> he is rescued by the Romani, who treat the mayor with their traditional healing practices. He sells them his father's house, {{in order to}} protect them from the Fascist policy of imprisoning the homeless. Lundi enrolls the children in her school. The freedom-loving Romani recognize that these French are trying to help but struggled with life in a fixed place and the rules of formal education.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route18 (NY18) is an east–west {{state highway}} in western New York in the United States. It runs {{parallel}} to the south shore of Lake Ontario {{for most of its}} length between Niagara County and Monroe County. NY18, which also passes through Orleans County, acts as a northerly alternate to NY104, another east–west route that parallels NY18 to the south on Ridge Road. The western terminus of NY18 is at a complex grade-separated interchange with NY104 <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> of Lewiston. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY104 in an area of Rochester known as Kodak Park.|$|E
50|$|Newtown {{was first}} settled in 1792 {{under the name}} of Mercersburg. The name was changed before <b>the</b> <b>village</b> {{incorporated}} in 1901. Still in existence today are the Odd Fellows' Cemetery Mound and <b>the</b> Perin <b>Village</b> Site, plus <b>the</b> Turpin Site and the Hahn Field Archeological District just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village's</b> boundaries.|$|R

5|$|Rivington Hall, {{a former}} manor house with an {{imposing}} red brick Georgian frontage, {{is a short}} distance from the village centre. Its barn, and the barn at Great House Farm were renovated and converted by the architect Jonathan Simpson for William Lever in 1904. The barns were used for catering for the early tourist industry, a function they retain today. Farmhouses and their barns scattered <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> centre, also built in local gritstone, are also listed.|$|E
5|$|St Lawrence's Church {{was built}} just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> {{at the end}} of the 14th century, but after it was buried in {{drifting}} sand it was replaced by Skagen Church in 1841 designed by Christian Frederik Hansen. It was redeveloped in 1909–10 by Ulrik Plesner who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen, including Klitgaarden and the railway station. Several landmarks in the town are closely associated with the Skagen Painters who used to frequent them, including Brøndums Hotel, Skagens Museum, Michael and Anna Ancher's House, and Drachmann's House.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his career}} was over, Rotheram {{continued}} to request sea service and honours from the Admiralty, becoming increasingly irate and intemperate in his demands. At the reorganising of the knightly orders in 1815, a number of senior naval officers were given knighthoods, but Rotheram was only made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, a step below knighthood. He retired to Bildeston in Suffolk and from there continued to request appointments, finally being made one of the captains of the Greenwich Naval Hospital in 1828. Rotheram died at Bildeston in 1830 and {{was buried in the}} churchyard of St Mary Magdelene just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village,</b> where his grave and a memorial plaque are still legible today. Rotheram was never awarded any further honours or promoted to admiral, having lost his seniority in the court martial of 1808.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{residents}} {{are from the}} Sangihe-Siao ethnic group. According to the 2000 census, the population of <b>the</b> island’s three <b>villages</b> totaled 2,649 (Lihunu 1,162, Kahuku 983 and Libas 504), while in 2010 the population of <b>the</b> <b>villages</b> had declined to 2,397 (Lihunu 1,029, Kahuku 938 and Libas 430). [...] Other residents live <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>villages</b> and at <b>the</b> five resorts.|$|R
5|$|The Baćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 83 civilians just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> of Baćin, near Hrvatska Dubica, committed by Croatian Serb paramilitaries. The killings took place on 21 October 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence. Most of the civilians were Croats, but they also included two ethnic Serbs, taken from Hrvatska Dubica, Baćin and the nearby village of Cerovljani. The civilians {{were killed in the}} area of Krečane, at the very bank of the Una River, and their bodies were left unburied for two weeks. Most of them were subsequently bulldozed into a shallow mass grave, while a number of the bodies were thrown into the river.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the Canadian Corps was {{to take control of}} the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. This would ensure that the southern flank could advance without suffering German enfilade fire. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The village of Thélus fell during the second day of the attack, as did the crest of the ridge, once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient against considerable German resistance. The final objective, a fortified knoll located <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April. The German forces then retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line.|$|E
5|$|The {{people of}} Navenby enjoy a high {{employment}} rate, although most work <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village.</b> Almost 600 commute each day, {{with the average}} journey to work being 12.5miles (20.18km). The 2001 census revealed that of 1,186people questioned aged 16–74, 722 were economically active, with men working an average of 44.8hours each week and women an average of 31.2. The service industry was the largest sector of the local economy, employing 67% of all workers, compared to 1841 when 48% worked in agriculture. Manufacturing work {{was carried out by}} 178people in 2001 and 565 were in the service industries. Of these workers, 371 were classed as managerial and professional. In 1841, just 16.6% of male workers had middle class jobs, but the 2001 census showed this figure had increased to 47.9%.|$|E

5|$|The {{pursuit of}} the Russian troops continued. On 7 February 1807, the French arrived <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> of Eylau, as night was falling. In some confusion, the Imperial coach rumbled into the village, {{although}} the Emperor was setting up his camp a few kilometers away. The Russian patrol in the village chased off the coach driver and his men and plundered the Emperor's belongings; in turn, the Imperial escort chased them off. More and more men were sent into the engagement, {{and in the end}} the French took the village when the Russians withdrew. Both sides lost 4,000 men in the contest for the village and the Emperor's nightshirt. Settling for the night, they prepared to engage the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Khe Sanh was {{the seat of}} {{government}} of Huong Hoa district, an area of Bru Montagnard villages and coffee plantations, situated about seven miles from the Laotian frontier on Route 9, the northernmost transverse road in South Vietnam. The badly deteriorated Route 9 ran from the coastal region, through the western highlands, and then crossed the border into Laos. The origin of the combat base lay in the construction by US Army Special Forces of an airfield in August 1962 <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> at an old French fort. The camp then became a Special Forces outpost of the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups (CIDG), whose purpose was to keep watch on NVA infiltration along the border {{and to protect the}} local population.|$|E
5|$|While NY426 leaves NY430 {{to follow}} {{the eastern edge of}} the lake southward toward French Creek, NY430 {{continues}} to the northeast, passing through the hamlet of Mina and over the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NY17) on its way to the town of Sherman and the village of the same name. Within the village of Sherman, NY430 becomes Main Street and intersects NY76 west of the village center. The two routes overlap for a single block before separating at the heart of the village, with NY76 continuing southward to an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway just <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> and, farther south, to its southern terminus at NY474 in Clymer. NY430, however, exits Sherman to the east before turning northward to parallel an old railroad bed northward into the town of Chautauqua.|$|E
50|$|Between 1300 and 1500 {{agriculture}} became predominant, especially {{beans and}} new varieties of maize. Larger villages were inhabited {{in summer and}} fall. Small camps diminished and <b>the</b> <b>villages</b> became larger {{as well as the}} houses, which became rectangular. Some of <b>the</b> <b>villages</b> became real fortresses. During the later Whittlesey Tradition burial grounds were placed <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>villages,</b> but still close to them. These villages were in use all year round.|$|R
