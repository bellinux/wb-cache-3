5|$|During the 1993 season, Prost and Senna {{continued}} their <b>on-track</b> rivalry. Prost was escorted by police to the Interlagos circuit for the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix {{due to the}} hostility of Brazilians towards him. The two {{continued their}} <b>on-track</b> battles at Silverstone where Senna aggressively defended his position against Prost. At Prost's last Grand Prix, the 1993 Australian Grand Prix, he was pulled up by Senna onto the top step of the podium for an embrace.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collision}} between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg {{on the last}} lap of the Austrian Grand Prix, the second of such incidents in five races, Mercedes introduced a new driver management policy, dictating the terms by which Hamilton and Rosberg could race one another and promising penalties {{in the event of}} further <b>on-track</b> altercations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} racing lap, Vettel led by 2.8 seconds from Webber, who was {{followed}} by Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Massa, Button, Schumacher, Kubica, Hülkenberg, Sutil, Barrichello, Kobaysahi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Liuzzi, Buemi, Glock, Petrov, Kovalainen, Yamamoto, Trulli, Senna and di Grassi. Alonso chose a cautious approach and lost four to five seconds while building up his pace slowly in the early stages. Sutil ran off the circuit but continued after losing his position to both Williams drivers. Webber lost grip on the next lap after running across the outside kerbing and spinning across the track onto the wall between turns twelve and thirteen; he slid back onto the circuit and collected Rosberg, forcing both drivers to retire. The debris <b>on-track</b> from the accident called the safety car to be deployed. Kobayashi, Petrov, Heidfeld and Buemi all made pit stops for intermediate tyres during the safety car period.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the {{entrance}} is the subway that links all the platforms, reached either by steps or lift; it houses the main public toilets, automated teller machines (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all platform islands except 13–15). A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' <b>on-track</b> equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|E
5|$|The third (and final) {{practice}} session {{started with a}} morning sleet shower and Anthony Davidson in Toyota's No. 5 entry drove off the circuit at Luffield turn. Davidson later aquaplaned backwards off the track and into the Chapel corner gravel trap. The session was stopped to allow the stricken Toyota to be extracted from the gravel trap and and {{it was able to}} return to the pit lane with assistance from a recovery crane, allowing <b>on-track</b> action to recommence. Sleet later turned to snow necessitating track officials to stop the session for the second time. Driver adviser Yannick Dalmas was asked to assess the track's condition during the stoppage and gave feedback that prompted the session's premature end with half an hour remaining. Eleven cars took to the track but nobody recorded a timed lap. Tincknell completed the most out-laps of any driver in the session with three.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} a drivers' boycott over the terms of their 1995 FIA Super Licences, which allowed the FIA to demand promotional {{appearances}} and forbade the drivers from criticising the championship, was defused by the governing body prior to the race, ensuring full driver participation in the championship. Although the Super License issue was resolved with 14teams and 28drivers on the official 1995 entry list, the Larrousse team with drivers Éric Bernard and Christophe Bouchut did not make an appearance at the circuit {{for any of the}} <b>on-track</b> sessions. This was due to the team running short of money: in the period prior to the event, with French government aid not forthcoming and a 1995 chassis not yet built, team owner Gérard Larrousse elected to miss the first two rounds of the season in the hope of competing from the San Marino Grand Prix onwards.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} 1995 season, Hill {{was one of}} the title favourites. The Williams team were reigning constructors' champions, having beaten Benetton in 1994, and with young David Coulthard, who was embarking on his first full season in Formula One, as team-mate, Hill was the clear number one driver. The year started badly when he spun off in Brazil due to a {{mechanical}} problem, but wins in the next two races put him in the championship lead. However, Schumacher won seven of the next twelve races, and took his second title with two races to spare, while Benetton took the constructors' championship. Schumacher and Hill had several <b>on-track</b> incidents during the season, two of which led to suspended one-race bans. Schumacher's penalty was for blocking and forcing Hill off the road at the Belgian Grand Prix; Hill's was for colliding with Schumacher under braking at the Italian Grand Prix. Hill's season finished positively when he won the Australian Grand Prix by finishing two laps ahead of the runner-up, Olivier Panis in a Ligier.|$|E
5|$|DRS was enabled on lap 46, as Barrichello and Rosberg were contesting eighth position. Button {{had caught}} Maldonado and Alguersuari, and passed both cars for tenth place. Mark Webber {{was the first}} driver to switch to slick tyres, and was {{followed}} by Barrichello and Buemi. Kobayashi and Massa, fighting for second place, were both passed by Schumacher on lap 51; Massa then passed Kobayashi for third place. As the drivers pitted for slick tyres {{over the next three}} laps, Massa damaged his wing forcing him into another pitstop, while damage to Adrian Sutil's car led to his retirement. Button had risen from ninth after his pit-stop to fourth, and was catching the leading trio of Vettel, Schumacher and Webber. On lap 56 Heidfeld, while battling Kobayashi for fifth place, collided with the rear of the Sauber which damaged his front wing. The wing then detached and folded under the car, and Heidfeld after losing control of his car ran down an escape road on turn 3. The debris <b>on-track</b> from the accident called the sixth safety car period of the race.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2003, in {{the lead}} up to the 2003 Indy 500, Andretti took to the track {{for the first time}} in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of 63. He participated in a test session for son Michael's AGR IndyCar team. One of the team's regular drivers, Tony Kanaan, {{suffered}} a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April 15 crash at Motegi. If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him. He would turn the car over to Kanaan on race day, though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race. During the test, Andretti ran at competitive speeds, but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash. Andretti was able to walk away from the wreck with just a minor cut on his chin. This was Andretti's last significant <b>on-track</b> activity at Indianapolis.|$|E
25|$|The CRHS owns seven {{pieces of}} <b>on-track</b> equipment: caboose 21165 and track car 328, G36L class Gondola 67257, F41 class flat car 715788, CR MOW Camp car 62610, N11 caboose 18452, and former Triple Crown RoadRailer TCSZ 463491.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} bulky rear wing that was affixed {{to the rear of}} the car from 2007 to early 2010 {{increased}} the severity of many <b>on-track</b> incidents by causing cars to flip over or go airborne at high speeds.|$|E
25|$|Forty {{people have}} been fatally injured in <b>on-track</b> incidents: 23 car drivers, twelve motorcyclists, three go-kart drivers, one powerboat racer, and one track worker. The most notable death may have been that of Dale Earnhardt, who was killed on the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500 on February 18, 2001.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the 2004 season a dispute with WilliamsF1 {{threatened}} to overshadow BAR's <b>on-track</b> performance. Both teams believed they had a valid contract for Button in 2005. The issue finally went to the Contract Recognition Board, which found in favour of BAR. Button was to drive for BAR in 2005, but signed a contract to join Williams for 2006.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007 season, Busch had two wins, one pole, scored five top-fives, and ten-top tens through 26 {{races and}} {{qualified}} for the Chase for the Sprint Cup. Busch's <b>on-track</b> performance increased noticeably after the addition of Pat Tryson as his crew chief midway through the season. He also ran four more Busch races, earning 2 top five and 3 top ten finishes.|$|E
25|$|The Advanced Rider Training, {{known as}} ART, {{is aimed at}} riders who have at least 12,000 miles of on-street riding experience. It {{consists}} of a two-hour classroom session and 4–5 hours of <b>on-track</b> education. Since the ART takes place on go-kart tracks in order to teach riding proficiency at higher speeds, it is only taught at Pat's Acres in Canby and in Medford.|$|E
25|$|Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) is a {{partnership}} that brings together national governments, donors, UN agencies, NGOs and other development partners. They work to improve sustainable access to sanitation and water supply {{to meet and}} go beyond the MDG target. In 2014, 77 countries had already met the MDG sanitation target, 29 were on track and, 79 were not <b>on-track.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ten teams {{participated in}} the Championship after several rule changes were {{implemented}} by the FIA to cut costs to try to minimise {{the impact of the}} global financial crisis. There were further changes to try to improve the <b>on-track</b> spectacle with the return of slick tyres, changes to aerodynamics and the introduction of Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) presenting some of the biggest changes in Formula One regulations for several decades.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{spotlight}} of attention during the 1992 season, Petty's <b>on-track</b> results {{had been so}} far unimpressive. He had scored zero top tens, and had a best finish of 15th (three times). His most notable race of the season came at Daytona during the July 4 Pepsi 400. With President George H. W. Bush in attendance, Petty was honored during the pre-race ceremonies. He qualified {{on the outside of}} the front row, and led the first five laps of the race.|$|E
25|$|Subject to {{the racing}} {{regulations}} in force, {{it is not}} uncommon for drivers to be allowed to make pitstops during safety car periods. This situation may provide a strategic advantage since any scheduled refueling, tire change or maintenance may be carried out while other competitors are lapping at lower speed, and the drivers who pit then simply rejoin a queue of cars all running together. During normal racing conditions, such interventions would typically involve losing significant terrain over those drivers that remain <b>on-track.</b>|$|E
25|$|During her {{tenure as}} a Truck Series driver, a dispute between then-Evernham Cup driver Jeremy Mayfield and Ray Evernham {{resulted}} {{in a series of}} lawsuits between Mayfield and Evernham. In Mayfield’s legal filings, he asserted that the No. 19 team’s lack of <b>on-track</b> success was {{due in large part to}} Evernham’s attention being focused on his personal relationship with an unnamed female driver. At the time, Crocker was the only female driver employed by Evernham Motorsports. Evernham confirmed in an interview with ESPN that the relationship exists and has hurt Crocker's career.|$|E
25|$|After pitting for repairs, Senna {{worked his}} way past both Williams and the Benettons to take a three-second victory. However, his altercation with Prost seven laps earlier meant he had missed the chicane and, {{according}} to FIA and FISA president Jean Marie Balestre, had not completed the lap. It {{is worth noting that}} many drivers in previous races had used the escape roads near chicanes after <b>on-track</b> incidents, as is customary, without receiving penalties. He was disqualified and Nannini revelled in his first grand prix victory. The new Williams FW13s finished second and third, putting them five points ahead of the Ferrari team in the race for second.|$|E
25|$|The Mid-Norfolk Railway is {{frequently}} used by mainline companies for crew {{training and the}} storage and testing of recommissioned and new <b>on-track</b> plant, including ballast tampers, ballast regulators, stoneblowers and Multi-Purpose Vehicles from companies including Network Rail and Balfour Beatty Rail Ltd. Since 2001 the line has been used annually for low adhesion training, or skidpan training, for crews from Anglia Railways, latterly for National Express East Anglia, where a specially fitted Class 153 treats the track with a slimy solution before the crew practices stopping in a virtual station. The line has also been used for training exercises by East of England Ambulance Service, Norfolk Police and the Fire Brigade, including major incident training involving air ambulances.|$|E
25|$|At Atlanta, {{facing the}} intense {{pressure}} of a hectic schedule of appearances and honors, {{not to mention}} the actual <b>on-track</b> activities, Petty barely managed to qualify for the Hooters 500. He posted the 39th-fastest speed out of 41 cars. He would not have been eligible for the provisional starting position, and had to qualify on speed. Petty stood on his first round time, and sweated out second round qualifying, and was not bumped from the lineup. With Petty safely in the field, the stage was set for a huge sendoff. Ceremonies to honor Petty were planned in the pre-race and post-race, and Petty was expected to take a ceremonial final lap around the track after the race to formally conclude his career. On the night before the race, Alabama held a concert honoring Petty at the Georgia Dome, with 45,000 in attendance.|$|E
25|$|Bad {{luck for}} rivals and {{excellent}} <b>on-track</b> performances from the Colombian {{meant he was}} a title contender, particularly after a key victory at the German Grand Prix. Williams, however, were unable {{to keep pace with}} the latest developments from Ferrari, coupled with a mid-season amendment to tyre regulations that forced the Michelin-shod Williams, among others, to quickly make a new design to avoid being disqualified. With that, the Bridgestone-shod Ferraris returned to form. Montoya failed to claim another victory that year. A drive-through penalty at the United States Grand Prix after a collision with Ferrari's Barrichello ended his title chances in the last race he would finish in 2003. He was leading the final race of the season in Japan when he had a hydraulic failure. Overall, he finished the season in 3rd position in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Orbital {{continued}} expanding its missile defense systems {{business with a}} $900 million award to develop, build, test and support interceptor booster vehicles. In 2006 Orbital conducted its 500th mission since the company’s founding with a diverse portfolio of products that included satellites, launch vehicles, and missile defense systems. In 2007, the first interplanetary spacecraft built by Orbital, Dawn was launched on an eight-year, three-billion-mile journey to the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. A major milestone in the company's history was in 2008 when it received a long-term NASA contract to provide cargo transportation services {{to and from the}} International Space Station (ISS) with a value of approximately $1.9 billion for missions from 2011 to 2015. Orbital is currently <b>on-track</b> to deliver on this contract with its Cygnus spacecraft and Antares rocket following the success of Cygnus Orb-D1 and Cygnus CRS Orb-1.|$|E
25|$|Many safety {{improvements}} {{were made}} in the sport following Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths and Barrichello's crash. These include improved crash barriers, redesigned tracks, higher crash safety standards (such as larger sills along the driver cockpit) and major cuts to engine power. The Tamburello corner {{and other parts of the}} Imola circuit were altered for 1995. This was despite calls for action in 1989, after a serious high-speed crash in which Senna's friend, Gerhard Berger, suffered burns to his hand. No action took place after that crash because, following an inspection by Senna and Berger, they ended up siding with officials who had, for years, claimed that the wall could not be moved further back due to a river nearby. Revised <b>on-track</b> medical procedures also saw personnel hold up curtains at crash sites, to prevent the public from viewing distressing images as had occurred on live television with Senna.|$|E
25|$|At Rial's début race, the 1988 Brazilian Grand Prix, de Cesaris {{qualified}} 14th {{and reached}} sixth {{place in the}} race, but {{he ran out of}} fuel seven laps from the end. Mechanical failures occurred during the following races, and Rial twice breached regulations; for working on the car <b>on-track</b> and the drivers head being above the roll bar - necessitating a modification of the car. The fuel tank was again a problem in Canada where de Cesaris ran out of fuel in fifth place; however the next race in Detroit saw Rial finish in fourth place, scoring three points. After the , the teams performance began to fall, and Brunner left the team after finishing 13th in their home race in Germany. Continuous mechanical problems and the fuel tank contributed to a six-race string of retirements, de Cesaris finishing the season classified 8th in Australia. The team finished in ninth place in the constructors championship, and Andrea de Cesaris was placed fifteenth in the drivers championship.|$|E
25|$|Harvick {{took his}} second {{consecutive}} win {{of the year}} at Martinsville Speedway, beating Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in the final 10 laps. Following <b>on-track</b> incidents both during and immediately after the Showtime Southern 500 (Darlington) with Kyle Busch, Harvick was placed on probation for 4 races (plus the NASCAR All-Star Race) and fined $25,000. Harvick then won the Coca-Cola 600 after Earnhardt, Jr. ran out of fuel in the last turn on Lap 402, finishing off a career accomplishment of winning all three current majors and the Brickyard 400, but is not eligible for a Career Grand Slam because of the Ferko lawsuit that wiped out his chance at the mark– only eight drivers have scored since the lawsuit eliminated the fall race at Darlington, which was required for the Career Grand Slam. Harvick announced that he would shut down his NASCAR Nationwide/Camping World Truck Series race team Kevin Harvick Inc. because he wanted to focus on winning a NSCS (NASCAR Sprint Cup Series) championship. He sold KHI (Kevin Harvick Inc.) to Richard Childress.|$|E
25|$|As {{has been}} the case since the SMI {{purchase}} of BMS, improvements continued in and around the Speedway in 2002. The season saw the addition of a long-awaited infield pedestrian tunnel, allowing access {{into and out of the}} infield during <b>on-track</b> activity. Also in 2002, a new building was constructed in the infield to house driver meetings. That same year also witnessed the christening of a new BMS Victory Lane atop the newly constructed building. Kurt Busch won the 2002 Food City 500 on March 24 and became the first Cup winner in the new BMS winner's circle. Additional improvements in 2002 included new scoreboards located on the facing of the suites in Turns 2 and 3. On Monday, August 26, 2002, work began on the most ambitious construction project since SMI's purchase of BMS in 1996. The entire backstretch, including the Speedway's last remaining concrete seats, was demolished. The new backstretch increased the venue’s seating capacity to more than 160,000. The new backstretch includes three levels of seating and is topped with 52 luxury skybox suites. These seats are also named for leading NASCAR figures, with Richard Petty, Cale Yarborough and Junior Johnson each having a section of the new seats named for them; Dale Earnhardt was given a section on top in his memory.|$|E
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 40 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Rosenqvist was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} two minutes and 13.099 seconds which was recorded his final timed lap late in the session. He was four-tenths of a second quicker than the second-fastest driver Callum Ilott who moved out of traffic to drive with a clear track on his fastest lap. Kenta Yamashita was third-fastest, ahead of Juncadella and Norris; the latter held the fastest lap until ten minutes remaining in the session. Jake Hughes, Félix da Costa, Sims, David Beckmann and George Russell rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was stopped early for 16 minutes when Ferdinand Habsburg went into Fisherman's Bend corner too quickly and understeered into the turn's barriers, causing his car's left front corner to become lodged underneath the wall. Habsburg was transported to a local hospital for a precautionary check-up. As a result, the session was extended by five minutes to provide competitors with additional <b>on-track</b> time. Cassidy stopped his car on the front straight with brake problems while Mardenborough made a pit stop because his car's engine cover was becoming detached and the problem affected his vehicle's top speed, and Tadasuke Makino carried excessive speed turning into Lisboa Bend corner and damaged his car's front-left corner in an impact with the turn's exit barrier.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{graphics}} were of {{the highest}} quality for the Nintendo 64 at the time. Smith praised general aspects of the game's graphics such as their crispness, detail, smoothness, and lack of polygon dropout. Reviewers praised the game's camera use, the game's [...] "very solid" [...] physics model, the impression of racers' speed, and the game's snow effects (sun reflected in the snow as appropriate, and fluffy snow and packed snow appeared and behaved differently). Graphical faults included occasional pop-up, misplaced shadows, and lag when racers passed through <b>on-track</b> trees; these problems were generally identified as minor.|$|E
500|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 60 {{minutes and}} {{was divided into}} four groups of five cars. Each group was determined by a lottery system and was permitted six minutes of <b>on-track</b> activity. All drivers were limited to two timed laps with one at maximum power. The fastest five overall competitors in the four groups participated in a [...] "Super Pole" [...] session with one driver on the track at any time going out in reverse order. Each of the five drivers was limited to one timed lap; the starting order {{was determined by the}} participants' fastest times.
