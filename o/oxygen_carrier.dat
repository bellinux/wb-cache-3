5|$|The protein {{hemocyanin}} is the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> in most mollusks {{and some}} arthropods {{such as the}} horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based hemoglobin. Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by {{their role in the}} formation of lacquers.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is an <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier</b> {{that occurs}} in red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E
25|$|Hemerythrin {{is another}} iron-containing <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> The oxygen binding {{site is a}} binuclear iron center.

The uptake of O2 by hemerythrin is accompanied by two-electron oxidation of the reduced binuclear center to produce bound peroxide (OOH−). The mechanism of oxygen uptake and release have been worked out in detail.|$|E

Gas-solid flow behavior and temperature field in fluidized bed are obtained. The impact of air to fuel ratio on the oxygen conversion rate is evaluated. The results indicate that a high air to fuel ratio will reduce oxygen conversion efficiency. By comparison with experimental data, the model with consideration of multi-scale structures can obtain a better prediction.

2500|$|An {{alternate}} method {{under development}} is chemical looping combustion (CLC). Chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid <b>oxygen</b> <b>carrier.</b> Metal oxide particles react with a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel in a fluidized bed combustor, producing solid metal particles and {{a mixture of}} carbon dioxide and water vapor. [...] The water vapor is condensed, leaving pure carbon dioxide, which can then be sequestered.

40|$|Accepted June 6, 2008. - El pdf del artículo es la versión post-printChemical-looping {{reforming}} (CLR) utilizes {{the same}} basic principles as chemical-looping combustion (CLC), being the main difference that the wanted product in CLR is H 2 and CO. Therefore, in the CLR process the {{air to fuel ratio}} is kept low to prevent the complete oxidation of the fuel to CO 2 and H 2 O. Ni-based <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers</b> prepared by impregnation on alumina have been studied in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and in a batch fluidized bed reactor in order to know its potential for CLR of CH 4. In the TGA the reactivity of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers</b> has been determined. In the batch fluidized bed the effect on the gas product distribution produced during reduction-oxidation cycles and on the carbon deposition of different operating conditions, as type of support, reaction temperature, H 2 O/CH 4 molar ratio, and preparation method, has been tested and analyzed. It was found that the support (different types of alumina) used to prepare the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers</b> had an important effect on the reactivity of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers,</b> on the gas product distribution, and on the carbon deposition. In addition, for all <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers</b> prepared, an increase in the reaction temperature and/or in the H 2 O/CH 4 molar ratio produced a decrease in the carbon deposition during the reduction period. Finally, it was observed that the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers</b> prepared by a deposition-precipitation method had higher tendency to increase the C deposition than the <b>oxygen</b> <b>carriers</b> prepared by dry impregnation. © 2008 Elsevier B.
