5|$|Mrs. Puff has {{appeared}} in many types of SpongeBob SquarePants merchandise, including action figures, aquarium ornaments, and video games. Tie-in books have prominently featured the character. Board games based on the show, such as The Game of Life and Bikini Bottom Book of Games, use her schoolhouse as a playing location. In 2007, a Lego construction set based <b>on</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Puff's school was released. SpongeBob's Boating Bash, a 2010 racing video game, centers <b>on</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Puff and {{takes place at the}} boating school. Mrs. Puff is a playable character in the Wii version, and acts as a guide for the player in the Nintendo DS game.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. Vitti had wanted an episode centered <b>on</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Krabappel that examined {{what it was like}} to have Bart as a student. It was the first episode of the show to feature her in a prominent role. The subplot where Homer tries to clean up his language was written partially in response to the complaints the show had been getting about the amount of cursing on the show. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image.|$|E

In accordance to these studies, we found that <b>mRS</b> <b>on</b> discharge and after 3 [*]months showed a highly significant difference between patient subgroups. A strong negative correlation was also detected between vitamin D status and <b>mRS</b> <b>on</b> discharge and after 3 [*]months.|$|R
30|$|The study {{required}} an approach capable of eliciting {{knowledge of a}} highly skilled work process from train drivers. Other studies in this domain have shown {{that this type of}} knowledge is difficult to extract because it is wielded tacitly [12] through repetition, and rapid and automated actions in a dynamic work environment [13]. The literature endorses converging multiple techniques as the best method for eliciting expert knowledge in these real-world environments [14]. Thus, the study adopted a mixed methods approach involving observation of work in a simulator and cab rides, observation of work using videos and training media, focus groups interviews, and one-to-one interviews with experts. The field work was conducted over a 6 -month period with an exploratory and “bootstrapped” research approach as part of a longer research project into conduct of security procedures <b>on</b> <b>MRSs.</b>|$|R

Columbo was never seen <b>on</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Columbo; each episode featured the resourceful Mrs. Columbo solving a murder mystery she encountered {{in her work}} as a newspaper reporter. Connections with the original Columbo series were made obvious: the glaring presence of Columbo's car in the driveway, Dog, and Mrs. Columbo emptying ashtrays containing the famous green cigar butts—all featured in the show's opening sequence.

40|$|After an {{analysis}} of the hazards of room-and-pillar retreat mining systems, it became apparent that safety could be significantly improved by considerations of (1) human factors, (2) remotely controlled mobile roof supports (MRS=s), (3) mine layout designs, and (4) ground monitoring systems. Initial studies of the effectiveness of MRS=s focused on their interaction with mine strata and evaluations of suitable measurements for detecting roof stability problems during pillar extraction. These studies indicated that overall stress distributions and strata movement were most influenced by the stiffness of coal-measure rocks and the design of mining layouts. Thus, to improve worker safety, mine layouts should be carefully designed and a pillar extraction method chosen for specific geologic and stress conditions. Pillar failure was often associated with an increase in pressure on the hydraulic gauges of the MRS, and roof failure was often preceded by rapid changes in the rate of roof-floor convergence. These studies led to development of a monitoring system that displays loading rate <b>on</b> an <b>MRS</b> in real time. A major MRS manufacturer cooperated in installing and testing the system <b>on</b> an <b>MRS.</b> New field studies focus on evaluating the performance of the system, measuring roof-floor convergence, and optimizing the safety of MRS operations through proper mine layout design...|$|R

25|$|In Adams’ case, {{the court}} did not ignore the {{suggestion}} that he had hastened death and, as Devlin makes clear, he needed to clarify for the jury, and incidentally the medical profession, {{the extent to which the}} law allowed the orthodox doctor to go in easing the passing of the dying. Mahar regards Adam’s statements to Hannam <b>on</b> <b>Mrs</b> Morrell as less about his guilt or innocence than a disconnection between the medical and legal views on assisted dying: Adams never denied giving his patients large doses of opiates, but denied it was murder. This was not simply Adams' idiosyncratic view, as appears from the evidence of Dr. Douthwaite for the prosecution, who accepted that a physician might knowingly give fatal doses of pain relieving drugs to a terminally ill patients, adding it was not his business to say whether it was murder. Devlin’s directions to the jury confirmed that it was a medical issue, not a legal or moral one, whether Adam’s treatment was designed to promote comfort. Devlin’s view was that Adams may have been guilty of mercy killing or even perhaps finishing off a troublesome patient, but was one who cared for his patients to the best of his ability. Adams eased the passing of Mrs Morrell, but his greed brought his motives into question. Mahar notes an editorial in a medical journal following the case suggested that the publicity it caused might hamper medical discretion, but claimed the use of opiates in terminal cases was essential. Adams may be seen as an extreme case in their use, but other doctors also used them to ease the passing.|$|E
25|$|It {{was opened}} at twelve o'clock <b>on</b> <b>Mrs</b> Thwaytes' 48th birthday, 2 October 1837. A large triumphal arch {{intertwined}} with greenery {{and topped with}} flags was built close to the Clock Tower. Mrs Thwaytes, accompanied by Simm Smith and wearing a blue satin crinoline, was conveyed along the very short distance from her residence to the Clock Tower {{in the first of}} a train of carriages containing trustees of the Clock Tower and other personages bearing wands and wearing blue rosettes. This procession was preceded by blue and white flags and a band, and followed by a cheering multitude. On arrival at the site, the multitude cheered again loudly and hats were thrown. It was noted that Mrs Thwaytes was slightly unwell, but she thanked the crowd. Simm Smith read out her address in which she presented the Clock Tower to the town. At {{the beginning and end of}} the ceremony a salute was fired from the four fog-warning cannon on the pier, and a free meal was provided for a hundred charity children, their parents, and the construction workers who built the Tower. Large numbers of gentlemen ate dinners and drank toasts at the Kent and Pier hotels. In the evening there was a firework display and a clock tower in variegated fire created by Mr Fewick who had been in charge of fireworks at the 1836 ceremony. Opening Day was also celebrated by villagers in Herne which was festooned with decorations following Mrs Thwaytes' distribution of money, food and goods. Celebrations on the anniversary of this opening ceremony and Mrs Thwaytes' birthday continued until at least 1839 when the gentry enjoyed a dinner, ball and concert.|$|E
