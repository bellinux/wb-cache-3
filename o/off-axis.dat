5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the <b>off-axis</b> listening experience.|$|E
5|$|The end-fire array trades a few {{decibels}} {{of output}} power for directionality, so it requires more enclosures {{for the same}} output power as a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of enclosures. Sixteen enclosures in four rows were used in 2007 {{at one of the}} stages of the Ultra Music Festival, to reduce low frequency interference to neighboring stages. Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it. The output pattern suffers from comb-filtering <b>off-axis,</b> but can be further shaped by adjusting the frequency response of each row of subwoofers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Off-axis</b> HPIV uses {{separate}} beams {{to provide}} the object and reference waves. This setup is used to avoid speckle noise form being generated from interference of the two waves within the scattering medium, which would occur if they were both propagated through the medium. An <b>off-axis</b> experiment is a highly complex optical system comprising numerous optical elements, and the reader is referred to an example schematic in Sheng et al. for a more complete presentation.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass of the bike and rider is only lowered and not moved out, but if {{the front of the}} bike is free to swivel about its steering axis, the lean to the right will cause it to steer to the right by some combination of gyroscopic precession, ground reaction forces, gravitational force on an <b>off-axis</b> {{center of mass}} or simply the inertia of an <b>off-axis</b> center of mass depending on the exact geometry and mass distribution of the particular bike and the amount of torque and the speed at which it is applied.|$|E
25|$|The 1.54-metre Danish National Telescope {{was built}} by Grubb-Parsons {{and has been in}} use at La Silla since 1979. The {{telescope}} has an <b>off-axis</b> mount, and the optics are a Ritchey-Chrétien design. Because of the telescope's mount and limited space inside the dome, it has significant pointing restrictions.|$|E
25|$|For {{theoretical}} {{considerations of}} mutual interference (at frequencies between 2 and c. 30GHz - typically in the Fixed Satellite Service) where specific antenna performance {{has not been}} defined, a reference antenna based on Recommendation ITU-R S.465 {{is used to calculate}} the interference, which will include the likely sidelobes for <b>off-axis</b> effects.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} EUVL tools, {{resulting from the}} use of reflective optics, is the <b>off-axis</b> illumination (at an angle of 6 degrees, in different direction at different positions within the illumination slit) on a multilayer mask. This leads to shadowing effects resulting in asymmetry in the diffraction pattern that degrade pattern fidelity in various ways as described below.|$|E
25|$|The stop {{determines whether}} the image will be vignetted. Larger stops {{can cause the}} {{intensity}} reaching the film or detector to fall off toward {{the edges of the}} picture, especially when, for <b>off-axis</b> points, a different stop becomes the aperture stop by virtue of cutting off more light than did the stop that was the aperture stop on the optic axis.|$|E
25|$|The {{speed of}} a {{compression}} wave in fluid {{is determined by the}} medium's compressibility and density. In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility and density, but with the additional factor of shear modulus which affects compression waves due to <b>off-axis</b> elastic energies which are able to influence effective tension and relaxation in a compression. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material's shear modulus and density.|$|E
25|$|<b>Off-axis</b> or offset feed– The {{reflector}} is an asymmetrical {{segment of}} a paraboloid, so the focus, and the feed antenna, are located {{to one side}} of the dish. The purpose of this design is to move the feed structure out of the beam path, so it does not block the beam. It is widely used in home satellite television dishes, which are small enough that the feed structure would otherwise block a significant percentage of the signal. Offset feed can also be used in multiple reflector designs such as the Cassegrain and Gregorian, below.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{cavities}} {{can also}} be used as multipass optical delay lines, folding a light beam so that a long path-length may be achieved in a small space. A plane-parallel cavity with flat mirrors produces a flat zigzag light path, but as discussed above, these designs are very sensitive to mechanical disturbances and walk-off. When curved mirrors are used in a nearly confocal configuration, the beam travels on a circular zigzag path. The latter is called a Herriott-type delay line. A fixed insertion mirror is placed <b>off-axis</b> near one of the curved mirrors, and a mobile pickup mirror is similarly placed near the other curved mirror. A flat linear stage with one pickup mirror is used in case of flat mirrors and a rotational stage with two mirrors is used for the Herriott-type delay line.|$|E
25|$|Driver design—including the {{particular}} way {{two or more}} drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system—is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of timbre and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments. Adjusting a design to improve performance is done {{using a combination of}} magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, <b>off-axis</b> response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an anechoic chamber to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.|$|E
25|$|All the {{above-mentioned}} methods involve recording tilt series {{of a given}} specimen field. This inevitably results in the summation of a high dose of reactive electrons through the sample and the accompanying destruction of fine detail during recording. The technique of low-dose (minimal-dose) imaging is therefore regularly applied to mitigate this effect. Low-dose imaging is performed by deflecting illumination and imaging regions simultaneously away from the optical axis to image an adjacent region to the area to be recorded (the high-dose region). This area is maintained centered during tilting and refocused before recording. During recording the deflections are removed so that the area of interest is exposed to the electron beam only for the duration required for imaging. An improvement of this technique (for objects resting on a sloping substrate film) is to have two symmetrical <b>off-axis</b> regions for focusing followed by setting focus to {{the average of the}} two high-dose focus values before recording the low-dose area of interest.|$|E
25|$|Some {{displays}} {{for early}} computers (those {{that needed to}} display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used Charactron CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask (stencil), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed <b>off-axis,</b> so {{a second set of}} deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed {{toward the center of the}} screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.|$|E
500|$|... "Also {{referred}} to as the Hammer, the AASM weapon has impressed during the campaign to date. Incorporating a precision guidance kit and propulsion system, the design will eventually be available for use with standard bombs weighing between 125kg and 1,000kg, although a 250kg version is the only one currently in service. Sagem cites a range capability of more than 32nm from high altitude, or 8nm from low level. Launches can also be made from an <b>off-axis</b> angle of up to 90°, while up to six weapons can be fired against individual targets in a single pass and with just one trigger press." [...] And [...] "Libya represents the first opportunity for the French air force to employ the Thales Damocles targeting pod, although the Navy gave the system its combat debut over Afghanistan in late 2010." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{architectural}} historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner {{described the}} first quadrangle as [...] "small and pretty, especially {{because of the}} variety of its ranges". He noted the part-Elizabethan and part-Jacobean architecture on the south side, where Price's building stops– the join between the two, he pointed out, is [...] "easily visible" [...] in Market Street. The windows in the first quadrangle, he noted, were Elizabethan in style, with mullioned windows and arched lights, arranged symmetrically, whereas the hall windows were Gothic in style. The historian John Julius Norwich wrote that the first quadrangle had [...] "a curious charm, due partly to its size and partly due to its several small eccentricities", including the curved path crossing the quadrangle from the entrance to the hall. The architect and designer Sir Hugh Casson, though, thought that the [...] "crooked <b>off-axis</b> line" [...] of the path was the college's oddest feature. [...] All four sides of the first quadrangle are Grade I listed buildings (the highest grade, for buildings of exceptional importance and international interest): the lodgings and chapel on the north side, the hall on the west side, and the buildings on the east and south sides.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study by}} Sherrill and {{coworkers}} probed {{the geometry of}} the interaction further, confirming that cation-π interactions are strongest when the cation is situated perpendicular to the plane of atoms (θ = 0 degrees in the image below). Variations from this geometry still exhibit a significant interaction which weakens as θ angle approaches 90 degrees. [...] For <b>off-axis</b> interactions the preferred ϕ places the cation between two H atoms. Equilibrium bond distances also increase with <b>off-axis</b> angle. Energies where the cation is coplanar with the carbon ring are saddle points on the potential energy surface, {{which is consistent with}} the idea that interaction between a cation and the positive region of the quadrupole is not ideal.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, a novel {{mechanism}} for spectral discrimination in cephalopods was described. [...] This {{relies on the}} exploitation of chromatic aberration (wavelength-dependence of focal length). Numerical modeling shows that chromatic aberration can yield useful chromatic information through the dependence of image acuity on accommodation. The unusual <b>off-axis</b> slit and annular pupil shapes in cephalopods enhance this ability.|$|E
2500|$|The {{combination}} of the <b>off-axis</b> asymmetry and the mask shadowing effect leads to a fundamental inability of two identical features even {{in close proximity to}} be in focus simultaneously. One of EUVL's key issues is the asymmetry between the top and bottom line of a pair of horizontal lines (the so-called [...] "two-bar"). Some ways to partly compensate are the use of assist features as well as asymmetric illumination.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>off-axis</b> {{illumination}} of the reticle is {{also the}} cause of non-telecentricity in wafer defocus, which consumes most of the 1.4 nm overlay budget of the NXE:3400 EUV scanner even for design rules as loose as 100nm pitch. In particular, the worst uncorrectable pattern placement error for a 24 nm line was about 1.1 nm, relative to an adjacent 72 nm power line, per 80 nm wafer focus position shift at a single slit position; when across-slit performance is included, the worst error is over 1.5 nm in the wafer defocus window ...|$|E
2500|$|At a {{redshift}} of z = 0.105, GRB 031203 {{was both}} the closest and faintest gamma-ray burst {{that had ever}} been observed. [...] It was about 1.3 billion light-years from Earth. Gamma-ray bursts, which generally emit roughly {{the same amount of}} energy, had previously been treated as standard candles. However, GRB 031203 and the earlier GRB 980425 were notable exceptions to the standard candle model due to their low energy output. This led some researchers to believe that GRB 031203 may have been an X-ray flash, viewed <b>off-axis,</b> or a member of a previously unknown population of nearby faint bursts.|$|E
2500|$|The narrow part of {{the horn}} next to the driver is called the [...] "throat" [...] and the large part {{farthest}} away from the driver is called the [...] "mouth". The angular coverage (radiation pattern) of the horn {{is determined by the}} shape and flare of the mouth. [...] A major problem of horn speakers is that the radiation pattern varies with frequency; high frequency sound tends to be emitted in narrow beams with poor <b>off-axis</b> performance. [...] Significant improvements have been made, beginning with the [...] "constant directivity" [...] horn invented in 1975 by Don Keele.|$|E
2500|$|A tweeter is a {{high-frequency}} driver that reproduces {{the highest}} frequencies in a speaker system. [...] A {{major problem in}} tweeter design is achieving wide angular sound coverage (<b>off-axis</b> response), since high frequency sound tends to leave the speaker in narrow beams. [...] Soft-dome tweeters are widely found in home stereo systems, and horn-loaded compression drivers are common in professional sound reinforcement. Ribbon tweeters have gained popularity in recent years, as the output power of some designs has been increased to levels useful for professional sound reinforcement, and their output pattern is wide in the horizontal plane, a pattern that has convenient applications in concert sound.|$|E
2500|$|Shotgun {{microphones}} are {{the most}} highly directional of simple first-order unidirectional types. [...] At low frequencies they have the classic polar response of a hypercardioid but at medium and higher frequencies an interference tube gives them an increased forward response. This is achieved by a process of cancellation of <b>off-axis</b> waves entering the longitudinal array of slots. A consequence of this technique {{is the presence of}} some rear lobes that vary in level and angle with frequency, and can cause some coloration effects. [...] Due to the narrowness of their forward sensitivity, shotgun microphones are commonly used on television and film sets, in stadiums, and for field recording of wildlife.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to high-energy collider physics, Fermilab hosts fixed-target and neutrino experiments, such as MicroBooNE (Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment), NOνA (NuMI <b>Off-Axis</b> νe Appearance) and SeaQuest. Completed neutrino experiments include MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search), MINOS+, MiniBooNE and SciBooNE (SciBar Booster Neutrino Experiment). The MiniBooNE detector was a [...] diameter sphere containing 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1,520 phototube detectors. An estimated 1 million neutrino events were recorded each year. [...] SciBooNE {{sat in the}} same neutrino beam as MiniBooNE but had fine-grained tracking capabilities. The NOνA experiment uses, and the MINOS experiment used, Fermilab's NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam, which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels [...] through the Earth to the Soudan Mine in Minnesota and the Ash River, MN site of the NOνA far detector.|$|E
2500|$|Schweitzer {{developed}} a technique for recording {{the performances of}} Bach's music. Known as [...] "The Schweitzer Technique", it is a slight improvement on what {{is commonly known as}} mid-side. The mid-side sees a figure-8 microphone pointed <b>off-axis,</b> perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single cardioid microphone is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm condenser microphones pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser. The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Compared {{with some}} low cost cameras that provide an optical {{viewfinder}} {{that uses a}} small auxiliary lens, the DSLR design {{has the advantage of}} being parallax-free: it never provides an <b>off-axis</b> view. A disadvantage of the DSLR optical viewfinder system is that when it is used, it prevents using the LCD for viewing and composing the picture. Some people prefer to compose pictures on the display– for them this has become the de facto way to use a camera. Depending on the viewing position of the reflex mirror (down or up), the light from the scene can only reach either the viewfinder or the sensor. Therefore, many early DSLRs did not provide [...] "live preview" [...] (i.e., focusing, framing, and depth-of-field preview using the display), a facility that is always available on digicams. Today most DSLRs can alternate between live view and viewing through an optical viewfinder.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{of a new}} temple {{commenced}} {{soon after}} {{the destruction of the}} older temple. The remains of the destroyed temple were removed from the site of the new temple and used to fill a c. 40 by 80m terrace within the overall sanctuary of c. 80 by 80m. This new temple terrace was aligned on north, west, and south with the plan of the new temple. The temple was a hexastyle peripteral Doric order structure on a 6by12 column plan resting on a 15.5 by 30.5m platform; it had a distyle in antis cella with an opisthodomos and a pronaos. [...] All but three of the outer columns were monolithic. There was a small, <b>off-axis</b> doorway between the cella and the opisthodomos. In similar design but more monumental execution than the earlier temple, the cella of the new temple had two rows of five columns, supporting another level of columns that reached to roof. The corners of the roof were decorated with sphinx acroteria, and the central, vegetal acroterion of each side had a pair of kore statues standing one on either side, an unusual feature. The antefixes were of marble, as were the roof tiles.|$|E
2500|$|Ulysses was {{spin-stabilised}} {{about its}} z-axis which roughly {{coincides with the}} axis of the dish antenna. [...] The RTG, whip antennas, and instrument boom were placed to stabilize this axis, with the spin rate nominally at 5rpm. [...] Inside the body was a hydrazine fuel tank. Hydrazine monopropellant was used for course corrections inbound to Jupiter, and later used exclusively to repoint the spin axis (and thus, the antenna) at Earth. [...] The spacecraft was controlled by eight thrusters in two blocks. [...] Thrusters were pulsed in the time domain to perform rotation or translation. [...] Four Sun sensors detected orientation. [...] For fine attitude control, the S-band antenna feed was mounted slightly <b>off-axis.</b> [...] This offset feed combined with the spacecraft spin introduced an oscillation to an S-band radio signal transmitted from Earth when received on board the spacecraft. The amplitude and phase of this oscillation was proportional to {{the orientation of the}} spin axis relative to the Earth direction. This method of determining the relative orientation is called CONSCAN and was used by early radars for automated tracking of targets and also very common in early infra-red guided missiles.|$|E
2500|$|One of Shure's most {{visually}} iconic microphone {{series is}} the Unidyne series, seen in use by {{heads of state}} and popular recording artists and performers from the 1940s {{through the end of}} the twentieth century, including President John F. Kennedy, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra. The Model 55 Unidyne is pictured with Harry S. Truman in the famous photograph where he is holding the Chicago Tribune newspaper with the erroneous front page headline [...] "Dewey Defeats Truman." [...] It is also pictured in front of Fidel Castro on the cover of the January 19, 1959 issue of Life magazine and in front of Martin Luther King, Jr. delivering of his I Have a Dream speech during the 1963 March on Washington. The original Shure 55 Unidyne microphone was designed by engineer Ben Bauer and first produced in 1939. Shure designed the 55 Unidyne as a rugged public address microphone with good audio performance. It was notable for its single-element, unidirectional design, which was smaller, less susceptible to feedback, and less sensitive to ambient noise than other microphones of the time. Several variants of the original Unidyne have been produced, most notably the 55S or [...] "Baby Unidyne." [...] The 55S is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Elvis mic" [...] due to its frequent use by Elvis Presley, and is the microphone depicted with Elvis on the commemorative first-class Elvis stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service in 1993. In 2008, the Unidyne Model 55 microphone was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, and the following year, Shure released the 55SH Series II. A supercardioid version, the Super 55 Deluxe Vocal Microphone, was introduced in 2009, featuring high gain before feedback and excellent <b>off-axis</b> rejection and further extending Unidyne's 70-plus year legacy. The 55 Series microphones were given the [...] "IEEE Milestone" [...] award in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|A type of antenna that {{combines}} a horn with a parabolic reflector {{is known as}} a Hogg-horn, or horn-reflector antenna, invented by [...] Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941 [...] and further developed by David C. Hogg at Bell labs in 1961. [...] It is also referred to as the [...] "sugar scoop" [...] due to its characteristic shape. [...] It consists of a horn antenna with a reflector mounted in the mouth of the horn at a 45 degree angle so the radiated beam is at right angles to the horn axis. [...] The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, and the focus of the reflector is at the apex of the horn, [...] so the device is equivalent to a parabolic antenna fed <b>off-axis.</b> [...] The advantage of this design over a standard parabolic antenna is that the horn shields the antenna from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis, so its radiation pattern has very small sidelobes. [...] Also, the aperture isn't partially obstructed by the feed and its supports, as with ordinary front-fed parabolic dishes, allowing it to achieve aperture efficiencies of 70% [...] as opposed to 55-60% for front-fed dishes. The disadvantage is that it is far larger and heavier for a given aperture area than a parabolic dish, and must be mounted on a cumbersome turntable to be fully steerable. [...] This design was used for a few radio telescopes and communication satellite ground antennas during the 1960s. [...] Its largest use, however, was as fixed antennas for microwave relay links in the AT Long Lines microwave network. [...] Since the 1970s this design has been superseded by shrouded parabolic dish antennas, which can achieve equally good sidelobe performance with a lighter more compact construction. [...] Probably the most photographed and well-known example is the 15 meter (50foot) long Holmdel Horn Antenna at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, with which Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, for which they won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. [...] Another more recent horn-reflector design is the cass-horn, which is a combination of a horn with a cassegrain parabolic antenna using two reflectors.|$|E
