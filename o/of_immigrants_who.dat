The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (4%).

25|$|Human Capital is the {{backbone}} of Human Development and economic development in every nation. Mahroum (2007) suggested that at the macro-level, human capital management is about three key capacities, the capacity to develop talent, the capacity to deploy talent, {{and the capacity to}} draw talent from elsewhere. Collectively, these three capacities form {{the backbone}} of any country's human capital competitiveness. Recent U.S. research shows that geographic regions that invest in the human capital and economic advancement <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> are already living in their jurisdictions help boost their short- and long-term economic growth. There is also strong evidence that organizations that possess and cultivate their human capital outperform other organizations lacking human capital (Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, and Ketchen, 2011).|$|E
